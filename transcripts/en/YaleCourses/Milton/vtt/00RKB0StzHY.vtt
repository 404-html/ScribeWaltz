1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.030
It's not until the fourth book of Paradise lost that we see.
Finally,

2
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:10.930
we see represented before us.
The paradise who's imminent loss is,

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.150
is heralded.
So grandly in the poems title and,

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.240
and Milton's task here is a difficult one.
His task is to,

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
is to represent unfollowing Eden Eden before the fall,

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.010
to represent this unfollow needing to a fallen audience of the 1660s from his

7
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:33.570
own perspective as a fallen,
as a fallen man himself as a fallen poet.

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.100
And Milton is continually confronting his self conscious about this predicament

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.020
and continually confronting the challenge posed by this essentially artistic

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.213
predicament.

11
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.020
But the predicament is not simply,

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.980
although it is this not simply an epistomological quandary.

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.060
I'm a problem about knowledge.
How can fallen man know anything about unfollowed?

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.430
Man,
there's,
there's more writing on this question than merely the,
uh,

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.201
this,

16
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:08.310
this question of how can we possibly know what it was like in this unknowable

17
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.360
state before the fall?
And it's,

18
00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:14.920
it's more important than simply that because everything is riding on Milton

19
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:19.770
success,
uh,
of,
of his representation of,
of an unfollowing Eden.

20
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.210
I think the theodicy,

21
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:26.211
the success of Milton's attempt to justify the ways of God to men is hanging to

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.280
s to some degree on the success of his representation of unfollowing us.

23
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.480
And,
and this is why,

24
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.720
because only if we can truly see paradise as an fallen can.

25
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:44.061
We really believe that Adam and eve were in fact perfectly capable of exercising

26
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:49.701
their unfolding wills freely when confronted with the temptation of the,

27
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.460
of the fruit.
So even so much as a hint of,

28
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.370
of fallenness in a representation of Eden threatens to threatens,
to indict God,

29
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:01.410
threatens to impugn God's justice.

30
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.400
And because God can be said to have caused the fall,

31
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.670
if he can be seen to have insinuated into paradise,

32
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.530
even the slightest propensity to,
to fall on us.
Um,

33
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.660
this the,
the question is an important one.

34
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.690
So to justify fully the ways of God that this fallen poet has to represent to us

35
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:27.340
the fallen audience and Eden,
that is unmistakably unfollow,

36
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.220
fallen.
It's a,
it's a,
it's a huge challenge.
Um,
and,

37
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.740
and,
and though an unfolding Eden,

38
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.060
Eden can't be like anything we know.
Um,
it,

39
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.990
it has to be utterly other from everything that we're familiar with because of

40
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.810
course everything that we're familiar with is fallen.

41
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.640
And so one of the dominant rhetorical strategies of the first two books has to

42
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:54.540
be inverted to some degree.
In,
in book four.
Um,

43
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.420
we have spent some time to talking about the similes,

44
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.160
especially the similes at the beginning of Milton's poem.

45
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.170
And the similar use initially,
um,
in,

46
00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:08.830
in paradise lost is at some important junctures in book four especially,

47
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.190
is transformed into what we can think of as a dissimilarly.

48
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.420
I'm not actually sure that that's a real rhetorical term.
Um,
I didn't make it up,

49
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.930
but in any case,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll use it for,
for lack of a better,

50
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.250
lack of a better word.
Um,
so,
uh,
similarly,
uh,

51
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.890
positive simile involves the construct.
You know what this is like,

52
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.891
it involves a construction that x is like why and a dissimilar would propose the

53
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.980
opposite.
That x is unlike why.

54
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.290
And so I'm going to ask you to turn to the most famous of these dissimilarities

55
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.760
and paradise lost.
This is at line two 68 of book for um,

56
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.470
it's page two 83 and two 84 in the Hughes.

57
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.880
And Milton is forced to describe what else can he do.

58
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.630
He's forced to describe paradise in terms of all the things that Eden is not.

59
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
So he tells us not that Fairfield of Ena nor that sweet grove of Daphne by

60
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.040
warranties nor that nicey and aisle.
I'm skipping here obviously,
and,

61
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.930
and so forth.

62
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.200
It's quite a catalog of things that Eden is not Mike and the rhetorical mode is

63
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:13.930
necessarily one of,
uh,

64
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.950
of negation because of the epistomological and artistic problem of,

65
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.330
of the fallen representation of unfollowing us.
Look,

66
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.780
um,
look a little further up at line two or 33.

67
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.510
This is I think where the problem of a,

68
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:35.530
of a fallen representation of an unfollow on state actually really comes to a

69
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:39.490
head Milton's describing here the four rivers of Eden,

70
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.040
a line two 33 and now divided into four main streams,

71
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.970
run diverse wandering,
many of famous realm and country.

72
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.970
And where up here needs no account but rather to tell if art could tell how from

73
00:04:55.721 --> 00:05:00.721
that Sapphire found the crisp had Brooks rolling on Orient Pearl and sands of

74
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.800
gold with Maisie.

75
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:07.801
Error under didn't shades ran nectar visiting each plant and Fed flowers worthy

76
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:10.990
of paradise,

77
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:15.550
which not nice art in beds and curious knots.

78
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But nature boom poured forth Prefuse on hill and Dale and plane,

79
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.820
the flowers,
a paradise or poured forth in Eden,

80
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:28.510
not by a nice or a or a fastidious,
uh,

81
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.100
a Gardner by fastidious artifice.
Um,
there's,

82
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.750
there's nothing fussy about this garden.

83
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.720
It's bounty as nature herself who has poured forth all this pro fused.

84
00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:42.730
Snus Eden is free of any artifice.
And,

85
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.470
but this lack of art in Eden of course only accentuates the problem that the

86
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.310
poet has no choice but to face,
um,

87
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.250
that the poet is under a pressure to describe with of what is of course his

88
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:58.400
poetic art that which is essentially indescribable.

89
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.870
And Milton lets us know the problem if art could tell.
And that phrase,

90
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.590
if art could tell clearly implies that aren't even Milton's aren't a,

91
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.950
can't tell us what Eden was like.
The Milton's aren't,

92
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.951
can't represent an unfollowing non artificial world with the instruments,

93
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:21.251
the tools of fallen artificial language and the,

94
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:22.601
the,

95
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:26.180
the impossibility of that he's facing I think is nowhere so impair a parent as

96
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:31.181
it is here in this description of the Crisper Brooks of paradise rolling with

97
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.310
Maisie error underpinned in shades.

98
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.330
Now of course,
error is a,

99
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.380
one of the most resident resident words in the entire poem.
Um,

100
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.620
error is the moral category or that we can think of it as the theological

101
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:50.240
category most often applied to the fall and to Adam and Eve's eventual sin.

102
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.700
And we might very well wonder why it is that error has,
has,

103
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:58.550
has crept into Eden before the fall.

104
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.310
It's presence here on some level,

105
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.330
it could be seen to doom the garden in advance.

106
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.550
It could be seen as some kind of evidence of a,

107
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:10.670
of a degree of fallenness in this unfolding Eden.

108
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.030
But Milton of course is using the word error in a special sense.

109
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.190
[inaudible] and he's doing what he does.
So often he's,

110
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:23.020
he employs a word solely to evoke its etymological root sense.

111
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.880
Uh,
which in this case simply means wandering.

112
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.860
The brook here is quite simply not flowing straight.
It's warm.
It's,

113
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.700
it's moving.
It's,
it's devastating.
It's moving in a,
in a,

114
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:36.440
in a curvaceous form.

115
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.920
And Milton is working consciously to exclude the,

116
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.310
the moral significance that this word error had acquired later in its,

117
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.730
in its etymological history.
I mean,

118
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.390
he's attempting to block out the meaning of this word that had crept in as it

119
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.430
were after the fall.

120
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.380
There's actually a wonderful book that looks really gently at just this

121
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.620
phenomenon.
It's called Milton's grand style,
uh,
by,

122
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.630
by the great critic Christopher ricks.
Um,
and,
and,
and,
and in that book,

123
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:09.740
Rick's argues for the,

124
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:14.020
the self consciousness behind Milton's employment of the original etymological

125
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.110
sense of some of the most loaded words in the,
in the poem.

126
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.380
And so Milton will remind us of the fall with his use of such a word as,

127
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:26.210
as error.
But if it's at the same time,

128
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:31.211
of course he's attempting to create an us and it's a remarkable move to create

129
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:36.521
in us a memory for a time in which a word like error had not yet been infected

130
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.020
by it's morally pejorative,
modern connotation.

131
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.580
He's reminding us of a time in which there was no such thing as moral error.

132
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.970
Not that we can be reminded because we,
of course we can't remember,

133
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:50.840
we weren't around,

134
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.990
but it's as if a memory is being instilled in us by means of Milton's poetry.

135
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.140
Um,
he,

136
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.970
he condenses into a single word what does essentially the entire poetic problem,

137
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:05.940
but setting the description of a,

138
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:10.941
of an fallen Eden Milton to manages with a word like this to remind us that

139
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:17.970
we're only seeing the garden after Satan has overlapped its boundaries and is
in,

140
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:21.270
has begun sneaking around and were given no description.
You'll,

141
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.260
you'll note we getting rid of no description of Eden until after the point in

142
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:30.261
the story in which Satan has already entered or cross the boundaries of

143
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:35.940
Paradise.
Look at a line to 85.

144
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.940
This is page two 85 in the Hughes.

145
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.300
Milton locates that geographical spot on the globe,
uh,

146
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.010
believed to have been eaten,

147
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.180
but he does that only to remind us that everything that we're saying is

148
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:49.710
precisely what Satan is seeing,

149
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.510
where the fiend saw an delighted all delight,

150
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.610
all kind of creatures,
new to site and strange.

151
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.170
And Satan's presence isn't as important here because he reminds us that we too

152
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.940
are,
we're in,
we're in a position of seeing and delighted all delight.

153
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.440
We share his paint alienation,
um,
from the,

154
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.890
from the innocence of the garden.
And,

155
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.030
and nowhere is the problem of representation more urgent and more troubled than

156
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:24.240
in the first view that we're given of of Adam and eve.

157
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.241
There is an extraordinary pressure on Milton as he describes the condition of

158
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.300
the and fallen Adam and eve and,
and,
and that pressure would unquestionably,

159
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:37.350
I think have been felt by the poems original or original readers,

160
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.330
Milton's description of Adam and eve.

161
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.490
And in this respect it is like what I take to be nearly every 17th century

162
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:47.010
description of Adam and eve.
It's,

163
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.660
it is necessarily a political statement.
It's an account of a first,

164
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.130
it's the account of the first society.
And as an account of the first society,

165
00:10:56.131 --> 00:11:00.420
Milton's Eaton has to establish something like the ideal against which all

166
00:11:00.421 --> 00:11:04.370
current,
all fallen societies have to be judged.
Um,

167
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.690
so in the 17th century or a description of man and the state of nature before

168
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.170
the onset of any kind of civil government was an essential component component

169
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:17.160
of about just about any political philosophy.
You couldn't,

170
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.560
you couldn't forward a political vision without forwarding at the same time an

171
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:26.040
image of a society before the onset of government.

172
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.730
And the most important political philosopher of mid,
mid 17th century England,
um,

173
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.560
is Milton's slightly older contemporary Thomas Hobbs.

174
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.440
And he had founded his vision of politics,

175
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:42.441
which was a decidedly authoritarian vision of politics on just such an account

176
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.910
of a nearly unrecoverable on unremembered bubble past.

177
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.990
And so we,
in in Hobbs is Leviathan.
Um,

178
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.430
Hobbes conjures image of the original,

179
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.360
the original man in the state of nature that serves as the foundation for his,

180
00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:58.990
uh,

181
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.910
political wisdom for his truly outrageous thesis that the only viable political

182
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:07.660
institution is that of an absolutist monarchy.
And I say it's,
it's a,

183
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:12.320
I say it's outrageous perhaps because it's so incredibly compelling.
Um,
you,

184
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.690
you almost,
uh,
it's,
it's very hard not to be converted to a,

185
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.660
a terrifying form of authoritarianism when you,

186
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.320
when you read Hobbes is iron clad,
uh,
pros.

187
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.070
So in the famous chapter 13 of the first book of Leviathan,
this was in the,

188
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.130
in the packet hubs describes the riot is mayhem constituent of life before the

189
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:38.800
onset of political institutions.
And so interestingly and importantly,

190
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:43.090
here Hobbs is forwarding a kind of secular argument.
This isn't theological.

191
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.170
And so he doesn't return us to the genesis account of Adam and eve.
Um,

192
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:50.560
his is the state of nature.
He tells us it's just like the one inhabited.
It's,

193
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:55.360
it's,
it's America.
Um,
it's the one inhabited by the savages of,

194
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.800
of,
of the Americas.

195
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.360
But the purpose is the purpose of the hubs and account is directly analogous.

196
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.360
I think to Milton's purpose in describing Eden for Hobbs,

197
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.670
uh,
men in the state of nature are all equal.

198
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.290
The state of nature is an egalitarian one.
And,
and,

199
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:16.460
and Hobbes does everything he can do it.

200
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.080
It's egalitarian even with respect to sex.
And,

201
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.630
and Hobbes does everything you can do to demonstrate the dangers of this natural

202
00:13:24.631 --> 00:13:29.500
egalitarianism.
Because,
uh,
because Hobbes tells us all men and women are,

203
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:34.120
were created equal.
There's no authority to keep them in place.

204
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:34.900
There's no,

205
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.810
there's no authority to keep them from what would it naturally just be a

206
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:41.860
perpetual state of strife.
And so,
uh,
and so hubs,

207
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.150
hubs explains in chapter 13,
without a common power and by common power,

208
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:50.680
he means a king,
a prince,
a tyrant.
It doesn't matter.

209
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.860
Someone without a common power man is in the state of war.

210
00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.310
And such a war is as is,
as is of every man against every man.

211
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.310
And he continues.
And the life of the natural man.

212
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.990
And this is surely the most famous and the most glorious sentence in all of

213
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:09.640
Hobbs is remarkable Leviathan.

214
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.740
And the life of the natural man is solitary,
poor,
nasty,

215
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.830
nasty,
brutish and short.

216
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:20.471
And so for hubs,

217
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:24.070
the egalitarianism established in nature is obviously on satisfactory.

218
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.060
It has to be corrected.

219
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.020
And so we have to construct some kind of governmental structure,

220
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:33.280
apology where whereby we submit ourselves to an absolute ruler,

221
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.830
a monarch or a tire,
and it doesn't matter.
And Hobbes,

222
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.550
Leviathan must have been deeply troubling to Milton,
um,

223
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.630
who devoted so much of his career,

224
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:47.500
to the critique of just the kind of absolute us government that Hobbes is

225
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:48.334
championing.

226
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.480
And I think there are a lot of signs and paradise lost that Milton is countering

227
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.330
his great contemporary Thomas Hobbs.

228
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.270
Now one of the advantages of writing about,

229
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.540
about Eden was that a description of paradise,
as I've suggested,

230
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:07.100
was something like an implicit model for a political philosophy.

231
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.260
It's certainly a Milton's hands.

232
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:14.300
And so Hobbes had used his description of the f the state of men in the state of

233
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:18.020
nature to forward his,
his authoritarianism.
And,

234
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.010
and so Milton has to use his description of the first couple to forward his

235
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:26.390
cause,
which is essentially that of republicanism or some kind of non monarchic

236
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.540
government and Adam and eve have to form,

237
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:33.860
they have to be able to form a successful society alone,

238
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.600
a successful polity on their own without the dictatorial intervention of any

239
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:41.660
sovereign power.
This is crucial for,
for,

240
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.900
for what Milton needs to be able to argue politically.

241
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.210
So what exactly your Milton's politics?

242
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:51.620
It's been a while since we visited this topic.
Um,
we haven't,

243
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.460
we haven't really discussed Milton's politics since we looked at the 1644 area

244
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.530
[inaudible] and a lot I'm sad to say has changed since then.

245
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.850
In areopagite it could be seven Milton affirm what was essentially the general

246
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:07.310
equality of all human beings.

247
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.090
And this was an implicit argument that all individuals have been endowed by God

248
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:16.091
with reason and that they are all equally capable of choosing and reasoning for

249
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:20.290
themselves.
But in the 1650s,

250
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.610
Milton had grown considerably less optimistic.
Um,

251
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.710
and his sense of the equality of,
of all men and women,

252
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.270
the average individual in England,
uh,

253
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.430
for Milton at this point didn't in fact seem to be endowed with quite as much

254
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:39.431
reason and capacity for rational choice as Milton felt that he was capable of or

255
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.490
as mill some felt that he and his fellow Puritan Revolutionaries,
um,
we're,

256
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.550
we're capable of so many of Milton's backsliding country men wanted their king

257
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:52.514
back,

258
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.740
a devastating a cultural fact for Milton.

259
00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:01.490
And so Milton began to develop something,
a,
a new political philosophy.

260
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:05.450
And it's something like an aristocratic philosophy of political society that

261
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:10.310
places superior,
more rational,
more spiritually minded beings.

262
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:15.010
People like John Milton,
I'm at the top of this society.
And they,
um,

263
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.180
are necessarily above less rational,
less excellent,
uh,

264
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.930
less spiritually minded beings who are obviously,
um,
in a lower stratum.

265
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.540
And so Milton Milton's later political philosophy sketches something like an

266
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.260
almost a natural hierarchy in which the rational elite are in a position to

267
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:37.820
guide and to,
uh,

268
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:42.850
to offer some sort of authoritative wisdom to the less rational members of this

269
00:17:44.641 --> 00:17:45.474
society.

270
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.830
And these less rational member ideally willingly,

271
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.710
willingly yield to the superior wisdom and the reason of the rational elite it

272
00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:54.840
would.

273
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.840
And it seems to be this later vision of a kind of naturally hierarchical society

274
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.390
that forms the basis for the first polity,

275
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:08.100
which is that of Adam and eve in Milton's Eden.
And it goes without saying.

276
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.450
The Union of Adam and Eve in Milton's paradise is a,
is a patriarchal one.

277
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.070
And the hierarchical division between superior and inferior creatures,
um,

278
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.420
has been marked almost entirely or exclusively along the lines of gender.

279
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.060
I mean,
Milton as you know,

280
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:29.061
has been reviled for his unrepentant patriarchal.

281
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.450
One of the first couple.
Um,
he,
he looked at line two 99,

282
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:38.490
one of the most famous lines in the poem.
Um,
this is the middle of page two,

283
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:43.110
85 of the Hughes.
Milton's talking about,
uh,

284
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:48.400
the purpose of Adam and Eve's creation.
He forgot only she forgotten him.

285
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.210
It,
this is a,
this is without question a,
a sexist,

286
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.590
sexist vision of the first polity.

287
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.370
We can say that I think without much hesitation,

288
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.470
but it would be almost criminal.

289
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:09.330
And I really believe this to say that Milton sexism is simplistic.
Um,

290
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.920
it is so complex in fact that Milton has included in his poem,
um,

291
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.270
a number of competing ways to think about this,
this first society.

292
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.280
And we actually have passionately expressed before us in paradise lost,

293
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.120
um,
the old Milton,
the younger,
much more liberal Milton,

294
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.620
that radically Galatarian ism that he was able so forcefully and compellingly to

295
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:36.270
voice scenario politica that voice is audible and paradise lost.

296
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.010
But we also of course have the later Milton,

297
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:42.060
the believer in a hierarchical society.
And,
and you can hear this,

298
00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:46.710
these contradictions at work in the poems description of this first polity that

299
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.000
the union of Adam and eve.

300
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.070
So look a little further up on page two 85.
This is line two 88

301
00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.220
two of far nobler shape,
erect dental,
godlike,

302
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.860
erect with native honor,
clad in Naked Majesty,
seemed lords of all.

303
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.730
And were these seemed for in their looks divine,

304
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:12.660
the image of their glorious makers,
Sean,
truth,
wisdom,

305
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.840
sanctitude severe and pure severe but in true filial freedom placed when it's

306
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:21.780
truth whence true authority and men.

307
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.510
Now I,

308
00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:29.190
it certainly strikes me to be the case that this first few that we get of Adam

309
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:32.070
and eve is an egalitarian one.

310
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.890
They are both in there Naked Majesty.

311
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:39.530
They are both described as lords of all,
but they're,

312
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.490
that they're seeming a quality is,
is a,

313
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.620
is a source of no small anxiety to Milton.

314
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.670
And so we are told almost immediately he can't take it anymore.
Um,
we're,
we're,

315
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:53.110
we're told though both not equal as their sex,
not equal scene.

316
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.510
Well of course up to this point,

317
00:20:55.511 --> 00:21:00.511
their sex did equal seam and it's here that Milton places an enormous amount of

318
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:06.241
weight on this word seemed one of the most important words in book four seemed,

319
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:08.763
seemed,

320
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.890
seemed not equal to whom the idea of seeming is always with respect to a

321
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:16.430
perceiver,
um,

322
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.450
someone to whom something seems to be this or that and it's with this word seem

323
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:26.911
that were reintroduced to the subject of the fallen perspective on and fallen

324
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.300
scene and reminded that we are not granted anything like a purview of Eden until

325
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:34.680
after Satan,
Satan has,
has entered the garden.
And,
and,

326
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.190
and in book this description of Eden in book four has in fact merely been

327
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.350
tracing Satan's steps.

328
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.370
And this description of Adam and eve merely emerges now because this is the

329
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:47.500
scene that Satan happens now to be looking at.

330
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.870
I look at line two 85 I've already,

331
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.740
I've already referred to these lines where the fiend saw an delighted all

332
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:56.920
delight,
all kind of living creatures,
new decide and strange.

333
00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.390
And then you have a colon and then after the colon falls,

334
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.280
this long description of Adam and eve.
And it's possible,

335
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.460
it's just possible to read the entire description of the sexually hierarchized

336
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:14.140
Adam and Eve as an account,

337
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.790
as an account in something like indirect discourse of Satan's fallen
perspective.

338
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.010
If their sex not equals seemed,

339
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.140
it's possible that their sex not equal seemed to Satan and it,
and it's Satan.

340
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:28.330
Of course,
we know this already to be the case.

341
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.910
Who is more concerned than any of the other poems,

342
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:34.060
characters with problems of inequality.
So this is,

343
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:38.770
this is naturally going to be the predisposition set of concerns that he brings

344
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:43.450
to his vision of any polity.
There's,

345
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.710
there's,
there's,
it's a,
it's a,

346
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:49.711
it's a fascinating question and there's actually a considerable debate raging

347
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.820
after we can,
if you can say that,
uh,
Milton just rage.

348
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:56.320
But if,
uh,
there's a,

349
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:59.620
there's a debate among meltedness on just this question and it's an interesting

350
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:00.040
one.

351
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.720
Milton's position at the head of the English literary Canon is often associated

352
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.130
or has been since the late seventies with his insistent positioning or maybe

353
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:13.060
actually since Virginia Woolf was writing in the twenties and thirties is often

354
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:18.061
associated with his is insistent positioning of Adam over eve in,

355
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.350
in paradise lost.
And so some participants in the debates about the,
the,
the,
the,

356
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:27.390
the validity of the western literary canon have imagined the effects of sexism,

357
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.220
sexism in our society,
um,
have imagined eradicating sexism,

358
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:38.170
sexism in our society by eradicating from college reading lists.

359
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.030
I'm a sexist poet,
light like,
like Milton.
And that argument is made,

360
00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:46.370
it's still forwarded today and it's an argument poses as you can imagine,

361
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:49.280
it poses an understandable threat to,
uh,

362
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.710
to people like me admirers of this poet.

363
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.380
And you can imagine the number of Milton assists.

364
00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.080
It was really quite remarkable who rallied around the textual suggestion that,

365
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.080
that when Milton says he forgot,
only she forgotten him,

366
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.720
he doesn't really mean it.
Uh,
this was,
uh,

367
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:10.730
I think it was in the mid eighties that a critic first first hit on the theory

368
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.240
that all of the description of Adam and eve could be seen as a,

369
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:19.010
as merely an exfoliation of the,
of Satan's perspective.

370
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.160
And there was a tremendous joy and excitement and the miltonic,

371
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:27.410
but then the Milton community,
once that idea had been,
had been floated,

372
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.460
um,

373
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:33.290
it's as if the narrator is just reproducing for us the hierarchical imagination

374
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:36.680
of Satan who's perspective on Adam and Eve is the one that we're getting at the

375
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:37.220
moment.

376
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.850
And so we're able to say to ourselves rather comfortably and complacently that

377
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:45.710
Milton isn't telling us that,
uh,
that,

378
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.573
that,

379
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:51.670
that the Social Organization of Eden is sexist and Milton is telling us that

380
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:57.101
Satan is sexist and that Patriarchy is essentially satanic rather than miltonic.

381
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.360
Um,
it's,
it's,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a depressing,

382
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.220
I get depressed when I think of,
um,
positions,
critical positions like this.
Um,

383
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.850
whether you have the extreme position of Milton as the inventor and the prime

384
00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:15.851
perpetrator of misogyny on the one hand or the counter vision of Milton as an

385
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:20.210
early feminist on,
on the other.
Um,

386
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.850
the case is obviously more complicated than that.

387
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.610
And it's more interesting than that because it's not at all clear in the,

388
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:27.500
and just in the passage that we're looking at,

389
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.890
it's not clear whose voice is actually authorizing these lines that established

390
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:38.390
the patriarchal PR parameters of unfollowing society with without a doubt,

391
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:39.650
we have,
uh,

392
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.820
the narrator speaking here and presumably he is representing something like the

393
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:45.050
official line of the poem.

394
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.970
But Milton does in fact go out of his way to situate the entire scene as an

395
00:25:49.971 --> 00:25:51.770
elaboration of Satan's perspective.

396
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.160
Both of these things are true and this passage,

397
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.190
which has absolutely everything to do with the established,

398
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.640
with what Milton calls,
establishing the true authority of men.

399
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.880
This passage refuses to establish its own authority.

400
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.410
It refuses to announce itself as the product either of,
of,
of the poems,

401
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:14.150
narrator or,
or,
or of Satan.
And,
and this,

402
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.440
it's a,
it's a,
it's a moment of textual instability and it reflects the larger,

403
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.680
I think it reflects the larger political instability that is threatening Eden,

404
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:28.250
threatening the relationship,
the relation between Adam and eve.

405
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.130
And so it's worth asking ourselves,

406
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.750
what is it about Adam and eve that makes them seem on equal?

407
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:39.560
Look at line two 97
for contemplation.

408
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:44.070
He and Valerie are formed for softness.
She and sweet,

409
00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:47.610
attractive grace.
Now,
how do we,
how do we know this?

410
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.100
We know it by their physical differences.
Uh,

411
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:55.170
we know it by the appearance of their anatomies and more precisely than that,

412
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.980
we know that they are different and unequal,
um,

413
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.300
by means of our perception of their hair,

414
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.540
his fair,
large front.

415
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:11.541
And I sublime declare absolute rule and highest and theme locks round from his

416
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:16.611
parted forelock manly hung clustering but not beneath his shoulders.

417
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.320
Um,
Milton did wear his hair long,

418
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.400
but he wants us to know that's,
that's,
that's part of the historical record.

419
00:27:26.401 --> 00:27:29.250
And he was very pleased with that.
Um,
but he wants to,

420
00:27:29.251 --> 00:27:32.000
he always wants us to know that it wasn't too long.
And this,

421
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:37.010
it's the same with Adam who wears his hair unusually long but not in decorously

422
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:42.460
long,
um,
round from his part in forelock,

423
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.720
manly hung clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad.

424
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:50.370
She as a veil down to the slender waste.

425
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.430
Her unadorned had golden tresses war disheveled,

426
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.550
but in wanton ringlets waived as the vine curls her tendrils

427
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.910
which implied subjection.
Now I,
I,
I'll,

428
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.491
I'll,
I'll,

429
00:28:06.491 --> 00:28:11.320
I'll bet that we can all agree that a description of their hair is not what we

430
00:28:11.321 --> 00:28:13.600
were expecting at this moment.
Um,

431
00:28:13.601 --> 00:28:16.840
supporters of Patriarchy or of the sexual superior,

432
00:28:16.841 --> 00:28:21.780
though it's the superiority of men have always enlisted anatomical differences.

433
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.360
Uh,

434
00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:27.360
the anatomical differences between the sexes as proof of of man's rightful,

435
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.130
a rightful ability to subject or subordinate woman.

436
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.600
And in fact central to the patriarchal prejudice,
as you can imagine,

437
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:38.710
was the strength diff.

438
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:43.690
What it's often seems to be the strength differential between men and women.

439
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:48.040
And so with Milton had imagined a cosmos that privileged physical strength,

440
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.200
then I think we would have no choice but glumly to accept the fact that Adam is

441
00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:57.270
indeed superior to eve.
And you could imagine how an argument like this could,

442
00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.850
it could have played out in the pages of paradise lost if a at Milton could

443
00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:05.830
easily have argued that human excellence could be determined by the sheer number

444
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:10.240
of shrubs that Adam and eve were able to prune on any given day.
And so in,
in,

445
00:29:10.241 --> 00:29:14.530
in such a world,
I'm Adam would be able to prove his superiority,

446
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.940
but physical strength and this is important means absolutely nothing and

447
00:29:18.941 --> 00:29:21.250
paradise lost.
And in fact,
if anything,

448
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:26.020
Milton is always denigrating the importance of physical strength.
So why?

449
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.170
Okay.
Given that we still have to ask the question,

450
00:29:29.171 --> 00:29:34.150
why try to argue for the inequality of the sexes on the basis of hair length?

451
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.690
Um,
you,
I presume that none of you have had,

452
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.330
but you probably still know nonetheless,

453
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:48.220
that men and women or boys and girls are not born with distinct or

454
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:51.230
distinguishable heads of hair.
Um,

455
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.280
at least until male pattern baldness sets in there.
Uh,
the,
the head,

456
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.680
the hair of men and women aren't distinct,
are distinguishable.
And if anything,

457
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.490
male pattern baldness simply gives women an edge.

458
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.080
And if Milton wanted to use Harris and natural sign of sexual difference,

459
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.610
he should be discussing,
I would think he should be discussing facial hair,

460
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.890
Adam's superiority,
um,

461
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.800
presumably could be advanced by his commanding beard.

462
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.540
We could imagine Milton doing that,

463
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:23.020
something that he lacks by virtue of her anatomy.

464
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.650
But the hair on the head,
this doesn't make any sense.

465
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:31.651
The hair on the head is in fact one of the few anatomical features that is

466
00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:33.250
absolutely gender neutral.

467
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.050
Our hair is gendered by virtue of the Barber,

468
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.870
not by virtue of the Creator,

469
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:46.270
which brings us to this fact,
um,
which we all know,

470
00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:50.350
the obvious and w which is what every obstetrician knows,

471
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:55.000
the obvious distinguishing anatomical correct characteristic his genitalia.
Um,

472
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.980
and Milton actually does mention Adam and Eve's mysterious parts,

473
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.450
but,
but he mentioned them only to dismiss their difference.
Um,

474
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:08.770
he may be gesturing towards something like,
you'll tell me if this is crazy,

475
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.390
if something like a genital difference when he describes Adam's hair,
his locks,

476
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:18.220
manly,
hung,
clustering.
I,
I'm,
I,
I don't,
I don't think that,

477
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:22.600
I don't think that holds,
that the sexual signifier

478
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:28.210
that hangs manly off of Adam's body and that signifier,

479
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:32.410
which has traditionally of course been invoked as a sign of sexual superiority

480
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:33.550
is Adam's penis.

481
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.200
But Milton alludes to this genital signifier of difference.

482
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.600
They're mysterious parts only to dismiss it.

483
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:44.890
He chooses instead for the distinguishing characteristic of the sexes of

484
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.740
phenomenon that's rooted not in nature but in culture.
Hairline,

485
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.040
like,
like Hobbes.
Milton is under a tremendous cultural pressure.

486
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:57.020
And when he describes the earliest state of nature,
um,

487
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.960
the description of nature has to bear the weight of all of the social and all of

488
00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:06.430
the political claims that the poem makes.
And the set of social conditions that,

489
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:09.680
that Milton has to justify and make seem natural is,

490
00:32:09.681 --> 00:32:11.800
is a particularly tricky one.

491
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.400
Both even Adam have to be seen as absolutely free.

492
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:20.770
Each of them has to be capable of exercising reason and making a reasonable

493
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.740
rational decisions.
And in this sense,
Adam and joy,
Adam and eve joy,

494
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.180
something like the absolutely egalitarian world,

495
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.180
the structure of the political world that we had seen in the treatise

496
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.660
[inaudible] Politica Milton at his most exuberantly liberal.

497
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.410
But while Adam and eve enjoy all the rights of an egalitarian society as they

498
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:45.440
do,
I think in paradise lost,
they are not therefore equal.

499
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.250
Adam appears to be superior to eve.

500
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:52.730
And Milton will only tell us that he appears such the,
the,

501
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:54.700
the narrator cannot make this,
uh,

502
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.400
make this claim in anything like a more declarative sense.

503
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.630
And so on the basis of,
at least at least of their appearances,

504
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.810
the social formation in Eden is strictly hierarchical and on some extraordinary

505
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:13.010
level,
this poem is trying to have it both ways.

506
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.660
And so much of the energy of the account of paradise derives from Milton's

507
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.170
contradictory account of the political structure of Eden.

508
00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:23.630
He applies to the Edenic society of Adam and Eve.

509
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.800
What I take to be two irreconcilable modes of social governance,

510
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.120
Eden is once egalitarian it's inhabitants or,
or entire,

511
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:35.900
there may in Naked Majesty there,
lords of all,
both of them.
Uh,

512
00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:38.660
Adam and eve are entirely free and self-determining,

513
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.060
but at the same time,
even as structured as a,

514
00:33:42.061 --> 00:33:46.610
as a kind of aristocracy where the male class is deemed categorically

515
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.780
genetically superior to the female class and with a,

516
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.090
it goes without saying that this situation is untenable.

517
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.540
The contradictory social formation of paradise is inherently unstable.

518
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.390
And I'm convinced that nothing is more important in our understanding of the

519
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:05.150
dynamics of the fall.
Then this,
then these principles,

520
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:10.360
the principle that Eve is absolutely free and equally rational,

521
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.730
equally capable of rational and virtuous choices,

522
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.940
but also the conflicting principle that eve is to some extent subject to Adams

523
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.390
Adams Authority and the contradictory political impulses in the poem or are

524
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.970
brilliantly worked out in the first description of Adam and eve.
Look at,

525
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:32.020
look at line three Oh seven.
This is unbelievable.
Um,

526
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.050
look at what Milton is able to establish by way of a description of Eve's hair.

527
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.830
It's here in a representation of her hair that the nature of the Edenic polity

528
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.970
is established.

529
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.310
So eves golden tresses waived as the vine curls her tendrils,

530
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.960
which implied subjection but required with gentle sway.

531
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.040
And by her yielded by him.
Best received,

532
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.150
yielded with Khoi submission,
modest pride.

533
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.410
And isn't this a beautiful line and sweet,

534
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.500
reluctant amorous delay that the conflicting politics of even our best captured

535
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:13.880
in the,
in the,
in,
in the,

536
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:19.850
in by means of the rhetorical strategy of oxymoron or the or the contradiction

537
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:23.810
in terms Milton packs this description of the first couples.

538
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.550
This is essentially a kind of erotic play that's being described before us and

539
00:35:28.551 --> 00:35:29.790
it's packed with oxymoron,

540
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:34.890
moronic descriptions and Milton's trying to communicate the incredibly delicate

541
00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:40.290
political balance of this hierarchical society.

542
00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.250
This society may be hierarchical,
Milton is telling us,

543
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:49.251
but it's not authoritarian eve maybe subject to Adam who holds authority over

544
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:53.520
eve but,
but,
but her subjection because she's free,

545
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:58.521
her subjection is required with a gentle sway and no sooner has Adam exercises

546
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.190
authority by gently swaying eve.

547
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.130
Then she willingly yields to him exercising her free capacity for,

548
00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:07.964
for consent,

549
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.980
her capacity to choose to be swayed by her superior.

550
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.040
So Eve Sarah Harris seems to imply subjection,

551
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:22.490
but Eve's here also seems to imply freedom and to kind of resistance to

552
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:26.400
subjection.
Eve yields not with submission.

553
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.500
Milton would never permit himself to say that,
uh,

554
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.190
eve yields with a Koi submission.

555
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.730
She hold something back even as she grants it.

556
00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:40.050
And we have detailed before us the endless give and take that this delicate

557
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.920
political structure requires.
And,
and for Milton,

558
00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:46.170
this give and take is not only the basis of a society,

559
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:50.850
it's the basis as well for,
for,
for,
for Eros four or sexual,
uh,

560
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.830
sexual pleasure.
With that,
that extraordinary phrase,
sweet,

561
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:56.963
reluctant,

562
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:02.300
Amaris Delay [inaudible] was able to pack into three adjectives and one noun.

563
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:07.580
The pleasure derived by both parties in Eve's exercise of resistance,

564
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.220
but [inaudible] is,

565
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.540
isn't just sexy for Milton,

566
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.810
it's also politically meaningful.
And from a political perspective,

567
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:23.811
her capacity for a kind of reluctance and resistance serves as a guarantee for

568
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:28.080
her capacity for our kind of rational consent.
And,
and,

569
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.580
and it's also theologically a resonant from a theological perspective.

570
00:37:32.581 --> 00:37:37.581
Eves willingness to resist to delay constitutes a guarantee of her divinely

571
00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:38.670
granted freewill.

572
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.020
It Eve cannot be forced to do anything.

573
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:48.021
And it's as if in this little dance that they perform in the quotidian life of,

574
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:51.170
of unfollowing Eden,
um,

575
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:56.240
eve is practicing in a small way for that crucial moment at the temptation in

576
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:59.520
which your ability to resist and delay will,

577
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.410
will mean the difference between life and death.

578
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.620
Now we as readers find it difficult.

579
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.150
I think we should at least find it difficult to found a theory of hierarchy on

580
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:13.770
something so fragile and so easily alterable you can tell I'm just,
I,

581
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:18.090
I just had a haircut yesterday,
so easily alterable as,
as hair length.

582
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:23.090
But what's even more amazing than that is that the fact that the nature of the

583
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:28.641
gendered hierarchy of Adam and Eve isn't even evident to Adam and eve

584
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:34.440
themselves.
Uh,
this blows me away.
Look at,
look at EBS.

585
00:38:34.441 --> 00:38:38.350
First memory in paradise lost.
This is a line for 77.

586
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:43.351
Page two 89 in the Hughes eve is far from being able to recognize Adam

587
00:38:43.911 --> 00:38:46.360
superiority immediately.
And for Eve,

588
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:49.030
there's certainly nothing in the length of his hair that,

589
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:53.400
that suggests that he might enjoy a kind of authority over her.
Um,

590
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.790
and in fact to eve,

591
00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.220
Adam seems to be a noticeably inferior creature when she compares him to that

592
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:00.941
image of herself,

593
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:04.690
that beautiful and responsive image to her of herself that she had found in the

594
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:07.960
pool.
This is line for 77 till I,

595
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.040
she tells Adam till I aspire to be fair indeed and tall.

596
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:17.100
She said she grants him that he's tall under a plate and yet me thought less

597
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:19.780
fair,
less winning,
soft,

598
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:25.240
less amiably mild than that's smooth watery image.

599
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.220
It's like the,
it's like the dissimilarly of the Fairfield's of Ana.

600
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.360
Adam can only be understood by what it is he lacks.

601
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.260
And indeed it's a lack of anything like a natural or self evidence,

602
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:41.080
sexual hierarchy that constitutes one of the central problems.

603
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:46.410
And Paradise lost hierarchy is not a natural fact in,

604
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.220
in paradise.
It's an arbitrarily imposed social institution.

605
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.590
It's been imposed by God,
but it's,

606
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:58.150
it hasn't been built into the structure of the natural world.

607
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.730
And its to Milton's great credit.
And I really mean this,

608
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.420
I mean this with the utmost seriousness that he labors to expose the artificial

609
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.200
cultural origins of the sexual subjection,

610
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:14.320
that at the same time he is championing and celebrating.

611
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.740
Yves has to be told that Adam is her superior and she has to undergo a,

612
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.190
uh,
an elaborate process and a complicated process of,

613
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:29.191
of cultural indoctrination and nowhere in the description of Eden or we reminded

614
00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:34.201
more forcefully of our incapacity to understand unfollow nature than in Milton's

615
00:40:34.271 --> 00:40:38.350
description of EBS hair,
her unadorned,
a golden tresses ward disheveled,

616
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.980
but in wanton ringlets waived,
disheveled and want.

617
00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:46.840
And of course these seem like extraordinarily prejudicial adjectives and they

618
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:50.560
cast a moral judgment.
It has seemed to readers from the very beginning.

619
00:40:50.561 --> 00:40:55.450
They cast a moral judgment on her long before she has sinned.
But once again,

620
00:40:55.451 --> 00:40:58.180
Milton is playing with that apology.
And I think this is Rick says,

621
00:40:58.181 --> 00:41:02.890
point disheveled is being used here in its original literal sense.

622
00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:06.470
It literally means hair let down and,
and the ringlets,

623
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:10.720
he's not wearing a bun and the ringlets are wanting anthem in that they are

624
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:13.170
simply unrestrained.
And,

625
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:17.080
and the fact that we are so eager as readers to supply a kind of loose their

626
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:19.810
sexual meaning to these words implicates us.

627
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.260
Milton perhaps seems to be saying it in an implicates of course,

628
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:25.600
Satan as well in the fallen perspective,

629
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:29.860
on the ultimate ultimately mysterious union of Adam and eve.

630
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.400
We are eyeing the muscats and leering at them just to is,
and,

631
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.050
and it Stanley Fischer's argument,

632
00:41:36.051 --> 00:41:39.350
and it's not unconvincing that Milton's purpose in employing these loaded

633
00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:42.830
adjectives is to force the reader to acknowledge her,

634
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:45.350
own her own fallenness,
um,

635
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:50.070
to remind us all of the inadequacy of our fallen perspective on,

636
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.620
on this unfollow nature.

637
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.840
So we're wrong to import a kind of moral prejudice to the words disheveled and

638
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:00.250
wanton.
But Milton,
we'll push it even further.
Um,

639
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.320
Eve's hair is also waiving and insinuating and in it's waving curly motions.

640
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:11.411
It resembles nothing so much as that other much less noble creature in the

641
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:17.670
garden.
And that's,
um,
that's of course the serpent.

642
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:22.640
Look at line three 45.
This is where Milton describes the elephant in the circle.

643
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.110
And I don't have time to comment at all.

644
00:42:26.111 --> 00:42:28.850
I just want to say what an amazing adjective.

645
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.460
The unwieldy elephant,

646
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.640
the unwieldy elephant to make them mirth used all his might and read to his live

647
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:40.820
Probasco this close the serpent,

648
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:45.530
sly insinuating wove with Gordian twine,
his braided train,

649
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.400
the braided train of the serpents waving motion resembles nothing so much as the

650
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:54.401
waving braids of Eve's hair and eve seems to be associated well in advance of

651
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:59.780
the actual temptation with the sly insinuations of the serpent and association

652
00:42:59.781 --> 00:43:03.800
that of course can only damage any sense that we have of her unfollowing reason

653
00:43:03.801 --> 00:43:05.570
and her her genuine freewill.

654
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:11.000
But Milton carefully includes in this description another example of a waving

655
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:15.880
and insinuating motion and Eden.
And that's the elephants proboscis.

656
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.450
He's prefaced his connection between even Satan here,
um,

657
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.410
with the,
with the,
with the,
with the inclusion of the elephant.

658
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:29.410
He wants us to know with this image of the elephants light Probasco is that the

659
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:34.880
motion of waving and weaving and reading and insinuating are still in fact

660
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.590
entirely innocent.

661
00:43:36.591 --> 00:43:41.591
And it will be only be Satan's subsequent actions that and infect them retro

662
00:43:42.231 --> 00:43:45.100
retroactively infect them for us.
And,

663
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.130
and the problem being exposed once again is the problem of representation.

664
00:43:49.131 --> 00:43:53.270
How can you represent an unfolded state from a fallen perspective?

665
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:59.000
Okay.
Um,
look at your,
the handout.
And if you don't have a handout,

666
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:03.500
um,
try to get one from the corners of the room.
Uh,
at this,

667
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.140
this representation of Adam and Eve was made in 1638.
Um,

668
00:44:08.141 --> 00:44:12.860
so this is this Rembrandt did this drawing,
uh,

669
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.980
shortly before Milton was beginning to think of paradise lost.

670
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.260
And in the Rembrandt representation we have,

671
00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:23.261
I think this is a devastating critique of the 17th century desire to represent

672
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:24.560
an unfollowing paradise.

673
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.420
But we have Milton trying to do like Milton represent a Rembrandt exposes the

674
00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:33.200
impossibility I think of of such a representation.
Uh,

675
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.410
if we read the book of Genesis,
we know that,
that he was alone with the serpent.

676
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.000
And so we're seeing Adam and eve in this picture presumably after eve is eaten

677
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:45.180
the fruit,
but before Adam had eaten it,

678
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.230
now Adam May not have eaten the fruit,
but he certainly,
I mean,
look at,

679
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:53.670
look at this.
He certainly looks as fallen as eve.
There.

680
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:58.170
They are equally physically ugly,
it seems to me.
And that's indisputable,

681
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.620
nasty,
brutish and short.

682
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.280
It's as if they've crawled out of the pages of the famous 13th chapter of the

683
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:10.281
first book of Hobbs' Leviathan look at eaves face with its broad overhanging

684
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:14.720
brow.
She suggested the uninvolved,

685
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.080
a state of an upper primate more than she does of the Glorious and beautiful

686
00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:23.760
first human female.
And looking at them that they're presumably on fallen.

687
00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:28.410
Adam here is riding in a twisted and guilty posture that gives him no moral,

688
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:33.150
superior superiority over eb whatsoever.
And it,
and if anything here,

689
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:37.850
Adam's here seems more wanton and more disheveled then eaves,

690
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:42.550
um,
Rembrandt's even seems to be,
um,

691
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:46.890
must be very humid.
There's a kind of frizzy split end thing going on,
uh,
with,

692
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:48.830
with,
with both of them and especially with the,

693
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.500
but at least it's falling rather neatly over her head,

694
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.850
which cannot be said of Adam.

695
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:58.980
And of course the primary clue that this representation of Eden is imposing

696
00:45:58.981 --> 00:45:59.814
upon.
Yeah.

697
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.423
<v 1>Uh,</v>

698
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.400
<v 0>unfollow and Adam,</v>

699
00:46:03.401 --> 00:46:07.360
a sense of fallenness comes from Rembrandt shading of their genitals.
And,

700
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.840
and actually in the original you can,
you can make out their genitalia quite,

701
00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:15.100
quite distinctly,
but they're nonetheless Jaden and this shaded,
this is it.

702
00:46:15.101 --> 00:46:16.420
This is important for Rembrandt.

703
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:21.310
They're partially hidden by the dark and guilty shadow produced by the serpent.

704
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:25.840
And the serpent you may or may not have noticed is that scaly hideous creature.

705
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.710
I'm climbing the tree on the right.
Uh,

706
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.490
Milton had gone out of his way to insist that the genitals of Adam and eve,

707
00:46:33.491 --> 00:46:37.060
they're mysterious parts were not concealed.
But then he goes on to,

708
00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:37.691
since you're us,

709
00:46:37.691 --> 00:46:41.410
his fallen readers for the sense of guilty shame that we bring to any

710
00:46:41.411 --> 00:46:45.250
speculation about their mysterious parts,
but Rembrandt is,

711
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.350
it's as if Mitt Rembrandts a step ahead of Milton.

712
00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:51.760
He's telling us that there can be no such thing as a just representation of

713
00:46:51.761 --> 00:46:55.210
unfollow.
Nudity are,
are darkened minds,

714
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.840
will continually shade that nudity with the,

715
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.620
with the inescapable shadows of guilt and shame that we have no choice but to

716
00:47:02.621 --> 00:47:04.780
bring two questions of sexuality.

717
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.900
Rembrandt joins Milton in representing a scene that seems to lie somewhere.

718
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:17.010
Both the Eden of Rembrandt in the Eden of Milton seem to lie somewhere between a

719
00:47:17.011 --> 00:47:19.140
fallen and an unfolding state.

720
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.280
And I think a lot of the energy of the Rembrandt drawing derives from his

721
00:47:23.281 --> 00:47:25.380
refusal to depict the,

722
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.640
the moral superiority of one sex over the other.
There there's,
there,

723
00:47:29.641 --> 00:47:34.630
there's no clear demarcation here of a sexual hierarchy or a natural sexual

724
00:47:34.631 --> 00:47:36.970
hierarchy.
This Adam doesn't seem in,

725
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:40.930
he's physically stronger than eve and if he is to be seen as the greater sex,

726
00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:44.860
perhaps it's just because he's placed himself arbitrarily in a physical posture

727
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:49.070
of superiority.
He's placed one foot slightly on a,
on a,
on an elevated play,

728
00:47:49.071 --> 00:47:51.350
and he's trying to get a leg up.
Um,

729
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:57.060
he's compensating perhaps for his lack of a self evident authority over eve

730
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.850
tradition,
of course,
has always insisted,

731
00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.070
and this is the story that we inherit as children,

732
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.520
that Eve's seduced Adam into eating the fruit.

733
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:11.550
Adam would never have fallen if even if eve hadn't tricked him into eating the

734
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:15.130
apple or implored her to join,

735
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.440
implored him to join her in her sin.

736
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.960
But Rembrandt here is refusing to attribute all of the guilty eve.

737
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.460
Now Adam May be,

738
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:29.110
it's possible that Adam is here trying to protect eve from the fruit with the

739
00:48:29.111 --> 00:48:30.190
gesture of his hand,

740
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.870
but he also might be reaching for the fruit grabbing it.

741
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:35.750
Um,

742
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:40.360
it's possible that he's seizing the fruit just as Milton's Adam sees as eve when

743
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:41.530
he finds her by the pool.

744
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:47.050
So what I'm saying here is that the suggestion and both Milton and Rembrandt is

745
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:50.890
that the fall has less to do with eve seduction,
seduction of Adam.

746
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:56.320
Then the more foundational,
the structural problem of sexual inequality,

747
00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:01.580
um,
the fall starts to look more and more like something like,

748
00:49:01.581 --> 00:49:05.440
like the inevitable consequence of sexual hierarchy.

749
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.570
Okay.
Um,

750
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:12.630
I'm going to conclude after we take one final look at the Rembrandt at,

751
00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:17.370
at one of the visual,
at the,
at the visual details that Milton forces,
um,

752
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:22.120
that Rembrandt forces into a kind of analogous relation.
And in this,

753
00:49:22.121 --> 00:49:24.100
he's like Milton Milton.

754
00:49:24.101 --> 00:49:28.540
Rembrandt draws into the relation into an analogous relation,

755
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:34.590
the slithery length of that awful serpent and the innocent and playful winding

756
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:36.380
of the elephants Probasco this.

757
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.840
And you can see the unwieldy elephant in the lower right hand corner of the

758
00:49:40.841 --> 00:49:44.560
Rembrandt drawing.
Um,
but the,

759
00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:49.760
the PROBASCO send the serpent's tail are not the only snaky things in

760
00:49:49.961 --> 00:49:53.950
Rembrandt's Eden.
As,
as,
as,
as I mentioned earlier,
and the original drawings,

761
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:58.840
Adam's mysterious part is actually quite visible.
It's nasty,

762
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.090
it's brutish,
it's short,

763
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.080
but it's discernible and it's important that is discernible.

764
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:07.480
And through this technique of visual juxtaposition,

765
00:50:07.481 --> 00:50:12.481
Rembrandt casts and evil and satanic shadow over this part of Adam's anatomy,

766
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:16.570
that distinguishing feature of his sex,

767
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.950
which is the arbitrary signifier of his authority over eve.

768
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:25.750
So Adam's authority here in its most intimate manifestation may be as complicit

769
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:30.300
as the serpent in the crime of the fall.
Um,

770
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.710
so Satan,
Satan sees Satan sees all of this,

771
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:42.130
he sees this weird and bizarrely unstable sexual hierarchy in Milton's Eden.

772
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.450
And what does he say?
A line to 90 no wine.
Five 20 line.

773
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.980
Why five line five 21 at page two 90,
um,

774
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:57.320
Milton has Satan announced that he has your Rica.

775
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.060
I know how I'm going to do it.

776
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.350
He's arrived at his scheme to destroy Adam and eve,
and he says,

777
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.050
just having witnessed all of this Oh,

778
00:51:06.051 --> 00:51:08.720
fair foundation laid where onto build their ruin,

779
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.080
I know how I'm going to be able to bring this place down.
Now,

780
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:16.370
Milton isn't eager to join Satan in this claim of God's injustice,

781
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.590
but he's willing to,

782
00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:22.370
to expose the inherently unstable foundation of Eden sexual hierarchy.

783
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.533
Um,

784
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:25.853
<v 1>okay.</v>

785
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:29.250
<v 0>Milton lays the foundation.
Ultimately,
I think,
as we'll see,</v>

786
00:51:29.251 --> 00:51:30.600
when we look read book nine,

787
00:51:30.601 --> 00:51:35.400
he lays the foundation for our understanding of some of the deepest causes of

788
00:51:35.401 --> 00:51:38.280
the fall.
Okay.
Remember for next time,

789
00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.730
a big chunk of reading books,
five,
six,
seven and eight.
