1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.210
For a vast number of complicated reasons.

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:06.660
Milton has invited for 350 years now,
uh,

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:08.790
uniquely violent.

4
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:12.930
And I do think it's a violent response to the particular question of his value

5
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.190
as a,
as a poet.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.540
And the violence I think of this reaction is due in large part to our tendency

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.250
to think of Milton and,
uh,

8
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
and of Milton's work in terms of the category of power.

9
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:26.340
So I've given this first lecture a title,

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.380
the title being Milton Power and the power of Milton because any introduction to

11
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:36.030
Milton has to confront the longstanding conviction and English letters of

12
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:40.470
Milton's power or his strength as a,
as a poet.

13
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.130
And it's practically impossible to begin to reading of Milton without the burden

14
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:48.390
of,
of innumerable prejudices and preconceptions.

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.110
Milton's reputation always proceeds him.
And in fact,
that's always been the case,

16
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:55.500
even in his lifetime.
And even if we've heard of nothing of Milton,

17
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:57.900
the poet or nothing of Milton the man,

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.690
we're certainly of course likely to have heard of,

19
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.230
of Adam and eve in of the story of Garden of Eden.
So,

20
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.510
and so it's especially difficult,
uh,

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
to read paradise lost without bringing to it some sense of the power of the,

22
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.600
of the religious problems,
the theological and ethical problems that,

23
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.950
that story seems so powerfully to set out to address.

24
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.960
Now,
readers,

25
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.610
readers of English literature talk about Milton very differently from the way

26
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:29.610
they talk about other other writers.
Historically,

27
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:34.530
it has not been a pleasure or wit or,

28
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.560
or beauty that have been associated with the experience of Reading Milton.

29
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:44.100
Those are the categories of value that we tend to associate or to affiliate with

30
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:48.960
our other favorite writers,
writers as diverse as a,
as,

31
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:53.810
as Shakespeare and uh,
Virginia Woolf for example.
But in a,

32
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:57.900
in our collective cultural consciousness,
if there's such a thing,
uh,

33
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.500
whether we like him or not,
we tend to think of Milton.

34
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.980
We tend to think of John Milton is powerful and the reasons for this coupling of

35
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:09.981
the of the name Milton and have this idea or the metaphor of power I think are

36
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:12.180
worth looking into.

37
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800
Power is a conceptual category that Milton bruited on and,

38
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.240
and,
and cultivated his entire writing life from a very early age.

39
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:29.241
Milton nursed the image of himself as a powerful poet and in Milton we have a

40
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:34.070
man who was able to state now just think about this for a moment.
It's,

41
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.680
I take this to be an absolutely remarkable fact.

42
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.640
We have in Milton a man who was able to state categorically in his early

43
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.380
twenties,
so just a few years older than you are now,

44
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.090
that the epic poem that he would not even begin writing for another 25 years

45
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.350
would become an unforgettable work of English literature.

46
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.530
Milton anticipated and lovingly invested his,

47
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.271
uh,

48
00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:03.271
all of his in his future literary power and his future literary fame.

49
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.880
He anticipated this power much as his father,

50
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.180
that reasonably well to do banker might have a anticipated long term earnings

51
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.950
from a particularly risky business venture.
And in Milton's case,
the,

52
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.180
this,
this investment in power paid off,
Milton would come to feel,

53
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.330
would eventually come to feel so comfortable with the,

54
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.630
with the mantle of power that he was able to do much more than simply rewrite

55
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.970
the first,
the first books of the Bible,

56
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:34.390
which is of course one of the things that he accomplished and paradise lost.

57
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.890
And that is itself,
no,
no mean undertaking.
By the end of his life,
though,

58
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:43.891
Milton would in effect try to rewrite everything.

59
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.530
After he'd published all of his major poems,
he,

60
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.910
he began publishing a spate of works that attempted to recreate British culture

61
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.470
from the ground up.
He,
uh,
he invented his own system of,
of philosophical logic.

62
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.910
He published a treatise that he had written earlier on,
on grammar,

63
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:05.530
inventing his own system for the understanding and the learning of the,

64
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.700
of the Latin language.

65
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.240
He wrote a long and detailed history of Britain attempting to create the meaning

66
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.770
of that little island that,
that he always assumed was God's chosen,

67
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.840
chosen nation.
And finally,
and probably four more Milton most important,
uh,

68
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.040
Milton wrote a theology and inventing in effect his own religion.

69
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.620
And Milton's,
Milton's Protestantism looks like it looks like no one else's.

70
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.760
Since,
uh,
before our sense there,

71
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.380
there's a real sense,

72
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.820
I think in which Milton wanted to recreate all of western culture at or to

73
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.100
recreate all of western culture in his own image.

74
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.780
And regardless of what we think of the success of that example or of the appeal

75
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.640
of the attempt to do such a thing,

76
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.790
the amazing thing I think is that Milton felt so empowered even to embark on

77
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:58.750
such an enormous project.

78
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:03.520
And readers and readers of Milton ever since have had to confront not just

79
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:04.630
Milton's writing,

80
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.790
but this unspeakable sense of empowerment that that underlies,
um,

81
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.960
at just about everything that Milton rights.
And so it,

82
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:17.410
it seems to me that a useful introduction to the poetry of Milton would be a

83
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:21.160
look at some of the various various types of power that Milton imagines in his

84
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:25.490
work and,
and some of the types of power that literary history has,

85
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.490
has tended to confer upon,
uh,
upon Milton.
The man,
the image of Milton,

86
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:32.470
the man,
and of Milton's Milton's writing.

87
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.460
Now probably the form of power that,
that we most readily associate with a,

88
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.390
with John Milton involves his position at the dead center of the English

89
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:48.310
Literary Canon.
Milton is,
this,
is this,
this is,
this goes beyond questioning.

90
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.890
He's an object of worship by British and American institutions of higher

91
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.290
education.
And,
uh,
my guess is that uh,

92
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.380
many of you have failed.

93
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.000
A few of you have failed to observe that it's practically impossible to graduate

94
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:10.001
from Yale with a bachelor of arts in English without having read paradise lost

95
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.210
either an English one 25 or,
or ds lit or in fact,

96
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.890
and of course just like this one.
This for you.
Some of this will be this,

97
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.700
this is the course.
And uh,
and you,

98
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.440
those of you who are taking this course because you have to,
uh,

99
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.160
you have to take one of the pre 18 hundreds and Milton is one of those.
Um,

100
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.090
you are more than entitled to ask why the poet,

101
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.180
this poet Milton is exercising this institutional sway over you as you go about

102
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.270
choosing your courses or perhaps you experience your courses in some way as

103
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.780
having been chosen for him.

104
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.920
It would be utterly inadequate for us to account for this institutional.

105
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:58.460
And it's a real institutional power that Milton holds over us by stating,
uh,

106
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.690
blandly that Milton is the greatest,
the greatest English poet.

107
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.070
That's the easy answer obviously.
And of course it's not,
it's not untrue,
but,

108
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.050
but,
but uh,

109
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.880
we can do better than that and we can anatomize some of the forms of power that

110
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:18.350
have been most commonly attributed to this greatest to this greatest English

111
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.650
poet.
There was first the,
um,

112
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.690
the understandable aesthetic power,

113
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.630
the power of the beauty of Milton's Milton's verse that a,

114
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:34.460
an aesthetic power that's often thought or felt to in here somewhere in the

115
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:38.810
poetry itself.
And in fact for,
for,
for readers of paradise lost.

116
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.660
And this has been an experience now for a few hundred years.

117
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.440
It does often seem as if there were some mysterious life force,

118
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.030
a pulsating through Milton's dense and driving lines of,

119
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.510
of unrivaled.
I am big pentameter and paradise lost.

120
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.300
Then now there's also the power.

121
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.280
There's also the power of that Milton himself claimed was behind the poetry of

122
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:01.761
paradise,

123
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:06.761
lost Milton insistent and it's completely possible that he might actually have

124
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:12.401
believed that God himself w was responsible for composing the poetry of

125
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:15.500
Paradise.
Lost that Milton Milton,

126
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.090
John Milton was merely the conduit for God's first serious attempt at a,

127
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:24.320
at an epic poem.
And so we have,
in this perspective,

128
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:27.350
we have an image of the awesome power of the deity himself.

129
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.180
Fun during a way behind every jot and tittle of,
of,
of Milton's great epic.

130
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.490
But for Milton's,
Milton's contemporaries in the 17th century,

131
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:41.170
Milton's power really wasn't at all aesthetic or,

132
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.430
or even religious in nature.

133
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:48.431
Milton Milton's pro power was primarily seen as social and political and

134
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:53.690
cultural.
Milton and this is a,

135
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.490
a wildly anachronistic use of terms,
but it's,
there's,
there's nonetheless,
uh,

136
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:03.240
uh,
a lot of sense to it.
Milton was essentially a left wing political radical,

137
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.320
and it was widely feared by his more timid contemporaries that,

138
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.200
that his writings would seduce,

139
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.870
seduce his readers into rejecting a good old fashion,

140
00:09:13.871 --> 00:09:17.600
traditional religious and social values.
And,
and there was a,

141
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.710
there's a lot of validity to that contemporary cultural fear.
Uh,

142
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.510
Milton was,
Milton was a revolutionary.

143
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.680
He was responsible for writing the first justification for an armed rebellion

144
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:31.080
against the legitimate monarch.
Uh,

145
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:35.280
the first to publish such a work in essentially in all of Europe.

146
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.610
Um,
Milton actually wrote that it was the duty,

147
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.080
not just the right,

148
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:48.081
but the duty of a nation to rise up and dethrone dethrone through execution and

149
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:54.030
unjust and legitimate,
though legitimate king.

150
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.870
And Milton in fact,
was largely responsible,

151
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:02.130
responsible in a cultural sense for the fact that the armed rebellion of England

152
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:04.980
civil war,
what we call,
what we think of as the Puritan Revolution,

153
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.440
actually led to the execution,

154
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.710
the execution by decapitation of England's monarch,

155
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.930
Charles the first in 1649.

156
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.670
And on top of all of this political revolution,
the political radicalism,

157
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:22.110
Milton was one of the first intellectuals in Europe to speak out in favor,

158
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:25.810
not only of a,
of divorce.
Milton argued for the,

159
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.130
the right to divorce on grounds of in compatibility,
but also,
um,

160
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.983
he argued,

161
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.320
he argued in favor of the right to a plural marriage or polygamy.

162
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.560
He was branded as a radical and dangerous debunker of traditional Christian

163
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:46.110
family values.
And now,

164
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.640
many of you know that Milton in his later years was blind and the fact of his

165
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:56.850
blindness was in his own day,
frequently cited by contemporary preachers,

166
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.060
men at the pulpit as an example of exactly how God punishes those who dare to

167
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:06.600
write against the king or those who dare to write against the institution of

168
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:09.870
marriage or the family and Milton's power.

169
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:12.330
For so many of these contemporaries was,
was,

170
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.570
was seen as palpably destructive and,
and,
and,
and truly frightening.

171
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.480
Obviously.
I,

172
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:22.320
it goes without saying that today the assessment of Milton is some kind of

173
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.330
imminent social threat,
um,

174
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.920
or some sort of social force in terms of his,
uh,

175
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.060
the radical nature of political power that has taken a sharp turn.

176
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.510
Milton is much more likely imagined to wield.
And if,

177
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.900
if you have any sense of what the mythology surrounding Milton is,

178
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:44.160
you would have to agree with this.

179
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.940
Milton's much more likely to imagine to be imagined to wheel to socially

180
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.930
conservative power over his readers and the,

181
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:53.470
in the debates ranging,
uh,

182
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:58.471
for the last 30 years or so over the value of traditional pedagogy and on over

183
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:01.150
the value of canonical reading lists.

184
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.070
Milton is always cited in variably cited as the canons most stalwart,

185
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:11.050
a representative of oppressive religious and social values.
And there's,

186
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:15.220
there's no question.
Milton is the dead white male poet,
uh,

187
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.110
par exsalonce in English letters certainly.
And his poetry works,

188
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:21.550
at least from this point of view,

189
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.080
his poetry works to solidify those dead white male values,

190
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:30.160
whatever those are in the unsuspecting minds of his readers,
none of whom,

191
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.190
obviously our dad and many have and many of whom are neither white nor nor male.

192
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.210
Milton's Milton's power from this perspective of the radical,

193
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.340
the radical cultural critique is really not so different from the power of the,

194
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:48.780
of the late Jerry Falwell or,
or,
or,

195
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.820
or some someone like rush Limbaugh.
Um,
there,

196
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:56.260
there's something insidious and culturally,
uh,

197
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.640
malicious and powerful about the social conservatism of,

198
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.530
of what is thought to be his voice.
Now this more or less,

199
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.400
this is the contemporary picture of John Milton and this more or less

200
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:11.320
contemporary picture of Milton as the,

201
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:16.250
as a powerful force of conservatism derives in large part,
uh,

202
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.810
from,
from the English writer Virginia Wolfe who was writing,
uh,

203
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.730
who wrote for a few decades but wrote about Milton during the 1920s.

204
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.710
And it's Wolff's image that's probably the one that's most firmly rooted in the

205
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:32.260
minds of Milton's readers today for Virginia Woolf,

206
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:35.440
especially in a room of one zone,

207
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.710
the dead writer Milton exercises an active power and active power at the present

208
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:47.071
moment as he forces his female readers to accept their subordinate place in

209
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:52.590
society and the text of Milton and especially a paradise lost,

210
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.790
therefore has to be seen as an active,

211
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.440
a persistently malignant conveyor of,

212
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.400
of patriarchal oppression.

213
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.900
Now like all like all judgments of literary value and literary power and force,

214
00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:10.660
the,
the 20th century feminist evaluation of Milton,

215
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:13.660
Virginia Woolf's has a,
has a complicated and long,

216
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.650
long prehistory and it's worth their while to look briefly at some of the

217
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:22.510
complicated steps by which an evaluation like Virginia Woolf sexually comes into

218
00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:25.900
being.
So let me,
let me take you back.
This is,
you can,

219
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:27.250
you can now look at your handouts.

220
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.650
Let me take you back to the 17th century up to the very beginning of the

221
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:34.960
literary reception of John Milton.

222
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.700
So Milton who had died and who died in 1674 had established himself as a great

223
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:45.100
English poet within 20,
within 20 or so years of his death.

224
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.610
And so as early as the late 17th century,

225
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.060
Milton had already entered what we think of as the English literary cannon.

226
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.310
He was for many of his younger contemporaries.

227
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.610
He was a canonical authority whose wisdom,

228
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:04.250
whose mere opinions could be cited as proof,

229
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:09.251
as some sort of indisputable evidence for one,

230
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.660
one position or another.

231
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.530
And an an an an extraordinarily ambitious poet like Milton naturally derived,

232
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.090
uh,
uh,
a great deal of satisfaction.

233
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:24.990
I'm convinced in his own lifetime in anticipating just this kind of posthumous

234
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.070
respect and worship,
um,
the,
the,

235
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.080
the fantasy of his fellow Englishman quoting him as an authority much as he

236
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.410
himself had for so many decades a quoted scripture.

237
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.670
Now,
one of the earliest,
and this,
I think this is a remarkable fact,

238
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:45.671
one of the earliest citations of paradise lost that actually appears in print in

239
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.630
the 17th century comes from the,

240
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.880
the pro feminist writer lady married cuddling and Chudleigh dared to argue.

241
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:54.890
And that's an amazing argument.

242
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.290
In a given the time and 1699 Chudleigh,

243
00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:03.350
he argued that a man that a woman rather could be considered and should be

244
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:07.310
considered as excellent a creature as a man,

245
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.260
that women might actually be as ontologically valuable as as men.

246
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.880
And in making such a point,
chudleigh naturally had to confront the,
as,

247
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.570
as,

248
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:22.570
as writers have a for Millennia Chudleigh he had to confront the problem of this

249
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:25.400
scriptural account of the priority of the sexes.

250
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.650
This suggestion that you can,

251
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.460
that many readers extract from the book of Genesis in the Bible,

252
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.540
that the initial creation of the male of the species,
Adam,

253
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.360
seems to establish the privileged,

254
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.120
the privileged drank of the entire male sex.

255
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.640
And so [inaudible] attempts to demonstrate,

256
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.610
and this is the passage at the top of top of the handout,

257
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.960
Chadley attempts to demonstrate that the genesis story of Adam and Eve

258
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.410
establishes no such thing.
Uh,
she writes,

259
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.780
woman's being created last will not be a very great argument to debase the

260
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:02.210
dignity of the female sex.

261
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.550
If some of the men ownness,
she continues to is more likely to be true.

262
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.600
The Great Milton a grave author brings in Adam the speaking to eve and paradise

263
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:18.770
lost and then she quotes Adam speaking to eve.
Oh fairest of creation.

264
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:23.771
Last and best of all God's works and the Great Milton can be invoked invoked

265
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:29.650
here because he has already been established as a,
as an authority,
a,

266
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.190
he's already been established as a figure who's very word possesses something

267
00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:38.600
like an indisputable cultural power.
And so it was a very grave author.

268
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:40.040
This is what Chablis is implying.

269
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:45.610
Milton can tell us something potentially true about the priority of the sexes of

270
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:50.180
course.
And you know this to be the case from your own,
uh,
your,

271
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.830
your own writing of,
of,
of papers for in the English department.
Um,
like,

272
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.600
like any literary critic who ever tried to write an analysis of anything,
uh,

273
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.660
chudleigh he has no choice but to nudge the lines that she's quoting out of

274
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:05.720
context.
And it is,
it's,

275
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.730
it's been said that to quote anybody is necessarily to misrepresent him.

276
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.910
And,
uh,
this fact is obviously a very good thing for lady Mary Chad Leeson's.

277
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.530
Milton would certainly not himself have wanted to suggest that women are

278
00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:23.410
superior to men.
Milton in fact,
soon goes on in paradise lost.
Um,

279
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.750
and then right after this very passage that she cites Milton,

280
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:32.751
the narrator be rates Adam for his overvaluation of his wife through the

281
00:18:33.541 --> 00:18:36.450
character of the Archangel Rafiel [inaudible].

282
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.060
I think this is one of the great ironies of,

283
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.820
of English literary history.

284
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:45.300
Certainly in the reception of of the poet Milton that one of the very first

285
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:50.301
published published discussions of Milton's epic attempts to enlist John Milton

286
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.720
as a,
as a proponent of feminism.
Now,

287
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:57.060
we don't have to be overly concerned here with,

288
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.720
with what I take to be chug these generous,
generous oversight of Milton's,
uh,

289
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.630
generally sexist bias.
Uh,

290
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.330
what's important for our immediate purposes is her identification of Milton as a

291
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:12.150
cultural authority.
He's a literary power,

292
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.580
a figure who can be called upon to supply the,
the voice of,

293
00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.000
of traditions,
uh,
itself.
He can be called upon,
in fact,

294
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.330
exactly as he is by lady Mary here.

295
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.600
He can be called upon to contradict scripture and it's,

296
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:35.450
and it's this power to contradict the word of God that makes Milton a force that

297
00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:40.980
makes Milton a force then,
which it's hard to imagine anything more powerful.

298
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.070
Now,
as you can see from the handout,

299
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:48.570
Milton is discussed in a very different manner a year later and a work published

300
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:53.450
by Mary astral in in 1700 and in a,

301
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.740
in an even more remarkably feminist,

302
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.580
a remarkable cry for the liberation of women from what she describes and

303
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:03.930
characterizes as domestic oppression.
Um,
astral writes,
the following,

304
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.670
patients and submission are the only comforts that are left to a poor people who

305
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:15.360
grown under tyranny unless they are strong enough to break the yolk.

306
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.230
Not Milton himself would cry up liberty to poor female slaves or plead for the

307
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:25.020
lawfulness or resisting a private tyranny.

308
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.350
So Milton,
for,
for,
for Astellas,

309
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:32.310
hardly the embodiment of orthodoxy that he is for Lady Mary Juggling Four for

310
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:34.670
Asto.
Milton remains this,

311
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.700
the subversive revolutionary whose treatises against the tyranny of the Stuart

312
00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:41.550
monarchy,
whose treatise is against the tyranny of Charles.

313
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:45.690
The first established his reputation as a,
as a liberator,

314
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.450
a liberator of all of the oppressed and enslaved citizens of England.

315
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:52.540
And that's that,
that's Milton's rhetoric,
uh,
that,
that,

316
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.490
that rhetoric belongs to Milton himself,
but as still resents of course,

317
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.640
Milton here and what she resents is the limitation of his subversiveness.

318
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.280
Um,

319
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.280
he refused to extend his critique of tyranny in the political realm to a

320
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:13.240
critique of man's domestic tyranny over woman in the,

321
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:17.290
in the private realm and the domestic sphere.
It's as if,
uh,

322
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.480
Mary Astellas saying what Milton was on the right track.

323
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:22.930
He simply didn't go far enough.
He didn't extend the logic of his position.

324
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.580
Now Milton's,

325
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.420
now it has to be said that Marianne [inaudible] image of Milton is probably the

326
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.430
product of a much closer reading of paradise lost,
um,
than,

327
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.940
than lady Mary Chumley's was,
uh,
Asil certainly seems to have noticed.

328
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:39.820
Milton's notorious and of course,

329
00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:43.210
deplorable line and Paradise lost about God,

330
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:47.400
about God's creation of Adam and eve.
He forgot,

331
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.020
only she for God in him.

332
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.140
A Milton's narrator tells us of God's creation of Adam and eve and,

333
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.990
and Mary Astellas clearly responding to this and understatement points to a

334
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:02.340
persistent worry.
And it's a worry,
um,

335
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.250
that that exists even now in the 21st century.
Um,

336
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.680
about the nature of Milton's power.

337
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:13.710
Is this guy a revolutionary or is he a reactionary and,

338
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:19.050
and an astral distinguishes Milton's cry against political tyranny from her own

339
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:24.830
critique,
her own cry against a patriarchal tyranny.
And,
and in making this dis,

340
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.950
in making this distinction,
she's exposing something.
Um,
the,
the,

341
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.780
that I take to be extremely interesting,

342
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.900
she's exposing the uncomfortable affinity between two competing equally

343
00:22:37.571 --> 00:22:40.930
progressive social movements and what we,
and you'll,

344
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:45.360
and you'll see this phenomenon,
uh,
manifest itself,
uh,

345
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.670
through throughout your reading of,
uh,
of Milton.
I'm convinced.

346
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.960
And what we see here is the strange proximity and it's often a very

347
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:57.300
uncomfortable proximity of Milton's rhetoric of political liberation to the pro

348
00:22:57.301 --> 00:23:02.080
feminist rhetoric of domestic liberation that is just beginning to emerge at the

349
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:03.370
end of the 17th century.

350
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.990
Now in the middle years of the 17th century during the English revolution,

351
00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:12.991
but saw the execution of the king and saw the establishment of a non monarchic

352
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:14.200
Republican government.

353
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.780
Milton had practically invented the formal language,

354
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.900
the literary language of insubordination.

355
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.790
He developed an entire vocabulary,
a rhetoric of,

356
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.600
of righteous disobedience,
of,
of resistance,

357
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.470
of protest and revolution.
And,

358
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.500
and I think it's a measure of the power of Milton's anti tyrannical language

359
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:42.160
that,
that it can be used against Milton himself.

360
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.430
A writer like Mary Asto can employ Milton's revolutionary rhetoric to advance

361
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:48.321
the cause,

362
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:52.310
to which John Milton himself would of course have had difficulty subscribing,

363
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.980
that the dead Milton could exercise a social power that had nothing whatsoever

364
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:01.730
to do with the living Milton's own social own social views.

365
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:08.070
Now we'll fast forward a couple of centuries and look at Virginia Woolf and then

366
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:12.320
by the time we get to wolf in the early part of the 20th century,

367
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.350
Milton has come to be associated with essentially all of these ways of thinking

368
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:22.670
about power.
However contradictory they are.
Um,

369
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.110
uh,

370
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:29.110
he's the very voice of traditional wisdom for some as he was for lady Mary each

371
00:24:29.161 --> 00:24:34.161
huddling and he's the voice of political subversiveness for others as he was

372
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:39.440
from Ariosto.
Um,
he's the friend of women everywhere,
at least for a few of his,

373
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.850
uh,
female readers in the 18th century.
And for many,
he's the,
the,

374
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:47.630
the very embodiment of,
of,
of,
of oppressive patriarchy.

375
00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.730
I mentioned earlier that,
um,

376
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.400
that it's Virginia Wolfe who's largely responsible for,

377
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:57.430
for our sense of Milton's identity as an oppressive patriarchal literary voice.

378
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.830
But Virginia Woolf too had,

379
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.660
had inherited these contradictory ways of thinking about Milton and about

380
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:07.640
Milton's Milton's power.

381
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.840
And you can see from the handout that in 1924,

382
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.820
what wolf is formulating,
beginning to formulate her,

383
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.120
her dazzling feminist critique of the masculine traditions,

384
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:23.870
what she thinks of as the masculine traditions of literary writing.

385
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.580
And she's not one of the,

386
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.980
she's not just one of the first literary critics to reveal that most famous

387
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:35.100
writers have been men.
Uh,
everyone had already had,

388
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.750
had always known that.
Um,

389
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.670
but she's one of the first literary critics to reveal that most famous writers

390
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.060
have been writing as men exerting the influence of their sex.

391
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.770
That's a,
that's to use her language in a manner that implicitly glorifies their

392
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:55.160
masculinity,
implicitly glorifies all men.

393
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.960
But this is not,
so she writes in 1924,

394
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.940
this is not so with Milton,
there's this,
and this is a,

395
00:26:04.941 --> 00:26:08.150
this is a wolf,
a amazing argument here.

396
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:11.900
There's a small group of writers whose work,
and I'm quoting her,

397
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:17.110
whose work is pure uncontaminated sexless as the angels are said to be sexless

398
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.770
and Milton is their leader.

399
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.750
She tells us like Lady Mary Chadley Wolf holds up Milton as a powerful

400
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:30.830
authority.
He,
he's almost a mythological figure who can,

401
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.020
who can sanction,
who can authorize this revolution in women's writing that,

402
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.130
that Virginia Woolf is beginning to prophesied here early,

403
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.530
early in the 20th century.
But this of course,

404
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:48.520
as we know is this is only one of the ways in which Milton's power or what wolf

405
00:26:48.521 --> 00:26:51.540
thinks of as his leadership can be thought of.

406
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.620
And in 1928 and this is the next quotation on the handout,

407
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.360
a Milton has come to represent for Virginia Woolf a very different type of

408
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:02.340
cultural force.
Uh,

409
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.720
near the conclusion of the perfectly extraordinary book.

410
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.410
A room of one's own,
a wolf elaborates on,

411
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.410
on her prophecy of a feminist future.

412
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:16.560
A world in which women can be viewed a literary feminist future,

413
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.170
a world in which women can be viewed as writers,

414
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:23.730
have no less stature and have no less power than men.

415
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.890
So this is,
uh,
this is wolf I'm quoting for my belief is,

416
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:30.360
and I'll,

417
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.440
I'll have to skip around a little bit for my belief is that if we live another

418
00:27:34.441 --> 00:27:39.180
century or so and have 500 a year,
each of us in rooms of our own,

419
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:44.340
if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think,

420
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.480
if we look past Milton's bogey for no human being should shut out the view,

421
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.250
then the opportunity will come in the dead poet who was Shakespeare's sister,

422
00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.440
we'll put on the body,

423
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:03.240
which she has so often laid down now,
the,
the,

424
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:08.241
the language is intentionally and really sublimely opaque and a apocalyptic here

425
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:09.690
as,
as wolf imagines,

426
00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:14.691
what might have happened to Judith Shakespeare had she been given the cultural

427
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:18.540
opportunities of her more privileged brother William,

428
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.120
but the anticipated triumph of women writers can never occur according to

429
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:27.900
Virginia Woolf here until we look past Milton's bogey,

430
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.840
until we look past Milton's bogey.

431
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.810
And she's ingeniously vague about what Milton's bogey is.
And I've,

432
00:28:35.811 --> 00:28:39.780
and I puzzled over this,
I puzzled over this phrase for years and I'm not,

433
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.550
I'm not even remotely satisfied that I have a clue what,
what,
what she means,

434
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.810
but Milton's bogey would seem to be,

435
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.140
I think that frightening shadow that Milton casts over wives who might find

436
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:58.330
themselves identifying with the subordinate.
Milton's,
uh,

437
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:03.350
Eve Milton's bogey seems to be the specter hovering over women poets are women

438
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:08.820
writers who may find in Milton and identification of poetic strength with

439
00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:11.540
masculinity itself.
Now will,

440
00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:16.290
it doesn't try to explain exactly how it is that Milton has shutting out the

441
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:19.620
view and she doesn't try to explain what the view would look like if it weren't

442
00:29:19.621 --> 00:29:21.010
shut out,
but,

443
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.650
but inciting the power of what she claims to be.

444
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:27.640
This Puritan Bogey,
uh,

445
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.750
Virginia Woolf really subtly reveals,

446
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:35.751
I think how difficult it is even for her to shut out entirely the real,

447
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:39.660
or it might just be the bogus power of,

448
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:43.690
of John Melton at the very moment that will advise us women readers to look past

449
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:47.760
Milton's bogey.
She finds herself in a peculiar position of,

450
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.520
of echoing the poetry of John Milton.
And this is I think,

451
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:55.210
an unbelievable thing to have happen at one of the formative moments of,

452
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.420
of 20th century feminism.
She's alluding here,
I think,

453
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.310
to one of the most famous passages in paradise lost in which Milton is asserting

454
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:07.270
nothing other than his poetic power.
This is the,

455
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:12.510
this is a on the handout.
It might be on the reverse of the handout.
The,

456
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:16.390
the blind poet calls on the Holy Spirit to assist him,

457
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.530
assist him in the composition of the epic.
He asked the Heavenly Muse,
uh,

458
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:26.680
at the end of the passage to help him see and tell him things invisible to

459
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:30.040
mortals site.
And Milton is going to a need.
He'll,

460
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:34.360
he'll need this additional help from God because as he says,

461
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:38.950
this is near the middle of the passage because wisdom at one entrance is quite

462
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.490
shut out.
Milton's blindness,

463
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:46.990
the fact of his blindness has shut out his view of the visible world that would

464
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:51.670
ordinarily present itself to him through the entrance of his eyes.
And this,

465
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.880
this shutout will enable him,

466
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:58.630
will help him explore the invisible world of divine truth.

467
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.730
Now when Virginia Woolf writes that Milton's bogey has shut out the view of,

468
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:04.860
of his female readers,

469
00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:09.640
she seems to be suggesting that the specter of Milton blinds women to the things

470
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:13.610
that they should be seeing the most important,
uh,
truths,
um,

471
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.280
out there in the world.
How troubling though this seems undeniable,

472
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:23.281
how strange that wolf really at her most radical is echoing the very words of

473
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:26.230
the power that she's opposing.

474
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:31.290
It's almost as if she were saying in some way in a post miltonic world,

475
00:31:32.261 --> 00:31:33.610
which is the world that we all live in.

476
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:38.611
It's impossible fully to look past Milton's bogey that the rhetoric of power,

477
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:43.360
the literary strategies of power and in some cases the vary.
In some cases,

478
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:48.361
the very experience of power and of literary power have become inextricably tied

479
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:54.451
and indebted to Milton and his great prophecy of 20th century feminism.

480
00:31:55.211 --> 00:31:58.750
Wolf is essentially proposing a cultural revolution.

481
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:03.940
And it's as if the text here,
we're telling us that whether we like it or not,

482
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.400
whether we like Milton or not,

483
00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:11.470
the language of revolution is one that is forever and always indebted to that

484
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:16.060
boogey man John Milton as as Virginia Wolfe had written,

485
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.100
Milton is our leader.
Now,

486
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:24.940
some of you,
I'm assuming we'll,
we'll already have read,
uh,

487
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.830
we'll already have read paradise lost.

488
00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:31.831
And so it will come to you as no surprise that the representation of power for

489
00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:32.500
Wilton,

490
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.500
for which Milton is most celebrated is the power exhibited in the failed

491
00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:41.540
revolution against God,
the revolution against God by,

492
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.970
by Satan and his fellow rebels.

493
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.220
And my guess is that our sense of Milton's power,
however,
however,

494
00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:50.540
that power is imagined,

495
00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:54.680
is intimately related to the way in which Milton himself represents power in the

496
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:59.180
characters of,
of Satan and,
and of God in paradise lost.

497
00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:02.600
So look at the,
look at the next passage.
This is from,

498
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.350
this is from Paradise Lost Satan and the,

499
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:09.860
and the rebel angels have been roundly defeated.

500
00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:12.860
They'd been humiliated by the son of God.

501
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.880
And the other priggish loyalist angels.

502
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.050
So they are pained,
uh,
utterly humiliated there,

503
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:25.690
prostrate on the burning lake of this miserable new realm called hell.
Um,

504
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.110
and nonetheless,

505
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.140
Satan pulls himself together and begins to analyze to theorize his situation.

506
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:37.691
He describes for us his own power that somehow manages to survive even a

507
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:41.600
terrifying and humiliating defeat like the one he's just experienced.

508
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.940
So this is Satan.
What though the field be lost,

509
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.010
all is not lost.

510
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.640
The unconquerable will and study of revenge in mortal hate and courage never to

511
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:56.990
submit or yield.

512
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:02.950
And what does else not to overcome that glory never shall his wrath or might

513
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.980
extort for me to bow and sue for grace with supplement knee and deify his power,

514
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:17.620
who from the terror of this arm so late doubted his empire that were low indeed,

515
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:23.440
that we're in ignominy and shame beneath this downfall.

516
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:25.220
Now,

517
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.700
we might at first think that Satan's vaunting here is a product of nothing more,

518
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.130
nothing more elevated than,
than hate and a desire for revenge.

519
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:38.780
But Milton Milton's doing something truly extraordinary and,

520
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:42.840
and,
and I think that the imaginative achievement here in,

521
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.660
in St and speech is easy to miss.

522
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:50.030
Satan finds it ignominious and shameful to lower himself,
to God,

523
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.660
to bow and sue for grace with [inaudible] knee.

524
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.400
And deify has power.
But this kind of submission is,

525
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.850
is shameful.
Not because it's simply always shameful.

526
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.740
So to debase oneself,

527
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:08.210
it's an ignominious hasheme because it may very well be.

528
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:11.240
I think this is without question what Satan is implying here.

529
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.620
It may very well be that God is not actually omnipotent.

530
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.500
When an omnipotent would a truly all powerful God actually doubt the extent of

531
00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:24.440
his own empire.
In,
in,
in Virginia,
Woolf's terms,

532
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.010
Satan is trying to look past God's bogey.

533
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.820
He tries to get behind the,
the highly theatrical,

534
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.540
the culturally constructed illusion of,

535
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.660
of God's power.
And it you,

536
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.710
you can hear Satan saying,
well,
so what if we lost?

537
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:48.210
The important thing is we may have lost this battle,
but the important thing is,

538
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.040
is that God revealed a terror of this arm,
of our strength,

539
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.730
a fear of the military,
strength of the rebel angels.
It's,
what's his,

540
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:58.380
what was manifest in this war?

541
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.120
God was so afraid of us that he actually doubted his hold on his own empire,

542
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:07.170
an empire that he was only actually able to maintain because of good luck or

543
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:09.720
something like superior military fire power,

544
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.310
but certainly nothing as grand and as absolute as omnipotence.

545
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.350
It's an amazing,
this is an amazing thing for Satan to say.
After his fall,

546
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:25.310
even the explosion of Satan from heaven was not sufficient to prove,

547
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.440
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt,
the legitimate authority of God,

548
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:35.910
that Satan is still able to doubt the legitimacy of Gods of God's power is a

549
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:40.110
testimony to the complexity.
I think of the,
of the analysis of,

550
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.470
of power and paradise lost.
No power,

551
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.400
not even God's power can be irresistibly and indisputably proven.

552
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.500
Satan refuses in this speech to deify the power of the conquering enemy.

553
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.570
And in this refusal,
Satan resembles no one so much as John Milton,

554
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.330
John Milton,

555
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:07.330
the political leftist who refused to deify the power of the English King Charles

556
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:12.240
the first,
um,
whom so many of his contemporaries considered to be God's anointed.

557
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:13.770
Um,
John Milton,

558
00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:18.771
who wrote hundreds of pages of anti monarchic propaganda until King Charles,

559
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:23.720
his head was safely severed from,
from his body.
Like,

560
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.140
like Milton.
Satan is in the business of demystifying power,

561
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.940
of exposing political or cultural power is something that is not simply

562
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:36.750
inherently there or naturally.
Their power is something.

563
00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:39.990
And this is what we learn from a reading of John Milton.

564
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.260
Power is something that is created by a human process of deification,

565
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:46.380
a process of,

566
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:51.710
of king worship or a process of God worship or book worship or a process for

567
00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:55.470
that matter of,
of poet worship.

568
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.740
Now later on,
a paradise lost.

569
00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:03.090
Satan comes to the conclusion that that old man and heaven who seemed,

570
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.433
uh,

571
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.910
who had assumed the authority to issue all of those arbitrary decrees,

572
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:14.690
Satan finally relents and concedes that he is actually an omnipotent God and

573
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:15.001
that,

574
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:20.001
that God actually is or was the omnipotent creator of all things.

575
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.670
But despite this enormous concession and this realization,

576
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.500
Satan is still justified,

577
00:38:25.501 --> 00:38:30.501
I think in his cynical demystification of God's behavior before the defeat of

578
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:32.160
the rebel angels.

579
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:37.430
And Satan complains now that God never bothered to demonstrate to the angels

580
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:43.180
just how powerful he was.
And so this is the last quotation on the handout,

581
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:44.913
Satan again,

582
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:50.730
but he who reigns monarch in heaven till then as one secure sat on his throne

583
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.240
upheld by old repute,
consent or custom,

584
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.300
and his regal state put forth that fall,

585
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:04.020
but still his strength concealed which tempted our attempt and rot our fall.

586
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.900
Satan saying that before the war in heaven,

587
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:12.901
God's power just seemed like any other kings power as if God sat on the throne

588
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:16.510
of heaven merely because of the humor,

589
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:21.540
those humanly constructed reasons of of tradition or of old repute or cut

590
00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:24.930
consent or custom.
Now,
alas for Satan,

591
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.880
it turned out that God's monarchy was actually based on genuine,

592
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.290
on genuine strength.

593
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:33.580
It wasn't simply that God just happened to be wearing the crown and just

594
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:36.310
happened to be sitting in the in the best chair.

595
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.420
But in Satan's articulation of what we can think of as a dialectic of power and

596
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:43.294
authority,

597
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:48.420
he provides us with a useful analysis of the problems besetting any

598
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:54.151
understanding of of power that the kinds of authority established by the bogeys

599
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:59.200
of tradition and custom and conservative tradition are not always

600
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:04.180
distinguishable from the kinds of authority that are based on genuine strength.

601
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:09.220
And even if we locate a source of some kind of genuine strength,

602
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:10.930
authoritative strength,

603
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:15.520
it's still usually possible as it is for Satan to argue that that power is

604
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:19.030
really a at base just the concealed product of customer.

605
00:40:19.031 --> 00:40:23.260
What we would think of is cultural construction to be a king,

606
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.500
one need merely put forth one's regal state when simply needs to act king lane.

607
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.700
Now I raised the matter of say,

608
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.800
Satan's critique of God's power because the evaluation and the criticism of,

609
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:43.360
of Milton and especially in Milton's poetry has hinged for a couple of centuries

610
00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:48.100
now on a related set of questions about the,
about this poet's power.

611
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.330
It is Milton,

612
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:53.170
is Milton powerful for the very straightforward reason that he's in possession

613
00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:56.020
of this tremendous,
uh,
literary strength,

614
00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:59.590
this unimaginable talent or,

615
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:04.030
or it as Milton only seen powerful because if the traditional religious values

616
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:06.940
with,
with,
with which he is so intimately associated,

617
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:12.090
does Milton only seen powerful because he has the force or the strength or the

618
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:14.980
age old literary Canon behind him?

619
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.970
Does Milton only seen powerful because he's the very literary embodiment of

620
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:23.620
Patriarchy and,
and masculine bias.
Now,
I mean,

621
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:28.180
it goes without saying that these are questions that it's impossible for us to

622
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:30.760
try to answer.
Uh,
certainly now.

623
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.340
But Milton lets us know later in paradise lost,

624
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.190
<v 1>okay,</v>

625
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:41.190
<v 0>that Satan was wrong to embark on his dangerous deconstruction of divine power.</v>

626
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.980
Um,
Milton ultimately is a,

627
00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:49.981
is a pious man and wants us to frown on Satan's critique of the Judeo Christian

628
00:41:50.951 --> 00:41:54.490
conception of divinity.
But,
but Satan,

629
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.520
regardless of Milton's ultimate dismissal of Satan's position,

630
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:05.310
Satan's analysis of power and of God's power especially isn't that easily

631
00:42:05.351 --> 00:42:06.184
dismissible.

632
00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.870
And that's not simply because Satan bear such a strong resemblance to Milton as,

633
00:42:10.871 --> 00:42:13.180
as of course he does.
Satan looks,

634
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:18.550
I'm convinced Satan looks ahead to us as,
as well.

635
00:42:18.551 --> 00:42:23.551
Satan resembles us as readers as we attempt to dissect and to anatomize the

636
00:42:25.001 --> 00:42:29.500
power of Milton's poetry.
And I go so far to say that,
um,
uh,

637
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.710
something like a satanic sensibility may be one of our best guides in our

638
00:42:34.811 --> 00:42:38.560
reading of,
of Milton.
It's Milton Satan who best prepares us.

639
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.050
I'll throw this out here at the end of this lecture,

640
00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:45.400
who best prepares us to explore what we can think of the law of as the

641
00:42:45.401 --> 00:42:48.640
labyrinths of,
of miltonic power.

642
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.400
He puts us in a position to explore

643
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:57.910
that truly weird but undeniable process whereby the very word Milton,

644
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:04.210
the name Milton stops referring to a particular middleclass Londoner who was

645
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:09.521
born in 1608 and begins to embody the very essence of that strange and

646
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:15.050
inexplicably phenomenon that we call literary power.

647
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.130
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

648
00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:22.080
<v 0>So that's all I,
that's all of the content portion of this,</v>

649
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:26.340
uh,
of this class.
The lecture is over.
Bet.
Let me remind you of a few things.
Um,

650
00:43:26.341 --> 00:43:30.570
you must,
before you leave this,
uh,
this lecture hall,

651
00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:34.840
put your name on one of the signup sheets.
Maybe I haven't hit well,

652
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.800
I'll find the sign up sheets and make sure that you have an opportunity to put

653
00:43:37.801 --> 00:43:40.930
your name on them.
Um,
if you don't,
um,

654
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.880
it's possible that some of our unbelievably distinguished djs will find

655
00:43:44.881 --> 00:43:49.230
themselves without a job.
And,

656
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.610
uh,
for next time,
um,

657
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.250
making sure that you will have read

658
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.020
at the very least,
Milton's great poem.
And he wrote,

659
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.230
he wrote it when he was only 21 years old.
Um,

660
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.040
the Ode on Christ's naitivity.
Um,
and,
and read,
of course,

661
00:44:09.041 --> 00:44:11.080
the other two poems that are assigned for the class,

662
00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:15.310
but we'll be focusing on what we call the naitivity out.
Okay.
That's it.
