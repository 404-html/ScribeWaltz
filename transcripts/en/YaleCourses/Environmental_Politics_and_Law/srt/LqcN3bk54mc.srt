1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,020
This is one of my favorite
topics in the course,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,270
food agriculture. And, uh,
I'm, I'm deeply interested in,

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,030
in everybody's personal
connection to food.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,530
You are what you eat, you are what you
breathe, you are what you drink. Um,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,050
and we often don't have a very good
understanding of what's in our food,

6
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,610
what's in our era and what's in our water.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,240
So hopefully this will sensitize
you to that problem. Uh,

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,770
and also to get you to
understand, hopefully, uh,

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,930
the structure of us environmental law
that applies to food and agriculture.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,740
And this is an interesting area of law.
Uh,

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,920
food like plastics,
like energy.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,440
It really does not have a distinctive,

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,710
a specific body of law that applies to it

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,550
as opposed to air and
water, uh, or pesticides.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,800
So that's kind of curious. It's a problem
that cuts across many different areas,

16
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:04,630
many different types of regulation,
uh,

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,600
and the management of food in the U s
and the management of agriculture is

18
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,640
really fractured among
a number of agencies.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,150
Great Britain recently centralized
their regulatory program and a created a

20
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:21,670
single agency to manage food.
How,

21
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:25,680
and we'll think about the wisdom of
doing that and some of the strengths and

22
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,910
weaknesses of the European and
British system. So to begin,

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,550
I want you to think about the
percentage of the world that, uh,

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,920
is used to grow crops or degrades lives,
livestock.

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,960
So there are 30 billion acres of land in
the world and about 4 billion acres of

26
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:47,210
those are in cropland.
So roughly about one seventh or,

27
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:51,990
or one eighth of the world is used to
grow crops within the United States.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,470
It's about 400 million acres of land.
It's an enormous area

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,620
and it's dispersed increasingly in
a more remote areas. As cities grow,

30
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,360
I had a suburb sprawl,
um,

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,560
and as farmers are pushed
further and further away,

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,250
and this has a really interesting and
important implications for environmental

33
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,410
quality and also for human health.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,960
So here are four crops represented in
these pictures a week in the upper left,

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,880
uh, corn. Uh, many of you
probably are unaware that a,

36
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,400
on a daily basis, most of us
consume cotton, uh, and a,

37
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,400
a variety of foods without recognizing it.
They really know in what form

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
oil, cotton, seed oil. It's,
it's part of a many pastries.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,310
Uh, many different kinds of cereals. Uh,

40
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,310
so many breads rely on don cotton
seed oil and, and the bottom rice.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,870
These are four major grains in the
world, uh, that, that uh, uh, uh,

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,040
uh, take up a hundreds of
millions of acres of landscape.

43
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,740
Corn alone in the United States is
almost 80 million acres that is currently

44
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:03,730
planted.
Increasingly in the United States,

45
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,690
farm size is increasing, meaning that
there are fewer and fewer farmers.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,610
And a surprisingly,

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,630
the diversity of crops that are planted
on individual farms is also going down.

48
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,340
So what that means is that farming
is becoming more highly specialized,

49
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,920
uh, that uh, uh, farmers are
knowledgeable about fewer crops. Uh,

50
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,950
they have less capacity to
manage problems such as a past,

51
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,870
a fun guy,

52
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,280
a insects of different sorts because
they really don't have the fundamental

53
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:40,780
understanding of ecology that many farmers
had to have in order to survive in a

54
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:44,950
world, uh, that, uh, was not as
chemically dependent as as ours is.

55
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Current industrialized agriculture
could be successful on a parking lot.

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,580
If you brought in soil and you brought
in fertilizer and you brought in water

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,100
and a artificially, uh, uh,
added organic matter. Uh,

58
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:01,750
so basically the more you
control your environment,

59
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:06,730
a using industrial technology,
the more expensive it becomes a,

60
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,650
but the less you have to worry
about understanding of college.

61
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,850
So it's curious that, uh, uh, you know,

62
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:16,870
as centralization is occurred in
ownership patterns, the farm's got larger.

63
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:21,460
The Crop, uh, specialty
diminished our dietary patterns.

64
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,690
It followed a similar, a similar pattern.
We've relied on fewer and fewer crops.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,560
So now that most people's
diet is comprised of a between
30 to 40 different, uh,

66
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,720
individual crops.

67
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,450
So I want to talk today about what the
central problems in food and agriculture

68
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:41,290
are. Uh, and these
include food availability.

69
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,350
And I think most of us
understand that, uh, the,

70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,800
the role of government is often been
perceived as one of trying to make sure

71
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:51,490
that we have a productive
food supply, uh, that, uh,

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,690
our agriculture is as productive as it
possibly could be so we could maximize

73
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,380
our exports to other countries. Uh, so
that our balance of trade would be helped.

74
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:02,770
But also so we could deal with under
nourished in impoverished parts of the

75
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:06,490
world that did not have the capacity
to grow food for whatever reason.

76
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,990
Food prices are going up, particularly
in the last decade. They've,

77
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,250
they've taken up an increasing percentage
of the average household income,

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,040
meaning that people are looking to buy
a lower cost foods and lower cost foods

79
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,270
are often higher calorie foods. They're
often foods that come and bulk packages.

80
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,850
Uh, so people are more
prone to, to buy a, the,

81
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,580
the leap the leader and a half bottles of
soda than they would a individual cans.

82
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,970
And that had, has had an influence
on patterns of food consumption.

83
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,780
As I mentioned,
species dependence has gone down.

84
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,290
We're relying on on fewer and fewer crops.
Uh,

85
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,000
we're genetically engineering those crops.
More and more.

86
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,140
A very high proportion of corn that's
planted in the United States is

87
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,770
genetically engineered. The same goes for
the other major greens that we produce.

88
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,330
Also a serious problem that
we have is that a, our,

89
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,710
our tastes are being cultivated
by other organizations,

90
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,290
particularly food processors,
uh, that, uh, are,

91
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,030
are adding ingredients that we don't
really pay much attention to in terms of

92
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,030
fat, in terms of salt, in terms of,

93
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,700
of sugar and a variety of artificial
flavors and colors that, uh, uh,

94
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,400
they do a very careful,
uh,

95
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,820
social surveys to understand what
kinds of tastes, what kinds of colors,

96
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,910
what kinds of flavors,
uh, people enjoy the most.

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,560
I use the example of the Salmo Fan.
Uh,

98
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:33,860
so that salmon is now colored in
30 dash 35 to 36 different shades,

99
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,200
uh, ranging from a really deep red
to a, uh, a very light coral. Uh,

100
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:42,400
so they, they did a, their
focus groups and, and, uh,

101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,440
conducted surveys and figured out that
that most people like a number 33,

102
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,390
uh, so that, uh, that type of thinking
is pervading the food industry. Uh,

103
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,890
we as buyers tend to respond.

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,390
We respond by by, uh, uh, basically, uh,

105
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,940
looking for the lower cost foods, but
also those that, that, uh, uh, seem to,

106
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,360
to provide either a taste or,

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,790
or some other aesthetic appeal.

108
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,310
We also are consuming more calories
than we ever have before. Uh,

109
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,240
we are consuming on average
in the United States,

110
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:20,090
about 3,900 calories per person.
Uh,

111
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:25,091
only 15 years ago we were consuming about
3,200 calories a and that's up from,

112
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,440
uh, uh, perhaps, uh, uh, 27,
2,800 calories per person.

113
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,030
And the average shear person
with the average wait,

114
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,300
say 165 pound a male could
survive extremely well on a,

115
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:42,920
on a diet of about 2,400 calories per
day. Now, this would vary tremendously.

116
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:47,180
I know some of you are athletes.
Some of you may run 10 miles a day,

117
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:50,930
some of you may swim four or five
miles a day. Uh, those of you that,

118
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,310
that to exercise a great deal, we'll
obviously need a, a much more, uh,

119
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:59,740
a much higher caloric intake. But, uh, uh,

120
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,110
if you combine knowledge about what's
happened to our behavior in our

121
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,310
increasingly sedentary lifestyles,
uh, sitting behind computers,

122
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,480
watching video games,

123
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:12,260
the latest report came out only last
week demonstrating the kids are now

124
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:16,580
spending seven hours a day looking
at electronic equipment of ones,

125
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:21,500
one form or another. Uh, this
is really quite striking.
Uh, my generation, we had a,

126
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,690
we had televisions, uh, but, uh, you know,

127
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,610
television wasn't that big a
thing when I grew up. And, uh, we,

128
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,550
we spent a whole lot more time outdoors.

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,560
People are spending time indoors or
they're not a burning up, uh, as much,

130
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,760
uh, energy as they used to. Uh,
so we're all putting on weight,

131
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,760
water consumption, water consumption,
especially in arid parts of the world. Uh,

132
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,310
irrigation a necessary for agriculture.
This is a critical problem,

133
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,610
particularly related to climate
change, uh, which, uh, uh,

134
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,170
is causing experts to
predict that, that, uh, uh,

135
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,120
it's going to be increasingly
expensive to move water into dryer, uh,

136
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,123
environments.

137
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Meaning that it's going to
be a core requirement to
ship those foods from longer

138
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,040
distances, uh, demanding higher energy.

139
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,450
Most of us don't really
have much knowledge of the
energy it takes to produce a,

140
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,180
say a, a, a bowl, a piece as
opposed to a bowl of oatmeal or a,

141
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,680
a a stake. And that's quite
curious. The amount of energy,

142
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,480
uh, that obviously increases with distance
from the source of production to the

143
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,010
source of consumption.
Uh,

144
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:32,050
but we really don't pay any attention to
that and we don't have any way of, of,

145
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,350
uh, uh, measuring it. This, by the way,

146
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:37,710
would be a terrific term paper if somebody
still thinking about a research topic

147
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:41,340
for the course. Just take one
food. Uh, just take apples,

148
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:45,720
figure out where apples are produced
in the world, uh, figure out, uh, uh,

149
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:50,280
where Yale buys it's apples and try to
come up with a metric for the energy

150
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,540
involved in moving an apple,
uh,

151
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,380
from point of production to the point
of consumption. So you know, you,

152
00:09:56,381 --> 00:10:00,000
you could imagine a society,
uh, decades into the future, uh,

153
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,450
where you could take your iPhone and you
could walk up to a grocery store shelf

154
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,020
and you know,
you could hold the,

155
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,120
the Barcode on the food are on the side
of the shelf next to your phone and you

156
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:12,330
could call up information on
where the food came from. A,

157
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:14,670
you could call it information
on its energy. Uh,

158
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:18,170
was it produced using
artificial chemicals, uh, or uh,

159
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,680
what kinds of fertilizers were used to
produce it so that we could get a whole

160
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:26,980
new level of understanding
of, uh, energy and, uh,

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,550
the environmental health
of our different products,

162
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,790
including issues such as a protein
content and fat content type of fat,

163
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,750
a amount of salt, et cetera. Right now,
most of us walk through the marketplace,

164
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,030
uh, really blind to these issues, uh,
blinds to the environmental effects of,

165
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:49,020
of food production,
a blind to also to the energy consumption.

166
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,890
We also have very little understanding
of food processing and I want you to

167
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:56,130
think about a couple of commodities
that you experience on a routine basis.

168
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,190
You take cotton, for example,
that I just showed you,

169
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:04,191
a picture of a cotton is a cotton
seeds are put into a machine.

170
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,200
Uh, they are ground up. Uh, then
there are, are sprayed by a solvent.

171
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,090
The solvent extracts the oils and
the oil drips down into, into vats.

172
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,910
Uh, it gets mixed with other kinds of
vegetable oils and ends it's way, uh,

173
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,260
of winds its way into,
into supermarkets.

174
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,460
How about grapes while grapes have
water extracted from them? Uh,

175
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,040
and they are turned into raisins. Uh, uh,

176
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,630
you can think of a variety of different
foods. Corn as another example,

177
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,770
a oil is extracted from corn. How is
it done? It's done using a solvent.

178
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,990
But what happens to the solvent?
Where does it go?

179
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,040
Or there residues of the solvent in
corn oil. And the answer is often yes,

180
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,660
the residents do, uh, uh, persist.
They do get into, into the food supply.

181
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,200
Uh,

182
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,010
but we have very little understanding of
what happens to food when it leaves the

183
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,560
farm on its way to, uh,
to our dinner table.

184
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,700
Food packaging is a topic that
we'll take on a, in a few weeks. Uh,

185
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:05,200
particularly with respect to plastics and
the absence of our understanding, the,

186
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,620
the origin of the plastic or
the content of the plastic,

187
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:12,920
the energy that it takes to produce the
plastic is really quite striking. Uh,

188
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,620
all of the plastic waste that surrounds
most of the meats that are produced and

189
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:19,990
available in grocery
stores is thrown away.

190
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,080
And there's almost no hope that any
of that plastic is ever recycled.

191
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,900
It's simply discarded and it's burned.
Uh,

192
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:29,200
and many of the plastics contain chemicals
that you really don't want to breathe,

193
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,650
or if they're buried in landfills,
they will leach.

194
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,830
They will break down gradually and they
will leach into soils and underlying

195
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:40,690
water supplies. Uh, and as I mentioned
in an earlier lecture in every landfill,

196
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,750
uh, among the 300,000
that exists in the nation,

197
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,070
you can find these residues of plastic
in the soil and the underlying what

198
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:48,910
groundwater supply.

199
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,680
So the key environmental and
health problems associated
with our methods of food

200
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:56,620
production, uh, include pesticides. Uh,

201
00:12:56,621 --> 00:13:00,730
and I'll talk a bit about pesticides
today and the structure of pesticide law.

202
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,490
Uh,

203
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,100
there are now some 25,000 pesticides,

204
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,060
uh, that are, are, uh,

205
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
packaged in different ways and
sold in different combinations.

206
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,840
In the United States alone
in the world marketplace,

207
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:18,340
there are 75,000 different pesticide
products that had been registered by

208
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,920
different nations.
How about fertilizers?

209
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,860
When some parts of the world human
waste is used as fertilizers,

210
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:24,910
animal waste is used,

211
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,280
but also there are a fossil fuel
based fertilizers that are, are,

212
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,230
are very common.
So increasingly we find fertilizer,

213
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,540
uh, being used as farmers, uh,

214
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,910
continually plant and replant the same
field. They don't let let it lie fallow.

215
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,310
They don't plant crops that can fix
nitrogen into the soil. Uh, so that,

216
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,330
uh, they have to, they have to add an
order to officially coloring agents.

217
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,930
Most of you probably do not pay too much
attention to coloring agents in your

218
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:56,764
food.

219
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,120
But there's a very interesting history
of coloring agents and different nations

220
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:04,990
have different laws and some,
some of these agents are natural,

221
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,880
others are artificial. Uh,
but, uh, uh, that, that would
be another great paper topic.

222
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,800
Just take a,
take a,

223
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:16,660
a look carefully at what we know about
different kinds of chemicals that are

224
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:20,340
used to color foods, flavors, a,

225
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,520
also artificial flavors and natural
flavors. Uh, what do you know about them?

226
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,490
They do not have to be labeled
under federal food law. Uh,

227
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,840
so natural flavors is a, uh,
a, an umbrella category. Uh,

228
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,390
artificial flavors also is, and uh, uh,

229
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,820
this is a huge industry. If you decided
you wanted to produce, say a, a,

230
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,260
a new concoction, maybe it
would be a coconut flavored, uh,

231
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,360
apple sauce will, you
could basically get a, uh,

232
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,000
some sort of pureed fruit, uh, of
different sorts. Maybe pair, maybe apple,

233
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:57,470
maybe peaches. You can ground it out and
grind the popup and uh, by processing it,

234
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,970
you'd likely lose all the flavor.

235
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,150
So you'd have to figure out how to
put the flavor back into it. Well,

236
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,620
you could do that really easily.

237
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:06,640
I encourage you to go online
and take a look at the, uh,

238
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,060
international flavors and
fragrances institute. Uh,

239
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:14,180
and it will give you a list of firms,
chemical companies all over the world.

240
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:17,840
That will will allow you to say,
yes, I want to make, make a, a,

241
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,480
a coconut lime apple sauce or a, uh, uh,

242
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,110
a root beer flavored chewing gum. Uh,
they will give you the, uh, the, uh,

243
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,710
chemical company's name,
and they will provide you with the,

244
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:33,650
the essence is necessary, uh, to create
the product. Also, you may not know,

245
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:37,400
but a fragrances are commonly used in
food because fragrances will trigger the

246
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,770
same, uh, nerve response, uh,

247
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:43,580
in your mouth and in your mind
that the flavors will trigger.

248
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,680
So to create a sense that you're eating,
say, root beer flavored oatmeal, uh,

249
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,900
they could simply use a, a, a drop of, of
a fragrance to give you that impression.

250
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,030
So packaging materials processing
affects a contamination of air, water,

251
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:04,010
and food on genetic modification. These
are all critical, highly debated topics,

252
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,810
uh, around the world, given the fact that
many nations have different standards.

253
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,550
Whereas the marketplace, the global
marketplace clearly is, is uh, uh,

254
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,750
moving commodities at a, at a lightening
pace, across national boundaries,

255
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,780
creating serious legal problems,
uh,

256
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:24,980
for firms that to have to
understand, uh, the, the difficulty,

257
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,830
the difficult, uh, uh, a problem of,

258
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,390
of having different regulations in
different countries and there are deeper,

259
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,900
deeper problems here associated
with the food supply.

260
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,880
And they include a really a fractured
legal and regulatory responsibility.

261
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,260
And I'll, I'll talk more about that
in a few moments. A private science,

262
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,580
the fact that the majority of science
that underlies a understanding the, the,

263
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:53,600
uh, environmental effects,
the health effects, uh,

264
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,070
the energy consumption required in
order to produce and move food, uh,

265
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,200
the,
the energy required to a,

266
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,980
to deal with the waste that the science
is being conducted in the private sector.

267
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,230
It's often not available
to the public sector.

268
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,180
So trade secrecy laws is quite
important in this case. Uh,

269
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:15,920
and that it often prevents you from
understanding in detail what you'd really

270
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:18,770
need to know in order to take
control over your own diet.

271
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,390
Worker safety is another deeper problem
that we don't pay much attention to.

272
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,830
If you look at, uh, the, uh, the farm,

273
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,990
the farm worker poisoning data
becomes apparent that, uh, uh,

274
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:34,200
workers are often, uh, not
well-protected. They're often, uh,

275
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,770
uh, uh, not monitored. They
often do not have, uh, uh,

276
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,190
insurance and, uh, uh,
health care, uh, so that, uh,

277
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,260
it's a neglected population.

278
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,910
Migrant workers traditionally
have been exploited in a,

279
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,870
almost every nation in the world.
But even in our,

280
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,410
our country where we think we
have highly sophisticated law, uh,

281
00:17:55,411 --> 00:18:00,060
workers really are not protected
nearly the same as you or I would be,

282
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,630
so that there are different
standards for allowable risk, uh,

283
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:08,060
for workers than there are
four. For a Uri say, uh,

284
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,780
from purchasing food in,
in the marketplace. Uh,
different contamination limits.

285
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,760
Uh, another deeper problem is the
narrative advantage of the producers.

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,010
If you look at the scale of the
advertising industry and their,

287
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:22,800
their methods of
advertising and this wall.

288
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,950
So it would be a great topic
for a paper on what are their,

289
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,760
what are their tonic
dominant test strategies? Uh,

290
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,430
how do they make claims
of a product benefit, uh,

291
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,190
either that it is natural,
that it is helpful,

292
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,490
how far can they go and what laws
restrict what they can claim.

293
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,970
What about their requirements to,
uh,

294
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,560
disclose risks that are known to be
associated with, with their foods.

295
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,050
So it's, it's interesting that the
organic food industry evolved basically,

296
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,350
uh, growing from a strategy
that, that, uh, uh,

297
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,420
proclaims that a certain
class of chemicals is not
present in the food supply.

298
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,670
So synthetic organic pesticides
are not allowed to be used, uh,

299
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,530
in organic foods.

300
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,090
Now that doesn't mean that those that
are producing nonorganic foods have to

301
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:15,120
label what synthetic organic
chemicals are in their food.

302
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,900
So you can think about different legal
strategies that might be employed in

303
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:23,320
order to provide the consumer
with knowledge that would
be really necessary to

304
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,370
understand what they're reading.
Uh,

305
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,080
public subsidies also a are a worthy
topic for somebody interested in trying to

306
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,230
transform the, the, uh, international
food system. So, uh, if you, uh,

307
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,880
look at the subsidies carefully,

308
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,880
and you can do this now because there
was a group in Washington called the

309
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:48,470
environmental working group that
put together a terrific website. Uh,

310
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,560
so you can go to the website and you can
find your home state and your county or

311
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,830
your town and you can figure out which
farmers are getting which subsidies. Uh,

312
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,000
and what you'll see is that that,
uh,

313
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,290
industrialized a commodities such
as corn and wheat and cotton, uh,

314
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,790
they're receiving the bulk of the
subsidies in the nation as opposed to the

315
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,500
organic farmers or farmers
that are beyond organic, uh,

316
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,160
who basically receive no
subsidy. So that, uh, you know,

317
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,960
government funds could be used to, to
innovate, to, to really transform, uh,

318
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,250
the structure of, of agriculture
in the nation. Uh, but, uh, uh,

319
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:30,330
this is not likely in the
near future a land values, uh,

320
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,770
how to land values play into the
pattern of farming and agriculture that,

321
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,910
that we currently see. Well, you know,

322
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,660
what I suggested earlier in the
talk was that, uh, you know,

323
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,520
as urban areas and suburban areas,

324
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:46,521
a sprawl out into undeveloped lands are
they commonly will cause property values

325
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,280
in lands that are nearby to
increase the commercial value there.

326
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,990
They're a residential value
or their industrial value, uh,

327
00:20:56,991 --> 00:21:01,090
may shoot up quite quickly as
a, as a city expands. So that a,

328
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:04,010
the value of the, of the
land, uh, from the, uh,

329
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,010
and in terms of its productivity for
different crops often can't compete with

330
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:13,660
this rising, uh, uh, property value.
Uh, so that, that the farmer sells out.

331
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,900
Also the agricultural land, uh,
it's flat generally. Uh, it,

332
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,670
it also is, is, uh, uh, not forested.

333
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,880
And what this means is that a,
it's really easy to develop.

334
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,590
So you can imagine the, uh, the problem
of, of developing in a forested area.

335
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,170
Uh, it's much more expensive
for land development.

336
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,940
So you find the rate of
transformation of farmland, uh, from,

337
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,980
from, uh, uh, especially in
the rural parts of the u s,

338
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,830
uh, that, uh, are in the target
zone for urban expansion. Uh,

339
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,140
these lands are being shifted into,

340
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,020
into residential and commercial
use at a very rapid rate. So, uh,

341
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,680
the fundamental problem that
I think we face right now is,

342
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,400
is one of intelligence.
And I don't mean to imply that a,

343
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,910
it's an absence of capacity to
understand these things. It's,

344
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,640
it's an absence of producing the knowledge
and making it publicly accessible to

345
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,940
consumers in a way that a
really could empower you to,

346
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,350
to react in the marketplace in a
way that would send messages back to

347
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:18,540
corporations.
Uh,

348
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,230
messages that I think really are
often much more powerful and, uh,

349
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,820
often more listened to than
messages sent by regulators.

350
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,430
So I'd like you to think about
corn and ethanol for just a moment.

351
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,060
And, uh, the, the increasing subsidy
for the production of ethanol, uh,

352
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:44,290
that, uh, you know, will
oxygenate fuels and a is,

353
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,530
is a required by a different
levels of government,

354
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,270
including the environmental
protection agency

355
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,650
as a way of improving
air quality. Uh, but, uh,

356
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,900
what is increasingly
apparent is that, uh, uh,

357
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,260
the ethanol in subsidy has caused, uh, uh,

358
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,910
corn prices to rise quite dramatically.
Uh,

359
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,000
because more of the farmers are putting
these ethanol production plants on their

360
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:13,630
property and they're not shutting
the corn into the food supply.

361
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,920
Now, there also was an, uh,

362
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,670
an over abundance of enthusiasm among
the farmers to produce the ethanol.

363
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,070
So the ethanol market, uh,
started to collapse. Uh,

364
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,910
and, uh, this is, uh, this is hurt the
farmers throughout the United States.

365
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,750
Think now about the one area, uh, and,
uh, the area of chemical application,

366
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,980
uh, particularly pesticides. Uh, this is
an interesting area in that, uh, it, it,

367
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,890
it demands that you think about
a real variety of laws. Uh,

368
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,270
the Federal Food Drug and
cosmetic act on the top here,

369
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,370
the federal insecticide fungicide and
rodenticide act and the Food Quality

370
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:55,670
Protection Act.

371
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,540
These are the dominant statutes in the
United States that apply to a pesticide,

372
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,850
uh, control, uh, but
other laws as well, uh,

373
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:09,530
are necessary to understand and have some,
some control over,

374
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,430
uh, pesticides including the safe
drinking water act. And other words,

375
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,110
one would need to worry about the
application of billions of pounds of

376
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,510
pesticides in the United
States every year. Uh,

377
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:24,200
because the pesticides the often
don't just go away. Uh, they,

378
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,070
they often will move down through soils
and into groundwater supplies. Uh, so,

379
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,890
uh, we'll talk a bit later in
the, in the week about, uh, the,

380
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:36,620
the problem with managing, uh,
drinking water quality by the way, uh,

381
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,960
the government, uh, uh, in
its food intake surveys, uh,

382
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,540
concludes that the number one food that
everybody eats in the United States is

383
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:49,470
water. Water is classified as a food
under the food, drug and cosmetic act. Uh,

384
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,980
so that,
uh,

385
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,590
worrying about a water contamination
is a really important issue and

386
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:59,360
understanding the way that a chemical
release into the atmosphere as well as

387
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:03,930
into a, on to plants in,
into the landscape, uh,

388
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,150
that that could contaminate drinking
water even if it goes through a filtration

389
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:11,780
plant, uh, that, uh, often is
the case for many urban areas.

390
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,650
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
uh,

391
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,430
that we talked a bit about
last week and Super Fund. Uh,

392
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,280
most of these sites have pesticides
within them and they are classified as

393
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,500
hazardous sites in part because
of the pesticides that are there.

394
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,530
But pesticides were in the, uh, recites
in the circle of sites on VA case.

395
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,510
Uh, predominantly, uh, chemicals
that are persistent were,

396
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:37,190
were applied back in the
30s, forties, and 50s.

397
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,020
The toxic substance control
act does deal with pesticides.

398
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,350
The Hazardous Material
Transportation Act does as well.

399
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,710
National Environmental Policy Act that a,
we talked about last week,

400
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,480
endangered species act if you have a,
an endangered species, uh, that, uh,

401
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,820
and it's habitat has been defined. It's
a normally illegal to apply pesticides,

402
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,180
uh, in that, in that Habitat, uh,

403
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,150
the Wilderness Act would prevent
pesticides from being applied within its

404
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:08,780
boundaries. Uh, and the
manufacturer of pesticides often

405
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,020
produces a airborne resumes that are
regulated under the Clean Air Act.

406
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:20,060
Uh, and also the release via
pipes from those plants, uh, uh,

407
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,690
is regulated under the clean
water act. Uh, but as well, uh,

408
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,900
you can imagine the problem of spraying
chemicals year after year and a

409
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:34,100
landscape, uh, and then, uh, you have,
uh, rainstorms coming in the spring.

410
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,400
Give you a good example of that.
Atrazine, which is an herbicide,

411
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,250
it's a pre emergent herbicides.
So they plant the corn,

412
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:43,190
but before the corn sprouts,
they'll spray the landscape,

413
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:48,030
the atrazine often in the spring.
Uh, so always in the spring,

414
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:52,350
actually in particularly in the Midwest,
uh, after the spring rains come,

415
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,870
you can measure as it spikes in atrazine,

416
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:59,430
in the Mississippi River and most of the
mid Western rivers and these rivers in

417
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,000
the Midwest provide water supplies
for tens of millions of people. Uh,

418
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,940
and the filtration of the
plants will not take it out.

419
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,140
So both the clean water act and the safe
drinking water act come into play in

420
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:10,974
that case.

421
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:16,130
And the Occupational Safety and Health
Act also is designed to protect a worker

422
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:18,330
safety. Uh, but as I said earlier,

423
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,480
it often sets standards that are
far above standards that are,

424
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,680
are set for a non worker environments.

425
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,000
So it's a very complicated body of law.
But for this reason,

426
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:34,620
pesticides becomes a good, a good
window to, to understand law. Uh,

427
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,870
one way to think about this is that
it's driven by two, two things really.

428
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,730
One is that pesticides are intentionally
toxic substances. They're not,

429
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,050
they're not like, say,
just some new chemical that
somebody designs a, you know,

430
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:53,470
for, uh, to, to be added to a, to
plastic to make it stronger. Uh,

431
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,020
that wasn't designed, uh, to,
uh, to kill a different species.

432
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,990
It was designed to provide
some functionality,

433
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,230
but pesticides is a group of chemicals,
uh,

434
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,490
were specifically designed
to injure either a plant, uh,

435
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,460
an insect, a, some other species. In fact,

436
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:16,080
some of the nerve gases that were designed
to during World War II and, and, uh, uh,

437
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:20,700
in the 1920s by Great Britain and Germany,
Nazi Germany,

438
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,880
they were designed
specifically to harm humans.

439
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,840
And many of these nerve gases
have been diluted down, uh,

440
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:32,400
for agricultural purposes. Uh, so that,
uh, all species have been targets, uh,

441
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:35,910
for the development of this class
of biocides. It's number one,

442
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:39,990
they're intentionally toxic substances.
And number two, to get their effect,

443
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,380
they've got to be released to the
environment in, in great quantities.

444
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,360
So you release a chemical
or the environment, uh,

445
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,510
the atomic weapons testing history
tells us you better understand something

446
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:52,470
about where it goes.

447
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,740
And pesticide history is replete with
examples where people paid too little

448
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:00,420
attention.
Now I want to,

449
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,480
I want to step back and take you into the
earlier part of the century and I want

450
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:10,180
you to think about a, a, a
very serious problem, uh,

451
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,830
at that point in time and a problem
that persistent and that's malaria.

452
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,970
Malaria is a, an illness that's
transmitted by a parasite. Uh,

453
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,340
it's, uh, the Anopheles
mosquito and a, all of its,

454
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,930
all of its variance,
uh,

455
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,460
had the capacity to take the parasite up
from the blood of an infected animal or

456
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:35,160
an uninfected human.
So if a,

457
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:39,240
if you had malaria and an inset
came and landed on you, uh,

458
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,720
the monopolies mosquito would first
spit a little bit of an anticoagulant

459
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:47,710
through its proboscis into
your, into your body to, uh, uh,

460
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:51,440
help you bleed a little bit, uh, and
then it will suck your blood, uh,

461
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,940
into its stomach cavity.
Uh, and with that blood,

462
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,470
it would pull in malaria parasites
that are in your body than perhaps a,

463
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:01,720
I didn't have assume
I didn't have malaria.

464
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,190
That mosquito flew over and landed
on me. Uh, it would bite me and, uh,

465
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:09,950
when it would insert it's anticoagulant,
uh,

466
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,480
in its saliva in me, they would
transmit parasites into my body.

467
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,810
And that's the way that this illness
is transmitted from person to person.

468
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,700
The parasite, uh, uh,

469
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,070
has the capacity to live for nine to 11
days inside the body of a mosquito and

470
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:26,800
the sea, kind of an interesting
issue that, that, uh,

471
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:30,460
the encephalitis virus last
from 10 to 25 days. And, uh,

472
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,980
thank God the Aids virus, uh, lasts
only one to two days, so that the,

473
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:36,570
the longevity of,

474
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:41,571
of different viruses or bacteria or
parasites inside different in insects,

475
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,280
uh, affects the rate of
transmission. So I want you to,

476
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,630
to also understand the scale
of this problem in the world.

477
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,820
And today there are about between
300 and 500 million people, uh,

478
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,680
that are clinically disabled by malaria,
meaning that they want,

479
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,370
they're walking around with this parasite
in their bodies that is sapping them

480
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:03,310
of energy, that is giving
them periodic fevers, uh,

481
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,770
that makes them more susceptible
to other kinds of illnesses. Uh,

482
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,780
and 40% of the world's population
live in areas that, that are at risk,

483
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,440
meaning that the mosquitoes in that
area are capable of transmitting the

484
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:18,670
parasite. And you've got a large
population percentage that, uh, uh,

485
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,990
uh, also is carrying the
parasite and their bodies. The,

486
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,380
the core of the problem for malaria
in the world is, is really, uh,

487
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,480
in tropical regions and, and, uh,

488
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,630
particularly in Africa where 90% of
the incidents and mortality a exist.

489
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,720
And, uh, the,

490
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,320
the estimate right now by the World
Health Organization is that roughly one to

491
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:40,870
one and a half million people
die every year from malaria.

492
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,330
And the estimate over the 20th century
is about a hundred million people have

493
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,410
died from this illness.

494
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,460
It's quite striking that many people
have not understood the scale of this

495
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:52,294
problem.

496
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,540
So it's also clear if you read much
military history that a malaria was a very

497
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,080
serious problem in all wars.

498
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,600
So that if you go back to at
the time of, uh, uh, Napoleon,

499
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,380
or if you look at the, the, uh, uh,

500
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,110
history of world war one or World War II,
as,

501
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,420
as us or other countries moved
into tropical parts of the world,

502
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,800
a more casualties commonly
occurred, more lost days, uh, among,

503
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,950
among a gis occurred due to malaria
than it did to the direct effects of

504
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:32,230
casualties. There are also susceptible
populations, kids in endemic areas. Uh,

505
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,680
uh, although in epidemics all
age groups are affected, uh,

506
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,070
refugees and migrant populations and
those living in tents such those that are,

507
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,010
are, uh, fighting and
in the armed conflict,

508
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,810
it's all related to heightened
exposure being, being out in,

509
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:49,250
in an environment where, uh, you're,

510
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:52,730
you're exposing yourself to
being bitten by infected insects.

511
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,080
So you could also imagine that those,
that,

512
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,100
that work in mines or those that work
in forestry and tropical parts of the

513
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:03,860
world or, or agricultural workers,
they are also more at risk.

514
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:08,861
People that spend a timeout to outdoors
in the tropics in endemic areas are more

515
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:09,440
at risk,

516
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,090
as are those with reduced immunity who
has reduced immunity while pregnant women.

517
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,320
Pregnant women are extremely susceptible
to a very serious illness from,

518
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,630
from pregnancy and also
miscarriages. Uh, also the,

519
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:24,290
the very young young children,

520
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,390
those that are already had their immune
system compromised or in parts of, of,

521
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:31,870
uh, uh, the poorest
parts of the world. Uh,

522
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
you often have the background
high incidents of acute
respiratory infections or

523
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:42,941
diarrheal diseases that reduces a
strength and immunity and makes one more

524
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:46,040
susceptible to to this illness.
Well,

525
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:49,710
one of the ways of controlling
malaria included pesticides. Uh,

526
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,730
and here's an example of a worker in 1939
and an outbreak in natal Brazil when a

527
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,260
mosquito actually hitchhiked from Africa
on a mail boat and an athlete Gambi a

528
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,300
mosquito, uh, not, not, uh,
uh, indigenous to, to Brazil.

529
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,350
And so they finally figured out that it
hitchhiked on this mail freighter, uh,

530
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,520
was able to, to, uh, uh, are,
are a number of them did.

531
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,600
And they were able to establish a, uh, uh,

532
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:23,150
a fairly large and robust population that
it occurred during a rainy season when

533
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,060
they had exactly the right pool of
water standing on, on the areas. Uh,

534
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,540
some mosquitoes actually are interesting
and that they prefer a streams or

535
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:35,030
rivers that are,
are moving really quickly is habitat.

536
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,860
Others like very Stillwater, others
like shallow water, uh, so that, uh,

537
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:43,100
there are hundreds and hundreds of
different species of mosquitoes capable of

538
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,770
transmitting, uh, these, these illnesses
such as malaria or dengue fever,

539
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:53,600
yellow fever. So that understanding
the ecology here is really important.

540
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,560
Uh,

541
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,300
one way of dealing with the problem
and not understanding the ecology is

542
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:03,590
basically to simply spray broad
areas and landscape with pesticides,

543
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:05,990
which is what they did in this case.
Uh,

544
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:11,210
when US troops invaded a
islands in the Pacific, in the,

545
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:15,350
in the war against Japan,
uh, in the mid 1940s,

546
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:21,070
the incidents among a US gis was often
3000 per thousand per year as it was

547
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:25,550
reported, meaning that everybody
on the island had on average, uh,

548
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,260
malaria at least three times so that the
casualty rates here caused them to have

549
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,440
to move troops in and out of the island
much more rapidly than they normally

550
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:34,274
would have.

551
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,200
The development of the chlorine industry,
uh,

552
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,270
is a very important part of this story
because chlorine is a key component of

553
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,650
many pesticides that were developed
in the 1940s, uh, including DDT.

554
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,240
A chlorinated hydrocarbons,
uh, include, uh,

555
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:58,250
Alderman Dieldrin have to Clore
chlordane, uh, chemicals. Uh,

556
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,010
curiously the became the target of the
environmental protection agency as soon

557
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,610
as it was formed in the
1970s. And why is that? Well,

558
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:10,611
because all of the properties that
made strontium 90 a dangerous compound,

559
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,260
it persisted.

560
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,950
It moved widely through the environment.

561
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,660
It will contaminate virtually
every compartment, uh,

562
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,020
and it would build up in food chains,
marine food chains, as well as, as a, uh,

563
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,350
an ecosystems, uh, in
terrestrial ecosystems.

564
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,210
It would get in people's bodies and it
will be transmitted via breastmilk across

565
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:37,890
generations. So the search was on, uh,

566
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,300
during this explosion in the
chemical industry in the 1940s, uh,

567
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:46,830
for a variety of new chemicals that
would replace the older metals like Paris

568
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,980
Green. Uh, in the previous shot here,

569
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,420
this gentleman is mixing Paris Green,
which is arsenic.

570
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,620
He's mixing it by hand and he's just
basically just throwing it out across a

571
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:58,940
stream so that the,

572
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:02,130
the heavy metals used earlier in the
century were replaced by the chlorinated

573
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:02,964
hydrocarbons.

574
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,780
And gradually they figured out that
a DDT in particular was exceptionally

575
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:13,290
effective at controlling the Paris, the
insects that would transmit the parasite,

576
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,270
uh, that, uh, uh, is malaria
that causes malaria. Uh,

577
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,890
so this was first tried a, as refugees
moved through Europe during World War II.

578
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,780
And here's an example of taking basically
a variant on a bicycle pump and taking

579
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:31,220
a hose. And, and uh, the
drill that was followed was a,

580
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,770
there was one shot down the
back of the neck. There was
one shot, uh, down, uh, the,

581
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,200
the, the waistband and then up into the
lower part of the shirt, front and back,

582
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,330
and then up both of the pant legs.

583
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,750
So that tens of thousands of
people were lined up in Rome,

584
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,780
walking through these stations as people
that were, were sanitation workers, then,

585
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,120
uh, would basically man these pumps in
spray people. This, this attempt, uh,

586
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,450
brought the typhus epidemic,
uh, that is transmitted by,

587
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,470
by fleas to a close,
uh,

588
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,640
extremely rapidly within a matter of a
couple of weeks when it was anticipated

589
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:08,790
to, to go on for, for
months, if not years.

590
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,750
Another example of a child
at the time being sprayed.

591
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,260
So gradually, uh, they recognize the DDT
would kill so many different species, uh,

592
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,820
that it was sprayed across marsh lands
and landscapes and they realized a,

593
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:25,770
at the end of World War II that they
should also release it for agricultural

594
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:28,830
purposes.
So by 1950,

595
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,560
a DDT was being marketed as a,
uh,

596
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,210
an effective way to control pests that
would threatened just about every crop.

597
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:40,540
You could imagine more than
300 different crops. Uh,

598
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,110
critical components of us agriculture,
uh, were recommended to be,

599
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,670
to be treated by, by this single
chemical. So Ddt is good for me. Uh,

600
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,700
there's a little jingle that went
along with this that kids would sing.

601
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,220
There was no understanding of, of
its bioaccumulation capacity. Uh,

602
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:01,030
even though they understood that they
only had to spray it once in an area, uh,

603
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,380
and whereas other compounds,

604
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,900
they would have to kind of come
back and keep on spraying. So, uh,

605
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,560
I'll tell that story in
just a moment. But, uh, uh,

606
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:14,130
here's another example of Jones beach in
New York, uh, where the, the county, uh,

607
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,480
public health department is driving
down the beach. Uh, and, uh,

608
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,900
uh, the sign that is on the side of the
struck this truck, you can't read it,

609
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:27,820
I'm sure, but it's telling it,
it says DDT powerful insecticide,

610
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:32,620
harmless to humans. Very little
understanding of what they were doing.

611
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:37,330
A kids were running down, people eating
their hamburgers. A trucks would come by,

612
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:41,460
kids would be sitting at picnic
tables, the picnic table,
all the food, and, and, uh,

613
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,550
the kids included would be sprayed very
little understanding of kind of the

614
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:50,050
basic ecology of this compound.
So it persists in the soil.

615
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,120
It was later discovered 10 to 35 years and
in the atmosphere, uh, for three years.

616
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,140
And that, just as an aside, uh,

617
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,040
they decided that they were going
to just test the air just by chance.

618
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,160
Somebody said, well, you know, this is
a ridiculous thing to do. Uh, but, uh,

619
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,700
30 meters off the ocean on a freighter,

620
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,980
a halfway between San Francisco and Tokyo,
uh,

621
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:12,880
they took air measurements and found
that a DDT was present in the air in the

622
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:16,720
middle of the Pacific Ocean, and that
there was a latitudinal gradient gradient.

623
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,090
So that as you approach the equator,

624
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:23,440
you would have a higher concentration
of Ddt, uh, then if you moved away.

625
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,940
And why was that?
Well,

626
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:28,570
it's because of the increased number of
pests that you get closer to the equator

627
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:32,980
and tropical parts of the world. Uh, led
those nations to springboard EDT, uh,

628
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,360
both for sanitation, public
health purposes, but also
for crop protection purposes

629
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,950
was also found in human tissues.
Uh,

630
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:45,250
and it probably is still detectable
in your tissue. And in fact,

631
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:49,420
I was looking at the food and Drug
Administration's a records on pesticide

632
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:53,860
residues in the food supply. It's kind
of striking and that, uh, uh, even today,

633
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,910
DDT is, is one of the most detected
chemicals in the u s food supply,

634
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:01,510
particularly in milk products,
uh, at very, very low levels.

635
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,780
But it's a good indicator of the longterm
persistence of this compound and why

636
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:11,200
we need to pay attention to
that. Also, uh, like strontium,

637
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,240
it was detected in breast
milk, uh, meaning that, uh,
if, if you were breastfed, uh,

638
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:21,240
your mom probably had a higher
concentration, uh, then, uh, uh,

639
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,510
you do. But, uh, any body
burden that you've got is
coming from, uh, probably, uh,

640
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,500
just a stores from your, your mom
because it's compound binds to body fat.

641
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:33,280
It's Lipophilic as opposed
to hydrophylic. Uh, and,

642
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,180
and, uh, uh, that's the, uh, that's
the way that a, you'd be exposed.

643
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:41,750
Your grandmother probably hadn't residues
far higher than, uh, than your mother.

644
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,430
But this kind of transgenerational
effect is, is quite curious.

645
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,300
In 1971, uh, the effort
to regulate it was,

646
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,180
was really pioneered
by Vermont of Vermont,

647
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:56,120
passed a law banning
DDT use and the state.

648
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,080
And they had formerly been spraying it
on their force to control for Gypsy Moss,

649
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,071
uh,
that,

650
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:06,071
that was followed in Wisconsin in 1970
by a black man in New York in 1971 by a

651
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:12,950
band. And finally, I'm actually
the British also, uh, decided that,

652
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:16,460
uh, uh, this was not a
problem that uh, uh, the,

653
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,480
the support for agriculture and the
control of public health was so important

654
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,080
that it should be continued to be used.
Whereas the Soviet found that, uh,

655
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:29,360
it was worthy of a band that came
out strongly in favor of a band.

656
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,790
Finally,
in 1972,

657
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,530
I remember EPA was created in 1969.
Uh,

658
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,590
it actually physically came into
being in 1970 [inaudible] 1972,

659
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,590
uh,
William Ruckelshaus,

660
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:46,760
who was the former administrator of
the environmental protection agency,

661
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,750
decided that they should move ahead
because of the effects on wildlife, uh,

662
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,900
but also the, the, uh,
cancer threat to humans, uh,

663
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:58,670
he felt was sinking it significant
enough to justify its regulation.

664
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,430
And I know you can't
read this, but, uh, uh,

665
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:06,290
there's an interesting phrase and this is
on the, uh, uh, in the New York Times, uh,

666
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,400
that, uh, effective
December 31st, 1972, uh,

667
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,890
in the meantime, he explained growers
and cotton, peanuts, soybeans, uh,

668
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,680
the three crops that account for almost
the total domestic use of DDT, uh,

669
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:22,160
will get instructions in the handling
of a substitute pesticide methyl

670
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:26,670
parathyroid on the substitute
is, uh, can't really read, Oh,

671
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,430
is nontoxic. Uh, but unlike DDT, uh,

672
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,790
it degrades quickly, so they're
trading off a persistent chemical,

673
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,000
uh, uh, for one that
degrades quite quickly,

674
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,140
not really understanding what the
longterm effect might be. Curiously, uh,

675
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,400
the company that manufactured the
companies that manufactured DDT, uh,

676
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,460
said to themselves, well, you know,

677
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:53,610
is there a way that we could modify the
chemical structure of the compound a and

678
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:56,470
s sell something that would
be a minor variant? Uh,

679
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,570
and they produced a compound
known as known as Dika fall. Uh,

680
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,460
that was the only a little bit
different. And, uh, low and behold,

681
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:08,540
uh, in all the parts of the country,
uh, where Dika fall was sprayed,

682
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,870
they found similar effects in wildlife,
particularly among a large raptors. Uh,

683
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,520
so in the, in the south west were an
in the south that were cotton is grown.

684
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,080
They found it being, they found Daggerfall
building up just the way DDT had a,

685
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:25,550
so it was Lipophilic, it was
bioaccumulative and, and, uh,

686
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,410
uh, basically, uh, became
equally worrisome to the
environmental protection agency.

687
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,320
So they banned DDT and 82
and [inaudible] 72, uh,

688
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:38,940
they got around to recognizing that,
uh, uh, not only was Dika fall,

689
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,560
uh,
having the same effects,

690
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,630
but it also is contaminated by
DDT at a level of about 15%. Uh,

691
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,830
and that they needed to get that chemical
out of the food plies in and out of

692
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:51,810
the, uh, uh, environment as well.

693
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,000
So it took until 1986 for
them to actually, uh, uh,

694
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,030
move ahead with a regulation and then
to work its way out of production took

695
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,110
until the early 1990s.
So this is the band that wasn't a band,

696
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,550
the band that took effect in [inaudible]
72 that really was not effective until

697
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:13,140
the early 1990s. Now,
if you then jump ahead,

698
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:15,240
fast forward to 1999,
uh,

699
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,770
you'll see that EPA is getting around
to studying methyl [inaudible] on the

700
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:24,690
recommended substitute by
William Ruckelshaus. In 1972,
uh, he decided, oh, well,

701
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,940
in 1999,
uh,

702
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,750
EPA decided this chemical is more
dangerous than we thought. In fact,

703
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,500
[inaudible] is responsible for more farm
worker deaths and poisoning than any

704
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,450
other chemical in history.
Uh,

705
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,070
not only is it a far more
acutely toxic than DDT, but,

706
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,820
uh, it, uh, also persisted
longer than they believed.

707
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,110
So one of the, uh, uh, concerns
that we have today is, you know,

708
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:54,600
what are we going to do with respect
to the persistence of malaria, uh,

709
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,320
but also it's likely migration
into parts of the world, uh,

710
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:03,480
where it had been well controlled. And
if you look at, uh, where malaria, uh,

711
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,670
exists now, you'll see that, that, uh, uh,

712
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,780
malaria is a problem predominantly
in the tropical parts of the world,

713
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:13,200
also the poorest parts of the
world. Uh, and you'll see that, uh,

714
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,640
it's the expected range of malaria,
of,

715
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:20,760
of the different species of mosquitoes
that carry it. Uh, it's widening. It's,

716
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,000
it's widening right now in response to,

717
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,020
to a changing climatic conditions so that
the habitat is becoming more favorable

718
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:32,100
for disease transmission. Now,
the World Health Organization, uh,

719
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:35,410
recognize this and they called
together a group of people that, uh,

720
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,200
were expert in pesticides. And I
worked on pesticides for maybe, uh, uh,

721
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,630
15 years and worked with a group
of about seven other people, uh,

722
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,340
some from African nations to try to
understand how to manage malaria,

723
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:51,450
particularly in Africa,
who had gone along with the bands of EPA.

724
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,140
And most other high income nations in
the world, uh, and had phased it out.

725
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,790
It did not recommend the use of DDT
in any part of the world as of the mid

726
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:00,750
1970s,

727
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,800
but they want it to reconsider
this because it was so
inexpensive and it was so,

728
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,850
it was so effective. Uh, in part
because it was so persistent,

729
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,240
they realized that if it was
sprayed both indoors and outdoors,

730
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,460
it would cause the insects to
evolve resistance strains, uh,

731
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,100
that would be harder and harder
for them to manage. Uh, in fact,

732
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,040
many mosquitoes have developed
a resistance to, to, uh,

733
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,420
a DVT so that they sprayed it
on a wall inside a house. Uh,

734
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,180
the Anopheles mosquito would land
on the wall, but it could sense it,

735
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,870
it through its feet, uh, and it
would take off and that's it.

736
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:39,640
So it's a new behavioral response that
prevented it from absorbing a lethal dose.

737
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,120
So gradually the World
Health Organization, uh,

738
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,820
became concerned about increasing
incidents of malaria, uh,

739
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,550
particularly in Africa,
uh,

740
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:54,130
and convene this group to try to figure
out whether or not it made sense, uh, to,

741
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,690
to get behind a DDT
and, and to, to, uh, uh,

742
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,700
use it again and the next most effective
pesticide cost four times the level of

743
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:07,140
DDT. Uh, so this was a
problem and, uh, the,

744
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:11,700
the aid agencies were not willing to pay
this increased expense, so that, that, uh,

745
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,980
uh, who, uh, finally in 2006, uh,

746
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,620
gave DDT a clean bill of health, so to
speak, even though this group of experts,

747
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,790
uh, that, uh, uh,
convened in, in 2004, uh,

748
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,720
this group found that, well, you know,
using DDT is really not a good idea.

749
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:33,070
You should use a less toxic chemical
and one that has less persistent, uh,

750
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:35,980
that would be equally effective.
Uh, even though it costs more.

751
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:40,840
So it's a matter of finding the money
in order to pay for the chemical that

752
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:43,990
would protect human
health, uh, and, uh, uh,

753
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:47,410
environmental quality at the same time.
It would deal with the malaria problem.

754
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,670
So,
uh,

755
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,480
I'm at time and I'm going to stop there
and we'll come back on Thursday and take

756
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:57,481
a closer look at the variety of laws that
applied to food safety in the nation.

757
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,480
Thank you.
