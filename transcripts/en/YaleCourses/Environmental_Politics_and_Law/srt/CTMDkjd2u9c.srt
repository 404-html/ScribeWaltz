1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,131
All right,

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:02,491
everybody,

3
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:03,324
let's start in.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,240
So the midterms are graded for those of
you that are not doing the paper and uh,

5
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:13,490
you'll receive them back
on Thursday in class.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:14,910
Uh,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,380
and uh,

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,030
people for the most part did quite well.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,980
So it's a good news.

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,920
Today I want to talk about tobacco and
the legal paradigm that surrounds tobacco

11
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,480
because it really provides a,

12
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:26,841
I think,

13
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:30,410
an interesting comparison
to some of the other,

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:30,650
uh,

15
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,300
legal regimes that we've taken a look at,

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,540
uh,

17
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,600
so far in the course,

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,040
including those that surround
air quality pesticides,

19
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,270
atomic weapons testing,

20
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,111
hazardous sites,

21
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:40,130
and plastics.

22
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,720
So how has tobacco,

23
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,050
uh,

24
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,520
managed and what's its history?

25
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,920
And I've come to think about this,

26
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,310
this a history really is a conflict of
perceptions of rights and obligations,

27
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,030
uh,

28
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,870
particularly,

29
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,770
uh,

30
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,560
the right to,

31
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,393
uh,

32
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:56,690
to,

33
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:56,810
uh,

34
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,010
participate in markets.

35
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,491
Uh,

36
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,660
the right to,

37
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,533
uh,

38
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,520
speak freely,

39
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,550
the right to advertise a as opposed to
the right to be free from exposure to

40
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:10,010
chemicals that are recognized
to be quite hazardous.

41
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,340
So all of these cases that we've
looked at so far during the term,

42
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,670
I really have had a raise questions about
a risk and a different approaches to

43
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,204
managing risk.

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,570
What are the different legal strategies
that you might think about to,

45
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,030
uh,

46
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,650
to take on a hazards such as this?

47
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,150
Well,

48
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,030
one is taxes.

49
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,781
Uh,

50
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:31,840
we'll take a look at tax policy and,

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,020
and to how tax policy creates
a dependency relationship,

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,590
uh,

53
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,690
between an industry and governments,

54
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,393
particularly,

55
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,790
particularly at times like
this of a budgetary stress.

56
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,330
We'll take a look also at
a place based restrictions,

57
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,810
uh,

58
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,790
so preventing the sale of,

59
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,820
of certain hazardous commodities in
certain kinds of environments so that,

60
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:55,880
uh,

61
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,031
uh,

62
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:56,310
no,

63
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,470
we can no longer purchase tobacco products
and vending machines in the United

64
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:00,800
States.

65
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,221
Instead,

66
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,710
they have to be purchased
a over the counter,

67
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,251
uh,

68
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,290
by someone who would check identification,

69
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,830
a sales restrictions of different sorts,

70
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:10,880
uh,

71
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,230
advertising restrictions,

72
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,480
a fair warning requirements on,

73
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,010
on tobacco products.

74
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:16,470
Uh,

75
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,900
also compensation.

76
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,411
Uh,

77
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:21,860
how are we going to manage compensation
for those that claim that they've been

78
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:22,910
harmed by the products?

79
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,520
How are we going to
subsidize the industry?

80
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,000
Uh,

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,170
you probably know that,

82
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:27,660
uh,

83
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,040
uh,

84
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,360
many different commodities,

85
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,920
agricultural commodities
received a rather high subsidies.

86
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,671
So,

87
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:34,941
uh,

88
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:35,191
what,

89
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,020
what has been the,

90
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,290
uh,

91
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,720
the relative history of
tobacco subsidies compared to,

92
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,740
to other commodities?

93
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,330
Uh,

94
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,880
how about,

95
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,360
uh,

96
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,970
regulating the chemical
content of tobacco,

97
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,000
uh,

98
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,040
flavoring agents,

99
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,270
coloring agents,

100
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:47,841
uh,

101
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,100
the shape of tobacco?

102
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,800
How about a tobacco products designed,

103
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,413
uh,

104
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:53,901
to,

105
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,734
uh,

106
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:54,890
uh,

107
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,431
soothe?

108
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:57,740
Or how about the regulation
of nicotine itself?

109
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,441
Uh,

110
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,274
known to be,

111
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,190
how about the ban on all tobacco products?

112
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,070
Uh,

113
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,170
has anybody thought about
doing that at any scale?

114
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:08,950
Uh,

115
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,310
well,

116
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,240
many governments have,

117
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,690
have chosen to ban use of tobacco,

118
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,540
tobacco products inside buildings.

119
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,160
So public buildings commonly,

120
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,000
uh,

121
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,780
uh,

122
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,150
now restrict the use of tobacco products.

123
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:22,680
Uh,

124
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,390
also how about socializing the industry?

125
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,940
An idea that a Kessler came up with a,

126
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,960
at the end of his book.

127
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,040
So what's the scale of this
issue in terms of economics?

128
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,860
Uh,

129
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,190
about $50 billion today
in consumer spending,

130
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,690
while in about 15 million people in the
United States smoke approximately 600

131
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,100
billion billion cigarettes each year.

132
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:44,700
Uh,

133
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,260
the overwhelming majority of those,

134
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,590
uh,

135
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,580
cigarettes by the way,

136
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:48,120
are,

137
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,510
are a lit and smoked indoors
so that this is very much a,

138
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,010
an indoor air quality issue,

139
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,920
uh,

140
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,650
about 4 billion cigars or smoked also for
40 million pounds of tobacco or burned

141
00:03:58,651 --> 00:03:59,550
indoors every year.

142
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,280
How about tobacco related illnesses?

143
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,320
He's very little debate
about this compared to the
other types of problems that

144
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,260
we've looked at that are
managed by environmental law,

145
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,730
including pesticides,

146
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,140
including air pollutants and drinking
water contaminants managed by the safe

147
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:20,960
drinking water act or chemicals that are
migrating from hazardous waste sites or

148
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,320
the quality of the scientific evidence
about the effect of tobacco and human

149
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,540
health is really the gold standard.

150
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,490
It's similar in quality to,

151
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,450
uh,

152
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,980
our understanding of the role that
radiation plays in inducing cancer.

153
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,940
Uh,

154
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,020
there are also about
470,000 different suppliers,

155
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:43,800
wholesalers and retailers that are
highly dependent upon this industry.

156
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,040
So this is a recipe for
a enormous conflict,

157
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,561
uh,

158
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:52,530
in Washington about how to
use the different strategies
that I just went over.

159
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,350
All,

160
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,810
Huh.

161
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,890
So the way that the laws have
evolved in the U s was laid out,

162
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
I think fairly well and Kessler's book.

163
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,231
Uh,

164
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:02,780
but the,

165
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,051
the,

166
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:03,580
uh,

167
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,250
strategies that the
government has relied on,

168
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,320
now I have included hazard warnings,

169
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:12,100
predominantly a control
over advertising claims and,

170
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,190
uh,

171
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,140
the use of specific media outlets,

172
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,220
uh,

173
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,240
age restrictions.

174
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,171
So that a,

175
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,580
within United States right now,

176
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,030
the,

177
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,301
the,

178
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:19,540
uh,

179
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,780
uh,

180
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,100
use of tobacco products,

181
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:26,101
the sale of tobacco products is restricted
to those that are 18 years and older.

182
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,660
Although there are some
states in some counties that,

183
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,160
uh,

184
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,321
uh,

185
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,960
now demand that you
need to be 19 years old,

186
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,821
for example,

187
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:34,990
in Nassau County and
Suffolk County in New York,

188
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,910
a demand that you'd be 19 years old.

189
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,420
Well,

190
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,650
if you look around the world too,

191
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,350
there's quite a bit of
variability in some of the,

192
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:41,651
the,

193
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:41,800
uh,

194
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,030
poor nations of the world.

195
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,560
All you need to be 10 years old.

196
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,521
I in France,

197
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,960
you need to be 16 years old.

198
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,441
Uh,

199
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,090
in Japan you need to be 20 years old.

200
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,730
So the idea of age based a restriction is,

201
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,760
is really quite variable across
different jurisdictional boundaries.

202
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,720
Uh,

203
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
restricting access,

204
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,800
uh,

205
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
making certain that a,

206
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,960
you can't just walk up to
a machine and put your,

207
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:02,501
your,

208
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:02,910
uh,

209
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,140
uh,

210
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,610
now seven or $8 into it to,

211
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:05,780
uh,

212
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,520
to get your,

213
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,910
your pack of cigarettes out,

214
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,410
the removal of subsidies,

215
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:09,801
uh,

216
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,850
but not prohibition.

217
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,060
So the Congress considered
a variety of strategies,

218
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,340
but they always backed off of prohibition.

219
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,160
How about industry strategies to
maintain their share of the marketplace?

220
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,203
What have they done?

221
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,230
Well,

222
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,350
one of the first things that
they did was to focus the issue.

223
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,660
Could focus government's
attention on labeling.

224
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,300
And as with the pesticide labeling and
labeling of pharmaceuticals and food

225
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,030
products,

226
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,410
uh,

227
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,171
labeling is a,

228
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:40,340
is a problematic form of
conveying a sense of risk.

229
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,970
Uh,

230
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,710
this is especially different,

231
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:42,891
uh,

232
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:43,161
than,

233
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:44,240
than pesticides or,

234
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:44,871
or,

235
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,050
uh,

236
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,883
some drugs,

237
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,191
uh,

238
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:46,641
in that,

239
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:46,731
uh,

240
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:46,930
the,

241
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,070
the product itself is addictive.

242
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,210
It's addictive.

243
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,480
Uh,

244
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
predominantly because of,

245
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,910
of the nicotine content,

246
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,320
uh,

247
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,540
they industry also fought,

248
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,230
uh,

249
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,690
to confuse the evidentiary
base on health effects.

250
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,400
So just like a nuclear weapons and just
like pesticides and pharmaceuticals.

251
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:04,800
Uh,

252
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,900
the knowledge about the danger grew
from the industry research itself.

253
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,240
So the American Tobacco Ends Institute,

254
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,141
uh,

255
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:12,974
for example,

256
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,341
uh,

257
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:17,420
might be thought of similarly to the
atomic energy commission or to the

258
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:21,560
pesticide companies that conducted
their own analyses of data so that they

259
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:25,100
became the source of data to
demonstrate the absence of,

260
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,010
have a clear understanding about,

261
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,640
uh,

262
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,780
adverse health effects.

263
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,580
Also in advertising.

264
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:31,770
You know,

265
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:31,960
they,

266
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,530
they really took a very bold moves and
I'll go through a variety of different

267
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,240
advertising strategies today with you,

268
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,870
uh,

269
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,600
to,

270
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,750
uh,

271
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,730
associate tobacco use
with the ideas of freedom,

272
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,390
uh,

273
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,470
values of nature.

274
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:45,741
Uh,

275
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,990
also sociability and sexuality.

276
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,180
So the imagery is very important.

277
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:53,150
It's extremely important
and also quite persuasive,

278
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:53,730
uh,

279
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,590
to the very young,

280
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,440
they focused on the costs of regulations,

281
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:57,951
uh,

282
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,480
not the costs of health care.

283
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,610
And it's quite interesting to think about,

284
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,120
uh,

285
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,600
uh,

286
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,640
the sea change that
occurred as a result of,

287
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:09,641
of litigation in Florida against tobacco
companies that resulted in a settlement

288
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,331
so that,

289
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:11,690
uh,

290
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,290
uh,

291
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,900
many attorneys general in the
United States banded together.

292
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,590
Uh,

293
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:15,981
and,

294
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:16,310
uh,

295
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,310
we're able to reach a settlement for
approximately $250 billion to be paid out

296
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:25,130
by the tobacco companies to
different states here by year.

297
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,870
A study at Yale,

298
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,110
uh,

299
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,070
just a couple of years ago demonstrated
by the way that the money that came into

300
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,040
Connecticut did not go
into educational funds,

301
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,490
uh,

302
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:34,821
that,

303
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:35,180
uh,

304
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,050
educational programs to
prevent tobacco use or to,

305
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,011
to,

306
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:40,520
uh,

307
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,090
uh,

308
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,390
uh,

309
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,470
increase the,

310
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:42,621
uh,

311
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:42,821
the,

312
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:43,654
the rate of,

313
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,221
of,

314
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:44,420
uh,

315
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,620
quitting of tobacco use,

316
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,220
uh,

317
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,520
instead it was diverted into a
variety of other state needs.

318
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,560
So the,

319
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:51,681
uh,

320
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,610
this balancing of,

321
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,080
of costs of regulation,

322
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,560
uh,

323
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,930
as opposed to the benefits of the
product has been central in their,

324
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,130
in their logic.

325
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,181
Also,

326
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,350
the idea of preemption,

327
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,010
uh,

328
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,460
just as pesticides are preempted
a so that they can't be,

329
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,530
they can't be regulated differently.

330
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,870
The labeling can't vary
from state to state.

331
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,860
Uh,

332
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,611
so that,

333
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:11,731
uh,

334
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,770
the tobacco companies went to the federal
government and were successful and I'm

335
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,670
preempting state and local regulation,

336
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,240
uh,

337
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,820
regarding both labeling
and tort litigation.

338
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,370
So preemption basically prevents this
patchwork quilt of regulations from,

339
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,061
from,

340
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:27,894
uh,

341
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,903
uh,

342
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,130
uh,

343
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,510
being imposed on the industry.

344
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,130
If you look at the variability
of taxation by state,

345
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,000
it's also quite,

346
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,330
uh,

347
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,163
quite curious.

348
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,940
So that in the state of Rhode Island,

349
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:39,511
uh,

350
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:39,930
the,

351
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,360
uh,

352
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,910
tax state tax is about
$2 and 46 cents per pack.

353
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,540
Uh,

354
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,810
whereas the state of Kentucky,

355
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:49,380
you was down to 3 cents per packer
and this is several years ago.

356
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,620
So states have the authority to
set taxes at different levels,

357
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,550
uh,

358
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,730
to give you a sense of the magnitude
of importance to a state's budget.

359
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,290
Uh,

360
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,960
the,

361
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,140
uh,

362
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,140
sales tax represents if a California
increase the sales tax by only 50 cents a,

363
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,410
it would raise nearly a half a billion
dollars per year if New York or increase

364
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:10,490
their taxes by about 50 cents a,

365
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,300
they would increase their income,

366
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,880
their revenue by about a
third of $1 billion per year.

367
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
So that states have become quite highly
reliant upon the sales taxes as a,

368
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,270
uh,

369
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,700
important for hormone of income.

370
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,471
How about,

371
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,130
uh,

372
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,340
some of the statistics about
smoking prevalence in education.

373
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,181
So,

374
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,740
as I said at the beginning of the lecture,

375
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:33,600
about 50 million people out of a little,

376
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,560
over a few,

377
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:37,740
over a 300 million people
in the United States smoke.

378
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,700
Uh,

379
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,421
but what about,

380
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:39,810
uh,

381
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,090
uh,

382
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,280
their level of education?

383
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,840
And what you see is that,

384
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,261
that,

385
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:43,950
uh,

386
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,610
uh,

387
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,690
current smokers,

388
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,410
uh,

389
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,750
the,

390
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,190
uh,

391
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,580
uh,

392
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,350
tend to decline as a percentage,

393
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,130
uh,

394
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,930
with education less than high school.

395
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,310
Uh,

396
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,143
you see here,

397
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,040
uh,

398
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,370
the current smoker smoking rate
is much higher than it is a,

399
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,390
for those that have university education,

400
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,020
so that those who understand the health
effects are less likely to adopt,

401
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,470
uh,

402
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,730
uh,

403
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,250
tobacco use and they're more
likely to consider quitting.

404
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,200
So to give you a sense,

405
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,600
also,

406
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,620
the magnitude of,

407
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:17,910
of tax revenue across
some of the larger states.

408
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,541
Uh,

409
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:18,811
the,

410
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:23,811
the u s income is now over a
well over $10 billion per year,

411
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,720
uh,

412
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,051
that,

413
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:25,540
uh,

414
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,373
states enjoy.

415
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,873
Uh,

416
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,250
tobacco also has been a
target for a subsidy removal.

417
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,500
So compared to corn as an example,

418
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,190
uh,

419
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,350
corn and joys about a one and a half,

420
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,700
$1 billion,

421
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,353
uh,

422
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,100
uh,

423
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,710
subsidy or did and 19 and 2004,

424
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,570
or as tobacco subsidies are,

425
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,470
uh,

426
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,610
less than a billion dollars.

427
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:48,444
Today,

428
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,250
advertising is a very important component
of the cigarette companies budgets,

429
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,010
uh,

430
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,930
so that they are spending today close
to 20 a $22 billion on advertising and

431
00:11:58,931 --> 00:11:59,980
promotional expenses.

432
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,790
Uh,

433
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,421
and this amount of,

434
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,740
to about $53 for every
person in the United States.

435
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,410
Uh,

436
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,580
this is a 22% increase
over over previous years.

437
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,270
So what you find is as,

438
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:12,430
as the market goes down,

439
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,350
as he adoption rate among the young
go down or they will vary there,

440
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,243
they're targeting,

441
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,300
uh,

442
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,590
of,

443
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,900
of advertising,

444
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,680
uh,

445
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,011
by,

446
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:21,310
uh,

447
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,941
by gender,

448
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,230
by a ethnic group,

449
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,040
uh,

450
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,180
as well as by age.

451
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,860
So that expenditures for advertising
have increased in response to increasing

452
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,480
regulation in these declining,

453
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:31,991
uh,

454
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:32,830
adoption rates.

455
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,500
Targeting children
through advertising is a,

456
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:35,720
a,

457
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,300
an important thing to consider.

458
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:37,540
And,

459
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,811
and,

460
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,020
uh,

461
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,980
kind of curiously,

462
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,200
children played an important
role in and the evolution of,

463
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:42,730
uh,

464
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,460
prohibited policy with
respect to nuclear weapons.

465
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,060
Uh,

466
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,640
they played an important
role in the control of led.

467
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,960
They played a really important role in
the adoption of the tougher a particulate

468
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:53,800
matter standards,

469
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,430
uh,

470
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,470
for pesticide,

471
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:55,750
uh,

472
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,583
restrictions.

473
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,610
So that Ms. Case,

474
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:01,200
a recognition that children
are especially susceptible to,

475
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,950
to,

476
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,320
uh,

477
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,880
persuasion by advertising,

478
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,083
uh,

479
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,120
has similarly led to two recent,

480
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,520
uh,

481
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,353
uh,

482
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,390
more restrictive legislation.

483
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,390
So Joe Camel provides a,

484
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:13,471
a,

485
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:14,950
a pretty interesting example.

486
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,610
This a series ran between a 1988 and
1997 and about 3000 new smokers less than

487
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:23,560
18 years.

488
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,280
Uh,

489
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,790
we're,

490
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,570
we're picked up,

491
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:25,810
uh,

492
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,390
per day and about a third of these people,

493
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,700
if they persist in their habit,

494
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,950
I will die of tobacco related illness.

495
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,151
The,

496
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:34,620
uh,

497
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,200
appeals,

498
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,620
uh,

499
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:35,870
uh,

500
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,320
are,

501
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,900
are well known to everybody.

502
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,290
Uh,

503
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,520
here you see Joe Camel,

504
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:40,090
uh,

505
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,331
uh,

506
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:40,850
with a,

507
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,350
uh,

508
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,921
a woman,

509
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,570
a cracked of woman in the background.

510
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,530
Uh,

511
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,970
the images a tough,

512
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,180
uh,

513
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,310
the image a is one of a fighter pilot.

514
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,030
Uh,

515
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,920
and there he is smoking his cigarette.

516
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,850
The idea of this series was,

517
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,520
was modeled after a television
show called Miami Vice,

518
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,540
uh,

519
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,300
really modeled after James
Bond and Don Johnson,

520
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:01,941
uh,

521
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,010
in one study showed that
nearly a third of all,

522
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,660
all three year olds a match the
character to the cigarette brand.

523
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,450
And amongst six year Joe camel was
his fee as a familiar as Mickey mouse.

524
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,411
So,

525
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:14,591
uh,

526
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,080
within a matter of three years,

527
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,980
Joe increased camels market
share from one to 33%.

528
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,810
And in a less than 18 year old range,

529
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,310
a sales increased during that three
year period by $500 million per year.

530
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,540
And this is believe now to be one of the
most successful advertising campaigns

531
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,374
in history.

532
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,521
I think about,

533
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:33,850
uh,

534
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,081
the,

535
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,320
the imagery as well.

536
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,351
So,

537
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:36,520
uh,

538
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,520
here on the left hand slide you see a
woman having a presumably just reached a

539
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,610
mountain peak and,

540
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,080
uh,

541
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,420
uh,

542
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,850
then reached into your
pocket for a lucky strike.

543
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:46,720
Uh,

544
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,610
the Marlboro man,

545
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:50,950
also the image of masculinity,

546
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,390
a horse having just roped the steer,

547
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,290
uh,

548
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,120
and also,

549
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,670
uh,

550
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,370
uh,

551
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,460
a key symbol for the corporation.

552
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,140
Looking back in history,

553
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,420
you can see also the appeal to women,

554
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,240
particularly as a weight control strategy.

555
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,130
So to keep a slender figure,

556
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,330
no one can die,

557
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,501
can deny.

558
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,300
It's a why as to reach for a lucky,

559
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,320
uh,

560
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,730
and also the appeal to,

561
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:14,170
uh,

562
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:14,450
uh,

563
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,440
keeping mom on a,

564
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,520
on a steady course.

565
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,121
So,

566
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:17,390
uh,

567
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,710
here you have a child in the add,

568
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,370
uh,

569
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,330
before you scold me,

570
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,164
mom,

571
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,770
maybe you better light up
a Marlboro a and g Mama.

572
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:26,150
You sure enjoy your Marlboro.

573
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,871
So things are,

574
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:28,340
things seem happier in the family.

575
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,230
So somebody is cranky,

576
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,600
uh,

577
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,890
uh,

578
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,571
associate,

579
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,050
uh,

580
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,180
uh,

581
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,230
the use of tobacco,

582
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:33,740
uh,

583
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,573
with a mood swing,

584
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,140
a physicians were enlisted to
support advertising as well.

585
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,650
Uh,

586
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,130
so here you see some ads
from the 1930s and 1940s.

587
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,790
Uh,

588
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:43,970
it's,

589
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,830
it's actually interesting
that you can go back through,

590
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:46,280
uh,

591
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,460
uh,

592
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,791
the,

593
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:51,650
these old volumes of life magazine or
a national geographic or time magazine

594
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,120
over in,

595
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,150
in Sterling Library.

596
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,840
And take a look at the patterns
in advertising over time.

597
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,970
So a 20,000,

598
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:03,590
679 physicians say luckies
are less irritating.

599
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:04,424
It's toasted.

600
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,740
More doctors smoke camels
than any other cigarette.

601
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,430
Dennis to also were part
of the advertising game.

602
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,630
And anybody that,

603
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:13,050
uh,

604
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:13,410
uh,

605
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,160
has smoked or no smokers know that
cigarettes generally steam teeth,

606
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,960
especially those without filters.

607
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,580
So the idea that putting a filter on the
end of the tobacco could remove the a,

608
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,670
the dangerous product.

609
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,900
It could remove the,

610
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:24,991
uh,

611
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:25,161
the,

612
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:26,660
the discoloring agents in the,

613
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,494
in the compound.

614
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,190
Uh,

615
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,351
uh,

616
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:29,580
that's an interesting idea.

617
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,210
Santa Claus even got into
the act for awhile while,

618
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,590
so a guard against throat scratch.

619
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:36,590
Uh,

620
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,190
there's also a long history about a
reliance on gender and women have been

621
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:42,360
extensively targeted.

622
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,543
A women,

623
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,810
I tend to have lower
adoption rates than men.

624
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:48,960
Men do a buy four or 5%
in the United States.

625
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,651
Uh,

626
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:50,850
and the,

627
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:51,001
uh,

628
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,490
the dominant marketing
strategy has been one to,

629
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:53,940
uh,

630
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,330
uh,

631
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,520
on themes of both social desirability,

632
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,120
uh,

633
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,020
and independence.

634
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,920
Uh,

635
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,080
and these are normally conveyed by thin,

636
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:02,280
attractive and athletic,

637
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,550
uh,

638
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,383
models.

639
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,730
Uh,

640
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,460
this history goes back quite a ways and
you see it in different parts of the

641
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,300
world as well.

642
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:09,871
Uh,

643
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:10,440
so that,

644
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,830
uh,

645
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,131
uh,

646
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:15,140
the highest estimates for cigarette
smoking among women tend to be in,

647
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:15,631
in the,

648
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:15,900
uh,

649
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,850
southern and tobacco growing states,

650
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,960
such as Kentucky,

651
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:19,530
uh,

652
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,420
where it's about 28.1%,

653
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,470
whereas nationally only
18% of women a smell.

654
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,231
Also,

655
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:28,531
you can,

656
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:28,830
uh,

657
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,970
recognize certain patterns of reliance
of different brands on different types of

658
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:33,800
imagery.

659
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,450
So whereas Marlboro concentrated on,

660
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:36,890
uh,

661
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,170
uh,

662
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,930
kind of a machismo image of masculinity,

663
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,330
I,

664
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,200
Virginia slims instead concentrated
their efforts on women,

665
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,630
always slim women,

666
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,230
uh,

667
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,250
always tough women.

668
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,641
Uh,

669
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:47,911
you know,

670
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:48,031
uh,

671
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,301
yeah,

672
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,830
I got a tattoo and no,

673
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:50,664
you can't see it.

674
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,910
So the image of sexuality
and also strength not
dominated their imagery on the

675
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:01,740
tobacco companies also tried to
influence cultural acceptance of tobacco

676
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:06,741
products by encouraging
actors to smoke on stage,

677
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,580
encouraging producers,

678
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,300
uh,

679
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,650
providing subsidies.

680
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,690
So that tobacco use was noted.

681
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,320
And about 75% of all movies that
will reviewed several years ago,

682
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,360
in 43% of the movies showed scenes in
which tobacco use could be interpreted as

683
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:25,530
attractive a with qualities
described by teenagers as sexy,

684
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:26,340
exciting,

685
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,173
powerful,

686
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:27,751
cool,

687
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:28,531
sophisticated,

688
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:29,161
rebellious,

689
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:29,820
and celebrity.

690
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,653
Celebratory.

691
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,500
And 25% of the movies included some
of the anti tobacco statements.

692
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,100
Uh,

693
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,550
top build actors lit up in
59% of all movies reviewed

694
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,091
another,

695
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:41,250
uh,

696
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,260
example of Virginia Slims Advertising,

697
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,170
riding a motorcycle,

698
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:46,630
uh,

699
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,760
the idea that you would,

700
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,300
uh,

701
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,380
take on risks,

702
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:49,980
uh,

703
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,791
not only writing them,

704
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,840
so motorcycle,

705
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,350
uh,

706
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,120
but also riding without a helmet.

707
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,010
So that,

708
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,130
uh,

709
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,390
the,

710
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,191
the idea that,

711
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:56,491
that,

712
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,060
uh,

713
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,560
uh,

714
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,350
you're tough,

715
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,591
uh,

716
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:58,951
you're,

717
00:18:58,951 --> 00:18:59,790
you're attractive,

718
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,973
you're slim.

719
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,270
Uh,

720
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,340
these are all images that,

721
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,060
uh,

722
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,450
uh,

723
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,450
are very strategically
designed to encourage adoption
rates in different parts

724
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:08,911
of the world.

725
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:12,720
You find a different ethnic groups being
targeted using a variety of different

726
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:13,554
strategies.

727
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,800
So a Virginia slims also tried to create
the idea that that independence and

728
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,870
cultural pride are linked to tobacco use.

729
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,651
Uh,

730
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:23,161
so that,

731
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:23,311
uh,

732
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:25,170
there's a terrific amount of variability.

733
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,780
Also the promotion of
different kinds of events.

734
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,240
Uh,

735
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,990
when I was a kid and
we'd go to rock concerts,

736
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,500
uh,

737
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,450
people would commonly be there with,

738
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,010
uh,

739
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,150
uh,

740
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,160
these big trays,

741
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,540
a haul over their shoulders,

742
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,111
uh,

743
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,870
with sample size tobacco packages,

744
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:40,530
four or five,

745
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,010
uh,

746
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,071
uh,

747
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:42,090
cigarettes and a carton.

748
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,700
And they were given out
freely and some bars,

749
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,170
the promotional activities,

750
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,740
uh,

751
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:46,951
uh,

752
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:47,784
also,

753
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,030
uh,

754
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,800
freely distributed tobacco products.

755
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,761
In this case,

756
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:50,911
you,

757
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,361
you a,

758
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:54,390
you probably recognize that or knew that,

759
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,080
uh,

760
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,740
different kinds of races and athletic
events were sponsored by different groups.

761
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,761
Virginia slims,

762
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:00,331
for example,

763
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,164
was,

764
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,810
was quite active in
promoting tennis tournaments.

765
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,520
Uh,

766
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:04,761
the,

767
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:07,920
the Virginia Slims and invitation
was an example of that.

768
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,780
A NASCAR racing was,

769
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:10,080
uh,

770
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,180
promoted by a lucky strike,

771
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,220
the moral borrow 500,

772
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:14,851
uh,

773
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,200
as another stock car race.

774
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,371
My Dad,

775
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:18,960
when he was in World War II,

776
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,440
uh,

777
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,273
he would,

778
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:20,850
uh,

779
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,290
he will,

780
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:21,570
uh,

781
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,321
after he came back,

782
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,880
he always told stories about his,

783
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:24,410
uh,

784
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:24,720
uh,

785
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,990
k ration kit so that they
were given a k rations,

786
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:29,730
which often included spam.

787
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,391
Uh,

788
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:30,661
but,

789
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:30,811
uh,

790
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:31,960
also peanuts and,

791
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,341
and,

792
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:32,910
uh,

793
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,360
uh,

794
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,290
chocolate bars.

795
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,650
And he would tell about always having
the cigarette pack a freely available to

796
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:40,920
all of the Gis.

797
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,140
What a brilliant advertising technique.

798
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,710
Uh,

799
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,440
recognizing the addictive
power of tobacco,

800
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,730
how few cigarettes it really takes to,

801
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,121
to,

802
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:49,600
uh,

803
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,830
cause a physical addiction,

804
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,381
uh,

805
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:53,710
and putting them into every k ration,

806
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,460
uh,

807
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,820
virtually ensuring that you
would have a high addiction rate,

808
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,180
uh,

809
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,410
for among the Gis.

810
00:20:59,700 --> 00:20:59,890
Uh,

811
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,760
once the millions of soldiers
came back to the u s today,

812
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,300
if you look on the Internet,

813
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,440
you'll find a variety of
different advertising schemes
in different parts of the

814
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,274
world.

815
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,263
Uh,

816
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,600
Rjr stir the census campaign is,

817
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:13,510
is a good example.

818
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,980
And some of them include a
product auctions and encourage
you to become a member

819
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:22,981
so that they can advertise and provide
you with the information about different

820
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:24,180
kinds of,

821
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,620
of,

822
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,450
of discounts on products as well
as to promote their products.

823
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:29,381
Now,

824
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,140
different countries to have taken
different approaches to labeling.

825
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:32,891
And,

826
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,010
uh,

827
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,341
you know,

828
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:37,480
that I'm not a great fan of labeling as
a way of conveying knowledge about risk.

829
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,010
And I don't think that it really,

830
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:39,250
uh,

831
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,720
often helps a consumer to understand the,

832
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:43,090
uh,

833
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,600
uh,

834
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,460
the true benefits as opposed to the,

835
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:45,581
uh,

836
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,740
the adverse effects
associated with products.

837
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,220
But the Canadians have taken a tougher
stance than we have in the United States.

838
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:51,711
No.

839
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:52,270
In the US,

840
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,570
you know that we have these little
boxes on the sides of the packets or

841
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:57,130
sometimes on the backs of the packets.

842
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,610
Uh,

843
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,241
that may say,

844
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:58,631
warning,

845
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:02,980
this product is known to cause cancer
where this product is dangerous to your

846
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:07,870
health or this product to it causes
emphysema or exacerbates asthma.

847
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,121
So that,

848
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:09,220
uh,

849
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,570
there are a variety of different signal
phrases that are required to be cycled

850
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:15,700
through on the sides of tobacco products.

851
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,390
Uh,

852
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,260
Canada has a system where that whereby
they demand that the front of the

853
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:21,094
package,

854
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,520
uh,

855
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,090
include photographs of,

856
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,490
of a health loss.

857
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,690
So here's an example of what a heart
looks like after it's had an attack.

858
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,110
Uh,

859
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,980
the darker area,

860
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,814
for example,

861
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,780
in,

862
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,613
in this photo,

863
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,161
uh,

864
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:33,910
another,

865
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,151
uh,

866
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:36,160
example cigarettes cause lung cancer.

867
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,220
So someone on a heart lung
machine on lying in a hospital,

868
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:39,950
uh,

869
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,200
cigarettes hurt babies.

870
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,800
Uh,

871
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,680
so that doesn't appeal to
a protection of the unborn,

872
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,521
uh,

873
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:45,821
and,

874
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:46,091
uh,

875
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:49,660
of children getting people to think more
carefully about what they're doing to

876
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,494
their young.

877
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,570
And something that might wake up,

878
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:52,871
uh,

879
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,704
teenagers,

880
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,070
uh,

881
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,840
tobacco use to can make you input.

882
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,820
It can make you impotent.

883
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:58,391
Uh,

884
00:22:58,391 --> 00:22:59,590
that's news to many people.

885
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,530
Uh,

886
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,810
there are also prevalence
rates that varied by ethnicity.

887
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,390
Uh,

888
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,970
so that American Indians
and Alaska natives,

889
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:07,804
for example,

890
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,260
uh,

891
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:08,860
have,

892
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,041
uh,

893
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:12,400
adoption and prevalence
rates are far higher than,

894
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,100
than we haven't in
other ethnic minorities.

895
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,061
Uh,

896
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,751
and also,

897
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:17,230
uh,

898
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,650
uh,

899
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,000
Asians have one of the lowest adoption
and addiction rates in the nation.

900
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,270
Most smokers begin his teens.

901
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:25,931
And,

902
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:26,081
uh,

903
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:26,580
this is,

904
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,830
uh,

905
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,910
quite interesting to me.

906
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,310
Uh,

907
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,141
when I saw this,

908
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,970
a David Kessler showed this slide to me,

909
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,700
I'm going to show a series
of slides that he provided a,

910
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,330
uh,

911
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,920
when he used to lecture in this course.

912
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,971
And you see that,

913
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:37,510
uh,

914
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,960
uh,

915
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,050
the adoption rates begin
at a very young age,

916
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,521
uh,

917
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:44,680
so that the up to 12 13% occur,

918
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,110
uh,

919
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,790
beneath the age of 12,

920
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,110
uh,

921
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,120
beneath the age of 15.

922
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,320
You see,

923
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,561
you know,

924
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,180
roughly a 25,

925
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:53,571
50,

926
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:55,070
maybe about 50%,

927
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:55,620
uh,

928
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,500
of the age of,

929
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,030
uh,

930
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,370
uh,

931
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,203
adoption.

932
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,163
So that uh,

933
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,460
the target,

934
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:01,791
uh,

935
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,450
of,

936
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,450
of a youth has become a very important
aspect of advertising campaigns among the

937
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,870
tobacco companies.

938
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,641
In fact,

939
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,920
a RJ Reynolds in 1984,

940
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,640
uh,

941
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,201
stated,

942
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:14,560
uh,

943
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,230
that young smokers had been the critical
factor in the growth and decline of

944
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:21,440
every major brand and company
over the last 50 years.

945
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,830
So if you can addict a single
individual who is 50 years old,

946
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,350
uh,

947
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,670
you will have a much lower rate of return
than you would if you could addict to

948
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,600
a 15 year old.

949
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,360
Another a comment by on
Rj Reynolds executive.

950
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,351
Realistically,

951
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:42,110
if our company is to survive
and prosper over the long term,

952
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,360
we must get our share of the youth market

953
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,840
and speaking again,

954
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,200
the executives says evidence
is now available to indicate
that 14 to 18 year old

955
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:56,660
group a is an increasing segment
of the smoking population.

956
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,120
Rj Rm as soon establishes a
successful new brand in this market.

957
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:05,450
If our position in the industry has
to be maintained over the long run,

958
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,720
if we were to attract a
nonsmoker or pre smoker,

959
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,470
there is nothing in this type of product
that he would currently understand or

960
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,304
desire.

961
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,701
Instead,

962
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:18,260
we somehow must convince him with wholly
irrational reasons that he should try

963
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,094
smoking.

964
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,510
Very interesting idea.

965
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,130
So here you have a product,

966
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,700
uh,

967
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,001
that,

968
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:23,211
uh,

969
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:23,511
you know,

970
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:27,590
would be a disgusting to too many
people that had never tried it.

971
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,110
I remember when I smoked
my first cigarette,

972
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,820
I just coughed and spluttered my eyes
watered a hated the taste and I hated the

973
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,110
smell that I carried around.

974
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,363
And,

975
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,170
and,

976
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:38,840
uh,

977
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,320
uh,

978
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,801
so that,

979
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:39,951
uh,

980
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:40,291
this is,

981
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:40,610
well,

982
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:40,950
this was,

983
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,320
were recognized by the industry that they
needed to create a other factors that

984
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:46,600
would encourage people to,

985
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,140
to adopt the,

986
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:48,861
how about the,

987
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:49,160
uh,

988
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,470
the legal framework that,

989
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:50,850
that,

990
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,130
uh,

991
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,400
this sits within?

992
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,500
Well,

993
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,360
the surgeon general's report that
was released in 1964 was the first,

994
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,080
uh,

995
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,890
thorough and,

996
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,300
and,

997
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,830
uh,

998
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,510
uh,

999
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,100
comprehensive indictment of the effect
of tobacco products on human health,

1000
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:07,790
uh,

1001
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,620
concluding that,

1002
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:08,840
uh,

1003
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,590
it did,

1004
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,860
uh,

1005
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,060
induce lung disease.

1006
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,980
So the Federal Trade Commission,

1007
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,580
uh,

1008
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,580
at that time began to regulate advertising
and it concluded that a cigarette ad

1009
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,450
advertising was deceptive,

1010
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:20,970
uh,

1011
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,470
that advertisers had a responsibility
to warn the public about the health

1012
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:27,470
hazards of smoking and that
the Federal Trade Commission,

1013
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,500
uh,

1014
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,720
then proposed labeling the amount of
tar and nicotine and include a statement

1015
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:33,590
such as caution,

1016
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,540
cigarette smoking is dangerous to health.

1017
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,600
It may cause death from
cancer or other diseases.

1018
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,940
The idea of preemption,

1019
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,690
uh,

1020
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,780
originated with respect to
tobacco products back in 1965.

1021
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,650
Uh,

1022
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,011
and,

1023
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:47,680
uh,

1024
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,100
it prohibited the Federal Trade Commission
and states and local governments from

1025
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:56,130
acquiring any other label on cigarette
packages in any warnings to cigarette

1026
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,860
advertising at least until 1969.

1027
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,900
There's also the federal communications
commission that plays an important role

1028
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:04,540
here,

1029
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:04,680
uh,

1030
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,510
particularly the fairness doctrine.

1031
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,190
Uh,

1032
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,780
so by 1967 more money
was spent on television,

1033
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,400
uh,

1034
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,650
tobacco advertising than
for any other product.

1035
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,670
Uh,

1036
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,110
and in 1966,

1037
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,490
a citizen John Vans Hoff wrote to CBS
TV in New York and requested that some

1038
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:25,350
other responsible spokesperson
be given a chance,

1039
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:25,860
uh,

1040
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,300
to present contrasting views.

1041
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:29,730
On the issue of the benefits
and advisability of smoking.

1042
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,100
And the FCC responded and
required a significant amount
of time to rebut tobacco

1043
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:35,934
advertising.

1044
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,470
Uh,

1045
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,820
concluding that we hold to the
fairness doctrine is applicable to such

1046
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:40,654
advertisement.

1047
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,710
The fairness doctrine has its origin
in 1949 in a rule that required

1048
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:51,390
broadcasters to devote some
of their airtime to discussing
controversial matters

1049
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,320
of public interest,

1050
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,010
uh,

1051
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,100
and to air contrasting views
regarding those matters.

1052
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,430
In 1969,

1053
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:03,870
the public health cigarette smoking act
was adopted and it demanded a cautionary

1054
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,920
label oh,

1055
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,390
with a key change in the phrase,

1056
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:06,920
uh,

1057
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,440
so that the surgeon general has determined
that cigarette smoking is dangerous

1058
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,274
to your health,

1059
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,080
not may be dangerous to your health.

1060
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,480
It also required a blackout,

1061
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:16,560
a cigarette commercials.

1062
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,070
Uh,

1063
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,070
as of January in 1971 on television and
radio stations estimated a loss of about

1064
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,490
$220 million in revenue.

1065
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,190
So we're a recall that I argued that,

1066
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:29,730
uh,

1067
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,420
this,

1068
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,140
this industry,

1069
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,320
uh,

1070
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,890
creates a very large
revenue base for states.

1071
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,401
Uh,

1072
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:40,200
it also created a terrific revenue
base in terms of advertising for the

1073
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,340
communications industry.

1074
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,210
What this means is that the
industry support was quite
varied and quite wide and

1075
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:49,110
diverse.

1076
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,321
Uh,

1077
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:49,651
that,

1078
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:50,010
uh,

1079
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,670
uh,

1080
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,690
the tobacco industry,

1081
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,333
uh,

1082
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:53,790
was,

1083
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,800
had the capacity to go to Congress and,

1084
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,290
uh,

1085
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,580
uh,

1086
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,510
find allies that would not
be immediately intuitive.

1087
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,020
So about seven and a half percent
of their total advertising revenue,

1088
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,500
uh,

1089
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,930
had been associated with the
tobacco industry at the time.

1090
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,850
So,

1091
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,121
uh,

1092
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:09,810
warnings,

1093
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,490
advertising and age restrictions,

1094
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:11,760
uh,

1095
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,760
between 1965 and 2008 became the key
targets of Congress when they enacted six

1096
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:21,840
different statutes that they
required that all packaging,

1097
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,140
uh,

1098
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,130
have labels on it.

1099
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,170
They required that,

1100
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:24,790
uh,

1101
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:24,990
uh,

1102
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,250
the advertisement of tobacco products
through an electronic communication medium

1103
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,760
would be prohibited by the
Federal Communications Commission.

1104
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,680
We're,

1105
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,980
we're also required a,

1106
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,090
these statutes require the secretary
of Health and human services to report

1107
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:43,390
every three years to Congress on research
findings concerning tobaccos addictive

1108
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:44,224
property.

1109
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,050
Uh,

1110
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,000
kind of curiously,

1111
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:46,181
you know,

1112
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,230
to combat the,

1113
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,810
the origin of the scientific studies,

1114
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:50,400
uh,

1115
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
occurring predominantly
within the industry.

1116
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,810
The National Institute of Health
started funding independent studies.

1117
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:56,520
Uh,

1118
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,070
so that,

1119
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,280
uh,

1120
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,821
just as,

1121
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:01,270
as you find in the
pharmaceutical industry or in,

1122
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,990
uh,

1123
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,411
the,

1124
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:02,920
uh,

1125
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,250
uh,

1126
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,270
pesticide industry,

1127
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:04,870
uh,

1128
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,703
the,

1129
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,940
the conduct of independent science
really became quite important to,

1130
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:10,541
to,

1131
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:10,900
uh,

1132
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,230
uh,

1133
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,760
the government's capacity to,

1134
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,530
to a amount of challenge,

1135
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:16,930
to be evidence that was
presented by the industry itself.

1136
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:18,611
Also,

1137
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:19,391
these statutes,

1138
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:19,810
uh,

1139
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,410
made states the receipt of certain
federal block grants contingent upon their

1140
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:26,200
prohibiting tobacco product manufacturers,

1141
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,130
uh,

1142
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,130
a manufacturer or retailer or
distributor from selling these products,

1143
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,071
uh,

1144
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:34,540
that included not just tobacco,

1145
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,590
not just a cigarettes,

1146
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:36,790
but also cigars and,

1147
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,421
and,

1148
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:37,600
uh,

1149
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,060
chewing tobacco to individuals
under the age of 18.

1150
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,131
So what are the,

1151
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:42,281
uh,

1152
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:44,080
estimated health effects from tobacco,

1153
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:44,950
uh,

1154
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,280
irritation as well recognized
lower respiratory infections,

1155
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:48,860
uh,

1156
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,840
are recognized.

1157
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,540
We're recognized early
reduced lung function,

1158
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,680
increased risk,

1159
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,270
uh,

1160
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,580
uh,

1161
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,413
for asthma,

1162
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,210
an exacerbation of
asthma among those that,

1163
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:58,840
uh,

1164
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,860
had it previously.

1165
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,203
Uh,

1166
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,860
non respiratory cancers,

1167
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,840
early onset of menopause,

1168
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,043
uh,

1169
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,960
also environmental tobacco smoke,

1170
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,003
uh,

1171
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,740
can cause brain tumors
and cervical cancer.

1172
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,720
That's environmental tobacco smoke.

1173
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,180
That's not a smoke that's inhaled by the,

1174
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,601
by,

1175
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,160
uh,

1176
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,620
uh,

1177
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,070
the,

1178
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,431
the,

1179
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:18,760
uh,

1180
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,593
the smoker.

1181
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,840
There are really three different
kinds of smoke a cigarette,

1182
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,590
uh,

1183
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,070
would,

1184
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,903
would produce,

1185
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,110
one is a smoke that's inhaled through
the tobacco itself as it burns.

1186
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,110
The other would be what's
called sidestream smoke.

1187
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,590
That is given off by the
burning tip a of the product.

1188
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,090
And the third would be the smoke.

1189
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:37,924
That's exhale.

1190
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,020
So each is a different
complex of compounds,

1191
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:41,710
uh,

1192
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,620
between three and 4,000
different chemicals.

1193
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,100
Uh,

1194
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,450
so it's really been a,

1195
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,920
a very difficult task.

1196
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:51,430
Understanding which of these chemicals
is responsible for which of these health

1197
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:52,264
effects.

1198
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,451
Uh,

1199
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:53,171
but this is,

1200
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:53,621
it's a,

1201
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,180
an interesting problem.

1202
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:58,060
It's similar in respect
to diesel emissions,

1203
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:00,500
which is also a complex mixed here.

1204
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,270
Uh,

1205
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,100
so that the effect of the mixed year,

1206
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,501
uh,

1207
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:04,870
has been the subject of study,

1208
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,290
uh,

1209
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:06,680
uh,

1210
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,960
as opposed to the analysis of
individual components in the,

1211
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:11,500
uh,

1212
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,333
in the mixture.

1213
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,590
So exposure during pregnancy,

1214
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,760
a harms of fetus,

1215
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,370
uh,

1216
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,880
and synergistic effects exist with radon.

1217
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,311
Uh,

1218
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:22,480
the natural gas that's given
off by a granitic rock,

1219
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:22,880
uh,

1220
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,100
that we have here in Connecticut.

1221
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:24,700
Uh,

1222
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,340
and,

1223
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,480
uh,

1224
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,440
the combination is known
to cause lung cancer.

1225
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,540
Uh,

1226
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,560
environmental tobacco smoke has
increasingly become a target of,

1227
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:35,890
uh,

1228
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,410
regulation and,

1229
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:37,921
and,

1230
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:38,350
uh,

1231
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,010
its relationship to heart disease,

1232
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,440
uh,

1233
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,640
is well supported by about
13 epidemiological studies.

1234
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:43,840
Uh,

1235
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,780
now 14.

1236
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,260
Uh,

1237
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,320
environmental tobacco smoke is
responsible for other kinds of effects,

1238
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:48,780
uh,

1239
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,090
that include heart disease,

1240
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,560
uh,

1241
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,090
impairment of platelet function,

1242
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,280
damage to the inside lining of arteries,

1243
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:55,780
uh,

1244
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,090
interference with oxygen
delivery and used by cells.

1245
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,450
And it can also depress
cellular respiration and
enhance fatty deposits on a

1246
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,740
vessel walls that can,

1247
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:07,100
uh,

1248
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,520
uh,

1249
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,330
exacerbate cardiovascular
and neurological illnesses.

1250
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,130
In 1997,

1251
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:18,131
a Harvard Study of 32,000 nurses was
released and found that the relative risk

1252
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,630
of coronary heart disease,

1253
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:21,770
uh,

1254
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,950
among those that smoke
compared to those that did not,

1255
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:25,701
uh,

1256
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:26,630
it was about two.

1257
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,190
So the two fold increase of risk of
heart disease among those that smoke,

1258
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,000
uh,

1259
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,200
and they attributed a 60,000 additional
deaths each year in the United States,

1260
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:36,770
uh,

1261
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,270
to environmental tobacco smoke.

1262
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,200
So that,

1263
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,600
uh,

1264
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,850
it wasn't until the 19,

1265
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,830
late 1990s at these estimates,

1266
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,310
uh,

1267
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,740
of health loss associated
not from smoking,

1268
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,280
uh,

1269
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,290
but being in an environment
where other smoked,

1270
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:48,950
uh,

1271
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,360
became quite sophisticated.

1272
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,020
20 fold increase in
death from lung cancer,

1273
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,630
uh,

1274
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,810
uh,

1275
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,190
was attributed to environmental
tobacco smoke has stated,

1276
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,860
uh,

1277
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,693
or,

1278
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,100
uh,

1279
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,930
in EPA in 1992 passive smoking report,

1280
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:03,430
uh,

1281
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,590
William Riley was the administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency at

1282
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:07,520
that point in time.

1283
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,151
Uh,

1284
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:08,984
and,

1285
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:09,650
uh,

1286
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,710
he also was a Yale
graduate and a returns to,

1287
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:12,921
you know,

1288
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:13,754
quite often.

1289
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,690
And I spoke to him about his effort
inside the environmental protection agency

1290
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,990
in the early 1990s to have
environmental tobacco spoke,

1291
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,500
uh,

1292
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,730
declared to be a,

1293
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,300
a dangerous substance and
more heavily regulated.

1294
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:26,811
And,

1295
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:27,110
uh,

1296
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,750
he thought that that was one of the
most difficult fights that he had.

1297
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:30,620
His administrator,

1298
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,160
uh,

1299
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,761
during the,

1300
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:32,440
uh,

1301
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,660
uh,

1302
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,800
early 1990s.

1303
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,300
But chemicals found inside tobacco
smoke or all chemicals that,

1304
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:38,730
uh,

1305
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:38,870
uh,

1306
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,110
you recognize as a hazardous substances.

1307
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,220
Carbon monoxide,

1308
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,190
a nicotine carcinogenic tars,

1309
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,350
a ammonia and nitrogen dioxide,

1310
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:49,250
vinyl chloride,

1311
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,211
cyanide,

1312
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:51,860
formaldehyde radionuclides,

1313
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:52,694
benzene,

1314
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,580
nitrosamines [inaudible]
aromatic hydrocarbons.

1315
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,110
Benzo,

1316
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,410
a Piring and arsenic.

1317
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,880
All of these compounds are the target
of regulation under different statutes.

1318
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,800
So it's quite remarkable that,

1319
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:04,370
uh,

1320
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:04,730
uh,

1321
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,250
we've been allowed to,

1322
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,540
to a burn cigarettes
in indoor environments.

1323
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:13,990
So why the Y has a indoor environmental
quality and this problem has escaped the

1324
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:16,880
attention of the environmental
protection agency.

1325
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:21,200
It really has to do with the private
property rights and the perception of,

1326
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,070
of uh,

1327
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,870
being free from government regulation,

1328
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,560
uh,

1329
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,960
inside your own home or
inside your own office.

1330
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,240
But it is quite curious.

1331
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,490
The question about who should pay for
tobacco related illness has prompted a

1332
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:39,491
much more vigorous regulatory action and
really was the basis for it for David

1333
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,690
Kessler is initiative inside the
Food and Drug Administration,

1334
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,260
uh,

1335
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,580
that you read about in his book.

1336
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,450
Question of intent.

1337
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,020
So in 1994 on new law was passed,

1338
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,350
authorizing the state of Florida,

1339
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:54,240
the sue cigarette manufacturers
to recover their medicaid funds,

1340
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,090
used to treat people that had
tobacco related illnesses.

1341
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,920
So states began to recognize that their
expenditures to pay for these illnesses

1342
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,963
were enormous.

1343
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,910
They were in the multiple
billion dollars per year.

1344
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,120
The law was upheld by the
Florida Supreme Court.

1345
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:09,810
Uh,

1346
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,610
and as of 1997,

1347
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:16,590
41 states banded together to sue the
tobacco industry to recover these medicaid

1348
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,424
costs.

1349
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,810
The state settlement,

1350
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:20,430
as I mentioned earlier in the lecture,

1351
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,430
is estimated to be about $250 billion.

1352
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,270
Uh,

1353
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:29,270
additional private litigation has also
gone on in different states against

1354
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:31,200
different corporations.

1355
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:31,920
Uh,

1356
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,280
states have also kind of interestingly
borrowed against their anticipated

1357
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,210
tobacco payments.

1358
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,140
Uh,

1359
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,531
and,

1360
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:37,910
uh,

1361
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,190
uh,

1362
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,950
many believed that states
have become addicted to the,

1363
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:41,071
uh,

1364
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:42,030
the tobacco money,

1365
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:42,570
uh,

1366
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,530
produced as a result.

1367
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,740
So that EPA in 1990,

1368
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,520
uh,

1369
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,520
began attacking a passive smoking as
being causally associated with lung cancer

1370
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,294
in adults.

1371
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,810
Uh,

1372
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,643
and it listed,

1373
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,240
uh,

1374
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,420
environmental tobacco smoke as a
group A or a known human carcinogen.

1375
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,080
Uh,

1376
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,110
you may think this is kind of a
modest difference in classification,

1377
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,621
uh,

1378
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:09,621
but there are relatively few known human
carcinogens that are recognized by the

1379
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,140
National Cancer Institute.

1380
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,580
The Centers for Disease Control,

1381
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,670
the NRA International Agency
for research on cancer,

1382
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,360
uh,

1383
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,740
and the World Health Organization.

1384
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,550
Uh,

1385
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,061
so that,

1386
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:18,151
uh,

1387
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:21,090
the listing of the product
is a known human carcinogen,

1388
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,770
gave the government and increased,

1389
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,300
uh,

1390
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,960
a step that they could,

1391
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,530
uh,

1392
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,530
use to increase debt and powerful lever,

1393
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:30,030
that lever that they could use,

1394
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:30,660
uh,

1395
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,130
to,

1396
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,390
to,

1397
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:31,460
uh,

1398
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,293
step up,

1399
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,140
uh,

1400
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,030
their encouragement to
prohibit tobacco products,

1401
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,450
uh,

1402
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,160
from being used in public buildings.

1403
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,360
EPA estimated in 1992 that as many as
3000 nonsmokers die from lung cancer every

1404
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:45,594
year,

1405
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,000
there are different roles
that the EPA has played.

1406
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,351
And,

1407
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:51,480
uh,

1408
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,070
if EPA has been responsible
for environmental tobacco
smoke or secondhand smoke,

1409
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,610
the FDA has been thought of
as the target for regulation.

1410
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,420
Uh,

1411
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:00,811
and,

1412
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:00,901
uh,

1413
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:02,520
that story is told,

1414
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,001
I think very,

1415
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:04,320
very well by David Kessler.

1416
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,341
So that,

1417
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:05,730
uh,

1418
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,950
FDA's question really surrounded,

1419
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,220
uh,

1420
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,700
two,

1421
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,301
two issues.

1422
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:09,601
One,

1423
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,434
whether or not,

1424
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,160
uh,

1425
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,710
nicotine is considered to be a drug.

1426
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,430
A,

1427
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,680
because under the Food
Drug and Cosmetic Act,

1428
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,520
uh,

1429
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,353
FDA,

1430
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:18,630
uh,

1431
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,160
eventually claimed jurisdiction,

1432
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,490
uh,

1433
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,323
based upon,

1434
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:21,630
uh,

1435
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,020
it's,

1436
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,630
it's finding the f that
nicotine was a drug,

1437
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,440
uh,

1438
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,273
and if so,

1439
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,461
uh,

1440
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:29,430
than it needed to receive a license,

1441
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:29,790
uh,

1442
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,470
from the food and Drug Administration.

1443
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,940
And the second question is,

1444
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,600
uh,

1445
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:33,811
uh,

1446
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,400
under the statute is a cigarette itself,

1447
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:36,861
uh,

1448
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:37,780
or a cigar,

1449
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,940
a drug delivery device for the drug.

1450
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:40,871
And if he asks,

1451
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:44,230
it should be regulated in possibly
prohibited under the statute.

1452
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,320
So this question about,

1453
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,470
uh,

1454
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,330
addiction is quite interesting.

1455
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,763
So if you look at,

1456
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,310
uh,

1457
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:56,310
a sales way to nicotine and tar levels
and smoke a pack as early as 1982,

1458
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,371
uh,

1459
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:58,150
you found that,

1460
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,870
um,

1461
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,703
uh,

1462
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,353
has a,

1463
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,933
uh,

1464
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,430
a percentage of the 1992 level,

1465
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:06,890
uh,

1466
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,280
between 82 and in 1991,

1467
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:09,940
uh,

1468
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,240
that,

1469
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,750
uh,

1470
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,460
you find that the nicotine
levels in cigarettes increased.

1471
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:13,990
Uh,

1472
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,370
the tar levels went down,

1473
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:15,940
uh,

1474
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,710
predominantly as a product of filtration,

1475
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,280
uh,

1476
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,540
but something was going on.

1477
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,350
Uh,

1478
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,300
and what was driving this
increase in nicotine?

1479
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,041
In fact,

1480
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,030
a curiously,

1481
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,470
the amount of nicotine,

1482
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,160
uh,

1483
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,600
in light brands,

1484
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,170
uh,

1485
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,760
that emerged during the 80s,

1486
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,863
1990s,

1487
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,531
uh,

1488
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:37,520
were found to be higher than
in the regular brands just
didn't seem to make much

1489
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,354
sense.

1490
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,580
They also realize that if you pluck the
tobacco leaves higher up on the stock,

1491
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,280
that they had a higher nicotine content,

1492
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:46,730
uh,

1493
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,050
in some species of plants.

1494
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,191
So that,

1495
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:49,580
uh,

1496
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,540
that meant that the,

1497
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,010
the tobacco growers,

1498
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:52,220
uh,

1499
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,840
the tobacco processors had the capacity
to manipulate the nicotine level based

1500
00:39:56,841 --> 00:40:01,700
upon the location on a stock
that the leak was pluck from.

1501
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,690
So the question again that faced,

1502
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:04,950
uh,

1503
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,260
the food and Drug Administration,

1504
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:06,740
uh,

1505
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,040
was,

1506
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,320
isn't it nicotine a drug a,

1507
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:11,840
and here's a comment
from a Sir Charles Ellis,

1508
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,290
uh,

1509
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,680
from the British American Tobacco
Company Research Conference in,

1510
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:16,120
uh,

1511
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,610
uh,

1512
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,050
1962.

1513
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,530
It's my conviction that nicotine is
a very remarkable beneficence drug,

1514
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,070
uh,

1515
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,700
that both helps the body to resist
external stress and also can,

1516
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:28,550
as a result show a pronounced
tranquilizing effect.

1517
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,170
Yeah.

1518
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,270
Nicotine is not only a very fine drug.

1519
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:32,760
Uh,

1520
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,593
he continued,

1521
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,460
but the techniques of administration by
smoking has considerable psychological

1522
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:41,090
advantage and the builtin control
against excessive absorption.

1523
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,500
We are then in the business of
selling nicotine and addictive drug.

1524
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,460
Uh,

1525
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,031
by the way,

1526
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:48,864
these were,

1527
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:53,130
these were comments made at a private
and confidential con conference,

1528
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:53,940
uh,

1529
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,230
that,

1530
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,750
uh,

1531
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,660
were eventually disclosed by the
Food and Drug Administration,

1532
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,210
uh,

1533
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,670
in his discovery process.

1534
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,211
And,

1535
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:00,300
uh,

1536
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,100
you can read more about that.

1537
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:03,150
And the role that,

1538
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,043
uh,

1539
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,100
um,

1540
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,310
uh,

1541
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,420
deep cough played,

1542
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:06,871
uh,

1543
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:07,430
in,

1544
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,650
uh,

1545
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,220
giving,

1546
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:08,400
uh,

1547
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,240
the food and Drug Administration in
particularly Kessler Guidance and,

1548
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:11,721
and,

1549
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:12,000
uh,

1550
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,770
how to get access to some
of this information that was
not in the public domain.

1551
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,340
Uh,

1552
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,971
he continued.

1553
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:18,351
We are,

1554
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,540
or the conviction that the ultimate
explanation for the perpetuated cigarette

1555
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:26,541
habit habit resides in the pharmacological
effect of smoke upon the body and the

1556
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:27,864
smoker.

1557
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,120
I think of a cigarette pack as
a storage container for a day.

1558
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,130
Supply of nicotine.

1559
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,750
I think of a cigarette as a dispenser
for a dose unit of Nicotine.

1560
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,280
I think of a puff of smoke,

1561
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,413
uh,

1562
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,720
as the vehicle for nicotine
smoke is beyond question,

1563
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,090
the most optimized vehicle of nicotine.

1564
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,340
So going back to these original
transcripts of meetings
held within the tobacco

1565
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,174
industry,

1566
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,640
I'll Kessler felt that he had discovered
yesterday believe that this was a,

1567
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,603
a drug.

1568
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,170
They believe that it was addictive.

1569
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:57,670
Uh,

1570
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,360
and they were thinking
themselves that the,

1571
00:41:59,520 --> 00:41:59,750
the,

1572
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,041
the,

1573
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:00,470
the,

1574
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,760
the cigarette and,

1575
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:02,270
uh,

1576
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:02,570
uh,

1577
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,560
cigar wrappers,

1578
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:03,801
uh,

1579
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,240
were drug delivery devices.

1580
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:07,971
In a sense,

1581
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:10,400
the tobacco industry may be
thought of as a specialized,

1582
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:14,090
highly ritualized and stylized segment
of the pharmaceutical industry.

1583
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:14,871
Again,

1584
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:16,270
this is Charlie.

1585
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,323
Claude Teague.

1586
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,860
Tobacco products uniquely contain
and deliver nicotine a potent drug,

1587
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,590
a with a variety of physiological effects.

1588
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,180
They also discovered that the companies
were engaged in a plant breeding,

1589
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,320
crying to genetically engineer
strains of tobacco plants,

1590
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:36,690
uh,

1591
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,810
that would produce higher
levels of nicotine,

1592
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,500
uh,

1593
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,100
particularly a strain known
as the y one nicotine,

1594
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,400
uh,

1595
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,233
stream.

1596
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,900
So the percentage nicotine,

1597
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,030
uh,

1598
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,863
in,

1599
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,760
uh,

1600
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:48,950
uh,

1601
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,050
why one was about threefold.

1602
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,350
The content of a normal
flue cured tobacco,

1603
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,533
uh,

1604
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,423
and the ammonia,

1605
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:56,930
uh,

1606
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,930
they found was capable of liberating
free nicotine from the blend in which it

1607
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:02,864
was associated,

1608
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,260
and it increased the
impact of satisfaction.

1609
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,690
So adding ammonia,

1610
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,140
uh,

1611
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,973
as,

1612
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:10,690
uh,

1613
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,490
a chemical,

1614
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,080
uh,

1615
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,230
uh,

1616
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,670
component of the tobacco product a
would increase the delivery of nicotine.

1617
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,320
So I'm going to stop there.

1618
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,200
We're just about at time
and we'll come back to,

1619
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:21,830
uh,

1620
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,450
the more recent revisions to law are
particularly the statute that was adopted,

1621
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:27,590
uh,

1622
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,590
last June and signed by President Obama
and compare that statute to the food and

1623
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:37,160
Drug Administration's proposed
regulations when Kessler was then the FDA

1624
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:37,994
commissioner.

1625
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:38,930
Thank you.
