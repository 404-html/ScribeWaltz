1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,740
For those of you that
were not here on Tuesday.

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:08,300
I just wanted to review a few
introductory comments. Uh,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,370
this is environmental politics and law.
And My name's John Wargo.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,790
I'm a professor of political science as
well as environmental policy, uh, in,

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,810
uh, the school of Forestry
and environmental studies,

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,630
the Department of Political
Science. And, uh, uh,

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,090
I have an appointment in the college,
uh,

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,300
for which I chair the
environmental studies major. Uh,

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,550
and this course is really designed to
give you an overview of environmental law,

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,910
some of its founding, uh,
and key principles, uh,

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,510
but also to get you to think more
broadly and deeply about, uh,

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,740
our capacity to use law to
shape human behavior. Uh,

13
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:46,590
and I think that the, uh, the
cases that we'll go through,

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,170
we'll largely be a historical cases,

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,400
but there'll be designed in a way and
presented in a way to encourage you to

16
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:58,320
think about evaluating law, uh, to
think about what's worked, what has not,

17
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:03,000
and why as a way of thinking about how
you might design law for the future.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,730
And the cases that, uh, we'll look at our,
I'm going to concentrate on today and,

19
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,280
uh, these, uh, are,

20
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:14,770
are a variety that I've had a chance
to work on during my career. Uh,

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,680
and the relationship between
law and science will be a
really critical component

22
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:23,060
of this course. Uh, there are no
prerequisites for the course, uh,

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,190
so that you don't have to have training
in chemistry or biology to do well in

24
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:33,240
the course. But what you'll see is that
scientific uncertainty, uh, especially,

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,601
uh,

26
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:38,040
is really important and how different
groups exploit's scientific uncertainty,

27
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,550
uh,

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,570
they choose their own data selectively
to tell their own narratives about what's

29
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:43,404
worth worrying about it.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,220
So this course is really designed to
get you to think about what's worth

31
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,840
worrying about in a, in a deeper way, uh,

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,030
as a way to encourage you to think
about, uh, your own behavior,

33
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,610
but also how you might
encourage others to,

34
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,280
to behave in a more responsible way.

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,890
This is not a course in how
to be an environmentalist.

36
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:06,891
It's a course in how you might think
about defining problems and solving

37
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,530
problems, uh, to, uh,

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,370
really help us think about the world
that we're creating a world, uh, uh,

39
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:18,990
with, uh, many billion more people in
it, uh, given our scarce resources.

40
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,810
So today when I wanted to do was
just to briefly once again a in a,

41
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,350
in about 30 seconds, uh, review, uh,

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,310
the obligations of the course
which are to show up. Uh,

43
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,540
it's important to show up.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,340
All of the slides will be posted
on the classes server, uh,

45
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,510
just after the lecture.

46
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,610
And what I'm hoping you'll do is
come to the lecture because a,

47
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,370
you'll see often just images and you
won't know how to interpret those images

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,170
and, and uh, via my voice I'll
be interpreting them for you. Uh,

49
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,320
and also the discussion sections
are critical to the course,

50
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:56,730
so that it's important that you go to
your discussion sections. And I, uh,

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,560
I think that all the times of
impulsive, is that correct, Laura?

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,290
All the times it will be up on Friday
so that you can make your choices. Uh,

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,860
we have eight different sections that
are set up and we're hoping that, uh, uh,

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,210
that's sufficient for the class.

55
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,930
There was also the obligation to either
take a midterm paper or conduct a,

56
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,140
a a research effort that would
produce a paper, you know,

57
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,700
roughly 10 to 12 pages in length.
And I'll talk more about that.

58
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,980
And as I lecture all,

59
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,620
I'll often pause and suggest what I think
are interesting research topics, uh,

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,150
that,
uh,

61
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,780
will span a whole array of different
kinds of laws and problems that will cover

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,740
so that that will be followed at the end
of the chorus by a final examination.

63
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,640
Uh, that, uh, also I'll, I'll
provide a review session for,

64
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,610
and I wanted to make one
thing clear about this.

65
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,770
I made an obligation to give a lecture
at elsewhere, uh, about a year ago, uh,

66
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:57,190
that, uh, uh, is up at
Dartmouth next Thursday.

67
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,290
So we will not have class next Thursday,

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,220
but I will make that up by providing you
with a lecture at the end of the course

69
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:04,060
and additional lecture,

70
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,270
which will review all the course
material for you prior to the final exam.

71
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,300
So let me start in my
interpretation of the, uh,

72
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,470
the failures and successes of 20th century
environmental law is very much tied

73
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:23,920
to how problems had been defined.
And if you look back in history,

74
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,020
you'll see that, uh, uh,

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,880
problems that have become
immediately apparent have
reached the press. Uh, and a,

76
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:34,270
a wide public have often
been translated into law.

77
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,340
So if you think about the Cuyahoga River
which used to catch fire routinely in

78
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,510
Ohio,
uh,

79
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,540
used to catch fire because of the
petroleum products that would lie on the

80
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,060
surface of the water,
uh,

81
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,100
that prompted changes in the clean water
act to try to reduce the emissions from

82
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:56,010
industrial facilities into the rivers.
Uh,

83
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,150
the toxic substance control act,
uh,

84
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:03,400
evolved after concern about
a variety of, of, uh, uh,

85
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,700
events,
uh,

86
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,830
as well as the resource conservation and
recovery act that applies to hazardous

87
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:09,664
waste sites.

88
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,470
Following the discovery that a canal
that had been loaded up with toxic

89
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,940
substances in New York state, known as
love canal, had turned into a school site.

90
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,600
Uh, the corporation had basically
abandoned the facility, uh,

91
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,360
and it was turned over to the
community which built a school.

92
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,640
And a gradually this seeping,

93
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,670
oozing a toxic soup started bubbling
to the surface of the playground and

94
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,350
people's backyards and
in into their basements.

95
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,970
And that prompted the passage
of, of the superfund law, uh,

96
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,580
back in the 1980s. So, uh, in,

97
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,890
in many respects a law follows public
recognition of significant threat.

98
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,780
That a is a surprise in a sense.

99
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,750
But these law has evolved
not in a systematic way.

100
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,350
It was not as if somebody said, okay,
we need to, uh, we need air law,

101
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,010
we need a clean water law. Uh, we
need to toxic substance control law.

102
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,660
We have to worry about hazardous sites.

103
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,840
And what about all the federal
land management responsibilities?

104
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,730
How are we going to manage grazing lands?
Timberland's uh, access to minerals.

105
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,660
Uh, how about private development to how
are we going to manage new development,

106
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,910
new subdivisions? Uh, rather than there
being some sort of a comprehensive vision,

107
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,410
uh, about, uh, the nature of law
that was specific saying, okay,

108
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,130
this kind of problems should be dealt
with best at the federal level as opposed

109
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:30,680
to another kind of problem
should be dealt with by states.

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,530
And what about local
governments? Uh, which,

111
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,470
which level of government has
the best capacity to deal with?

112
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:40,430
Which kind of problem? No one's sat down
and thought comprehensively about this.

113
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,570
And the result is really what
I think of as a, a really a,

114
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:49,220
a fragmented patchwork quilt that's
quite afraid of various statutes that are

115
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:53,250
pieced together, uh, that, uh, have
embedded within them different decisions,

116
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:58,010
standards as well as different
levels of, of funding, uh,

117
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,320
and administered by a variety
of different agencies.

118
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,850
So when I talk about
environmental law, uh, you,

119
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,860
you probably know that the environmental
protection agency has a primary

120
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,890
responsibility to administer
some of the core statutes,

121
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,840
like the Clean Air Act
and the clean water act.

122
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,170
But there are many other statutes
that deal with the chemicals in the

123
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,870
environment, uh, that, uh,

124
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,760
give authority to groups like
the food and Drug Administration,

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,600
the Consumer Product Safety
Commission as, as examples. Uh,

126
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:27,740
and often responsibility for one
kind of a problem. Uh, and we'll,

127
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:30,200
we'll see this particularly
with respect to pesticides,

128
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,520
is fractured among different agencies
with responsibility to implement.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,930
So the Department of Agriculture
has a responsibility to,

130
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,770
to consider the benefits and costs of
farmers of new pesticide regulations.

131
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,170
EPA has a responsibility to look at
toxicity data for pesticides and to judge

132
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,270
what the risk is and to set the standards.

133
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,780
The Food and Drug Administration has
the responsibility to go out and monitor

134
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:54,920
what's in the food supply.

135
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,000
So we know whether or not people are
being exposed to dangerous stuff, uh,

136
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,110
chemical residues. So does this make
sense? That absolutely does not.

137
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,860
And then when we get to
the pesticide case, I'll,

138
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:10,861
I'll tell you a story about how I
tried to pull data together from the

139
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,330
Department of Agriculture, uh, on what
people eat, uh, pull data together on a,

140
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,760
from the food and Drug Administration.

141
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:18,980
About what residues they
found in those foods.

142
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,180
Pull data from the
environmental protection agency
together in a way that made

143
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:28,181
sense to try to figure out what you or
an individual might be exposed to and

144
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:32,870
what your risk might be. Uh, the databases
were all set up in different formats,

145
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,700
uh,
using different software.

146
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,570
It was a nightmare and it took about
three years to integrate the data sets in

147
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:41,510
order to answer the simple question,
what are people exposed to?

148
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,050
So the patchwork quilt that's frayed
that offers insufficient protection is a,

149
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:52,220
is a key image that I want you to
carry with you. How we define problems,

150
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,020
uh, often, uh, will result in,
in, uh, the effectiveness of, of,

151
00:08:57,021 --> 00:09:01,410
of the solution. And often the problems
had been a highly reductionist, uh,

152
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:04,950
in their definition. And this is, uh, uh,

153
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:08,520
also been associated with their
assignment to specific agencies.

154
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,030
And we'll see that many of
these problems cross, uh,

155
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,130
many different boundaries and a,

156
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:18,810
the absence of thinking in a systems
way or thinking ecologically lies at,

157
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,630
at, uh, uh, the core of the issue.

158
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,470
So what are the central questions
of environmental law? Uh,

159
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:29,400
one is the level of government that's
appropriate to the problem. Clearly,

160
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:32,850
if you have air pollution blowing across
state boundaries and local boundaries,

161
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,230
uh, if everybody sets their
own, every state sets their
own, uh, air pollution law,

162
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,660
uh, that's going to be a
nightmare. Everybody has their own,

163
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,990
each state has their own standard.
Uh,

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,870
another key question would be what branch
of government I should establish the

165
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,520
law? Uh, so should it be the, uh, uh,

166
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,800
Congress or should it be
the executive branch? Uh,

167
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:57,270
so EPA has the authority to set
regulations, so congress passes a statute,

168
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,250
sets out broad guidelines,

169
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,190
and then the environmental protection
agency has the authority to set

170
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,770
regulations that,
uh,

171
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,830
really are more refined and dependent
upon the scientific evidence.

172
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,120
So you really wouldn't want Congress to
get involved in the setting of highly

173
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:15,080
specific regulations, uh, that, uh, uh,

174
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,600
really would demand and understanding
of the technical details.

175
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,190
What's our capacity to detect
this chemical? Uh, what's
our capacity to, uh, uh,

176
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,650
understand it's risk?
Who's most at threat?

177
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,500
What are the costs and benefits
associated with regulation?

178
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,560
Do we really want Congress to deal
with that kind of specificity.

179
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,730
And I think often not, therefore
the executive branch, uh,

180
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,060
meaning the Environmental Protection
Agency or other regulatory agencies are

181
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:42,550
often given that authority when
they're given that authority. Uh,

182
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,460
and they don't do anything about it.

183
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:48,060
Ha as has been the case for
many of these problems. Uh,

184
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:52,140
Congress often we'll call them up and
hold hearings and, and demand, uh,

185
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,780
them to explain why nothing
has been accomplished.

186
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,290
And we'll talk about the safe drinking
water act is a great example of that

187
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,740
where Congress finally threw
up his hands and said, uh, EPA,

188
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:06,260
you're just not doing your job and we
are going to specify which chemicals you

189
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,130
have got to test for in drinking water.

190
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,450
And you have got to set maximum
contaminant levels for those chemicals and

191
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:14,940
drinking water and you've
got to do it by date x.

192
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Or they did that also with the hazardous
chemicals law so that Congress does get

193
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,790
upset. Regulations can be
passed by the president, uh,

194
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,070
via executive order.

195
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,660
And also the judiciary plays a really
critical role so that the, the, uh,

196
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,590
collection of decisions surrounding any
one of these problems creates precedent

197
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
for future decisions.
Uh,

198
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:41,881
and courts are often in a position of
interpreting uncertainty in the language

199
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:45,390
of statutes,
but also uncertainty in the,

200
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:50,360
in the language of regulations. And there
are highly individualized cases. Um,

201
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,860
and, uh, unfortunately the,
uh, uh, uh, process of,

202
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:58,861
of adjudication in the court system
is not a very close to the process of

203
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:03,210
discovering new knowledge
that, uh, we think about here
within the academy. Uh, it,

204
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:07,480
it's not about discovering truth.
It's not about proving causality. Uh,

205
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:12,100
it's about control of evidence to tell
a story. So, uh, the courts really are,

206
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,720
are, uh, uh, looking at competing
narratives of what the problem is,

207
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,570
what the damage is and whether
or not the defendant, uh,

208
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,580
really is responsible for
adversely affecting the plaintiffs.

209
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,880
So another key question is
monitoring and surveillance.

210
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:32,800
And it's very easy to pass a law that it
sounds great on, on, uh, uh, on its face.

211
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,840
Uh,
but if you look at it really carefully,

212
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,680
what you'll find is that there's really
no comprehension of how much monitoring

213
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,570
and surveillance is required in order to
really do the job to get the job done.

214
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,430
So monitoring and surveillance,

215
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,500
I think of as one of the primary
defects of 20th century law. Uh,

216
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,570
so we have grossly
misunderstood the amount of,

217
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,600
of money that it will take to really
figure out what happens when you release a

218
00:12:58,601 --> 00:12:59,860
chemical to the environment.

219
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,310
What happens if you blow it out of your
tailpipe on your car or it comes out of

220
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,180
a, uh, uh, a, a nuclear power plant or
radio new cloud goes up into the air.

221
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,920
What happens to that to figure that out
is extremely expensive and a in society

222
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:17,500
with respect to air
pollution, law, chemical law,

223
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,420
even endangered species management,

224
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:24,240
understanding how many
individuals of both sexes, of,

225
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,400
uh, uh, of endangered mammals
exist, where they are,

226
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:30,580
what their reproductive rate is.
That takes intensive monitoring.

227
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,590
So when these laws are passed,

228
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,800
if the government does not set up a
really effective and efficient monitoring

229
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:43,130
and surveillance program, the whole thing
is just like a waste of time. So, uh,

230
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,450
the, the, uh, uh, level of,

231
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,040
of misunderstanding of this issue, I
just cannot, I cannot emphasize enough.

232
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,400
Uh, another key question is access to
data. So who should have access to date?

233
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,740
And I'll give you a good example of this.

234
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,280
I'm working on a project
now and I'm working,

235
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,350
it happens to do with green building
standards and I was wondering about a

236
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,310
carpet treatments and uh, the, uh, uh,
stain master carpets as an example.

237
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,110
Everybody's heard of stain master.
Other,

238
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,260
other chemicals are applied
to the surface of carpets, uh,

239
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,350
to keep them from absorbing stains or
to keep things from sticking to them.

240
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,380
Uh, so, uh, you might think about
to cook, whereas another example,

241
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,030
a lot of cookware now, you don't
have to put any sort of, uh, uh,

242
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,030
an oil into it in order to keep things
from sticking in it. So the, the,

243
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:35,570
the chemicals that are used to
accomplish this, including to make your,

244
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:38,800
your clothing waterproof.
Uh, for example, uh, uh,

245
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:42,760
I was skiing last week and I looked down
at myself and I said, boy, you know,

246
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:47,560
I thought this was just a, you know, a
nice waterproof shell that I was wearing.

247
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,970
And then I started thinking,
oh, you idiot, you know,
you, you're, you're, uh, uh,

248
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,920
wearing a product and you have
no idea what the ingredient is.

249
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,680
And I'm reading reports
saying that everybody,

250
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,140
almost everybody has
this chemical in their,

251
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:04,460
in their body and detectable in their
human tissue. So all of a sudden the chem,

252
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,910
now think about this history. The
chemical is released into the marketplace.

253
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,550
It get you,
it gets used in nonstick pans.

254
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,030
It gets used to be sprayed on the
carpets to keep, uh, you know,

255
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,980
red wine from absorbing to the,
to the fiber.

256
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,180
It gets sprayed on surfaces such
as clothing to keep people dry. Uh,

257
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,040
so that the functionality has been the
primary concern. Nobody asks the question,

258
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,060
what happens to this chemical? Then down
the road somebody says, well, let's test,

259
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,230
let's test blood,

260
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:34,850
or let's test urine and let's test a
body fat or maybe even here to figure out

261
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,500
where this thing is going and whether
or not it's there and they find,

262
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,320
Lo and behold, it is there. And then, uh,

263
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,470
to try to get the chemical
out of the marketplace,

264
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,590
which is now global is a very
difficult thing to accomplish.

265
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,800
So, access to data, uh, I'm reading
this report about this data and the, uh,

266
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,870
one of the major corporations,
uh, dupont, uh, is, is,

267
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,860
has been producing chemicals
that, uh, have this, this effect.

268
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,500
And they submitted a report to EPA,
EPA put it up online. And I, I've,

269
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,560
I've got to show it to you. Uh, I
haven't gotten it up in a pdf format yet,

270
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,600
but I've got to show it
to you because every,

271
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,790
every page has the title of the topic.
Uh,

272
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,370
and then it has CBI written on
it with nothing else. CBI is,

273
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,510
uh, the acronym for confidential
business information.

274
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,950
So the information was submitted to from
dupont to the environmental protection

275
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,520
agency and the environmental protection
agency basically shuts down the public

276
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,880
from understanding what
that is. Uh, and it's,

277
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,320
it's all about how much of
the chemical is produced,

278
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,300
what the company knows
about, where it goes, uh,

279
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,410
and also what the health effects
or environmental effects might be.

280
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,990
So access to data, intellectual property
rights, a secrecy and confidentiality.

281
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,940
These are all things that we really
need to think about very carefully, uh,

282
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,030
when we structure environmental law.
Another key question number five is,

283
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,830
should we allow preemption?

284
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,430
Preemption is a really
interesting idea that, uh,

285
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,690
on the federal government could prevent
a state from adopting regulations that

286
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,030
might be different or less restrictive
than the federal standards. And the,

287
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,610
the clean air act is a great example
of this because the clean air act does

288
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:20,480
preempt states from adopting regulations
that are different from the federal

289
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:23,450
standards with respect to vehicle
emissions, power plant emissions,

290
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,630
a mercury emissions, and the
state of California. However,

291
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,640
it was exempted by Congress when that
statute was passed. And why is that? Well,

292
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,980
it's because they have some pretty
severe air quality problems.

293
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,700
There are different patches in the country
where air quality is very, very poor.

294
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:43,280
And one is the La Basin and other
is the, uh, Salt Lake basin. Uh,

295
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,120
and uh, Houston, Atlanta,
Chicago, New York.

296
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:50,460
This area is out of compliance with
clean air act standards quite routinely.

297
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,540
And you might think that a,
this geographic and,

298
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,990
and climatological variability is a pretty
good justification for states to have

299
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:01,140
the capacity,
the legal capacity to set their own laws.

300
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,770
So the states have far higher
pollution than the national average.

301
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,530
So that, uh, thinking about,
uh, what kinds of problems, uh,

302
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,760
are amenable to,
uh,

303
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,990
having states have more authority as
opposed to when do we want to centralize

304
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,660
authority across all
states in, in, and locate,

305
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,280
locate the authority with
the federal government.

306
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,690
This is a really important question.

307
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,770
Another key question is administrative
discretion versus statutory criteria. Uh,

308
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,510
so when should congress give the
environmental protection agency the

309
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:37,200
administrative discretion,
uh, to set standards, uh,

310
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,780
to judge whether or not
the economic benefits are,

311
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,290
are outweighing what the
environmental harm might be. A,

312
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,840
should they have the authority to do that.
So if you,

313
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:50,580
if you adopt a utilitarian standard
that's cost benefit balancing or say risk

314
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,490
benefit balancing,
uh,

315
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,730
then you're basically giving the
agency a lot of discretion to do their

316
00:18:56,731 --> 00:19:00,510
technical analysis and to try to figure
out how to go through that balancing act

317
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,420
that gives them a lot of authority,
uh,

318
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,440
as opposed to setting statutory criteria
saying the risk shall not be greater

319
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,274
than x.

320
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,480
Say cancer risks should not be greater
than one in a million or the decision

321
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:16,680
standard within the, the Food
Quality Protection Act, uh,

322
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,370
that the agency must, uh, uh, find, uh,

323
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:23,700
a reasonable certainty that no harm
will result from any pesticide.

324
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,350
Sounds unfortunate. So thinking about, uh,

325
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,770
whether or not it makes sense to, to,
uh, give an administrative agency,

326
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:41,070
that kind of discretion, uh, is very
important. And it depends again,

327
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,840
on the technical nature of the problem.

328
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,260
Another key question is risk averaging.
Uh, if you have lousy data, uh,

329
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,000
data that, uh, uh, is collected, uh,
maybe with very small sample sizes, uh,

330
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,870
so that you have no understanding of
democratic variability and exposure. Uh,

331
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,800
or in the, uh, the, the,

332
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,830
the complex temporal and spacial
distributional patterns of pollution.

333
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,100
Uh, then it's like looking at the world
without my glasses on, which is, uh, uh,

334
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,630
you know, all, all of the students
look the same. Uh, so that, uh,

335
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,520
you lose any resolution,
uh,

336
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,640
you lose the ability to
identify pockets of a,

337
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,450
a serious problems or high
risk or high exposure. Uh,

338
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,930
and if you don't have that
resolution in your data,

339
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,860
you can't go in and protect
the most vulnerable. Those
people that are, are, uh,

340
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,320
are most at risk.
So if,

341
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,120
if a EPA does not have a good
monitoring and surveillance data,

342
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,620
they get to a position statistically
where they're forced to to average very

343
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,540
broadly, uh, across space, across
time and across demographic groups.

344
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,560
And, and this is a very
serious problem getting, uh,

345
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,440
getting our system of
environmental law to have the,

346
00:20:55,441 --> 00:21:00,441
the scientific and evidentiary
foundation that allows the analyst to

347
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,610
discriminate between, uh, you know,

348
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,070
what's a really clean area and
what's a really dirty area.

349
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,110
And I'll give you one example of that.
We'll,

350
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:12,180
that we'll look at later in the term
with respect to vehicle emissions. Uh,

351
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,940
I wondered about this because EPA sets
their air quality monitoring out in

352
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,774
fields.

353
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,160
There's one just across the cube bridge
on interstate 95 right next to the

354
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,910
highway. When you go across, you get
to the other side of the bridge. Uh,

355
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,330
if you're heading east on 95, you can
see it set up on a little platform. Uh,

356
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,460
so that's a fixed monitoring site where
they're measuring particulate matter,

357
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,350
they're measuring ozone occasionally,
very occasionally they measure voc. Uh,

358
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,430
so that, that, uh, uh,

359
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,260
their image of the distribution of air
pollution in the nation comes from this

360
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,560
network of fixed stations and they've
got probably two dozen set up in

361
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,580
Connecticut.
Well,

362
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:52,240
I wondering whether or not you would
come to a very different conclusion about

363
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:54,620
the quality of air in the
movement of pollution, uh,

364
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,660
particularly vehicle emissions and the
carbon particles I was talking about on

365
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:03,490
Tuesday. If instead of a reading
your data coming from the stations,

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,680
you put the monitors on kids and you
followed them through their daily life.

367
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,520
And the answer is of
course it's different.

368
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,500
It's radically different and I'll
demonstrate in a few weeks why that is.

369
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,490
So EPA has this image of,
of uh,

370
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,240
pollution being quite uniform across
the state, uh, or across a region. Uh,

371
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,260
whereas the pollution that you inhale a
on a daily basis coming from secondhand

372
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,050
cigarette smoke or firsthand
cigarette smoke, uh,

373
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,860
coming from a vehicle emissions coming
from power plant emissions of power

374
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,560
plants in Ohio, uh, generally it takes,

375
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,120
it takes about two weeks
for particles released, uh,

376
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,150
to the air in Europe if they're very
fine to make it into the stratosphere and

377
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:52,960
to go all the way around the world and
then come back and become part of our

378
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:57,630
climate. Uh, so that, uh, it's
very interesting that, that uh, uh,

379
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,080
your image of,
of,

380
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,620
of what's worth worrying about is very
dependent upon this monitoring and

381
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:07,270
sampling and how specific it is.
Number eight is really critical.

382
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:09,490
The burden of proof and
the standard of proof.

383
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,420
Who should bear the burden
of proof that that a,

384
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,540
a problem is really serious?
Well,

385
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,430
industry often claims that it's
the public's responsibility
to demonstrate that

386
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,470
their emissions, uh, their
chemicals, they're harvesting
of a national forest, uh,

387
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:31,280
that, uh, that is creating a problem.
So if this burden lies on a, uh,

388
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,080
an impoverished community, uh,
or it lies on a group of a,

389
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,390
of families in a small neighborhood,

390
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,810
they're not going to be able to mount this
scientific analysis and, and, and, uh,

391
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,370
develop the funding, uh,
to mount a legal, uh,

392
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,650
to, to challenge industry standards.
Most large corporations have, have,

393
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,970
uh, groups of lawyers.
They have a large, uh,

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,330
offices of lawyers or they hire
law firms to represent them.

395
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,020
I've been involved in litigation for
the past two decades, uh, and, uh,

396
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:07,760
sat across the table from a six lawyers,
from a major chemical company,

397
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,180
uh, being deposed on a
number of occasions. Uh,

398
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:14,840
and this was just a very
small group of lawyers that,

399
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,970
that we're trying to pick apart.
You know, my claim, uh, that, uh,

400
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,480
chemical posed as a specific
threat to children. Uh, so most,

401
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,490
uh, plaintiffs would not have the capacity
to mount that kind of legal expertise.

402
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,380
And don't forget this basic,

403
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,730
this basic idea that probably 90%,

404
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,270
even 95% of of environmental science of
health science relative to environmental

405
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:44,690
quality. Uh, what sector
does that go on in?

406
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,340
It doesn't go on in the public sector.
It goes on in the private sector, uh,

407
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:53,870
so that, uh, corporations that are, are
very interested in, in making a profit,

408
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,050
uh, and selling goods and services. Uh,

409
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,380
they basically are doing their
own internal risk assessments, uh,

410
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,400
for what the effect might be on, on,
uh, the environment or human health. Uh,

411
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,210
and those can never see the light of day.

412
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,370
I'll talk in the pesticide case in
a few weeks about a one compound.

413
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:17,420
It's an organophosphate insecticide and
one of the world's most heavily used and,

414
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:22,340
uh, uh, via litigation. Uh,
the group I work with, uh,

415
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,390
uh, forced disclosure of,
of a database that, uh, uh,

416
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,260
who was really pray quite remarkable.
Uh,

417
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,380
this company had spent $100 million,
uh,

418
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,360
on studies for one chemical to keep
it in the marketplace so they could

419
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:43,310
understand what its risks might be.
Uh, now, uh, that's quite impressive.

420
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,150
Uh, so think about challenging,
uh, the quality of that evidence.

421
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
Another company submitted a, a, uh,

422
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,530
a proposal to the environmental protection
agency to continue their license to

423
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:59,330
use a pesticide. Uh, this happened
to be an herbicide known as atrazine.

424
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,500
Atrazine is found in the wells of about
30 million people in the Midwest right

425
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:08,450
now, uh, because it's sprayed across the
landscape planted with corn and soybeans.

426
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,430
Uh, it's a, uh, an endocrine disruptor.
In other words, it's hormonally active.

427
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,410
Uh, and also, uh, it's believed
to pose different kinds of
threats to human health.

428
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,360
So when,
uh,

429
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,440
when this corporation decided that
it wanted to submit it to data to the

430
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:29,030
environmental protection agency, they
decided to do it, uh, not electronically,

431
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,970
but to deliver the material
and to deliver the material.

432
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:36,971
It took them two tractor trailer loads
a of boxes with a datasets and the

433
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,810
supporting evidence,

434
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,670
which they drove up to the docks of
the environmental protection agency in.

435
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,220
And so you can imagine this,

436
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,160
a regulatory office of EPA looking at
this huge sea of boxes that they would

437
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:54,660
have to analyze. That's a very interesting
strategy. And so what would that do?

438
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,320
Well,

439
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,460
it basically would put a regulatory effort
that might be chugging down the road

440
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:02,310
at a good pace and it would
put it in the deep freeze.

441
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,130
It would slow it down to the point where,
oh my gosh,

442
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,910
this agency has to look at a thousand
chemicals. This is one chemical,

443
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,820
and we've got to go through all those
data sets and we're going to have to

444
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,180
understand whether or not that evidence
really is supportable, credible,

445
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:19,980
replicable, oh, that's going
to slow things down, one
out of a thousand chemicals.

446
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,860
So, uh, the burden of proof, the standard
of proof is a really critical issue.

447
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,970
So for civil actions, uh, you, you
need to remember, uh, that, uh, uh,

448
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,970
the, the plaintiff, uh, needs to
demonstrate that, uh, damage occurred,

449
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,430
uh,
not beyond a reasonable doubt,

450
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,940
but by the standard of preponderance
of the evidence. In other words,

451
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:45,810
it's more likely than not that
the defendant caused the damage.

452
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,590
Think about that with respect to
the standard of proof required.

453
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:52,650
If you wanted to submit a paper to
science magazine, well, you know,

454
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,840
you'd be asked questions about, uh, okay,
what's your confidence interval? Uh,

455
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,920
do you have a 95% confidence, uh, in,

456
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:03,540
in the a causal relationship that
you're, you're, uh, uh, hypothesizing,

457
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,940
uh, or is it a 99% confidence? Uh,

458
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,430
so that the standard of proof that that
is applied before a decision is made is

459
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:14,520
a critical issue. And this can be
adjusted if you're designing law.

460
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,570
Also national sovereignty to
re regulate to foreign hazards.

461
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,220
There are a variety of international
standards set up to prevent the,

462
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,720
the export of,
of hazardous waste.

463
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,700
So there's quite a controversy brewing
right now about electronic waste being

464
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:32,590
transmitted, particularly to
an Asian nations, which are,

465
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,720
are trying to recycle the precious
metals out of computer equipment,

466
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,220
uh, old cell phones. Uh, and, uh,

467
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,280
even though there may be
only a 75 cents per, per, uh,

468
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,970
uh, cell phone in terms of the value of,
of those metals, uh, there are some, uh,

469
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,100
three dozen different metals that can be
extracted from electronic equipment and

470
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,140
a, if they're thrown away
or if they're burned,

471
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,620
the material will go up
into the atmosphere or it
will make its way down into

472
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:05,280
the soil and the groundwater. Uh, and
also the people that are doing this,

473
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:08,730
the people that are burning the plastic
off of the electronic components in the

474
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,940
metals,
they are often exposed at a high level.

475
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,960
So that's a very interesting problem.
How could we regulate international trade?

476
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,710
Well, this issue of national sovereignty
is very important. Does one nation,

477
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:24,420
one another nation telling it what it
can and cannot import a, does it want to,

478
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,300
uh, uh, uh, demand that,

479
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:30,060
that nation adopt some sort
of a universal standard?

480
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:34,110
And the answer is clearly
no. Uh, and finally, uh,

481
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:38,640
what criteria would we use to choose
among the possible legal strategies,

482
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,710
uh, that, uh, are there?

483
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,910
So I'm going to skip a really quickly now,
uh,

484
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,370
to a variety of different cases. And, uh,

485
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,130
I'd like you to imagine a society with
no environmental law. And by the way,

486
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,780
that was the United States back in
1950 when we had no clean air act,

487
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:57,260
no clean water act.
Uh,

488
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,300
and how would you design law
in order to assure a healthy,

489
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,950
productive and sustainable future?

490
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,840
That is a central question that I hope
you can address by the end of the course.

491
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,100
Now,

492
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,100
imagine a society in the year 2010 as we
sit here where our law is fractured by

493
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:19,630
problem and by media. Uh, so
by media I need air, water,

494
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:23,980
food, or by problem type. Hazardous
wastes are hazardous sites or,

495
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,900
or a pesticide problem. It's
fractured by level of government. Uh,

496
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,620
there's very little surveillance.
It tends to evolve at a snail's pace.

497
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,490
And a little anecdote there,
uh, in, in a variety of, uh,

498
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,330
decisions to,
uh,

499
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:43,290
regulate or license an individual
chemical or a new product. Uh,

500
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,660
it often will take EPA,
uh,

501
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:51,460
up to a decade or 15 years to go through
a review to determine whether or not,

502
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,900
uh, that chemical is safe. Whether
or not poses excessive risk, uh,

503
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,500
or what the economic benefit is if it's a,

504
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:04,330
if it's being reviewed under a balancing
and cost standard. So that, uh,

505
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:04,900
uh,

506
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,320
now imagine this out of the
80,000 chemicals that are
out there in international

507
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:09,154
commerce,

508
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,960
if it takes EPA 15 years
to review one chemical,

509
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,530
what does that tell you about what their
capacity is to manage your exposure to

510
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:20,560
dangerous things?
It tells you what's exceptionally limited.

511
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Our system of law also provides a false
sense of security because most of us

512
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:29,140
believe that, uh, the, the, uh,

513
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,150
the little statements on the back of,
uh, uh, different products such as,

514
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:35,000
uh,
uh,

515
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,420
a nervous side and the hardware
store that says this is EPA license.

516
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,730
That's almost a certification of
safety in most people's minds.

517
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,210
Many people think it wouldn't be in
the marketplace if it was dangerous.

518
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,090
People have reviewed this,
right? Well, you know,

519
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:52,600
by the time you're finished
with this course, you will,
you will be thinking, uh,

520
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,550
uh, quite a, quite a
lot about that problem.

521
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,070
So environmental law is also highly
specialized in the sciences and as I just

522
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:04,300
said, about 95% of environmental
science goes on in the private sector.

523
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,670
Uh, and what that means is that,
uh, they have a, a a a leg up.

524
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:13,870
They have a competitive advantage and
controlling the narrative about the nature

525
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:16,720
of the danger. So that,
uh, thinking about, uh,

526
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:21,721
how to set up an institution that really
would produce science that would be

527
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:25,150
publicly available, that
would be, uh, transparent.

528
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,570
It would be open,
the data would be out there.

529
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,800
So you or I could review it. I mean,
that's a, that's a big obligation.

530
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,500
Uh, it's also highly politicized
and its implementation. Uh,

531
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,590
there are all sorts of stories about,
uh,

532
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,740
regulators in inside the
food and Drug Administration,

533
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,820
occupational safety and
Health Administration and
the Environmental Protection

534
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,900
Agency and how they move at fairly
high levels from the agency,

535
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,910
assistant administrator for
toxic substances and EPA
going to work for Monsanto.

536
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,590
A, they'll go to work for
Monsanto, uh, during periods of,

537
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,620
of, uh, uh, liberal administration,

538
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,460
and then they'll come back
into the administration, uh,

539
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,210
during periods of conservative
administrations. So that, uh,

540
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,490
there's this revolving door
idea among top regulators.

541
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,270
It's extremely difficult
to regularly, uh, also, uh,

542
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,220
our system of law is very poorly
supported by the nonprofit community.

543
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,940
You may think that there's a large network
of, of nonprofits out there that are,

544
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,770
are playing the watchdog role. Uh,
but, but you're wrong. In fact, uh,

545
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,230
when the area of the
Safe Drinking Water Act,

546
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,460
there is no nonprofit in Washington DC
that has taken the safe drinking water

547
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:40,760
act under, it's under its purview
saying, this is our specialty,

548
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,370
but you can always count on them
to be there to, uh, to, uh, uh,

549
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,940
try to judge the reasonableness
of a proposed regulation.

550
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,190
Uh, generally, uh,

551
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,870
in the system of environmental
law that we've got is utilitarian.

552
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,970
It's balancing of costs
and benefits or risks are,

553
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,260
or the estimate of damages and a
with economic benefits might be,

554
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,970
and inherent in that decision
standard is this problem.

555
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,870
You've got costs that are
pretty easy to quantify.

556
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,510
And if you've got a firm
that's making a product,

557
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,100
they're going to tell you with pretty good
accuracy, their opinion about, uh, what,

558
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,330
what they would lose if you
took that right away from
them to Bruce that product.

559
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,760
Uh, now by contrast,
if you think about, uh,

560
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,510
the damage side of the equation
or the risk side of the equation,

561
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,260
that's a projection that's a
projection out into the future.

562
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:45,140
Uh, that's a probabilistic estimate
of what might happen into the future.

563
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,720
And the global warming, a transformation
in thinking that we've, we've, uh,

564
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,530
we've seen over the past decade has really
been quite remarkable because people

565
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:56,270
are thinking now,
uh,

566
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,470
out over a long time horizon in ways
that they never had before. You know,

567
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:03,830
what is it climate going to be like and
what's it going to do two or ecosystems

568
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:07,970
and to our, our, our shorelines into our
health a hundred years down the road.

569
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:13,100
There were very few people that think
out in that long term. So how do you,

570
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,920
how do you project damages out
over long periods of time? Well,

571
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:20,921
you rely on very complex computer models
to do that so that you have to have

572
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:25,790
faith in those who are
doing the projection and the
quality of the analysis so

573
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,530
that, uh, uh,

574
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,540
this problem can be kind of capsulized
in the idea that costs are often

575
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,960
relatively well known and they can be
projected with relative precision over the

576
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:41,640
short term compared to, uh, the harms,

577
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,540
the environmental and health harms that
are highly uncertain and they're often

578
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:49,620
projected way out into the future with a
really fuzzy image of how they're going

579
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:53,490
to fall out differently
on different groups. Uh,

580
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:57,990
also our system of law, environmental
law has been trivialized, I think, uh,

581
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:02,400
by, uh, the concerns that we have over
international security and terrorism.

582
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,440
Basically nobody was talking about
environmental law for several years, uh,

583
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,420
between 2001, uh, following the,
uh, the attack on the trade centers,

584
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,030
uh, in 2004, 2005, uh,

585
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,640
environmental law came back to life.
But even when the public is, is asked,

586
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,000
you know,

587
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,360
what do you care about most in terms of
problems that the United States faces?

588
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,580
You will see issues such as the economy
regularly being first on that list,

589
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,670
you'll see issues of national security
being in the top two or three. Uh,

590
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,320
but people are thinking in a,
in a much, uh, about, uh, uh,

591
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,740
very different collection of problems
rather than, than environmental concern.

592
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:44,820
We'll be talking about the importance
of public perception of the environment

593
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:48,900
compared to these other social
objectives in the future. Uh,

594
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,720
one other point I wanted to make is that
the, the estimates today are that, uh,

595
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,060
the system that we have in place now
costs industry about 300 to $400 billion

596
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,620
per year in the United States alone,
uh,

597
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,350
only in compliance costs.
That's pretty remarkable. Uh,

598
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:11,040
EPA and other groups have reviewed
this estimate along with the government

599
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:15,000
accountability office. Uh, that's
a, that's a very large investment.

600
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,090
So put the pieces together here
of what I've just told you.

601
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,120
I've told you that we have this system
of law that is not working very well, uh,

602
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,700
for a whole variety of reasons.

603
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,900
Now I'm telling you that this is costing
society an enormous amount of money.

604
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,710
Well. Uh, does that make sense? We'll,
we'll come back to that issue. Uh,

605
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,870
during the term now I'm going to spend
about 10 minutes just quickly reviewing

606
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,720
some of the cases that we'll go through
that we'll demonstrate some of these,

607
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,800
these key principles.

608
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:47,030
1955 was a 1954 was a turning point
for environmental ism in the nation,

609
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,800
in the world because it basically taught
people to think at a global scale about

610
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:58,380
nature and about the environment
for the very first time.

611
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,890
And it's the result of this explosion
on the Bikini atoll in the Marshall

612
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,830
Islands that punched up radioactive
material into the stratosphere.

613
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,430
And at the time they thought that, well,
we had to worry about where it would,

614
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,580
where it would go, how it
would be distributed, uh,

615
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,120
within a couple of hundred miles.
And a variety of mistakes were made,

616
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,210
including, uh, uh, exposing
people working for the military.

617
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,680
Uh, this group of people was, uh, uh,

618
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,140
sitting in these lawn chairs and their
shorts and, uh, uh, their caps on,

619
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:33,810
they had ski goggles on. You know,
with a dark lens is thinking,

620
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,770
well that would be safe enough.
Or there are many,

621
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,380
many stories about workers being exposed,
uh,

622
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,790
beyond what normal normally we would
think of as, as being a safe level today.

623
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,030
So what you don't know can hurt you.

624
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,810
And the more you ask about
a chemical movement, the,

625
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:52,810
the more we recognize that a chemical is
actually persist longer than we thought

626
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:57,430
they would. Uh, they often move further
in ways that were non intuitive,

627
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,230
uh, through ecosystems, marine
food chains, uh, they, they, uh,

628
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,850
may get deposited in the
landscape in different ways.

629
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,590
We'll see next week when we take
this story apart, uh, that, uh,

630
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,380
one of the major surprises was that this
material got into global circulation,

631
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:11,980
uh,

632
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,930
so that everybody in the world was exposed
to radionuclides strontium 90 iodine,

633
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:19,840
one 31, CCM, one 37 a.

634
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:23,410
And your parents were all are all walking
around today with those byproducts

635
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:27,850
that often have halflife so thousands
of years. So that, uh, these are,

636
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:29,560
these are really important lessons.

637
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,940
The atomic energy commission
figured this out by 1955, 1956,

638
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,710
they figured out that, uh, these,

639
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:39,900
these radionuclides wouldn't just
kind of go away. And that's been a,

640
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:43,810
that's been the perception of most
people about chemicals released to the

641
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:47,650
environment. They just go away.
Uh, many of them don't go away, uh,

642
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:52,070
particularly radionuclides and,
uh, they move around the world. Uh,

643
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,400
they tend to settle down. The heavier
particles will settle down. Uh,

644
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,680
when it's dry,
the finer particles tend to aggregate.

645
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:04,300
And then when a rain cloud intersects
with, with the dust cloud, uh,

646
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,940
as they settled down into lower
elements of the atmosphere,

647
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,520
that's when they rain down into the earth.

648
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,750
And that creates a patchy pattern of
contamination. It's a patchy pattern,

649
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:18,751
but we can figure out what the deposition
deposition rates were 50 years ago

650
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:22,770
today, just by taking soil samples.
It's very interesting. So that a,

651
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,190
you can back calculate the halflife
of CCM one 37 or strontium 90,

652
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,700
and you see that it actually plays out,
excuse me,

653
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,130
in a very patchy way

654
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,460
that is dependent upon this intersection
between the dust cloud and the rain

655
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:43,294
clouds.

656
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,370
So the number one failure that we'll see
as we go through this case is a failure

657
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:51,070
of systems thinking,
a failure to think ecologically.

658
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,870
But the atomic energy
commission was clearly thinking
ecologically back in 1955.

659
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,430
Uh, but then we, we've been waking
up over the past 50, 60 years

660
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,350
without really paying much attention
to this story. So that, uh,

661
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,120
we'll see as the milk was tested,
uh,

662
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:10,751
in the ground,

663
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:14,830
soil contamination levels of strontium
90 were tested between the period of 54

664
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:19,831
and in 1958 when a more atomic
bombs were exploded than in,

665
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:25,480
during any other period in human
history. Uh, you see this correlation,

666
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,810
this rise in levels and the
soil and levels in the milk.

667
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,800
And then you see the levels in the human
diet going up during the same period of

668
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:36,290
time and the levels and human bone.
They didn't know that.

669
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,580
They didn't know that at the time. They
designed the bombs, uh, so that, uh,

670
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:45,500
they didn't know that strontium 90 would
compete with calcium, uh, to, to, uh, uh,

671
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,150
be fixed within bone in the
human body. Uh, but the, the, uh,

672
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,500
atomic energy commission created this
clan to Stein operation where they

673
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,100
collected dead bodies from 15,000
people around the world, uh,

674
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,880
and they sent them to the labs
in Chicago, uh, and to, uh,

675
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,020
to Lamont Laboratory and,
uh,

676
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,020
to Columbia University
where they were tested. Uh,

677
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,840
and every bone they tested
found strontium 90 in it.

678
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,550
And that really woke them up.

679
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,040
You can find this story only because
this documentation that was formerly

680
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:23,390
classified for the, uh, until
the mid to late 1990s, uh,

681
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:26,150
is now available in the
declassified documents database.

682
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,860
It's really a fascinating story.

683
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,670
These people were sitting around in the
Atomic Energy Commission is headquarters

684
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:35,030
actually saying, well, you know,
what is the law and body snatching?

685
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,450
They use that phrase body snatching.
Where are we going to get cadavers?

686
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:42,740
Do we really have to ask relatives about
this? Well, what about homeless people?

687
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,341
Uh,

688
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:47,840
so the atomic energy commission was
collecting bones from around the world and

689
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:52,700
they were able to build this map of
the deposition rate of strontium 90,

690
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,070
uh, by, uh,

691
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:58,100
looking at bones that came from Argentina
bones that came from South Africa.

692
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,370
And I can just imagine what their faces
look like when they saw the levels, uh,

693
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,820
that, uh, we're spanning all attitudes
and basically all nations in the world.

694
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,950
Well, this story gets repeated. It
gets repeated chemical by chemical. Uh,

695
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,310
as EPA begins to come to life
in the 1970s and eighties,

696
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,200
begins to wake up in this case to
polybrominated diphenyl ethers, uh, that,

697
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:25,000
uh, uh, are these flame retardants, uh,

698
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,820
that we now all walk around with.
And it's a common story that we,

699
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,850
we first find the chemicals in wildlife.
Why? Because they're easy to test on.

700
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,150
People generally don't like to give
bone samples so that, uh, uh, their,

701
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,210
their bones can be tested
for strontium 90. By the way,

702
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:46,211
there's an interesting kind of way to
figure out what's in your bone by testing

703
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,070
teeth. Uh, so by testing the
deciduous teeth of young kids, uh,

704
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,630
the atomic energy commission figured
this out and they were actually going

705
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,260
around from Dennis to Dennis collecting
teeth from people thinking, well,

706
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:57,471
you know,

707
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,490
why were we crazy enough to
have to collect bones from
dead people when we could

708
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:01,520
have just collected teeth?

709
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,880
So you find that you find this pattern
of recognition first and wildlife.

710
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,480
Then they say, oh, well I know how,
how did it get into the wildlife?

711
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,690
And then gradually somebody said,
boy, if it's in the wildlife,

712
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,340
it might be in humans too.
Uh, and gradually people
started testing breast milk.

713
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:24,140
Breast milk became the, the tissue
of choice in order to, to, uh, uh,

714
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,870
understand whether or not
chemicals were being transmitted.

715
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:31,380
Transgenerationally and it also is,
it's easy to collect,

716
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,170
uh, it, uh, is relatively
inexpensive to store.

717
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,860
And here's a good example of DDT found
in different nations around the world in

718
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:39,330
breast milk in the 1970s.

719
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,740
So human tissue testing became really
an important way to figure out, uh,

720
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,780
what people were,
were exposed to.

721
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,030
And if you know that you
find it in somebody's body,

722
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:50,400
then you have this kind of
interesting problem. Well,

723
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,030
how do I figure out where I encountered
it? How, how was I exposed it?

724
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:57,300
I breathe it to eat it and the
food to come in the drinking water.

725
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,030
So these are all questions that EPA
has faced on numerous occasions. Uh,

726
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,260
this is the island of the
case that we'll spend a,

727
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:08,880
a lecture on or two in a few weeks where
I've worked for a couple of years and

728
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:10,620
I've worked on hazardous,
uh,

729
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:15,840
defense sites and the process of
their restoration for, for, uh, uh,

730
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,950
sites in, in Massachusetts, uh, sites
in California as well as sites in,

731
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:24,570
in Puerto Rico. And this is a
fascinating story, uh, that, uh,

732
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,410
led me to understand how chemicals
moved through the food chain. And a,

733
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:29,430
this is a bombing run.

734
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,960
200 million pounds of bombs were
dropped on this little island, uh,

735
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:37,590
over the period between 1940 and 1919.
Uh,

736
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,410
uh,
or actually 2003.

737
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,700
So I wondered where did the
chemicals in those bombs go?

738
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,510
So I took students some from this
class down and we dove in this bay.

739
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,930
Uh, we found a, a, an old destroyer.

740
00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:00,370
We found 2000 pound bombs that were as
long as this stage and about that wide

741
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,180
lying, underwater rusting out, leaking.

742
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,070
We found mounds of artillery shells.
Uh, I remember one case where I was,

743
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,050
uh, my goggles had fogged up and I came
to the surface and like looked around and

744
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,720
looked and saw there was a tank on the,

745
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,450
on a hill that was only about
20 meters from where I was.

746
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,590
And then I cleared my goggles and I looked
down and I was within about two feet

747
00:46:22,591 --> 00:46:25,140
standing on a pile of,
of artillery shells.

748
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,230
And I hadn't really put
two and two together. Uh,

749
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:32,970
but destroyers had sat
offshore and for 30, 40 years,

750
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,930
we're lobbying,
uh,

751
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,670
these artillery shells at the tank
on the hill for target practice.

752
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,540
And a bunch of them had missed,
uh, and piled up in the same place.

753
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,200
So they're still sitting there. I
mean, I could take, uh, take you there.

754
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:49,810
Now we can still see the 2000 palm bumps.
So the,

755
00:46:49,811 --> 00:46:53,980
the base closure and
reclamation act, uh, back, uh,

756
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,170
that that was established.

757
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:58,230
It's closing down a bunch of these
bases has led the army, the air force,

758
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:01,850
the Navy, uh, uh, to
basically close basis,

759
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,800
walk away and uh,

760
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,470
clean up according to standards
that they believe are safe.

761
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,190
So this will be a story about standard
setting that turns into a story about

762
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:15,300
chemicals moving in, in the marine food
chain. You've heard about mercury in tuna,

763
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:20,250
you probably heard about mercury
in shark in large predatory fish,

764
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:25,470
but you probably haven't heard about
mercury in the array of tropical fish, uh,

765
00:47:25,471 --> 00:47:30,440
that, uh, exist in, in,
uh, uh, uh, the sees,

766
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,180
well, that's because they haven't been
studied. People tend to look at, uh,

767
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,360
at the chemicals and the larger
fish, they tend to avoid, uh, the,

768
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,700
the study of, of uh, uh,

769
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,800
this set of tropical fish,
uh,

770
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,900
because these don't comprise them at
large proportion of the u s average diet,

771
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,000
uh, or other high income nations that
would fund this kind of research, uh,

772
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:58,900
would not comprise their, their diet. So
the problem I faced in Puerto Rico is,

773
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,000
wow, you know, uh, I know that these
people eat a lot of these fish. Um,

774
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,330
and there were probably two dozen
that they eat on a routine basis. Uh,

775
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,450
what happens to a TNT HDX,
which are explosives?

776
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,660
What happens to cadmium and mercury
and lead and aluminum and copper in a

777
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,630
variety of other chemicals that
are components of munitions, uh,

778
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,360
how do they build up in fish? And is
this population more exposed than others?

779
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,450
So that island communities,
whether it's the Marshall Islanders,

780
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,970
the Seychelle Islanders,
the, uh, via Kenzie, uh,

781
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,190
that had these diets that
are very rich in fish,

782
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,500
they can be more exposed than others.

783
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,670
So I'm going to jump ahead here because
I'm running out of time and I'll come

784
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:43,150
back to these, uh, and
get to the final slide.

785
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,860
Oh, I see. How much fun
we're going to have.

786
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,680
Want to leave you today with one image
that was up in the Wasatch, uh, last week.

787
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:59,170
I spent eight days, eight
days in heaven, so to speak.

788
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,470
And if any of you have not been to the
Wasatch, I encourage you to go there.

789
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,140
This is just east of Salt Lake City,

790
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,600
about 10,000 feet in height and a
standing there looking out at these

791
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:15,250
magnificent mountains. Uh, I
suddenly realized, you know,

792
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:19,240
given what I've told you today,
chemical movement through the atmosphere,

793
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,860
through the environment, you suddenly
realize that the idea of wildness,

794
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,150
the idea of purity,

795
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,490
the idea of environmental quality that
most people have and most people value.

796
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,860
Uh, it's really being challenged by the
way we're using and abusing chemicals so

797
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:40,840
that, uh, the failure of law to
effectively control these chemicals,

798
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,183
uh,

799
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,410
terrain down in the snows and the Wasatch
to get into the bodies of different

800
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:51,880
species of wildlife into the plants
and the animals or the humans that are

801
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:55,960
drinking the water. The failure
to control that is challenging.

802
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Our very sense of what wildness is
of what purity is of what nature is.

803
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,440
So I'm going to close there and
leave you with a sense of challenge,

804
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,720
uh, that, uh, we need to think
about a different system.

805
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,790
We need to think about a different way.

806
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:17,500
For a lot of work that could prevent
this from continuing through future

807
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:20,020
generations. Okay. That's
it for today. Thank you.
