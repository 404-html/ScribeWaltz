1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,453
Okay,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,353
let me start in.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,270
This lecture is about national security
and it's about the conflict that's

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:13,830
evolved during the 20th century between
national security and environmental

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:15,390
quality and human health.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,261
Uh,

7
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:20,790
so I want to explore that because so
much money in the world is spent on

8
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,970
national security and
it has the potential to,

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:24,830
to,

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,200
uh,

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,770
invade individual rights to
diminish personal freedom,

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,380
uh,

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,630
to diminish privacy.

14
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,361
Uh,

15
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:32,161
at the same time,

16
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:36,810
it has a potential to concentrate
power and authority among elites,

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,100
political elites,

18
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,570
a wealthy elites,

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,920
a technical leads,

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:41,641
uh,

21
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:46,641
and so that it's threatening
to a democratic participation
and policymaking in a

22
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,240
variety of ways.

23
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,110
Uh,

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,670
and as we move through the course,

25
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,400
you'll find that secrecy
is not just an issue,

26
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:57,480
that we need to figure out how to manage
better in the public sector relative to

27
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,650
classified information.

28
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,660
And this is the topic of today's session,

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,300
but it's also a critical
issue in the private sector.

30
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:03,910
Uh,

31
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,660
the growing use of confidential
business information.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,110
Uh,

33
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,110
the Goo goo growing obscurity of product
ingredients as a globalized markets

34
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,460
cause products and services
to across national borders,

35
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,880
uh,

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,380
without any clear identity about
a components or potential effects.

37
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,200
So national security and
environmental quality.

38
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,330
I want you to think about this case
and other cases that we deal with as a,

39
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:31,320
a problem of managing intelligence.

40
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,550
I'm not meaning to imply that
other people are not intelligence.

41
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:38,070
I'm thinking about
intelligent and a meaning to,

42
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,490
uh,

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,490
hopefully get you to think about the idea
of a legal system that would produce a

44
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,030
public that was literate and capable
of understanding the quality of the

45
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,080
environment around them.

46
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,530
Uh,

47
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,120
what's threatening and what's not,

48
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,740
so that potentially they could,

49
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,190
they could manage their exposure to a,

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,831
to chemicals,

51
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:56,664
they could manage,

52
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,060
uh,

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,100
the effect of human behavior on,

54
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,563
on a,

55
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:00,841
uh,

56
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,720
a variety of environmental issues
such as endangered species.

57
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,111
So the,

58
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:05,491
the,

59
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:10,260
the purpose for the title of my book
that I'm having you read you poor things,

60
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,860
uh,

61
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,693
is,

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,331
is,

63
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:12,630
uh,

64
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,330
the idea of thinking about
the origin of knowledge.

65
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,931
You know,

66
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:17,310
where do we get the information,

67
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,390
where do we get the data?

68
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,830
Where do we get the knowledge?

69
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,693
Who produces it?

70
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,570
Uh,

71
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,470
and what we'll see today is
that a knowledge about the
environmental effects of

72
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:29,340
national security or produced
predominantly by the Defense Department,

73
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,970
uh,

74
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,940
they control sites are they
control the technology,

75
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,691
uh,

76
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,000
in weaponry and weapons delivery systems,

77
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,421
uh,

78
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:40,530
making it extremely difficult for the
public to understand really what the

79
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,460
dangers might be.

80
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,560
Where does the knowledge flow?

81
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,030
Is it intelligible,

82
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,040
uh,

83
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,480
is it understood the distinction between,

84
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,430
is it intelligible and is it understood,

85
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,450
is really critical?

86
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,760
It involves a literacy,

87
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,231
it,

88
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:54,800
uh,

89
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,940
involves educational background,

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,710
uh,

91
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,220
technical competence and who owns it?

92
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,380
This is really a key question for law.

93
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:02,960
Uh,

94
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,220
you can think about this in terms of
it being an intellectual property,

95
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:06,431
right?

96
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,264
Question.

97
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,710
Should the public own it?

98
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,160
Uh,

99
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,500
should the public be able to keep,

100
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,470
should the government be able to
keep the knowledge from the public?

101
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:14,950
Uh,

102
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,280
should the private sector be allowed
to own it and should they be allowed to

103
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,690
keep knowledge from the public?

104
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,260
So think about it as a problem of
understanding production and flow of

105
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,094
knowledge.

106
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,460
Uh,

107
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,020
because environmental quality is
always going to be elusive until we,

108
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,361
we,

109
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:28,451
uh,

110
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:32,590
create a public that really
is a far more intelligent,

111
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,424
so to speak,

112
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:33,881
uh,

113
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,714
understanding,

114
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,051
uh,

115
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,070
than it currently is.

116
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,320
So what are the purposes of secrecy?

117
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,820
And I'm kind of fascinated by,

118
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,180
uh,

119
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,360
uh,

120
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,220
the growing a classification of
information in the public sector so that,

121
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:45,520
uh,

122
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
in in US history,

123
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,280
never before has the government been
classifying more information than it is

124
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,114
today.

125
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,631
You know,

126
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,291
at the same time,

127
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,250
there's a very interesting,

128
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,840
uh,

129
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,673
uh,

130
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,853
cultural,

131
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,923
uh,

132
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,460
change that we're witnessing
in your generation,

133
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:00,881
uh,

134
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,110
related to Facebook.

135
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,711
I mean,

136
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:06,790
I've never seen a generation be so
interested in revealing secrets or

137
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:11,791
information about themselves as your
generation is so disconnected and in a way

138
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,090
between government policy
and what's going on that,

139
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:16,550
uh,

140
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,810
uh,

141
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,021
in,

142
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,060
in social circles among
younger generations.

143
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,060
How do terror and warfare
depended upon secrecy

144
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,290
when to secrecy threaten
national security?

145
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:27,821
One,

146
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,040
is secrecy necessary
for national security?

147
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,880
Uh,

148
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,530
and how is it related
to individual rights?

149
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,710
These are key questions that I hope you'll
keep in mind as we move through this

150
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,544
lecture today.

151
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,420
They're common scripts
in environmental history,

152
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,950
no matter whether or not you consider
this case or the case of an endangered

153
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,551
species.

154
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,384
A case of,

155
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,120
of uh,

156
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,500
uh,

157
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
managing water quality,

158
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,950
managing a sustainable agriculture
who knew about the problem,

159
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,990
who knew about contaminants in this case?

160
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,250
When did they know,

161
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,330
when do they inform the public and
what do they do about the problem?

162
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,000
These are critical questions and secrecy
is a central component of all of them.

163
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,450
So that the history that I want to go
through today is really one that is very

164
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,600
brief.

165
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,740
It only spans the period
between 1944 and 1963.

166
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,140
So in this period,

167
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,590
uh,

168
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,120
the atomic weapons,

169
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,490
the first atomic weapons
were designed and tested.

170
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,650
The first one at Los Alamos,

171
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,000
New Mexico in 1945 followed by two,

172
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,250
uh,

173
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,940
uses of atomic weapons.

174
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:36,330
The only two aggressive uses in,

175
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,340
in a world history or one on Hiroshima
and the other on Nagasaki killing

176
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,420
hundreds of thousands of people and
resulting in injuries and death and

177
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,340
heritable Muterric stations,

178
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,001
uh,

179
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:49,301
that,

180
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:49,540
uh,

181
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,930
have,

182
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,570
has affected generations of Japanese.

183
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,321
Uh,

184
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,510
so this compressed period
is really quite striking.

185
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,180
Now why in the world would we
be talking about this issue?

186
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,810
Uh,

187
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,040
which seems so old now.

188
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,150
It's part of the Cold War,

189
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:02,740
uh,

190
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,010
in,

191
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,770
in a class on a current
environmental law and policy.

192
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,761
Well,

193
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,320
I'll tell you a bit of a story.

194
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,400
In,

195
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
uh,

196
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,090
2003 I was in the [inaudible]
real book library and if,

197
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,520
I don't know if you have
visited the Beinecke Library,

198
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,860
uh,

199
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,131
but,

200
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:19,250
uh,

201
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,870
it really is a remarkable place.

202
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,790
It's got a wonderful rich
store of information,

203
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,800
especially on the American West.

204
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,431
Uh,

205
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:33,431
but I found out just by surfing the
net that they also have all of Rachel

206
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,910
Carson's original research material.

207
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,571
Now,

208
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,310
Rachel Carson wrote silent spring,

209
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:37,881
uh,

210
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,510
and the sea around us and a number of
other books and his rather famous in that,

211
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,560
uh,

212
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,580
environmental history,

213
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,390
uh,

214
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,590
particularly for her work trying to get
the public to wake up about the dangers

215
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,424
of pesticides,

216
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,060
especially related to wildlife because
she was a wildlife biologist working for

217
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,230
the fish and wildlife service.

218
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:54,861
Well,

219
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:57,230
it turns out that all of her
original research materials,

220
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,410
including about 120 boxes of material,

221
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,160
are stored in the,

222
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,780
in the basement of a key library.

223
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,490
So going through those,

224
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,740
as I was trying to understand
the history of pesticides,

225
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,290
uh,

226
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,550
I found one file that was
on nuclear weapons testing.

227
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,510
Uh,

228
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,850
and that file was incredibly dense.

229
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,720
Uh,

230
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,100
and as she,

231
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,260
as she had conducted a research,

232
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:18,681
by the way,

233
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,960
it's very different than what we do today,

234
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,380
uh,

235
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,720
which when our research
is almost all electronic,

236
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,200
uh,

237
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,420
she would hand copy material.

238
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,560
There were no copy machines,

239
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,010
uh,

240
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,411
that she,

241
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:30,290
she had access to at that point in time.

242
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:30,891
Uh,

243
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:31,970
and then she would write notes,

244
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,721
little side notes,

245
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,160
interpreting it as you went along.

246
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,780
So going through this,

247
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,620
I realized that,

248
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,840
that all of her work on pesticides where
she wondered what happened to them once

249
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:42,674
they were released,

250
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,120
uh,

251
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,970
where they went,

252
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,340
how did they make their way into the soil?

253
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,690
Why we'll wildlife,

254
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,260
uh,

255
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,730
the canaries in the,

256
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:49,851
uh,

257
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:50,481
in the mind,

258
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,314
in a sense.

259
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,551
Uh,

260
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,460
what were the wildlife telling us
about human hazards in human risk?

261
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:55,971
Uh,

262
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,260
and,

263
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,820
and what was wrong with
current law and policy,

264
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,190
uh,

265
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,950
that would allow that kind of release
and a non accountability on the part of,

266
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,000
of the private sector.

267
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,400
So she learned that way of thinking,

268
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,001
uh,

269
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:08,361
that,

270
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:08,720
uh,

271
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,220
that narrative logic,

272
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,611
uh,

273
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,570
she learned that,

274
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,770
uh,

275
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,720
not by studying pesticides,

276
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,850
by looking at the history of the Atomic
Energy Commission in the 1950s and how

277
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:24,410
they came to understand a radionuclides
and what happened to them and the kind

278
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,020
of threat they posed to water quality,

279
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:27,980
to air quality,

280
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,510
how they got into wildlife,

281
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,040
how they got into human tissue.

282
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,540
So this is a story of today.

283
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,880
So the idea that a,

284
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:39,800
the success in any of these
cases is dependent upon
very high quality science is

285
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,030
a very important idea.

286
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,830
And remember what I said the other day,

287
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,521
that,

288
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:43,910
uh,

289
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,070
perhaps 95% of the science,

290
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:46,850
uh,

291
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,140
in the field of environmental science
is conducted in the private sector,

292
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,120
never sees the light of day.

293
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:53,961
Well,

294
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:54,621
in this case,

295
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,650
this is the,

296
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,720
the best example of state
science at an enormous scale.

297
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,100
The Atomic Energy Commission,

298
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:02,730
uh,

299
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,290
had an unlimited budget.

300
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,090
They had unlimited authority,

301
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,661
uh,

302
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:11,661
and they had a unlimited capacity
to tell a story about a danger and,

303
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:12,901
and,

304
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,021
uh,

305
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:13,261
the,

306
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,550
the importance of pursuing a atomic
weapons development in order to protect

307
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:18,450
national security.

308
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,770
So this time span just gives you
the number of tests per year,

309
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,110
uh,

310
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,980
between 1945 or actually
the number of explosions,

311
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,210
1945.

312
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,720
And then 1960 to 1963,

313
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,800
president Kennedy,

314
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,880
uh,

315
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,890
worked too with the Soviets to,

316
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,680
to pass the limited test ban treaty.

317
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,820
And since that time,

318
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,983
uh,

319
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,270
uh,

320
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,650
an atmospheric testing
has been severely limited,

321
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,820
no nuclear test worldwide
between 45 and in [inaudible] 96,

322
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,481
uh,

323
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,710
roughly about 2000,

324
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:51,000
maybe about 2,400.

325
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,650
After 1963,

326
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,740
the majority of tests or the
number of tests actually went up,

327
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,221
uh,

328
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,750
but most of them went underground.

329
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,640
So underground testing has allowed,

330
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,740
and we'll see later on in the,

331
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,723
and the lecture,

332
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,191
uh,

333
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:02,551
that,

334
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:02,761
uh,

335
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,220
there have been certain
parts of the world that,

336
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,341
uh,

337
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:05,890
it's,

338
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,723
it's been agreed,

339
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,231
uh,

340
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,440
among nations that had
this nuclear capacity,

341
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:10,860
uh,

342
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,820
to avoid testing.

343
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,070
So outerspace is now off limits.

344
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,820
Uh,

345
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,460
testing in the South Pacific is now
off limits because it was the site of,

346
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,690
of of many highly intense tests,

347
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,291
uh,

348
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:22,680
of,

349
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,030
of,

350
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,250
uh,

351
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,180
hydrogen bonds.

352
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,640
And also a testing in the,

353
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,570
on the Poles is,

354
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,060
is a restricted by
international agreement.

355
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,770
So this is a very limited period of time
and many people don't understand where

356
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:36,090
these tests were conducted.

357
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,550
Some of the South Atlantic Salmon,

358
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,384
Mississippi,

359
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:39,841
uh,

360
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,070
some in Japan,

361
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,933
New Mexico,

362
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,930
the Pacific Ocean,

363
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,560
uh,

364
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,940
the Nevada test site,

365
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,260
Johnson island,

366
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,120
Christmas Island,

367
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,830
a new attack in Bikini,

368
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,110
which are part of the Marshall
Islands in the Pacific.

369
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,020
I'll be speaking more about this
and show you some film clips,

370
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,591
uh,

371
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:55,950
on,

372
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,100
uh,

373
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,630
next Tuesday when we reconvene.

374
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,860
One interesting aspect of this
history was the behavior of clouds.

375
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:05,694
Fuchs,

376
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,240
uh,

377
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,050
who was a theoretical scientist working
at Los Alamos on the development of the

378
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:10,681
first weapon,

379
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:14,250
the first atomic bomb during what
is known as the Manhattan project.

380
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,590
And he had access to top secret material,

381
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,310
uh,

382
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,941
a very,

383
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,110
very highly skilled,

384
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,460
uh,

385
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,360
a physicist and he passed most of what
he knew onto the Soviets in the late

386
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,260
1940s.

387
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,840
So he was tried and convicted of
espionage and Britain in the 1950s and he

388
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,540
served nine years out
of a 14 year sentence.

389
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,590
This is fascinating to me and think
about the nature of the sanction here so

390
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,710
that the Soviets gained
their understanding of,

391
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,220
of how the U S,

392
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,610
uh,

393
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,560
produced nuclear weapons and
gained an understanding of,

394
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,410
of what our strategy was,

395
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,920
uh,

396
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,000
how we were testing it,

397
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,920
how were we were monitoring the effects,

398
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,900
what the intensity of the radiation was.

399
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,130
And the man,

400
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:53,560
uh,

401
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,030
serves only nine years in prison

402
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,370
lesson is kind of curious.

403
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,670
Uh,

404
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,590
most secrets have very short lives
and the more valuable they are,

405
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,610
uh,

406
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,590
the more limited is her life.

407
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,430
So I think about the idea of creating
a secret as creating a property,

408
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:14,364
right?

409
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,440
And so it creates a property,

410
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:17,000
right?

411
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,370
Uh,

412
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,690
and it's value is,

413
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:21,210
is a dependent on many aspects,

414
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:21,901
uh,

415
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:22,380
of its,

416
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,213
of its character.

417
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,790
And A,

418
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,080
we'll explore that as we move through
the power of explosions on the Bikini

419
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,770
atoll in the South Pacific is something
to take note of a next Tuesday.

420
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,030
We'll come back to this story,

421
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,480
uh,

422
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,120
where the bikini islanders
were removed from their island,

423
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:36,990
uh,

424
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,660
through negotiation and
the use of eminent domain.

425
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,310
And then the u s,

426
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:41,550
uh,

427
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,420
proceeded to a test about 25,

428
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:47,490
26 different nuclear weapons,

429
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,870
including the,

430
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:49,000
uh,

431
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the Bravo test in 1954 a that I'll show
you a clip of a in which was one of the

432
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:57,600
largest bombs ever exploded
by the u s in the atmosphere.

433
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,733
Okay.

434
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,410
The Atomic Energy Commission,

435
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:01,830
uh,

436
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,350
created what they called Project Gabriel,

437
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,320
uh,

438
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,260
evolved to be called project sunshine.

439
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,801
Uh,

440
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,500
that lasted between 1949 and 1961.

441
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,941
So project,

442
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:12,960
sunset sunshine,

443
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,670
I became famous and it was the,

444
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,190
a collection of scientists
and the government,

445
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:17,630
uh,

446
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:17,820
uh,

447
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,020
working with the atomic energy commission
based predominantly at the University

448
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,550
of Chicago and Columbia University,

449
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,050
the Lamont laboratories.

450
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,850
So scientists were given,

451
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,030
uh,

452
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,301
you know,

453
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:32,301
virtually unlimited funds to conduct
research that would help the atomic energy

454
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:34,230
commission.

455
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,450
Understand the power of
their different weapons.

456
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,620
And there's some 200 different types of,

457
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,350
of nuclear weapons eventually that were,

458
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,393
were designed,

459
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,971
uh,

460
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:42,310
and,

461
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,420
uh,

462
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,781
some,

463
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,160
uh,

464
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,410
uh,

465
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,150
so large that they had to
redesign aircraft in order to,

466
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,860
to handle the weight and others so small
that they could be tactically carried

467
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,694
in a suitcase,

468
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,610
uh,

469
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,230
and,

470
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,531
and,

471
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:52,710
uh,

472
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,920
be used under a field conditions
that were very difficult.

473
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,230
A different delivery mechanisms,

474
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,420
a delivery by aircraft delivery,

475
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:01,254
by missile,

476
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,630
a delivery by a artillery,

477
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,820
a delivery by suitcase.

478
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,571
So that,

479
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:06,900
uh,

480
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,141
you know,

481
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:10,470
a variety of different types of
bombs have different strengths.

482
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:10,770
And,

483
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,070
uh,

484
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,903
we're,

485
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
we're designed for different,

486
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:14,000
uh,

487
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,833
uh,

488
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,810
types of warfare.

489
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,920
So the sunshine scientist really
ramped up in the early 1950s.

490
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,150
And what's interesting is the way that
they thought about environmental science,

491
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,080
uh,

492
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,710
they wondered what happened
to the radionuclides no,

493
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,250
where do they go when a bomb explodes?

494
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,084
What happens?

495
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,660
Well,

496
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:30,811
you know,

497
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:33,120
dust particles get blown
up into the atmosphere.

498
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:33,630
Uh,

499
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,490
if you drop a bomb and shallow water,

500
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:36,181
it will take,

501
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:36,560
uh,

502
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:36,690
uh,

503
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,390
the material on the bottom of the water.

504
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,390
It will take the fish.

505
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,560
Then it will basically blow everything
up and the coral up into the end of the

506
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:44,394
atmosphere.

507
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,031
Uh,

508
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:45,930
it will also,

509
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,390
uh,

510
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,950
uh,

511
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,320
kill any birds that,

512
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:48,720
uh,

513
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,310
are in close proximity.

514
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,890
So test has a story about a bird's
raining from the sky on fire.

515
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,580
Uh,

516
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,500
it will also cause a pattern of movement
in the atmosphere that depends very

517
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,540
much upon climate and wind conditions.

518
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,320
Uh,

519
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,440
and the power of the bomb determines
how high up into the atmosphere of the

520
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,274
particles get.

521
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,350
So dozens and dozens of different new
clients or created a that some of which

522
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,540
had never been recognized before.

523
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,680
So trying to figure this out,

524
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,360
one of the first things they did was they
set up a monitoring system that makes

525
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,930
sense if you want to figure
out where something is going.

526
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,890
He set up a monitoring system.

527
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,510
In this case it was rather simplistic,

528
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,080
uh,

529
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,561
around,

530
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:30,800
uh,

531
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,870
the Nevada test site north of Las Vegas,

532
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,100
about 65 miles.

533
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,840
And people used to cluster on top.

534
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,110
So the casinos and the hotels
in the evening to watch the,

535
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:39,201
uh,

536
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,630
the bombs explode or get up really
early in the morning to watch the bombs

537
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:43,464
explode,

538
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,600
a highly visible,

539
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,310
given the,

540
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,340
the clear climate.

541
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,950
So they set up their monitors and they,

542
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,400
they presume that a,

543
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,190
or they'd captured the dispersal of Rec,

544
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,880
uh,

545
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,713
radiation.

546
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,351
Uh,

547
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:56,270
and then they began to get reports.

548
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,570
Our reports came in from
different parts of the country.

549
00:15:59,720 --> 00:15:59,960
Uh,

550
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,260
some in North Dakota from people
that were mining for uranium,

551
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,160
uh,

552
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,461
that,

553
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:04,730
uh,

554
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,140
had carried Geiger counters.

555
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,960
And a one minor,

556
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:08,800
uh,

557
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,290
was,

558
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,180
was telling a story where he was eating
dinner at his campfire with his guy or

559
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,000
counter that he forgot to turn off
and the Geiger counter stopped,

560
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,520
started to spit,

561
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,513
split out,

562
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,680
and he,

563
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:21,920
Shit,

564
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,130
ah,

565
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,341
boy,

566
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:22,551
you know,

567
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:23,780
I've got to have this thing serviced.

568
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:23,961
It's,

569
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,010
it must be out of tune.

570
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,370
It must be a detecting
something that a is not there.

571
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
So he took it in to have it
serviced and found out that it was,

572
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,510
it was actually,

573
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,100
uh,

574
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,430
in,

575
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,760
in great tune and didn't need to be
recalibrated and went back to his site and

576
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,594
it happened again.

577
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,910
So he realized that,

578
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:41,330
uh,

579
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,610
gradually that something was
going on in the atmosphere.

580
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,390
It wasn't measuring anything in the
mine or a in nearby rock because it,

581
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,090
it normally in that place would be a,

582
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,933
would be silent.

583
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,140
He was picking up radionuclides that
were raining down in North Dakota.

584
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,770
A Polaroid became important in the
process of understanding the distribution

585
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,030
Polaroid film company,

586
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,541
uh,

587
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,650
because it's film was found to be exposed
when it arrived at doctor's offices

588
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,360
and hospitals in different
parts of the world.

589
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,920
And at that point in time,

590
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:10,760
they used to to,

591
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:10,910
uh,

592
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,470
put,

593
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,840
uh,

594
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,340
the Polaroid film,

595
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,301
uh,

596
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:14,661
the,

597
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:15,050
uh,

598
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,231
you know,

599
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:19,520
eight and a half by 11 sheets into boxes
and then they would pack the boxes,

600
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:19,821
you know,

601
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:24,050
not with the Styrofoam kernels that
we use today that will never go away.

602
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,651
Uh,

603
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:28,340
but instead they used to
pack it with corn husks.

604
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,530
So gradually they,

605
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:30,890
uh,

606
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,220
uh,

607
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,620
figured it out because they
could see in some cases,

608
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,011
uh,

609
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,480
the image of the Corn Husk,

610
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:36,410
uh,

611
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,190
on top of the,

612
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,491
the,

613
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:37,611
uh,

614
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,890
the film matching directly.

615
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,210
So what was happening?

616
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,020
Well,

617
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,890
the radionuclides,

618
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,390
we're intersecting a cloud.

619
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:45,740
They were raining down in this case,

620
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,540
in the Midwestern part
of the United States,

621
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,081
uh,

622
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,760
where the box had been and the corn husks,

623
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,301
uh,

624
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:54,120
we're exposing the film because
they had absorbed the radionuclides.

625
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,790
So they realized gradually that their
donut 200 miles in diameter around Las

626
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,420
Vegas was a completely inappropriate
to capture the scale of this problem.

627
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,900
This is a very important lesson in
environmental science and environmental

628
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,040
policy policy.

629
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,791
It's like,

630
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,300
uh,

631
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,080
uh,

632
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,381
you know,

633
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:10,660
the,

634
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,280
uh,

635
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,570
uh,

636
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:11,890
the,

637
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,680
the analogy of the drunk leaning on a,

638
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,010
a light post looking for his,

639
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:17,280
uh,

640
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,150
his car keys.

641
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:18,870
Uh,

642
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,370
why is he looking under the light post?

643
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,680
That's because that's
where the light is a,

644
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:24,330
so that there are many,

645
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:27,930
many different stories about the
failure of environmental science,

646
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:28,681
uh,

647
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:33,000
and the ineffectiveness of environmental
law that flow from this problem of

648
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,890
misunderstanding the need for a
very sensitive sampling design.

649
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,143
In this case,

650
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,160
the stokes test in 1957 put
radionuclides into the atmosphere,

651
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,670
but they started moving in different
directions at different altitudes.

652
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,091
Ooh,

653
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:50,310
there's an interesting idea that's novel.

654
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:50,820
Uh,

655
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,320
no one thought about that before.

656
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,340
So here are the dashed line at the
bottom is moving at 30,000 feet,

657
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,140
whereas it just nix the
southeast side of Idaho.

658
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,590
Uh,

659
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,850
whereas the dust at 10,000 feet
shoots all the way up to Montana,

660
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,160
then it arcs up over southern Canada,

661
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,080
comes back over the Great Lakes,

662
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,430
and you see that arc of the dashed
line coming and breakdown across lake

663
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,570
Champlain and the New York,

664
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,404
Vermont border,

665
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,150
the Massachusetts New York border,

666
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,500
and then the Connecticut border.

667
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,131
Well,

668
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,150
that's pretty interesting.

669
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,630
Uh,

670
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,370
another test that they followed
created dust clouds that,

671
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:25,890
uh,

672
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,311
again,

673
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,870
we're driven by weather patterns.

674
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,140
And you see in this case
that a at 30,000 feet,

675
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,450
one swirled around Texas for about a week,

676
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,870
another one swooped all the way at 20,000
feet down into Florida and probably

677
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,900
would have been detected in if they had
rainstorms in Florida at the time of the

678
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,280
dust dust cloud that got there,

679
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,340
that would have been detectable.

680
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,790
And in the orange,

681
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,950
orange is an orange juice
and a in orange oils,

682
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:50,731
uh,

683
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,331
so that,

684
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:51,451
uh,

685
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:55,920
crops were being threatened and exposed
and in a variety of different ways that

686
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:56,161
a,

687
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,000
we're being driven by weather patterns
and we all know that even today it's hard

688
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:04,170
to predict what the weather's going to
be a within 36 hours in many parts of the

689
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:04,740
country.

690
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,341
So that,

691
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:05,910
uh,

692
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,270
the,

693
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,790
the,

694
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,710
the state of weather forecasting back
at this time was quite primitive.

695
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,191
Uh,

696
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:13,290
so that basically told
these scientists and,

697
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:13,681
and again,

698
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:17,400
I can just imagine what they were doing
sitting across the table looking at each

699
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:17,850
other.

700
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,080
How are we gonna manage this?

701
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,540
What's going to happen if
the public understands this?

702
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,590
How are we going to maintain
our political support for the,

703
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,700
the weapons testing program so that we
can keep on building these weapons to

704
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,130
contain the Soviet sorta to strike fear
into their hearts following their policy

705
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:35,964
of deterrence.

706
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,110
The bigger the bomb,

707
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,520
the less likely we are to be attacked
by a other nations that would understand

708
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:43,980
that an attack would be simply suicide.

709
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,793
Well,

710
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,270
here is a chart which is an
amalgamation of different,

711
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,230
uh,

712
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:53,410
uh,

713
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,600
bomb blasts in the
pathways that they took.

714
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,160
A and the darkest areas are areas that
received the highest doses of radiation.

715
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,031
And,

716
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:01,211
uh,

717
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,820
these new Clyde's have half
lives that vary between,

718
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:04,270
uh,

719
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,631
uh,

720
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,201
roughly,

721
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:05,540
uh,

722
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,020
uh,

723
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,550
three to four weeks up to a 40,

724
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:10,300
50,

725
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,230
a hundred years.

726
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:11,580
Uh,

727
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,970
so that if you went to the,

728
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,180
to the center of the country in,

729
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,830
in Iowa and you took a test of the soil,

730
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,100
you could still detect many of these
radionuclides in the soil and they are

731
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:24,340
transferable from soil to crops and,

732
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,950
and up to,

733
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,140
uh,

734
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,973
to fruits.

735
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,430
So that,

736
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:27,880
uh,

737
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,880
this patchiness and fallout was
eventually recognized by the Atomic Energy

738
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,560
Commission in the mid 1950s and gradually,

739
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,801
you know,

740
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:39,100
once this information was
declassified in the early 1990s.

741
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,000
And the only reason I'm telling you this
story is because most of this knowledge

742
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,560
was eventually declassified.

743
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,611
I couldn't be here,

744
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:46,780
which is kind of an interesting thought.

745
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:48,790
I couldn't be here right
now telling you the story.

746
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,390
Uh,

747
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,430
had the declassification process not,

748
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:53,380
not occurred under the
Clinton administration,

749
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,071
uh,

750
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,910
once they realized that that the atomic
energy commission that kept all this

751
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:58,744
information,

752
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,380
uh,

753
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,220
from the public when they really had
no national security logic to do so.

754
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,540
So here is a,

755
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,870
a,

756
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,991
uh,

757
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,320
a map of the United States constructed
by the National Cancer Institute,

758
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:08,690
uh,

759
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,030
in the late 1990s,

760
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,390
uh,

761
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,380
that tick the dose estimates that they
got from the soils because they could

762
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:15,011
calculate back,

763
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:19,150
calculate the concentrations from existing
concentrations and knowing the decay

764
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,320
rate of different new Clyde's.

765
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,840
And they develop this map of,

766
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,280
of expected doses.

767
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,030
And then,

768
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,360
uh,

769
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,680
the,

770
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,850
the cancer institutes
started asking questions,

771
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,280
uh,

772
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,960
because they understood the dose
response relationship for radiation.

773
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,000
And these new Clyde's
is really pretty clear.

774
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,440
This is not like a,

775
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,041
you know,

776
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,874
you have to drink,

777
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,560
uh,

778
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,000
10,000 cans of Diet soda
to absorb Enough Sacrum to,

779
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,190
uh,

780
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,460
to,

781
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,350
to elevate your cancer risk a little bit.

782
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,130
Uh,

783
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,521
this is,

784
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:45,820
uh,

785
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,050
this is a science that,

786
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:47,490
uh,

787
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:47,741
uh,

788
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,280
are,

789
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,491
uh,

790
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:51,710
evolved in the 1950s largely because of,

791
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,800
of the importance to the military,

792
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,280
uh,

793
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,950
that understood the dose
response relationship,

794
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,730
uh,

795
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,810
quite clearly.

796
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,183
So,

797
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,160
but understanding a dose response
relationship ship meaning,

798
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,731
let's see,

799
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:06,430
the best way to explain dose
response relationship if you,

800
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:07,750
if it's not familiar to you,

801
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,501
is to,

802
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:08,810
uh,

803
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,070
uh,

804
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,620
especially for college
students is to think about,

805
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,240
uh,

806
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,880
uh,

807
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,960
a six pack of beer.

808
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,000
So he six pack of Beer,

809
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,380
you have one beer and you know,

810
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,610
you might feel a little bit of it.

811
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,220
Uh,

812
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,053
you have two beers,

813
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,060
two beers within 15 minutes.

814
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,170
I know you'd never do that.

815
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,313
Uh,

816
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,350
you have three beers within 20 minutes.

817
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,860
Uh,

818
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,110
you have six beers within a an hour.

819
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,740
Uh,

820
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,311
so that,

821
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:30,890
uh,

822
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,200
the,

823
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
the effect that you feel
the effect on your body,

824
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,000
uh,

825
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,230
depends upon the dose and
the concentration that
you're actually a circulating

826
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,064
in your system.

827
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,930
So they understood this relationship,

828
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,231
uh,

829
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:45,190
with great clarity with respect to
these radionuclides so that the cancer

830
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,760
estimates really are quite robust.

831
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,800
One interesting thing is that if you look
at the pattern of testing that really

832
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,890
it peaked in the late 1950s,

833
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,401
uh,

834
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:55,971
so that,

835
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:56,061
uh,

836
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:56,810
you see,

837
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,643
you see,

838
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,220
uh,

839
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,220
this is radionuclides in rainwater and
then there was an agreement not to test

840
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,930
for a period of two years.

841
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,120
And you see that the rain
water levels decline.

842
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,260
It's in the rainwater.

843
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:09,740
Hmm.

844
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,573
That's interesting.

845
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,630
It's in the rainwater.

846
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,250
What does that mean for a fish?

847
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,450
What does it mean for rivers?

848
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,860
What does it mean for,

849
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:16,070
uh,

850
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,940
parts of the West that a experience,

851
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:19,160
high levels of snowpack?

852
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,660
Well,

853
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,270
it means that a snowpack,

854
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:22,761
uh,

855
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:23,511
for example,

856
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:23,660
uh,

857
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,141
Jackson,

858
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:24,681
Wyoming,

859
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:25,730
a couple of years ago,

860
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,230
a Jackson Hole,

861
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:30,620
Wyoming received more than
600 inches of snow in,

862
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,473
in one year.

863
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,460
And in a matter of a about a month,

864
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,060
uh,

865
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,520
in,

866
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,210
in the period between
April and a late May,

867
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:38,930
uh,

868
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,960
you get basically warmer
weather melting all the snow.

869
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,550
So in this period of time,

870
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:44,570
you get this rush,

871
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:48,740
you get this pulse of radioactive
water that moves into a stream.

872
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,940
And Lo and behold,

873
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,930
where could you test that?

874
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:51,801
Well,

875
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:53,960
you could test that in
the supermarket where,

876
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,270
and in what supermarket
and Salmon Supermarkets,

877
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,320
Trod supermarket buying
Trenton sooner supermarket,

878
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,660
you could find,

879
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:01,990
uh,

880
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,450
uh,

881
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,970
these levels increasing in the,

882
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,710
in the Columbia River,

883
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,110
uh,

884
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,130
that goes by the Hanford
uranium enrichment plant,

885
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,670
plutonium enrichment plant in
Washington and the state of Washington.

886
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,270
So the water levels concentrations
were going up because the rainwater

887
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,081
concentration,

888
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:20,840
we're going up and the fish
concentrations were going up.

889
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,400
Uh,

890
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,800
and also people that were drinking water
out of wells that were fed underground

891
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,620
by the aquifer from the Hanford area,

892
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,210
they were also being exposed.

893
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,720
The per capita dose
was calculated as well.

894
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:33,381
And you see the,

895
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:33,471
uh,

896
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:36,790
the dip between 1960 January of 1960,

897
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,480
uh,

898
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,881
and,

899
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:38,150
uh,

900
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,250
late 1962 during the,

901
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:40,640
uh,

902
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:40,821
uh,

903
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:41,430
agreed,

904
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,020
uh,

905
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,160
cessation of testing.

906
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,380
So this information was,

907
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:46,280
was really quite,

908
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,683
quite robust.

909
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,850
So project sunshine,

910
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,420
uh,

911
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,050
basically pieced together this idea
that these new Clyde's were in global

912
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:54,884
circulation.

913
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,311
Uh,

914
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:58,010
they were contaminating every
aspect of our environment,

915
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,600
uh,

916
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,000
and they were making their way
into humans and particularly,

917
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,450
uh,

918
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,500
uh,

919
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,540
they were concerned about strontium 90.

920
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,374
Because,

921
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,620
uh,

922
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,840
if you have a diet that is low in calcium,

923
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,660
your body's going to absorb more
strontium 90 into your bone.

924
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,490
Uh,

925
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:12,951
also,

926
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:13,550
if you have,

927
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,010
uh,

928
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,843
uh,

929
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,320
uh,

930
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,930
a diet that's low in iodine,

931
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,560
your thyroid is going
to absorb more iodine,

932
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,290
uh,

933
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,200
one 31 than it normally would.

934
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,820
So understanding this,

935
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:26,150
uh,

936
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,570
uh,

937
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,950
this relationship between,

938
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,053
uh,

939
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,080
uh,

940
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,850
calcium and strontium 90 is very important
because it eventually led to calcium

941
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:37,910
enrichment of breads a of milk.

942
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,261
Uh,

943
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:40,790
so the four fortification
program was really,

944
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,873
uh,

945
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,380
it really had its origination and
recommendations by the Atomic Energy

946
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,620
Commission.

947
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,610
So the public thought,

948
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:47,911
oh,

949
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:49,710
we're just getting more minerals in our,

950
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:50,544
in our diet.

951
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:50,761
Well,

952
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:51,660
that must be a good thing.

953
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:54,510
The nutritionist must be arguing
that this makes a lot of sense.

954
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,180
Uh,

955
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,400
but in reality,

956
00:26:56,401 --> 00:27:00,990
what was going on was that the Atomic
Energy Commission was a anxiously wringing

957
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:01,621
his hands,

958
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,440
recognizing that they've got to
figure out how to lower the dose being

959
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:05,820
experienced in the population.

960
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,030
The population had no
idea what was going on.

961
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,520
So project sunshine scientists,

962
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:13,920
they eventually attained 15,000 bodies,

963
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,001
dead bodies,

964
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,040
trying to understand the
distribution of these,

965
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,440
uh,

966
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,900
new Clyde's throughout the world.

967
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,620
Uh,

968
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,550
bodies from New York,

969
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:21,121
San Francisco,

970
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:21,840
Houston,

971
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,080
uh,

972
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,591
Japan,

973
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:23,071
India,

974
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:23,851
South Africa.

975
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,200
Why from other nations?

976
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,980
Well,

977
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,890
predominantly because they were
worried about the other nations,

978
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,820
uh,

979
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,900
coming back and,

980
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:31,231
and,

981
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:31,740
uh,

982
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,160
uh,

983
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,370
telling the United States that we
were contaminating not only their food

984
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:35,881
supplies,

985
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:37,080
which was going to harm their,

986
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,810
their ability to trade
products internationally,

987
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,290
uh,

988
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,310
processed foods,

989
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:41,850
uh,

990
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,390
uh,

991
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,220
water,

992
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,053
uh,

993
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,000
just about any kind of of,

994
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,490
uh,

995
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:46,950
uh,

996
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,560
crop you could think
of as well as animals.

997
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,250
Uh,

998
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,031
so that,

999
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:51,300
uh,

1000
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,180
gradually over the period
between 1955 in 1960,

1001
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,350
the atomic energy commission,

1002
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,280
uh,

1003
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,100
grew to really understand the
global distributional pattern.

1004
00:27:59,390 --> 00:27:59,590
Uh,

1005
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,240
and how,

1006
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,340
how people in certain areas of,

1007
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,330
of Latin America,

1008
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,200
in tropical areas,

1009
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:07,230
we're really experiencing
quite high levels of fallout.

1010
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,220
Why would that be a tropical rain forest?

1011
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,940
They experience intense rainfall,

1012
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,601
uh,

1013
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:13,171
so that,

1014
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:13,321
uh,

1015
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,180
the rain was so high that it would,

1016
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,200
it would concentrate the,

1017
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,790
the new Clyde's in,

1018
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,100
in,

1019
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,380
uh,

1020
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,940
some of the tropical forest areas.

1021
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,210
So permission to take the body
parts was never sought or obtained.

1022
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,920
A family members were,

1023
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,030
were never consulted.

1024
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:27,780
Uh,

1025
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,120
bones were cleaned and
packaged and formalin,

1026
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:30,770
uh,

1027
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,500
and then they were crushed and analyzed
by laboratory technicians at Columbia

1028
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,500
and other prestige has us institutions,

1029
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,640
academic institutions,

1030
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,170
uh,

1031
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,220
and sometimes the bones
were pooled together.

1032
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:41,760
Uh,

1033
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,900
gradually they decided that they were
going to look for geographic variability

1034
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,140
and there are going to look for age
related variability because they were

1035
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,730
finding that a kids,

1036
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,640
for some reason we're absorbing
more of the radionuclides,

1037
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:55,560
especially strontium than the adults were.

1038
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,970
So why would that be?

1039
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,560
Cause it's something about their diet.

1040
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,690
Was there something
about their physiology?

1041
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,620
Well,

1042
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,580
it had to do with their,

1043
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:04,980
their rate of growth of bone.

1044
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,380
So kids are,

1045
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,000
kids are,

1046
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,840
are growing most rapidly at
what point in their lives?

1047
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,110
Well,

1048
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,360
uh,

1049
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,840
from time of conception
roughly till the time of 13,

1050
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,740
but different organ systems and
different functions in the body,

1051
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,020
a mature at different rates.

1052
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,500
So statute statute for example,

1053
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:27,090
is quite linear,

1054
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,970
although you get this
really serious growth curve,

1055
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,750
um,

1056
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,170
uh,

1057
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,650
in,

1058
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,483
in Utero,

1059
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,260
and then it goes up gradually,

1060
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:35,094
gradually,

1061
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,930
and then a more steeply,

1062
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,530
uh,

1063
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,970
during the early teenage years.

1064
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,950
So you could figure out the,

1065
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,860
that were correlated with these periods
of rapid growth and development.

1066
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,120
So,

1067
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,301
you know,

1068
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:46,990
gradually,

1069
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,230
uh,

1070
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,390
these secrets started to leak out.

1071
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,410
Uh,

1072
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,410
and the US began to study fallout data
and once the Soviets had developed their

1073
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,020
own capacity to make them
10 test a nuclear weapons,

1074
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,450
the atomic energy commission
had this great argument.

1075
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,101
Well,

1076
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,290
there are new collides in our
food supply and in our bodies,

1077
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,380
it's not our fault while we
take some responsibility,

1078
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,730
but it's the Soviets fault.

1079
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,240
And Soviets were actually testing
these weapons up in Siberia.

1080
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:13,930
Uh,

1081
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,760
and so the Siberian radionuclides work
tended to come down across Alaska and

1082
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,520
across Canada and into the,

1083
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:20,801
the,

1084
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:20,890
uh,

1085
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,030
western and Midwestern
part of the u s so in,

1086
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:24,271
in,

1087
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:27,850
in threads that are similar to the ones
that I showed you from the Nevada test

1088
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:28,684
site.

1089
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,561
So the,

1090
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,394
the U S was,

1091
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,380
was trying to at this point,

1092
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:35,320
desperately maintain public
support for continued testing.

1093
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:35,981
Uh,

1094
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,510
in part because they were wondering,

1095
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:38,020
well,

1096
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,470
you know,

1097
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,990
what would happen if we did have a,

1098
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,350
a,

1099
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:40,431
a,

1100
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:41,620
a nuclear war,

1101
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,431
you know,

1102
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:42,701
what,

1103
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:47,080
where would the new Clyde's go and what
would our capacity to respond to me?

1104
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,020
So these were legitimate
national security concerns,

1105
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:50,500
uh,

1106
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,520
that they were exploring.

1107
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,510
So,

1108
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:52,860
uh,

1109
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,860
the u s began to release
some of its information at
the same time that a state's

1110
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:00,310
started their own testing programs.

1111
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,211
So you know,

1112
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:01,751
just like,

1113
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:02,330
um,

1114
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:02,530
uh,

1115
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,460
you find variability and air pollution
today from a motor vehicles depending

1116
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:07,390
upon climate and,

1117
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,000
and,

1118
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,140
uh,

1119
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,381
we're,

1120
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:10,000
our vehicle uses most intense,

1121
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,511
uh,

1122
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:11,071
you find,

1123
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:11,320
uh,

1124
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,150
in this case a states being worried about
a specific patterns of concentration

1125
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,520
in the crops that they grow.

1126
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,051
Vermont cheese,

1127
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:20,884
for example,

1128
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,170
a or a mid western grains,

1129
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,100
uh,

1130
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,870
or a cattle grazed in,

1131
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,050
uh,

1132
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,520
in the western us.

1133
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,511
So Minnesota,

1134
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:33,511
Vermont and other states felt like they
were environmental hotspots and they,

1135
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:34,414
that they're,

1136
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,080
uh,

1137
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,490
corporations were being hindered,

1138
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:37,870
their capacity to trade,

1139
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,560
uh,

1140
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,470
nationally and internationally
was being diminished.

1141
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,510
The U s finally started a,

1142
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,370
an open test,

1143
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:48,640
a of milk for radioactivity in 1957,

1144
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,560
12 years after the explosions began,

1145
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,111
uh,

1146
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:53,350
and Linus Pauling who won the Nobel prize

1147
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,770
for his work on nutrition,

1148
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,900
particularly related to vitamin C,

1149
00:31:59,130 --> 00:31:59,530
uh,

1150
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,363
came out with,

1151
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,150
with his conclusion that the body really
discriminates against strontium and

1152
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:07,480
favors calcium uptake if the
calcium levels were high enough.

1153
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,030
Uh,

1154
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,920
that prompted the,

1155
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:09,070
uh,

1156
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,040
the addition of a,

1157
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,680
of a calcium is how I was saying to
milk bread and animal feeds as well as

1158
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:15,520
fertilizers.

1159
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,280
So this is quite,

1160
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:19,114
quite curious.

1161
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,770
Surgeon General,

1162
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,430
uh,

1163
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,830
for the u s denied that the
fallout hazards were serious in,

1164
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,490
in the New York Times in 1959.

1165
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,421
And,

1166
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:28,840
uh,

1167
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,291
so there was,

1168
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:32,920
there was really quite an open public
debate in late in the late fifties,

1169
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,590
in part that surrounded Eisenhower's
campaign to become president again in,

1170
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:37,850
in,

1171
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,500
uh,

1172
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,410
1956.

1173
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:42,410
And his competitor was his vice
president Adelai Stephenson.

1174
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,900
So Stephenson,

1175
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,150
uh,

1176
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,880
basically broke the news that,

1177
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,110
uh,

1178
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,420
the atomic energy commission had been
hiding this information from the public.

1179
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,201
And,

1180
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:53,350
uh,

1181
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,781
in the,

1182
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,420
in this last minute a campaign effort,

1183
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,050
uh,

1184
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,500
he,

1185
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,260
he claimed that there were genetic
hazards to future generation,

1186
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,360
a risk of bone cancer and,

1187
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:02,451
uh,

1188
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,910
the inability to conduct
medical investigations.

1189
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,870
Now this is interesting.

1190
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,500
Uh,

1191
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,190
so that,

1192
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,491
that,

1193
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:07,701
uh,

1194
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:10,430
there's exposure that is universal.

1195
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,470
Everybody's exposed
because everybody eats.

1196
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,280
Uh,

1197
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,240
and that means that,

1198
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:19,190
that you really don't have any opportunity
for scientific control group that has

1199
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:22,370
unexposed to figure out what the
long term health effects might be.

1200
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,240
13 yell scientists including
Arthur Gauston of the
biology department who passed

1201
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,074
away just a,

1202
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,550
uh,

1203
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,050
a few years ago assigned a statement,

1204
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:34,670
a endorsing the views of Stevenson.

1205
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:38,210
Stevenson lost Eisenhower
became president again.

1206
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:38,871
And,

1207
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:39,111
uh,

1208
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:41,120
what was interesting
about it is that that,

1209
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:41,720
uh,

1210
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,070
transcripts from his,

1211
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,581
his,

1212
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:43,730
uh,

1213
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,730
conferences is a national security,

1214
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,120
uh,

1215
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,850
team,

1216
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,021
uh,

1217
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,660
had been released in
the late 1990s as well.

1218
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,070
And Co and Eisenhower,

1219
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,320
uh,

1220
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,660
eventually got to the point where
he was telling his staff that,

1221
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:57,130
uh,

1222
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:57,440
uh,

1223
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,990
the levels are radionuclides
in the milk supply.

1224
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,600
The buildup and especially in,

1225
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:01,900
in,

1226
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,060
uh,

1227
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,900
children's bones was unacceptable and
something was going to have to happen.

1228
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,320
And that prompted him to be
more aggressive in trying to,

1229
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:09,851
to,

1230
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:10,684
uh,

1231
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,170
negotiate with the Soviets,

1232
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:12,680
uh,

1233
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,110
to,

1234
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,280
uh,

1235
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,820
to create some sort of a treaty that
would reduce atmospheric testing.

1236
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,570
So I'm going to jump ahead here
so I don't run out of time.

1237
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,830
The atomic energy commission also
was found to have withheld data,

1238
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,870
recognizing that there were these
spikes in the New York City,

1239
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,580
uh,

1240
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:28,880
uh,

1241
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,750
milk supplies,

1242
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,530
uh,

1243
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,490
data that was collected just prior to
the election that they understood posed a

1244
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:34,970
problem.

1245
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,980
They held that until
weeks after the election.

1246
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,870
So it's kind of curious that
milk became the standard for,

1247
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,050
for trying to figure out,

1248
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:42,660
uh,

1249
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,820
where the chemicals when,

1250
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,720
especially powdered buttermilk
because it's dehydrated form,

1251
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,151
uh,

1252
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:48,984
it was easy to,

1253
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,180
to send around the country.

1254
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,710
And this chart I think is also
interesting because remember that the,

1255
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,131
the,

1256
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:55,460
uh,

1257
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,790
uh,

1258
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,280
limited test ban treaty of 1963,

1259
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,240
uh,

1260
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,280
really stopped protesting cold.

1261
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,650
And what you see is a gradual decline,

1262
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,250
uh,

1263
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,350
in worldwide,

1264
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,420
a fallout a represented by strontium 90,

1265
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:10,220
and CCM one's 37 and milk.

1266
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,840
So you see this gradual decline because
of the residency time in the atmosphere

1267
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,220
so that these chemicals,

1268
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:16,670
uh,

1269
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,121
don't,

1270
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:17,570
uh,

1271
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,730
don't all wash out like quickly,

1272
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,081
uh,

1273
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:21,470
after the explosions,

1274
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,360
they go into global circulation.

1275
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
And there was great
debate at the time about,

1276
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:25,581
uh,

1277
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:25,711
the,

1278
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:28,010
the amount of time that they
stayed in the atmosphere.

1279
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,050
And the atomic energy
commission was arguing,

1280
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:30,831
don't worry about it.

1281
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:33,380
They're going to stay in the
atmosphere for a long period of time.

1282
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,930
Why would they use that logic while they,

1283
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:37,530
one of the radiation to dissipate?

1284
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,680
So that by the time the new Clyde's got
down to the ground that they wouldn't

1285
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,630
pose such an intense radiation threat.

1286
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,060
Now that's kind of an interesting story.

1287
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,790
So environmentalist's and,

1288
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,110
and,

1289
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,220
uh,

1290
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,650
public health advocates were arguing,

1291
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,250
no,

1292
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,260
you don't understand this
pattern of deposition.

1293
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,710
Uh,

1294
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,460
it's often,

1295
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,430
it's often more quickly
that it reaches the ground,

1296
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,300
uh,

1297
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,810
in a,

1298
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,200
in a higher concentrate
and that higher intensity,

1299
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:01,770
uh,

1300
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,603
of radiation.

1301
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,511
So that,

1302
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:04,300
uh,

1303
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,680
uh,

1304
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,510
this story played out over the
1970s and 1980s until gradually,

1305
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:09,850
uh,

1306
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,710
you find,

1307
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,120
uh,

1308
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,720
uh,

1309
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,750
1995,

1310
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:16,080
it really leveling off
to what it is today.

1311
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:17,581
Curiously,

1312
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,170
you see the spike and CCM,

1313
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:21,810
one 37 in 1987,

1314
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,830
1986,

1315
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:23,790
1987.

1316
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,130
Anybody have any idea what that might be?

1317
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,223
Chernobyl.

1318
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Chernobyl released more CCM one 37 to
the atmosphere after the explosion that,

1319
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,610
where the dome with a building,

1320
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,790
uh,

1321
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,740
blew off.

1322
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,311
And,

1323
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:38,431
uh,

1324
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:42,060
there was a fire that was
uncontainable for a period of weeks,

1325
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,060
spewed more radiation into the
atmosphere in the form of cesium one 37.

1326
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,410
Then many of the earlier
atmospheric weapons tests did.

1327
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,850
So,

1328
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,610
um,

1329
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,020
I began by telling you that,

1330
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:55,530
uh,

1331
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:55,651
uh,

1332
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:57,180
under conditions of secrecy,

1333
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,630
uh,

1334
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,180
the people that hold
power over the secret,

1335
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:00,720
uh,

1336
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,340
have great narrative advantage.

1337
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,160
They not only control the,

1338
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:05,571
the,

1339
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:06,750
the search for the data,

1340
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:11,610
they control it's interpretation and
they control the story that's told to the

1341
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:12,444
general public.

1342
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,110
And a couple of elements of the story
are kind of fun to think about because

1343
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:16,944
we'll see these,

1344
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,431
these,

1345
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:17,591
uh,

1346
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:17,820
uh,

1347
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,250
same narratives evolve for pesticides,

1348
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:21,240
for plastics,

1349
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:21,810
uh,

1350
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,880
for a variety of different
environmental problems.

1351
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,100
Is the problem human induced,

1352
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,700
uh,

1353
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,533
or is it,

1354
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,130
uh,

1355
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:28,680
uh,

1356
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,720
more important to worry
about natural sources,

1357
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,490
natural sources of radiation?

1358
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,300
Hm.

1359
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,830
So you see these comparisons between
the dose that you would get by having a,

1360
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,080
a glass of milk or a having the diet
of a trial comparison between that and

1361
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,700
number of flights that you would
take across the United States.

1362
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,390
And you probably know that you get
a measurable dose of Radiation,

1363
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:48,851
uh,

1364
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:49,100
when,

1365
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,720
when you,

1366
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,730
you're up an aircraft.

1367
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,030
So this comparison
between a human induced,

1368
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,331
uh,

1369
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:56,520
exposure compared to natural exposure.

1370
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,061
Another,

1371
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:58,620
a good example of that would be radon.

1372
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,320
And in Connecticut we have
a problem with radon gas,

1373
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,970
which is radioactive being admitted,

1374
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:05,190
especially from the kind
of rock that we have here.

1375
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,170
And particularly along the coastline.

1376
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,570
A heading east down
here along long island,

1377
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,590
long island sound.

1378
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,450
Uh,

1379
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,450
and my basement,

1380
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:13,410
my house for example,

1381
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:15,120
we had a radon problem.

1382
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,580
We're radon gas was a,

1383
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,401
not just measurable,

1384
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:17,671
it was,

1385
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:18,780
it was really quite high.

1386
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,720
So we had to figure out
how to remediate that.

1387
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,400
You dig a hole in your basement floor,

1388
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,470
you put a little fan and a pipe
in and you'd get rid of it.

1389
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,820
If you don't do that,

1390
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,220
uh,

1391
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,601
then you're,

1392
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:27,990
you're,

1393
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,790
you risk exposing your family to,

1394
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,020
to rate on a,

1395
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:32,940
which is a very well known carcinogen.

1396
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,840
The estimates of desk from radon exposure
in the United States are actually

1397
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:38,674
quite high.

1398
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,200
You know,

1399
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,880
a 40 to 50,000 people
per year are believed to,

1400
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,390
uh,

1401
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,490
get lung cancer as a,

1402
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,210
as a result of radon exposure.

1403
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,160
So that the comparison of natural
sources of radiation to human induced,

1404
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:51,490
uh,

1405
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,370
sources related to national
security protection,

1406
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:54,910
uh,

1407
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,700
there's some legitimacy to that and
you have to be very careful about it.

1408
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,451
Also,

1409
00:38:58,451 --> 00:38:59,860
the idea of relative risk,

1410
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,550
well,

1411
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,380
why are we worrying
about radiation when we,

1412
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,360
we should be worrying
about other kinds of risks.

1413
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:07,330
And we'll see that with
respect to pesticides,

1414
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,333
where,

1415
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:08,800
where,

1416
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:08,950
uh,

1417
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,521
you find,

1418
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:09,700
uh,

1419
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,380
say the,

1420
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,950
the car manufacturers,

1421
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,310
uh,

1422
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,210
concerned about,

1423
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:13,690
uh,

1424
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,260
uh,

1425
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,050
the emission technology requirements
under the clean air act for,

1426
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:18,700
for,

1427
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,260
uh,

1428
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,650
uh,

1429
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,590
tailpipe emissions,

1430
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,280
uh,

1431
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,701
and they,

1432
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:23,080
they point other sources,

1433
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,520
other critical sources of,

1434
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,140
of a human exposure to air pollutants
such as power plants or incinerators.

1435
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,900
So this idea of risk comparison,

1436
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,411
uh,

1437
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,160
really,

1438
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,341
uh,

1439
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:33,611
was,

1440
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:38,020
was well honed in the 1940s and 1950s
by the atomic energy commission.

1441
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,683
And then,

1442
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,691
excuse me,

1443
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:41,524
in that case,

1444
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:41,650
uh,

1445
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,850
the concern was to express
the risk relative to,

1446
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,050
uh,

1447
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,830
uh,

1448
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,060
misunderstanding,

1449
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,660
uh,

1450
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,111
the,

1451
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:50,471
the,

1452
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:50,560
uh,

1453
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,650
implications of,

1454
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,900
of nuclear war,

1455
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,530
uh,

1456
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:53,940
and,

1457
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,370
and,

1458
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:54,670
uh,

1459
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,260
not being able to protect the public,

1460
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:56,670
uh,

1461
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,503
from excessive,

1462
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,540
uh,

1463
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,970
patterns of exposure that
played out by the way,

1464
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:03,220
in a variety of pretty unusual ways.

1465
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:03,731
Uh,

1466
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:04,291
so that,

1467
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:04,670
uh,

1468
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,050
uh,

1469
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:09,130
many people in the 1950s built a
fallout shelters in their backyard.

1470
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,241
My neighbors did it.

1471
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,290
My family never had the,

1472
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:11,401
the,

1473
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:12,400
the means to do it,

1474
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,420
but my neighbors had these,

1475
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,330
these concrete buildings
that they built underground.

1476
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,600
They look a lot like basements and
they would store water and food and,

1477
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:19,961
and,

1478
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:20,171
uh,

1479
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:23,590
they would practice their drills where
they would run down into the basement.

1480
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,341
And,

1481
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:24,930
uh,

1482
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:29,200
this was especially important during the
Cuban missile crisis where we came the

1483
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,760
closest that we ever have to,

1484
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,650
to a nuclear war.

1485
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,910
So the idea of how long do you
have to stay in the shelter,

1486
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,481
uh,

1487
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:38,470
to protect yourself?

1488
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,790
Well,

1489
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,580
you wouldn't know that unless you had
done these atmospheric tests and you

1490
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:46,870
understood how the concentrations
diminished over a certain period of time.

1491
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,380
So the idea of relative
risk also deserves merit.

1492
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,240
This is also an interesting time when,

1493
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:52,520
uh,

1494
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:52,710
the,

1495
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,370
the first environmentalist,

1496
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,880
uh,

1497
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,350
had formed their organizations
back in the 1940s and 1950,

1498
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,790
say tended to be medical doctors.

1499
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,271
Uh,

1500
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,220
the very first environmentalist and the,

1501
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,870
one of the interest groups that you
recognize today is consumers union that

1502
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:09,400
produces consumer reports,

1503
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,190
magazine compares a product quality,

1504
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,881
uh,

1505
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:13,301
and uh,

1506
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:13,781
often,

1507
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:13,871
uh,

1508
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,870
environmental or health
claims and products.

1509
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,140
So consumer's union was very
active in collecting milk,

1510
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:20,800
uh,

1511
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,960
in this case from 48
cities around the world.

1512
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,660
No one talked about human milk.

1513
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,730
And I found this to be quite fascinating.

1514
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,100
So for the entire decade,

1515
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,850
uh,

1516
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,110
no one spoke about,

1517
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,093
oh,

1518
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,680
well,

1519
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:33,981
you know,

1520
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:35,300
if it's getting into cow's milk,

1521
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,450
why isn't it getting into human
milk is getting into human milk.

1522
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,410
What's the capacity to be transferring
these radionuclides across generations

1523
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:43,310
via breastfeeding?

1524
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,450
Well,

1525
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,081
in part,

1526
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:45,980
I think it was a,

1527
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,730
uh,

1528
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,563
a shyness,

1529
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,600
a reluctance to,

1530
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,380
to talk about breastfeeding in public,

1531
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,520
which was common at the time,

1532
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,720
but it was clearly an issue that the
atomic energy commission had recognized.

1533
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,460
And I found a document,

1534
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:03,140
it was a document that a was
declassified that was produced in 1952,

1535
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:03,681
uh,

1536
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:04,011
that,

1537
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:04,530
uh,

1538
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:08,120
that demonstrated quite clearly that the
atomic energy commission had made the

1539
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:11,090
connection like that it's in cow's milk,

1540
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,230
it's going to be in human milk.

1541
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:12,860
Uh,

1542
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,521
we know that,

1543
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:13,671
uh,

1544
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:14,140
these,

1545
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,140
these compounds are capable of causing
mutations in genes and some of those

1546
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:21,080
mutations are inheritable.

1547
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,650
They can be transferred across generations
in addition to the fact that we're

1548
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:25,484
exposing,

1549
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,060
uh,

1550
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,390
uh,

1551
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,860
the next generation via via breastmilk
in addition to infant formula and milk

1552
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:31,221
and other,

1553
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,380
other parts of a,

1554
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,520
of a small child or an infant food supply.

1555
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,381
Also,

1556
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:36,531
uh,

1557
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:36,720
the,

1558
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,020
the group saying became
famous at this point in time,

1559
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,030
uh,

1560
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,710
a group that was politically
active to protect pregnant women.

1561
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,320
And this history is the first history,

1562
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,040
uh,

1563
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,120
in the 20th century where children's
health became a logic for more,

1564
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,571
uh,

1565
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:51,510
for a,

1566
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:51,790
uh,

1567
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,430
a stronger set of regulations
and rules relative to a meeting,

1568
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:55,991
something that,

1569
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:56,210
uh,

1570
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,740
could be thought of as dangerous to the,

1571
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,603
to the atmosphere.

1572
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,223
Uh,

1573
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,370
so,

1574
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:01,760
uh,

1575
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,510
gradually,

1576
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,990
uh,

1577
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,190
by the end of the decade,

1578
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,570
the Atomic Energy Commission recognize
that does strontium 90 accumulated in

1579
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:09,404
soils,

1580
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,260
it accumulated in foods
it accumulated in kids,

1581
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,680
they knew how to calculate with a cancer
risk was because they understood the

1582
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:16,910
dose response relationship.

1583
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,590
So they were basically sitting on a gold
mine of knowledge that they had kept

1584
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:22,420
from the public,

1585
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:22,670
uh,

1586
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,410
as best they could during
this period of time.

1587
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,790
So here's a list of 60 years of
experimentation with nuclear weapons.

1588
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,710
43 years,

1589
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,420
45 years of negotiation.

1590
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,160
And you see the Antarctic Treaty,

1591
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,680
the agreement not to conduct
the testing and the Arctic.

1592
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,040
This is common heritage
for all of mankind,

1593
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:40,874
so to speak.

1594
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,211
You see,

1595
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:42,230
the hotline agreement,

1596
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:42,650
uh,

1597
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,251
before,

1598
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:43,420
uh,

1599
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,470
a nuclear war,

1600
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:45,711
uh,

1601
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:46,001
was,

1602
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:46,361
was,

1603
00:43:46,361 --> 00:43:46,800
uh,

1604
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:46,960
uh,

1605
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,511
initiated.

1606
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:48,281
There was an agreement,

1607
00:43:48,281 --> 00:43:48,530
uh,

1608
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,090
to call up a,

1609
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:51,140
the Soviets and,

1610
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:51,370
uh,

1611
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,940
try a last minute to attempt it.

1612
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:53,780
Negotiation,

1613
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,210
the limited test ban treaty
that I just described,

1614
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:57,410
the outer space treaty,

1615
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,071
uh,

1616
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:58,340
the,

1617
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,681
the,

1618
00:43:58,681 --> 00:43:58,880
uh,

1619
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,840
seabed treaty,

1620
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:01,610
it's not legal to,

1621
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,151
to,

1622
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:02,660
uh,

1623
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,490
conduct experiments in the seabed.

1624
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,210
Uh,

1625
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:05,480
uh,

1626
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,050
so that,

1627
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:06,200
uh,

1628
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,290
common property around the world is,

1629
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,700
is now protected by international treaty.

1630
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:11,360
Uh,

1631
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,950
however the United States is testing,

1632
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,760
uh,

1633
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,690
at a rate that,

1634
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:15,070
uh,

1635
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:15,440
uh,

1636
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,880
is never been less,

1637
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,451
uh,

1638
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:17,991
the testing,

1639
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:18,824
however,

1640
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,690
the majority of it is underground.

1641
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,890
And I'll show you a
clip next next week of,

1642
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,180
uh,

1643
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,320
some underground tests,

1644
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:24,861
uh,

1645
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:25,191
that,

1646
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:25,880
uh,

1647
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,300
uh,

1648
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,490
created earthquakes in
different parts of the world,

1649
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:28,880
uh,

1650
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,140
particularly in Alaska.

1651
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,890
And we also see a very curious effect
where these former testing sites,

1652
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,221
uh,

1653
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:39,210
were eventually translated into
fish and wildlife reserves.

1654
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,370
So that's another interesting thing to
try to explain and I'm going to close

1655
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:46,410
today with one more thought for you.

1656
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,620
This entire story unfolded
between 1945 in 1963.

1657
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,040
Uh,

1658
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,970
the environmental protection
agency was created in 1970

1659
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,690
in the safe drinking water act was
created in 1976 so there was absolutely no

1660
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:04,801
protection.

1661
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,950
There was no monitoring of public water
supplies through this entire period of

1662
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:08,730
time.

1663
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,420
Uh,

1664
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,390
the clean air act was not in existence,

1665
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:13,224
so that there was no,

1666
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,580
there was no protection against,

1667
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,030
uh,

1668
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,850
the radionuclides as air
pollutants are air contaminants.

1669
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,080
And finally,

1670
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,700
in 1976,

1671
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:25,500
the environmental protection agency set
an acceptable radioactivity limit for

1672
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:30,270
drinking water of one millisievert or
that can be translated into 0.1 rim per

1673
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:31,104
year.

1674
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,270
How about reading that nuclides and food?

1675
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:33,931
Uh,

1676
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,550
one would think that this history,

1677
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,000
uh,

1678
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,140
would provide a very good logic for
establishing limits for radionuclides and

1679
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:40,974
food.

1680
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:41,280
Uh,

1681
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,941
but you know,

1682
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:44,100
as the Chernobyl event in 1986,

1683
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:44,641
uh,

1684
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,474
unfolded,

1685
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,200
we realized that we were not alone
and not having any sort of limits for

1686
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,370
radionuclides and food.

1687
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,850
Uh,

1688
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,130
neither did any of the
European Union nations.

1689
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,410
So trade was completely disrupted.

1690
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:56,040
Uh,

1691
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,460
tens of billions of dollars of food
was lost following the Chernobyl event

1692
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:02,750
because Italy had one standard for,

1693
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,980
for acceptable a contamination,

1694
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:06,300
whereas Germany had another,

1695
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:06,680
uh,

1696
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,490
they're all the nations
had different standards.

1697
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,200
But just keep this in mind that the
United States still has no maximum permit,

1698
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,060
maximum permissible limits.

1699
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,710
The takeaway point here,

1700
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,670
simply when secrecies combined with
the absence of environmental and health

1701
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:24,840
surveillance [inaudible] the public
opinion and politics favor the development

1702
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:26,110
of hazardous technologies.

1703
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,523
In this case,

1704
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:28,831
uh,

1705
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:31,920
this knowledge was controlled
by elites and then relate,

1706
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:34,140
released selectively
to an unknowing public,

1707
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:34,801
uh,

1708
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:35,880
in an attempt to,

1709
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:40,230
to encourage them to a favor
continued atomic weapons testing.
