1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,020
Tell her to continue talking about air
quality today and air quality law and,

2
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:07,320
uh,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,220
also to,

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,750
uh,

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,583
uh,

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,340
make some comments about women versus
American trucker in response to a couple

7
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,174
of questions.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,150
So with respect to Whitman,

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:19,591
uh,

10
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:24,000
EPA in 1997 had proposed
new pm and ozone standards,

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,020
uh,

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,730
and both the northeastern states and
California supported these measures and a

13
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:32,850
members from Congress from the
Midwestern states did not support it.

14
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,910
This is quite common with
their quality standards.

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,930
It was unprecedented in a eps history
for a single change in a national ambient

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,340
air quality standard.

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,800
Have 28 days of hearings in Congress.

18
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,803
And finally,

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,760
this was brought to court and made its
way to the court of appeals and the DC

20
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:54,594
circuit.

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,860
And the circuit found that the
standards were unconstitutional,

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,670
was eventually elevated
up to the Supreme Court.

23
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,421
And I read you,

24
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:03,960
uh,

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,440
the conclusion of the Supreme Court and,

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,020
but they also a raised a separate question
about the consideration of costs and

27
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:18,021
whether or not costs should be part of
the calculus a and section 109 B one

28
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:22,470
instructs the EPA to set primary
ambient air quality standards,

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,230
uh,

30
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,790
the attainment and maintenance of which
are requisite to protect public health

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,560
will inadequate margin of safety.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,940
That seems rather clear.

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,561
However,

34
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:32,790
they went on saying that,

35
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:32,890
uh,

36
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,020
the respondent's argue,

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,441
uh,

38
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:37,650
that many more factors than air
pollution affect public health.

39
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,551
In particular,

40
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,670
the economic costs of implementing a
very stringent standard might produce

41
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:46,590
health losses sufficient to offset the
health gains achieved and cleaning the

42
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:46,831
air,

43
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:47,401
for example,

44
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:51,180
by closing down whole industries and
thereby impoverishing the workers and

45
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,130
consumers dependent upon those industries.

46
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,200
So this is unquestionably true.

47
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,750
And the congress was unquestionably
aware of it at the time.

48
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,553
Uh,

49
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,960
and considering the role of economics
and decision making and how that might be

50
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:08,961
balanced against a estimates of risk and
the benefits from a tougher air quality

51
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,044
regulations.

52
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,411
Uh,

53
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,430
the court continued,

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:11,821
uh,

55
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:12,960
Congress has commissioned,

56
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,340
had commissioned in the air quality
act of 1967 a detailed estimate of the

57
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,280
economic impact of air quality
standards on the nation's industries,

58
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:20,761
communities,

59
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,650
and other contributing
sources of pollution.

60
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,870
The 1970 congress not only
anticipated the compliance costs,

61
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,411
uh,

62
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,880
that could injure the public health,

63
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,950
but provided for that
precise [inaudible] exigency,

64
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,470
excuse me.

65
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,303
Exigency

66
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,250
and the section one 10 of the clean air
act permitted the administrator to waive

67
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:45,120
the compliance deadline for stationary
sources if sufficient control measures

68
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:49,890
were simply a unavailable
and the continued operation
of such sources who was

69
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:52,740
found to be essential to the
public health or welfare.

70
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,290
And it a section,

71
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,070
uh,

72
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,380
two oh two prescribed the
emission standards for
automobiles could take effect

73
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,640
only after such a period
that the administrator finds
necessary to permit the

74
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,480
development and application of the
requisite technology giving appropriate

75
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,540
consideration to the cost of
compliance within such period.

76
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,440
So Epa could decide that it's time
for a new air quality standard,

77
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,950
but they could find that the
economic effects were so intense,

78
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,401
uh,

79
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:18,731
that,

80
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,150
uh,

81
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,340
uh,

82
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,350
they could delay that.

83
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,000
Uh,

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,180
and,

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,800
and to offer the industry
the opportunity to retool,

86
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,610
reorganize in order to develop
by the necessary technology,

87
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,391
say a new,

88
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:28,870
uh,

89
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:28,961
uh,

90
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,100
mission control system in order
to meet that new standard.

91
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,760
So despite this consideration of costs,

92
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,110
uh,

93
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,340
the court found that the engine driving
nearly all of title one is section one

94
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,330
oh nine B one.

95
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,710
And I commend you to read this.

96
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,250
Uh,

97
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,260
you can call it up on [inaudible] website,

98
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,840
uh,

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,490
that these standards have to be set to
protect public health with this margin of

100
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,220
safety to account for uncertainty
and the risk estimate.

101
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,710
So when interpreting the statutory text,

102
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,950
Congress does not one might say
hide elephants and mouse holes.

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,500
So they overturned the appellate ruling.

104
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,340
I don't want to take you back to a
where I left you a on Tuesday and talk a

105
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,090
little bit more about asthma and,

106
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,481
and,

107
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:11,651
uh,

108
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,101
the,

109
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:16,000
the prevalence of asthma and
the finding by Mark Colon.

110
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,550
Uh,

111
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,550
and Eileen story at the University of
Connecticut that between three and 22% of

112
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,350
kids in Connecticut schools,

113
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,480
I had been diagnosed by physicians.

114
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,531
And by the way,

115
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:26,771
the,

116
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:26,980
uh,

117
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,550
one of the gold standards for,

118
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,140
uh,

119
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,140
recognizing an illness and a population
would be looking at whether or not it

120
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:34,300
had,

121
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,970
had been diagnosed by a
physician and in schools.

122
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,070
It's interesting that if,

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,820
if your child is on any medication,

124
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,880
other then you have to register those
medications with the school nurse.

125
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,940
So the school nurse has to
keep a very tight control,

126
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,340
uh,

127
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,751
in fact,

128
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:46,871
uh,

129
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,290
they,

130
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,620
they maintain the meds in
the nurse's offices so that,

131
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,160
uh,

132
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,430
uh,

133
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,490
this is a really interesting and important
than high quality method of record

134
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:56,324
keeping.

135
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,650
So mark and I and several others wondered
together about what the causes of the

136
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,860
rise in asthma might have been
during the 1980s in 1990s.

137
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,050
And we started thinking about what had
changed and whether or not kids might be

138
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:12,880
exposed to different kinds of chemicals.

139
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,610
Uh,

140
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,270
and I left you also with uh,

141
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,650
uh,

142
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,210
this lung section and I want it to come
back to this because I didn't explain it

143
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,410
very carefully the other day.

144
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:20,890
Uh,

145
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,180
so on the left is basically rat lung
tissue exposed to low concentrations of

146
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,014
diesel exhaust.

147
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,360
And what you see is the coagulation,

148
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,290
uh,

149
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,123
between,

150
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,640
uh,

151
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,890
cells of the particulate matter,

152
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,724
the carbon,

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,180
uh,

154
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,490
in those that are exposed
at higher concentrations.

155
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,271
Now,

156
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,280
what this suggests is that,

157
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:39,671
that,

158
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:39,790
uh,

159
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,420
you might think about scenarios that
would lead to higher levels of exposure.

160
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
So what might those be?

161
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:45,910
Well,

162
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,920
we're talking about black
carbon in this case.

163
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,550
So,

164
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,681
uh,

165
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,820
when are people more exposed
to combustion byproducts?

166
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,600
Uh,

167
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:52,991
so the,

168
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,824
one of the,

169
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,950
one of the things you should always think
about in terms of those that are more

170
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,480
exposed would be occupational settings.

171
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,640
So how about for example,

172
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,503
minors?

173
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,890
So in coal mines,

174
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,150
uh,

175
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,200
the coal dust is also carbon dust,

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,681
uh,

177
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:10,970
but also they use diesel generators
to provide electricity to,

178
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,480
uh,

179
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,780
uh,

180
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,613
basically,

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,310
uh,

182
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,330
give energy to,

183
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,721
to,

184
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,190
uh,

185
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,380
uh,

186
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,470
the jackhammers and a to the
lighting that they have in the minds.

187
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
So the combination of
unventilated a diesel generator,

188
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,610
fumes on top of the coal
dust leads to high exposures.

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,630
And what about,

190
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:26,871
uh,

191
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,520
what about truck drivers?

192
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,580
It was interesting after the study that
I'm going to review with you in a few

193
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:32,340
moments.

194
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:32,521
Uh,

195
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:33,390
I received a,

196
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,450
a phone call from someone who had seen
it and they wondered whether or not they

197
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,321
should get involved.

198
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:39,921
This was the,

199
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,220
the American Federation of Labor,

200
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,520
the AFL CIO.

201
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:43,940
Uh,

202
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,930
they were concerned that,

203
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,291
that,

204
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:45,770
uh,

205
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,090
they were an organization of truck drivers
that really might be one of the more

206
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:51,350
highly exposed groups,

207
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,890
highly exposed because they sit
inside their trucks all day long.

208
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,461
Uh,

209
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,780
and especially in,

210
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,250
in urban areas where,

211
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,130
where traffic comes to a standstill,

212
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,650
you could expect that the
exposures would be highest.

213
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,780
So occupational settings are clearly
a one area where people might be more

214
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,620
heavily exposed.

215
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,550
A couple other human lung tissue samples
that I wanted to show you with respect

216
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,484
to black carbon,

217
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,691
uh,

218
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:18,524
actually only one.

219
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,210
So bringing you back to,

220
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:20,450
uh,

221
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:20,751
the,

222
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,330
the map and the concept of,

223
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,240
of the way that we understand the air
pollution problem is really driven by

224
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:27,590
these dots on this map.

225
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,630
We could be in any state in the nation
and you'd see a similar kind of map with,

226
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,860
with the monitoring
stations scattered about.

227
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,460
Uh,

228
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,940
and in some instances
they have a concentration,

229
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,420
uh,

230
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,670
where they think that the,

231
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:39,981
the,

232
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,101
uh,

233
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,740
ambient concentrations are our highest,

234
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,400
so that you can see them down along
the southeastern part of the coast.

235
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:46,890
Uh,

236
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,830
and this is the area that
is out of compliance.

237
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,570
It's a non attainment zone
for both particulate matter
and ozone and also up in

238
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,410
the Hartford area.

239
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,130
Uh,

240
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,610
so that,

241
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:55,731
uh,

242
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,121
you see,

243
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:56,470
uh,

244
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:56,650
uh,

245
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,070
a collection of monitors.

246
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,581
Uh,

247
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,480
but it also also,

248
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,130
they are trying to figure out the,

249
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:01,320
uh,

250
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,651
the,

251
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:01,821
the,

252
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,130
the variability in
distribution of pollution.

253
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,660
So they put monitors also in parts of the
state that are less densely populated.

254
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,770
So thinking about this,

255
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,070
a group of us decided that we
really wanted to understand,

256
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,581
uh,

257
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,800
what the air was like and if kids day.

258
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,690
So rather than relying on,

259
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,070
on,

260
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,210
uh,

261
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,620
the,

262
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,410
the reports from these
different monitoring stations,

263
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:24,891
you know,

264
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:28,980
what if we took a monitors and we put
them on children and then we followed them

265
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:29,120
at,

266
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
through their daily routine from the
time they left home to the time that they

267
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,200
came back to their house after,

268
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,080
after school.

269
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,580
So a group of us,

270
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,211
uh,

271
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,800
including David Brown from,

272
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,190
uh,

273
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,470
uh,

274
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,303
the,

275
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,360
the Centers for Disease Control and,

276
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:44,690
uh,

277
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,540
Nancy Alderman who runs a group
called environment and human health,

278
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,650
Mark Colon,

279
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,281
Susan Adams,

280
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,340
the former commissioner of health and
Connecticut and Bob Low camera who's a

281
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,030
professor,

282
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,010
professor of pediatrics here.

283
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,321
Uh,

284
00:08:55,321 --> 00:09:00,090
this was the group that took this study
on along with some technical analysts at

285
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:00,781
Yukon that,

286
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,614
that run the,

287
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:01,951
the,

288
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,220
uh,

289
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,450
EPA testing lab.

290
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,550
So all of the air quality measurements
that are taken in the state,

291
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:07,770
uh,

292
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,421
go through their,

293
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,700
their laboratory too,

294
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,950
to make sure that a,

295
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:11,520
they're,

296
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,780
they're carefully analyzed.

297
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,750
And I also left you with
this chart so that you could,

298
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,261
you could,

299
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:16,500
uh,

300
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,270
keep in mind the idea that you've got
a temporal variation in ambient outdoor

301
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:25,770
air quality that appears to be a
driven and perhaps predictable,

302
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,150
not just by month of the year,

303
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,510
uh,

304
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,520
but also by hour of the day.

305
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,400
So what would these have monitors?

306
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,320
Like here's a,

307
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,141
an example,

308
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,251
a,

309
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:35,400
a gas canister,

310
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,031
a little,

311
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:36,600
uh,

312
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,440
metal globe,

313
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:37,831
uh,

314
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:38,131
that,

315
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:38,550
uh,

316
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,580
was pulling in air at a preset rate.

317
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,380
It had a vacuum in it and a,

318
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:47,550
so that we were looking for about 55
different volatile organic compounds that

319
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:48,230
we knew,

320
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,400
uh,

321
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,941
we're part of,

322
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:49,920
of diesel emissions.

323
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,240
And by the way,

324
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,461
we,

325
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:53,220
we weren't really sure whether or not,

326
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:53,380
uh,

327
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,941
the,

328
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:54,120
uh,

329
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,350
exposure was highest,

330
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,920
uh,

331
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,401
during,

332
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:56,641
uh,

333
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:57,001
the,

334
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,400
the,

335
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,720
uh,

336
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,870
travel to school or whether or not
their exposure and their risk would be

337
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,100
highest within the school.

338
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:02,480
Uh,

339
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,313
so we,

340
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,410
we used a variety of different pieces of
equipment that could monitor chemicals

341
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,710
that might be more concentrated
either in traffic or,

342
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,920
or an indoor environments
and in indoor environments.

343
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:16,110
What kinds of chemicals
might you be concerned about?

344
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,591
Well,

345
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:17,340
it could be a,

346
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,630
say the chemicals in a
photography laboratory or a
chemistry laboratory such as

347
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,800
a benzine or,

348
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:23,820
or other solvents.

349
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,200
Or it might be,

350
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,034
uh,

351
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,461
uh,

352
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:30,150
other kinds of cleaning products
or it could be pesticides so that,

353
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:30,490
uh,

354
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,690
we,

355
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,690
we tried to figure this out in a way
that would point us to the most risky

356
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,350
sources of exposure and with
respect to particulate matter,

357
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:41,550
these carbon particles.

358
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:41,910
Uh,

359
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,980
this was the chart that we produced.

360
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,653
By the way,

361
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,020
part of the story is that,

362
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,191
uh,

363
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:51,240
this is my daughter when
she was about 12 years old.

364
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,470
And so she was the first
Guinea pig she agreed to,

365
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,270
to carry this a voc,

366
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,410
a canister,

367
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:03,110
but also she has a formaldehyde pump
sitting here on her jacket and a,

368
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,900
she's got a particle meter here
strapped to her belt and she carried a,

369
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:07,170
uh,

370
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,730
an ID card that had a carbon monitor on
Ethel amateur that's about the size of a

371
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,331
microwave.

372
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,710
So she walked around with this thing,

373
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,310
uh,

374
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,420
by her side all day long.

375
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:15,991
And a,

376
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:16,321
as a,

377
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,050
as a rather,

378
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,350
uh,

379
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,040
uh,

380
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,730
uh,

381
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,400
an amusing anecdote on the side.

382
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,470
When she first stepped on a bus,

383
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,570
all the kids in the back
of the bus screamed,

384
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,260
uh,

385
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,880
because of our post 11 sensitivity
about what people might look like,

386
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,160
all strapped up in technical equipment.

387
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,470
The bus driver threw her off the bus,

388
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,100
and that's when I realized that I should
have called the superintendent and a

389
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,150
warn them what we were doing.

390
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,600
So here's the,

391
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,171
here's the,

392
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:43,320
uh,

393
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,160
outcome of,

394
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,551
of,

395
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:44,671
uh,

396
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,690
our initial tests.

397
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,320
Uh,

398
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
we found that there was a burst
of exposure early in the day,

399
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:49,860
uh,

400
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,470
to pm 10 and a also a burst of
exposure at the end of the day.

401
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,580
But there are also a increases that we
saw during the middle of the day that

402
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,630
really were not explained.

403
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,550
And it took us a little
while to figure it out.

404
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:00,761
But,

405
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:00,851
uh,

406
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:01,061
the,

407
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:02,830
the kind of of of,

408
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:03,430
uh,

409
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,580
particles that we were
measuring a varied by we're the,

410
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,240
we're the,

411
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,481
the,

412
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:07,601
uh,

413
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,470
the child was,

414
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,170
so if they're waiting for
the bus or they're on the,

415
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,130
on the school bus,

416
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,730
one could presume that
these were carbon particles.

417
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,301
Uh,

418
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,590
but if they're just a in the,

419
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:18,424
in the gym,

420
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,000
uh,

421
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,601
moving around,

422
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,860
these could be dust particles.

423
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,670
So if I had a chalkboard up here and
I could take an eraser and just pat it

424
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:25,504
against the board,

425
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,570
you'd see a cloud of park
pm 10 particulate matter 10,

426
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:28,990
uh,

427
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,920
move up into the air.

428
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,980
The same thing with a,

429
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,920
a gymnasium where you have,

430
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,431
I say,

431
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:33,550
yeah,

432
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,800
50 kids running around
playing basketball or,

433
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:36,161
or,

434
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:36,630
uh,

435
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:36,730
uh,

436
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,340
some of the sport you get to
particles moving into the air.

437
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,300
So we needed to,

438
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,140
to discern the carbon particles
from other kinds of particles.

439
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,750
So 6,000,

440
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,450
600,000 school buses exist
in the United States.

441
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,230
Uh,

442
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,650
and we also face the problem of
trying to figure out whether or not,

443
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,160
uh,

444
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,380
exposure during those high periods,

445
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:59,110
early in the day and late in
the day were the result of,

446
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,530
of,

447
00:12:59,530 --> 00:12:59,860
uh,

448
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,270
going to school and traffic from the
buses or were they the particles coming

449
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:05,200
from other vehicles?

450
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,540
So I'll tell you a bit more
about that in just a moment.

451
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,441
So here's a,

452
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:13,441
a very quick summary of this study that
was picked up by a good morning America

453
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,963
when it was released.

454
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,260
Now expected to get the FDA approval.

455
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,540
But now we turn back to the story.

456
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,870
Important News for anyone.

457
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,431
One second.

458
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:25,400
Children who ride school
buses later today,

459
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,480
a new study from Yale University will
be released saying the amount of diesel

460
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:30,314
fuel

461
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,250
standard and those few are
going on the record in the area.

462
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,710
Yeah,

463
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,543
we need it

464
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,993
most.

465
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,100
Yeah.

466
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,100
You can get those children on APP as
an estimated 180 hours every year.

467
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,150
Uh,

468
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,060
according to a new game university
study by Professor John Parker

469
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,360
[inaudible] off using both
the sensitive monitor,

470
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,660
which he places directly
on school children took
[inaudible] rolling around with

471
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,213
children.

472
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,650
I have full day.

473
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,110
You found out exactly what
[inaudible] water goes.

474
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,260
We've showed just slides
and the management of the
diesel off at certain points

475
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,250
of the day is we jumped to different,

476
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,720
those are the EA,

477
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,330
the EA measure,

478
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,100
air quality location.

479
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,310
An advocate is the results
or what were you hearing?

480
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,150
How much higher than the
government's acceptable.

481
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,210
Where you finding routinely or
for short periods is common?

482
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,670
We're finding levels that were five
to 10 times higher than the government

483
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,360
standard.

484
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,280
That's his biggest fight.

485
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,580
Uh,

486
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,690
it was a surprise to me.

487
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
There's no telling exactly what
exposed you to this kind of,

488
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,340
these leads off the,

489
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:17,150
do you have job?

490
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,870
No,

491
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,220
but children with asthma,

492
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,570
like 30 year old Aaron,

493
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,523
I don't know.

494
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,440
They feel it every time
they get on their boss.

495
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,650
Did you ever had a time when you had
gotten the Buffy and gray and got off the

496
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,580
bus deal and said

497
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,240
her father John does that say,

498
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,200
man,

499
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,030
we're doing something right now
with harmful to our children.

500
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,220
Let's wait five more years before
we were in the parents on stank.

501
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,980
But that's exactly what the EPA is
doing and 2006 there's only to implement

502
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,950
nuclear standard for all
diesel engine and clearly

503
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,520
the research little any layer standards.

504
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,440
And in part they say because diva leads
off is likely the cause of lung cancer

505
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,450
and they say the regulations will prevent
more than 8,000 premature deaths and

506
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:18,980
more than 300,000 asthma attacks
and want to go do use two devices,

507
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,400
one measure gas with light bending and
the other measure side part of us such

508
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:24,831
as,

509
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,130
so mark,

510
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,690
go ahead.

511
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,550
15 schools Yelder and carry these
devices throughout their school days.

512
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,240
What we found was,

513
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,790
uh,

514
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,670
when it looks close to a
higher intensity particulars,

515
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,360
but we tend to diminish
during the school day

516
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,670
also found the level
of [inaudible] office.

517
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:47,990
The,

518
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,520
the buses was especially I under certain
conditions such as when the buses were

519
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,490
parked end to end in front
of the school with the engine

520
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,640
exhaust.

521
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,360
All of us.

522
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,780
Yes,

523
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,290
absolutely.

524
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,640
That's a school bus.

525
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:05,720
Industry says there's an earlier study
conducted in a Virginia School district

526
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:10,721
last March that shows really the air on
Fairfax County public schools for poses.

527
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,130
No health risks.

528
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,740
I was one thing was causing your feelings.

529
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,443
Uh,

530
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,460
don't feel along with weight and make
sure we understand everything before we

531
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:26,540
make decisions that affect the health
of workflows and our unhelpful cells.

532
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,220
Another industry group,

533
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:33,320
diesel technology forum argues that the
diesel engines now they produce are much

534
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,510
cleaner than the diesel
engines of the path.

535
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,520
And that with the proper
name is easiest to buses,

536
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,810
no threat,

537
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,643
the rights

538
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,370
and costly process of
upgrading on the march.

539
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,130
But give it poses a challenge
to cash strapped punks and

540
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,390
even move the cash.

541
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,930
It will still take your time.

542
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,940
I could send the corresponding
great hundred joins us now.

543
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,230
So your parents,

544
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,071
you've seen this,

545
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,560
you want to do something that you bought.

546
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,910
Well the best thing about the Margot
says that schools can do and the good and

547
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:06,160
California to do it in
stages like cad getting his,

548
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:10,900
having a no either policy but school was
holes up they not and why not kicking

549
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,090
out all that diesel
exhaust and other thing.

550
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,330
They can do a staggered at
times but the buses to connect.

551
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,170
So instead of all of
them pulling up the kids,

552
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:17,741
getting on,

553
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:18,820
all of them pulling off,

554
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,870
they standard at times,

555
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,460
they kind of,

556
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,900
and it will no problem.

557
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,490
He says it's going to
be kind of expensive.

558
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:27,310
Retrofitting some of these
buses in five to $6,000.

559
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,193
It would take time.

560
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,010
What's more important?

561
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,790
A couple of asides,

562
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,680
when we were both standing
on the school bus,

563
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,440
there was a film crew there
with about six people.

564
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,011
Uh,

565
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:40,341
the,

566
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:41,360
the fumes were,

567
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,870
it was a day actually like this
with a high level of humidity.

568
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,440
Uh,

569
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,520
all of us got sick.

570
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,100
All of us got sick within a
matter of about five minutes.

571
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,121
And,

572
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:50,510
uh,

573
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,610
it was curious because a,

574
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,300
the consumer correspondent,

575
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:54,134
Greg Hunter,

576
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,930
he didn't believe that a,

577
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,340
we were really picking up
chemicals that were dangerous.

578
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:58,910
Uh,

579
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,790
but after,

580
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,140
uh,

581
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,750
after he and the entire
crew felt nauseous and,

582
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:02,870
uh,

583
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,860
we all got headaches,

584
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,401
uh,

585
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:09,401
because we had lined the buses up one
in front of another and we were the

586
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:09,891
emissions.

587
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:11,420
We're basically just building up as,

588
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:11,781
as,

589
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:12,060
uh,

590
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,410
uh,

591
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,280
the time went by.

592
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,030
Uh,

593
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,421
he was,

594
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:14,590
uh,

595
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,750
he was clearly convinced that
this was a more serious problem.

596
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,980
So I want to take you back
to the averaging issue and
remember that there's this

597
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:26,981
24 averaging 24 hour averaging requirement
over three years that's in play with

598
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:27,914
this standard.

599
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,970
And that was represented by the
graph that I showed you yesterday.

600
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,980
If you took the data that we produced
a for just one child as an example,

601
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:42,200
then you average it over a
one hour or over eight hours.

602
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,020
You see that,

603
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,121
uh,

604
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:45,500
all of the levels would be reduced.

605
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:45,951
So your,

606
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:46,784
your image of,

607
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,270
of,

608
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,540
uh,

609
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,811
you know,

610
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,200
what the levels were would
be down in this low range,

611
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,820
uh,

612
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,470
missing,

613
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,700
uh,

614
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,890
experiences have a much higher pollution.

615
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,641
So again,

616
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,450
the averaging issue played out in,

617
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,360
in the way that,

618
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:58,630
that,

619
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,750
uh,

620
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,460
we had to think about
different kinds of strategies.

621
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,010
The other issue that I wanted
to bring to your attention,

622
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,290
uh,

623
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:04,580
that,

624
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,530
that surprised me was that that,

625
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:06,920
uh,

626
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,820
the amount of time,

627
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:10,730
the amount of exposure was far
higher than I could have imagined.

628
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,950
So this diagram just shows you that,

629
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:13,191
that,

630
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:13,340
uh,

631
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,600
the,

632
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,780
the millions of hours per year spent
on buses by kids in different states.

633
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,620
And I want to point to just a couple of
states here in New York has the highest

634
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,010
amount of time spent by
a child hours on a bus,

635
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,580
uh,

636
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,413
because,

637
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,290
uh,

638
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,250
predominantly because,

639
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:28,730
uh,

640
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,001
uh,

641
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:34,001
of the rural parts of New York and the
relatively high population in New York.

642
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:35,451
Uh,

643
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,890
but compare that to California,

644
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,650
a California has a,

645
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,800
a little bit less than,

646
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,370
than a half of the hours
or the total exposure,

647
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:43,851
uh,

648
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:44,660
the New York.

649
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:44,781
Now,

650
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:45,740
why might that be?

651
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,263
Anybody have an,

652
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,303
sorry,

653
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,593
there's more cars.

654
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:56,871
Okay.

655
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:57,051
Well,

656
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:59,990
remember the population of
California is 40 million people.

657
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,270
So it's a much larger
population than New York.

658
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,250
And I think that,

659
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,641
that,

660
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:05,200
uh,

661
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,600
uh,

662
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:05,811
the,

663
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:08,480
the answer is likely to be the way that,

664
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:08,920
uh,

665
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,440
uh,

666
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
residential populations and,

667
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,780
and communities in California are more
closely clustered together than they are

668
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:15,614
in New York state.

669
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,120
So it also,

670
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:21,110
if you find what we found was
that in in places like Idaho,

671
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,221
Wyoming,

672
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:23,150
and Alaska,

673
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,600
uh,

674
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,060
that it's very common
for kids to spend two,

675
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:28,940
three hours a day on buses as
opposed to here in Connecticut,

676
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,970
maybe an hour at most
45 minutes to an hour.

677
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,900
So the pattern of land use really was
driving the pattern of exposure that vary

678
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:37,280
quite a bit state by state.

679
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,470
And one other aspect of this that,

680
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:39,800
uh,

681
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,101
was,

682
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:44,310
was important was that the kids
that have disabilities and they,

683
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,510
they might be disabled for a
whole array of different reasons,

684
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,280
but kids that are disabled or
often a bust to regional districts,

685
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,240
a regional school systems that
have very specialized expertise.

686
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,991
So,

687
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:57,500
uh,

688
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,333
on average,

689
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:58,760
uh,

690
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,360
kids with disabilities
that are moved around to a,

691
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,440
to benefit from the specialized expertise,

692
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:03,930
uh,

693
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,050
they experience a higher
level of exposure.

694
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,500
Uh,

695
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,860
some,

696
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,700
some kids spend three or four hours per
day going back and forth between these

697
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:11,534
control centers.

698
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,520
And I mentioned earlier in the term that,

699
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:13,851
that,

700
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:14,350
uh,

701
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,510
uh,

702
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,610
I got a call from a woman in Alaska
who a wondered about her child who was,

703
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:18,980
uh,

704
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,190
uh,

705
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,100
only three years old who she put
just behind the driver's seat.

706
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:23,480
She was the driver of the bus.

707
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,050
Uh,

708
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,670
the child was asthmatic and,

709
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:26,001
and,

710
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:26,180
uh,

711
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,040
she was having trouble
controlling the asthma,

712
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,850
uh,

713
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,810
with medications.

714
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,660
And she wonder whether or not the
school bus might be a problem.

715
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:33,081
So I asked her,

716
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:33,350
well,

717
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,030
how long is it is a,

718
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:35,301
your,

719
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:36,320
your daily routine,

720
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,850
how long does your child spend on the bus?

721
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,740
And it was eight and a half hours per day.

722
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,361
So that,

723
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:41,620
uh,

724
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,820
thinking about these
high end exposures and,

725
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,663
and we're,

726
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,290
uh,

727
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,650
which groups in the population might be
susceptible is an important aspect of

728
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:49,484
this.

729
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,260
So just one other thing that,

730
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:51,500
uh,

731
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,920
uh,

732
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,421
was,

733
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,560
was interesting in terms of study design.

734
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,611
And again,

735
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:57,380
in terms of sampling strategy,

736
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,101
first of all,

737
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:01,280
we were monitoring individual
kids and individual buses.

738
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,980
Uh,

739
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,280
and I just want to reinforce again,

740
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,091
the importance of,

741
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:07,190
of thinking about sampling strategy.

742
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,450
And remember the little,

743
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:08,760
uh,

744
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:08,990
uh,

745
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,990
200 mile radius from the Nevada test site
when the atomic energy commission set

746
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,530
up their sampling design.

747
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:16,550
And in that way,

748
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,890
and how everybody was
fooled into thinking that,

749
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,690
tell those particles
wouldn't go beyond that,

750
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,111
that area.

751
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:26,111
There's another defect in a scientific
thinking that that led to two a confusion

752
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,943
in this case.

753
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,480
Uh,

754
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:28,750
we,

755
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,330
we really didn't understand whether
or not the level of pollution,

756
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,650
uh,

757
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,311
was a,

758
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:36,560
that we were measuring was
coming from inside the bus,

759
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,041
uh,

760
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,050
from other traffic or from,

761
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:39,884
uh,

762
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,370
uh,

763
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:40,771
from,

764
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:40,891
uh,

765
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:41,724
other sources.

766
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,220
And a recall the other day,

767
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:43,611
I said,

768
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:43,821
well,

769
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:44,180
you know,

770
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,901
within Connecticut,

771
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:48,160
we three times as much diesel
fuel indoors to heat heat our,

772
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:48,690
our,

773
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,523
our buildings,

774
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,881
uh,

775
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:51,470
compared to what's submitted from,

776
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,370
from vehicles.

777
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,031
Uh,

778
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,780
so it was very important to us too,

779
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:55,760
to get a sense of,

780
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,190
of what was actually coming out of a bus.

781
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,420
So we set up a separates experimental
bus route in a very rural part of

782
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:06,620
Connecticut that was far away from any
residential unit or any other source of

783
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:08,900
carbon that we could think
of other than carbon.

784
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,820
That's kind of moving long distance,

785
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,481
uh,

786
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:11,721
and,

787
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:12,051
and,

788
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:12,400
uh,

789
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,880
existing at low levels.

790
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,670
So we would look at our meters
and see that the levels were,

791
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,211
were,

792
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:17,390
uh,

793
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,223
close to,

794
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,063
to zero.

795
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,030
Uh,

796
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,660
and,

797
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,751
uh,

798
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,510
this was reflected also in the
states monitoring facilities.

799
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,291
Uh,

800
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:28,650
and then we turned the buses on and we
saw an immediate jump in the particular

801
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:30,710
account and also in the voc emissions,

802
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,281
uh,

803
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,060
within the buses.

804
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,893
After we did that,

805
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,020
we also saw a couple of
interesting patterns.

806
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,591
And,

807
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:36,710
uh,

808
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,910
my daughter for example,

809
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,110
was it was on a school bus.

810
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:39,520
She,

811
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,240
she was picked up,

812
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,550
uh,

813
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,410
near my house and she was taken to
school and there's this increase in

814
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:46,370
concentration,

815
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,340
which is kind of curious.

816
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,300
And then as she got to a school where
she got off the bus for about 10 minutes

817
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,330
or five minutes until she was
transferred to another bus,

818
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,690
she walked about 50
yards away from the bus,

819
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,260
uh,

820
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,340
and then got back on the next bus and
picked her up and took her eventually to

821
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:05,174
school.

822
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,700
So,

823
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:05,960
uh,

824
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,980
this was pretty good.

825
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,600
A pretty good demonstration that,

826
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,441
that,

827
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:09,611
uh,

828
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,020
that the air quality
within the bus itself was,

829
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,883
was a serious,

830
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,390
a source of exposure.

831
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,750
We also found a kind of curiously,

832
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,290
if we looked at kind of the,

833
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,850
the horizontal movement,

834
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,271
uh,

835
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:21,610
and we also looked at the,

836
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,643
the uh,

837
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,330
uh,

838
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,280
behavioral pattern that we could,

839
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:29,870
we could figure out that a elevation
change across a root made a difference in

840
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,700
the particle level within the bus cabin.

841
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,460
So it was a bus went uphill.

842
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,470
It's underload,

843
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:34,820
uh,

844
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,770
it produces more pollution.

845
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,161
Ah,

846
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:41,520
emissions are quite a bit higher both
for [inaudible] as well as for for uh,

847
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,580
uh,

848
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,030
the small particles.

849
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,541
In fact,

850
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,010
I was a,

851
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,810
I was coming to work the other day in,

852
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,470
in traffic and uh,

853
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,250
there was a truck next to me and uh,

854
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,520
the truck was using his,

855
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:52,670
his engine as a brake.

856
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,440
So we would accelerate and traffic.

857
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:54,741
And I was,

858
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:57,170
I was right behind this
bus accelerate and traffic.

859
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:59,610
I could see the dark
black smoke coming out,

860
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:02,480
meaning the engine is under load and
it's not operating very efficiently.

861
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,330
And then the traffic in front
of the truck would slow down.

862
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,410
And he would use his,

863
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,210
his engine to break the truck.

864
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,560
It was under load again.

865
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,450
And then you see the
black smoke come up again.

866
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,480
So I remember that a cruising
speed that at about 65,

867
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:18,680
70 miles an hour is the most
efficient level of combustion for,

868
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,480
for most diesel trucks and vehicles.

869
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,321
And by the way,

870
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:22,850
I don't think I mentioned
this the other day,

871
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:25,550
there are about 90 million
diesel trucks and vehicles,

872
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,010
uh,

873
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:26,810
uh,

874
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:26,991
uh,

875
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,160
in the United States today.

876
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,030
So this problem is much bigger than
just the 600,000 school buses that,

877
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,691
that,

878
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:32,821
uh,

879
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:34,940
I'm looking at in this study,

880
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,560
we also found that if we compare the
level of exposure to the kids on the bus

881
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,700
inside the cabin,

882
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,200
uh,

883
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,100
and to the federal standard,

884
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,441
uh,

885
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:45,930
that they were experiencing levels
that were quite a bit higher,

886
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,980
uh,

887
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,170
sometimes 20 to 25 times higher,

888
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:49,790
uh,

889
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,240
on it for short periods of time.

890
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,810
And then we found this kind
of a curious thing that,

891
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:53,980
uh,

892
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,260
an idling vehicle,

893
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:55,680
uh,

894
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,900
collects more pollution inside the cabin,

895
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,860
then a,

896
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:00,000
a moving vehicle.

897
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,360
So there's a ventilation process
that did occur is when a vehicle,

898
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,560
one vehicle moves,

899
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,070
unless the vehicle is
moving in a train of a bus,

900
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,470
our buses that are
coming into a school or,

901
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:10,690
or,

902
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,640
or leading a school.

903
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:12,871
By the way,

904
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:13,800
most vehicles have,

905
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,180
have no filtration system.

906
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,790
Most trucks and buses have no
filtration system for the air,

907
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,361
uh,

908
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:18,591
in,

909
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:18,720
in,

910
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,280
in the,

911
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,680
uh,

912
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,513
indoor cabin.

913
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,211
And by the way,

914
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:23,280
if you get to the point where
you want to buy a new car,

915
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,880
I would really encourage you to think
carefully about the relative quality of

916
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:27,714
air filtration.

917
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,560
There's some vehicles now the Japanese
vehicles started to put filtration

918
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,520
equipment in first.

919
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,050
Uh,

920
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,301
but it,

921
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:36,600
it makes a significant difference
to the quality of the indoor air.

922
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,510
You can test that in a kind
of an interesting way with
respect to particulates

923
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:41,344
and carbon.

924
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,940
Cause you can just take your finger and
they don't clean your dashboard for six

925
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:45,211
months,

926
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:46,044
for example.

927
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,960
And then just take your finger and wipe
it across and you'll pick up a variety

928
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:49,100
of,

929
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,850
of particles that will
come in because of the,

930
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,000
the interior cabinet
is so poorly filtered.

931
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,590
So this,

932
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,880
this idling issue,

933
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,780
uh,

934
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,710
prompted us to think,

935
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:58,921
well,

936
00:27:58,921 --> 00:27:59,131
you know,

937
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:04,131
one no brainer as a policy response
would be to try to get the bus drivers to

938
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:05,880
shut their engines off
while they were idling.

939
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,010
This is a much harder problem to crack
with respect to two trucks because trucks

940
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:11,760
today,

941
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:11,990
uh,

942
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,930
are commonly,

943
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,873
uh,

944
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,791
on their,

945
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:18,520
their ignition is switched on
a 24 hours a day because the,

946
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:18,871
the,

947
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:19,110
uh,

948
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,710
engine itself is providing electricity
through a generator to refrigerate the,

949
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,180
the,

950
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,660
uh,

951
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,171
cargo,

952
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,480
but it's also providing
electricity for the main cabin.

953
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,261
Uh,

954
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:30,510
and for some long distance haulers,

955
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,490
especially independent operators,

956
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,121
you know,

957
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:34,380
they basically live in their trucks.

958
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:38,460
They will pull over to the side of the
Mcdonald's and sleep for six or eight

959
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:38,881
hours,

960
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:40,200
or the pull into a truck stop.

961
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,910
And most truck stops are not equipped
with these electronic outlets so that they

962
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,980
could plug their truck in
and turn their engine off.

963
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,540
So they're burning fuel,

964
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:48,711
uh,

965
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:51,870
almost 24 hours a day and island and the,

966
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:51,991
uh,

967
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:52,181
the,

968
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:52,800
the,

969
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,780
the level of emissions are higher,

970
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,130
uh,

971
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,390
in the engine while it's idling.

972
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,710
But also I think that,

973
00:28:58,711 --> 00:28:58,841
uh,

974
00:28:58,841 --> 00:28:59,011
the,

975
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:00,620
the truck drivers exposure is,

976
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:02,430
is really quite a serious issue.

977
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,770
So we also found that the,

978
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:04,861
uh,

979
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,140
the filtration equipment in,

980
00:29:06,141 --> 00:29:07,640
in these buses that were built in,

981
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,290
in year 2000 [inaudible] was so poor.

982
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,520
It virtually,

983
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,350
it was large enough the,

984
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,420
the little spaces in the airflow,

985
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,820
we're large enough so that you could
stick a pencil point through it.

986
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,341
Uh,

987
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:22,350
so clearly it wasn't going to give
any protection at all for low diameter

988
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:25,560
particulate matter pm 10 or pm 2.5.

989
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,060
So there are a variety of factors
here that you can read an influence,

990
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:33,420
the degree of concentration and whether
or not the windows are open or whether

991
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:35,250
or not they're closed the engine type,

992
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:35,871
the age of the,

993
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:36,520
the uh,

994
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,930
uh,

995
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:41,930
engine in the bus so that older buses
are more polluting than the newer buses

996
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:42,780
are.

997
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,210
[inaudible].

998
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,670
And a one curious thing
about this was whenever I,

999
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,541
whenever I do a study,

1000
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,250
I always assume that
I'm going to get sued.

1001
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,800
And I was assuming that the large
diesel manufacturing companies were,

1002
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:52,510
we're uh,

1003
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:52,900
uh,

1004
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,370
going to give me a pretty rough ride.

1005
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,870
And I was really quite surprised
because they wanted to promote my work.

1006
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,310
They were really interested in having
this become very common knowledge.

1007
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,810
And why might that be,

1008
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,553
sorry,

1009
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,150
sell new engines.

1010
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:11,290
That's exactly the answer.

1011
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:16,291
They were interested in
selling new engines that
would emit lower levels of the

1012
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,920
particles that we were measuring.

1013
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,470
And uh,

1014
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:19,750
you know,

1015
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,100
put that idea together with the
fact that most trucks have a,

1016
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:23,610
a,

1017
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:23,740
a,

1018
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,960
an active lifespan of three
to 4 million miles and,

1019
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,000
and often 30 to two,

1020
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,640
sometimes even 35 years.

1021
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,810
So they were anxious that the standards
be lowered so that they could sell more

1022
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,153
vehicles.

1023
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,240
So there are a variety of,

1024
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:39,100
of lessons here.

1025
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,470
Uh,

1026
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,800
we were also measuring
emissions with when,

1027
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,050
uh,

1028
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,630
the vehicles we're using,

1029
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,350
uh,

1030
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,320
on sulfur content and the fuel
that was 500 parts per million.

1031
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,040
And remember I told you the other day
that now the ultra low sulfur fuels are

1032
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,120
available and in use,

1033
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:52,631
uh,

1034
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:55,300
as a requirement completely
phased in in the nation,

1035
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:55,960
uh,

1036
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,300
as well as has a,

1037
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,350
a particle traps that will take out
some of the compounds of concern.

1038
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,760
Now,

1039
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,880
as you're thinking about this as a policy
problem and then you're thinking about

1040
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,650
it with respect to the clean air act,

1041
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,790
you should also think about different
parts of the country that are either

1042
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,940
within or are out of
compliance with our standards.

1043
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,103
So the,

1044
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,980
these exposures that are,

1045
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,960
are being experienced by,

1046
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,761
by kids or,

1047
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:22,594
or the drivers,

1048
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,900
they're coming on top of
background air quality problems.

1049
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:26,711
In other words,

1050
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:27,011
the,

1051
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:27,341
the,

1052
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:27,820
uh,

1053
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,140
if you look here in Connecticut,

1054
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,401
you see that,

1055
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:30,770
uh,

1056
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,210
uh,

1057
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,790
we are a southern part of Connecticut.

1058
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:38,791
We are in an orange where we're exceeding
a the eight hour ozone standard.

1059
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,401
Uh,

1060
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,260
and we were also,

1061
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:41,680
uh,

1062
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,680
when we were doing the study exceeding
the particulate matter standard as well,

1063
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,390
so that,

1064
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,140
uh,

1065
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,170
on a day like this,

1066
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,621
uh,

1067
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:53,110
you get many of the particles
being rained out of the air,

1068
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,540
but on a still humid day,

1069
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,650
in the middle of the summer,

1070
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:58,990
you're going to get a very
high level background.

1071
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:01,030
Ambient has called ambient exposure.

1072
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,890
So that these,

1073
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,221
these,

1074
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:03,540
uh,

1075
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:03,850
uh,

1076
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,170
within the bus exposures,

1077
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:09,190
or you could imagine other kinds
of pollutants in your daily life,

1078
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,280
they're coming on top of this
background level of exposure.

1079
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,460
I was also quite surprised to find that,

1080
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,210
uh,

1081
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,190
diesel particles are measurable,

1082
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,730
uh,

1083
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,440
in any building in the nation.

1084
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,710
There's an ambient background
level of diesel particles,

1085
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,070
uh,

1086
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,760
even in this room as we were able
to discern just the other day.

1087
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,690
But,

1088
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:28,880
uh,

1089
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,970
I can't smell diesel
exhaust in the room today.

1090
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,481
Uh,

1091
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:32,380
but if you had a,

1092
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:32,631
the,

1093
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:34,690
the latest and most sensitive
detection equipment,

1094
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,080
uh,

1095
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,831
you could smell it.

1096
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,530
So we're all experiencing this
background level of exposure.

1097
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,460
So I'm,

1098
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:39,651
you know,

1099
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:43,280
one way of thinking about it is how many
hours on the bus is going to lead to

1100
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,581
two,

1101
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,860
what kind of a total exposure and a,

1102
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:46,481
so if the,

1103
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:50,100
the blue here is represented
and representative of,

1104
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,100
of the background level of exposure,

1105
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,270
maybe 18,

1106
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:53,841
17,

1107
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:54,471
18,

1108
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:54,940
uh,

1109
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,350
uh,

1110
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,970
uh,

1111
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,390
uh,

1112
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,720
micrograms per cubic meter of pm 2.5,

1113
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,310
then these other bus exposures in the
colored segments are coming on top of

1114
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,000
that.

1115
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,990
So if you look way over on
the right for our child,

1116
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:09,470
it's on a bus for three hours,

1117
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,940
they would be experiencing,

1118
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,620
uh,

1119
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,310
the,

1120
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,700
the level of pollution that would be
twice with the federal standard is.

1121
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,630
So as you're thinking about how to
create a health protective standard,

1122
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,081
uh,

1123
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:25,070
you need to think about these ambient
average background levels that are being

1124
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,360
picked up and measured by,

1125
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,220
by the fixed monitoring equipment.

1126
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,540
But also think about just how daily
behavior leads people to be exposed and in

1127
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,530
very different ways.

1128
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,743
Now also,

1129
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,680
it's curious that the European Union
is moving much more rapidly to,

1130
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,870
to promote diesel vehicles and,

1131
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:44,030
and diesel engines,

1132
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:44,690
uh,

1133
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,000
predominantly to reduce co two emissions.

1134
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:47,661
Uh,

1135
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:48,230
so that,

1136
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,390
uh,

1137
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,400
diesel now represents about 20%
of the Europeans passenger fleet,

1138
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,390
whereas in the United States
it represents less than 3%.

1139
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,741
So that,

1140
00:33:57,741 --> 00:33:58,060
uh,

1141
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,240
it,

1142
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,920
it presents a real dilemma
too to think through.

1143
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,850
Do we want to reduce co two or do we
want to be more concerned about lowering

1144
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,800
the level of exposure to
these particular dates?

1145
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,263
So,

1146
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,570
you know,

1147
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,700
these kinds of questions can,

1148
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,250
can lead to policy recommendations,

1149
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:13,821
uh,

1150
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,230
and for any kind of a problem.

1151
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,910
I want to encourage you to think about,

1152
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,930
first of all,

1153
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,141
you know,

1154
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,620
what's the right target for your,

1155
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:22,010
your proposal is that
the federal government,

1156
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,910
state government,

1157
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,020
local governments,

1158
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,651
uh,

1159
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:25,484
would it be a,

1160
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,320
a voluntary standards that you might
encourage to the corporations that

1161
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:31,400
manufacture these,

1162
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,443
these products?

1163
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,380
Uh,

1164
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,360
or what could you recommend to an
individual to reduce their exposure today?

1165
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,790
Kind of curiously in response
to that last question.

1166
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,450
Uh,

1167
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,430
many parents responded to this study
that got much more publicity than it

1168
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,260
deserves in terms of
the investment of money.

1169
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,280
This study costs about,

1170
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,413
uh,

1171
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,770
probably 30,

1172
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:53,920
a 30 to $35,000 to,

1173
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:54,271
to,

1174
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:54,740
uh,

1175
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,550
to do,

1176
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,490
but people all over the country
stopped driving their kids to school,

1177
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,390
which was a problem.

1178
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,051
Uh,

1179
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:00,970
so I had to,

1180
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,500
to come up with some press releases,

1181
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,010
uh,

1182
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,311
that,

1183
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:04,850
uh,

1184
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,720
demonstrated that the congestion at some
schools was increasing because people

1185
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,190
were not putting their kids on the bus.

1186
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,830
Uh,

1187
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:15,830
and it was also increasing the risk of
injury from accidents at the schools so

1188
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:16,521
that,

1189
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:16,760
uh,

1190
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,491
driving your,

1191
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,120
your kids to school is
not the right answer.

1192
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:20,810
You get a,

1193
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:20,990
you know,

1194
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,530
many more,

1195
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,420
many more vehicles arriving at the school,

1196
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,790
creating a pollution that would be,

1197
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,243
uh,

1198
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,660
a higher than the quote
would be coming from the bus.

1199
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,780
So recommendations to
the federal government,

1200
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:38,110
a retrofit diesel buses with two to
ensure lower put particle traps on them.

1201
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,481
And as the,

1202
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:39,631
uh,

1203
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:42,180
the film segment showed
a that's expensive,

1204
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,820
that cost about $6,000 per vehicle to do.

1205
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,481
Uh,

1206
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:45,820
and it's,

1207
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,070
it's an important issue in,

1208
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:51,300
in some of of the states and the federal
government have really stepped up in

1209
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:53,010
response to this so that,

1210
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:53,430
uh,

1211
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,690
who's going to pay for this?

1212
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,500
Well,

1213
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:55,650
uh,

1214
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:55,921
it's,

1215
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:56,910
it's interesting that a,

1216
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,510
so far I've been keeping track of,

1217
00:35:58,511 --> 00:35:59,344
of uh,

1218
00:35:59,540 --> 00:35:59,800
uh,

1219
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,220
what the state expenditures have been
and what the federal government's

1220
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,090
expenditures have been.

1221
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:03,691
And,

1222
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:03,840
uh,

1223
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,470
right now we're close to a half a billion
dollars that's been spent on school

1224
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:09,860
bus retrofits or,

1225
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,920
or substituting the,

1226
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:11,310
uh,

1227
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:11,641
the,

1228
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:12,210
uh,

1229
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:12,540
uh,

1230
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,820
lower emitting newer
engines for the older,

1231
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,940
older engines so that requiring the
buses to use ultra low sulfur fuel at the

1232
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:22,740
time the study came out was a
really important recommendation.

1233
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,810
5,500 parts per million of software as
opposed to 15 parts per million of sulfur

1234
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,860
produces a much,

1235
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,010
much higher level of particulate matter.

1236
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,200
So testing tailpipe emissions.

1237
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:35,700
It's kind of interesting that that,

1238
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:35,881
uh,

1239
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:37,200
we have to have our cars,

1240
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,590
uh,

1241
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,270
tested for tailpipe emissions,

1242
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,730
but trucks and buses generally do not,

1243
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,240
uh,

1244
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,721
so that,

1245
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:43,554
uh,

1246
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,220
they,

1247
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,030
they are exempt.

1248
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,421
In fact,

1249
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:47,250
they can be pulled over on the highway,

1250
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:47,761
uh,

1251
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:49,180
and uh,

1252
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,430
they can be asked by a department
of Environmental Protection,

1253
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:53,971
uh,

1254
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:54,510
working,

1255
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:54,781
uh,

1256
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,100
an employee working for the state,

1257
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:56,530
uh,

1258
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,660
to turn their engine on.

1259
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:02,040
And they will hold what's
called a wrinkled chart up
against it that gives them

1260
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:06,840
different levels of opacity and the hold
that up against the sky and visually

1261
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,770
try to compare,

1262
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,260
uh,

1263
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,640
the darkness of the emissions to
their chart to figure out what,

1264
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,280
whether or not they think that
the truck is in compliance.

1265
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:14,731
Well,

1266
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:15,420
this is not,

1267
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,800
this is not the right way to go.

1268
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:17,634
There should be much more,

1269
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,570
a much more intense
and a precise estimate,

1270
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:21,841
uh,

1271
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:22,110
that,

1272
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,431
that,

1273
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:22,890
uh,

1274
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,060
we had the technology available to
conduct this kinds of emissions testing.

1275
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,420
So,

1276
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,190
uh,

1277
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,940
the other thing to think here that is
important on this list is that the federal

1278
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:33,541
standards,

1279
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:38,541
the 15 micrograms per cubic meter
that is assuming a safe level,

1280
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,153
uh,

1281
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,060
what the safe threshold would be
with respect to outdoor pollution,

1282
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,620
not with respect to within vehicle
pollution or other indoor sources,

1283
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,250
uh,

1284
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,810
being added on top of that.

1285
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,913
So that,

1286
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,161
you know,

1287
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:56,850
my belief is that these federal standards
are not health protective because they

1288
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:01,200
basically are looking at the problem as
a one source at a time or just measuring

1289
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:04,770
what's going on in the outdoor environment
and forgetting that we spend 90% of

1290
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:05,920
our time either indoors or,

1291
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,020
or within vehicles.

1292
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,160
Uh,

1293
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,940
so we also clearly need to expand the
monitoring network and the idea that we're

1294
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:16,941
getting our image of the intensity of
this kind of a problem by just relying on

1295
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,720
fixed monitors outdoors,

1296
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,430
it really makes little sense.

1297
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,420
So putting monitors on individuals and
then following them through their daily

1298
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:25,080
life,

1299
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,590
that's,

1300
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,950
that's going to give you a much
more accurate representation
of really what your

1301
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,240
exposure and risk might be.

1302
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,120
So this is a very expensive alternative.

1303
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:33,540
Uh,

1304
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,290
but it's likely to be
the wave of the future.

1305
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,210
So the a second target for this
study has been state governments.

1306
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,610
So what could state governments do that,

1307
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:42,910
uh,

1308
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,260
the federal government could not do?

1309
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:44,801
Well,

1310
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:45,310
they could,

1311
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,100
they could prohibit a school
bus idling by statute.

1312
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,181
And in fact,

1313
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:49,361
uh,

1314
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,470
when this study came out,

1315
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,940
we proposed a law in Connecticut that
would demand a maximum of three minutes

1316
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,244
for idling.

1317
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,290
And since we did that,

1318
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,500
there are 26 other states that
have adopted this same idea,

1319
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,840
say fuel as well as reduce pollution.

1320
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:05,674
So it's kind of a,

1321
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,190
uh,

1322
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,900
a double win situation.

1323
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,120
So requiring buses to,

1324
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,321
to,

1325
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:11,800
uh,

1326
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,071
uh,

1327
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:12,904
also,

1328
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,863
uh,

1329
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,680
are requiring more buses to drive shorter
distances is another way of reducing

1330
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:18,514
exposure.

1331
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,440
So when most school districts like,

1332
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:20,770
uh,

1333
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,550
uh,

1334
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,120
uh,

1335
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,481
we're,

1336
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:24,390
we're seeing today with respect to,

1337
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,550
to declining state grants
and federal grants,

1338
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,110
uh,

1339
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,560
to,

1340
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,830
to two school districts,

1341
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,360
what are they doing there?

1342
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,810
They're using fewer buses
and they're using their,

1343
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,041
they're,

1344
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,650
they're putting the kids on the buses for,

1345
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,000
for longer periods of time.

1346
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,850
So the roots are actually going in
the wrong direction leading to higher

1347
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:40,684
exposures.

1348
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,370
And finally,

1349
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:47,020
local governments are really responsible
for enforcing these island bands.

1350
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,771
And,

1351
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:47,891
uh,

1352
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,860
we found a couple of followup
studies that there's about,

1353
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,090
there's about a 55 to 75% compliance rate,

1354
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:55,600
uh,

1355
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,311
for no island,

1356
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,430
particularly at schools.

1357
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,950
So now when we did this study,

1358
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:03,610
all the buses would pull up and they'd
idle while a kids got on the buses or

1359
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,370
they would idle as the kids got
off the buses to go into school.

1360
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:06,940
Uh,

1361
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,140
but now it's quite interesting.

1362
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,711
The,

1363
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:08,861
the,

1364
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:11,500
the monitors here turned out not to be,

1365
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,070
uh,

1366
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,390
people that worked for the government,

1367
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,040
but instead the school teachers,

1368
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,870
cause the cu school teachers were,

1369
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:17,200
were,

1370
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,130
have long been angry.

1371
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,120
I hadn't understood this,

1372
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,470
but they were angry at the way that,

1373
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:20,711
that,

1374
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:21,190
uh,

1375
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,030
the emissions were,

1376
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,680
were making their way into the school.

1377
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,240
And we found that many school systems
had their ventilation system set up so

1378
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:28,500
that,

1379
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,570
uh,

1380
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,110
they were,

1381
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,610
they were pulling the air from the
bus loading area into the school.

1382
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,151
Uh,

1383
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:36,250
and I had one superintendent tell me that,

1384
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:36,731
that,

1385
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:37,030
uh,

1386
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,650
she always knew when the buses were,

1387
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:39,484
were arriving,

1388
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,001
uh,

1389
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:44,350
even though she was 250 yards away from
where they were arriving on the other

1390
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:45,430
side of the complex,

1391
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:45,911
uh,

1392
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:49,240
because the air ventilation system was
picking it up and redistributing it

1393
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,500
throughout the entire school.

1394
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,360
So just kind of thinking
about to a building design
as well as important also in

1395
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:59,290
my own town and a response to this
because we did some of the testing and the

1396
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,124
town,

1397
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,710
when the town build a
new school two years ago,

1398
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,960
it decided to create a staging area,

1399
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,400
separate parking facility or buses
could go and instead of all the buses

1400
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,990
training in at the same time,

1401
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:12,280
we're all leaving at the same time,

1402
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,170
they could stagger it so that,

1403
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,650
uh,

1404
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,050
you know,

1405
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,690
when one bus is following another bus,

1406
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,520
it's simply going to be
picking up the exhaust,

1407
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,350
uh,

1408
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:19,690
uh,

1409
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,523
and distributing it.

1410
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,300
So I wanted to give you just a sense
of a couple other kinds of air quality

1411
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:27,880
problems that you may not have heard of.

1412
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,470
This one was new to me.

1413
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,470
I the,

1414
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,120
there was a CNN reporter from,

1415
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:34,300
uh,

1416
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,130
uh,

1417
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:35,330
uh,

1418
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:35,660
who's,

1419
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,970
who's beat as a Pentagon who called
me the other day and he said,

1420
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:38,600
uh,

1421
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,440
can you help me out?

1422
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:42,640
Can you help me understand
what the threat is to,

1423
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,400
uh,

1424
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,680
people in the military
from open pit burning,

1425
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,061
open pit,

1426
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:48,350
burning of garbage.

1427
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,680
Uh,

1428
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
right now is,

1429
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:52,580
is it prohibited in the United States,

1430
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,900
although many people do it
in their backyard and open
pit burning is the primary

1431
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:59,630
source of emission of
dioxins to the atmosphere.

1432
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,150
So people on the right hand side of this,

1433
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,680
uh,

1434
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:02,850
in,

1435
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,160
in a barrel will stuff their,

1436
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:04,810
their garbage,

1437
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,660
their waste into it,

1438
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,280
and just burn it instead of having to,

1439
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:08,600
to pay for a trash collector.

1440
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,190
So you might save a,

1441
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,430
you know,

1442
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,470
$100 per month if you did this.

1443
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,200
So,

1444
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,731
so that,

1445
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:13,971
uh,

1446
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:14,301
what,

1447
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:18,950
what's coming out is a product of
very low temperature combustion,

1448
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,660
which is perfect for the formation
of dioxins and furans dioxins.

1449
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:28,270
Some of the congeners are known to be
the most carcinogenic substances that we

1450
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,180
are now aware of.

1451
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,141
So that,

1452
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:30,520
uh,

1453
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:30,640
uh,

1454
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,070
also you could think about how
pollution would kind of gather on,

1455
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,780
on the surface nearby,

1456
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,200
could gather on foods
or vegetable gardens,

1457
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,570
but also kids playing in a sandbox.

1458
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,620
So this is a kind of a
surprising source of,

1459
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:49,130
of our exposure to dioxins
that are persistent
bioaccumulative and carcinogenic.

1460
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,300
Uh,

1461
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,280
there is a lawsuit that is
being considered by a group of,

1462
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:54,740
of,

1463
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,573
uh,

1464
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,150
uh,

1465
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,030
those in the,

1466
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:57,320
uh,

1467
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,153
air force,

1468
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,401
uh,

1469
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,890
that we're responsible for
maintaining these trash pits.

1470
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,160
They're responsible to throw the garbage
in and you can imagine what their

1471
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:05,120
exposure would be.

1472
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,540
And what is the primary component
now of most of our waste?

1473
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,530
Well,

1474
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,270
it's turning out to be in terms of of,

1475
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:11,650
uh,

1476
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,720
a spatial volume rather than wait,

1477
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:15,920
it's turning out to be plastics.

1478
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,270
So plastics,

1479
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:17,931
when they're burned,

1480
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:19,580
particularly polyvinyl chloride,

1481
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,890
is pretty well recognized to emit dioxins.

1482
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,910
We have another phenomenon going on in
response to higher fossil fuel prices,

1483
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,480
uh,

1484
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,630
especially in the northern
latitudes in the country.

1485
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,100
And these are wood boilers.

1486
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,090
People are buying wood boilers
and basically not using their,

1487
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,020
their furnaces,

1488
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,970
they're natural gas furnaces or their,

1489
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:38,361
their,

1490
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,800
uh,

1491
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,110
uh,

1492
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,490
diesel fuel furnaces.

1493
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,340
So that,

1494
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,711
that,

1495
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:41,970
uh,

1496
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,520
these burn at a fairly,

1497
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,540
uh,

1498
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,250
low temperature and they also admit a
variety of pollutants including most of

1499
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,084
the particles,

1500
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,600
uh,

1501
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,931
that,

1502
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:51,510
uh,

1503
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:51,980
uh,

1504
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,060
in diameters that,

1505
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,111
that,

1506
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:54,380
uh,

1507
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:54,671
are,

1508
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:55,371
are quite small,

1509
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,730
just like tobacco smoke or
we're like a diesel emissions.

1510
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,010
And here's just one
example of the effect of,

1511
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:01,281
of,

1512
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:04,880
of one household having a one wood burner.

1513
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,390
And you can see this spreading
over an area that that,

1514
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:08,750
uh,

1515
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,583
is now,

1516
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:09,830
uh,

1517
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,300
at this point in the photograph,

1518
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:11,930
uh,

1519
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,530
it's about,

1520
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:12,740
uh,

1521
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,180
almost a half a mile wide and the
concentration of particulate in this area

1522
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,500
because I've worked on woodsmoke smoke,

1523
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,660
if you can see wood smoke at this level,

1524
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,180
the particular concentrations
are likely to be,

1525
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:23,900
uh,

1526
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,351
in the,

1527
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:24,740
uh,

1528
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,920
many multiples above that
15 microgram federal limit.

1529
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,800
So that this is a phenomenon that,

1530
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,500
uh,

1531
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,500
is increasing in prevalence and leading
to two really quite extreme exposures.

1532
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,790
I know this firsthand because
I have a neighbor that,

1533
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:38,940
uh,

1534
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,040
installed one of these boilers and to,

1535
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,100
he lives in a valley and I live
on the hill above the valley.

1536
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,100
So every morning when the air is still,

1537
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,320
because the sun has an
energize the atmosphere,

1538
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,910
it builds up in the valley,

1539
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,940
just like you can see in,

1540
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:52,330
in,

1541
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,163
in this case,

1542
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,860
it takes a son too to a heat,

1543
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,710
the atmosphere and basically
until about nine or 10 o'clock,

1544
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,260
uh,

1545
00:44:59,260 --> 00:44:59,520
it,

1546
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,353
it elevates,

1547
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:00,851
but a,

1548
00:45:00,851 --> 00:45:04,410
our house is filled with wood
smoke from his house as an example.

1549
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,161
And,

1550
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:05,281
uh,

1551
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:05,521
the,

1552
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:10,521
the compounds in Woodsmoke are just as
dangerous as the compounds in tobacco.

1553
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:11,281
You know,

1554
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:15,690
one other kind of idea that a student
picked up on after this lecture a few

1555
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,300
years ago was the idea of
mapping out healthy roots,

1556
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:18,721
uh,

1557
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:20,550
for exercise and urban environments.

1558
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,151
I mean,

1559
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,960
could you think about what the healthiest
route would be through new haven to

1560
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:25,810
ride your bike or,

1561
00:45:25,811 --> 00:45:26,644
or to run?

1562
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,241
I mean,

1563
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,770
you certainly would want to run a,

1564
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,060
say a in New York City within central
park where you would have much higher

1565
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:34,440
quality than you would if you ran,

1566
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,330
say along the Hudson River Parkway.

1567
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:36,991
Uh,

1568
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:37,531
so that,

1569
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:37,770
uh,

1570
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,600
could you map out the
healthiest running route?

1571
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:39,840
Uh,

1572
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,141
and,

1573
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:40,231
uh,

1574
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:43,110
the student did putting
our particle meters on a,

1575
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:43,944
on a bicycle.

1576
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,290
And,

1577
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:45,720
uh,

1578
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,000
one other thing that I'd like you to
think about that we're not going to have

1579
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,070
much time to consider is,

1580
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:50,790
you know,

1581
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,200
the kinds of consumer,

1582
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:52,580
uh,

1583
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,070
uh,

1584
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,090
behaviors that could,

1585
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,540
could,

1586
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,670
can lead to rather intense exposures.

1587
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,211
You know,

1588
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:59,090
whether or not it's the plugin fragrances,

1589
00:45:59,280 --> 00:45:59,540
uh,

1590
00:45:59,540 --> 00:45:59,800
the,

1591
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,110
the car air fresheners.

1592
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,220
And when I saw this,

1593
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:03,840
and I mean everybody knows about these,

1594
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:05,130
but the concept that,

1595
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:05,580
uh,

1596
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:05,731
you know,

1597
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:08,350
you're sitting in traffic and you're
really bothered by diesel exhausts,

1598
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:09,570
so you put up a car,

1599
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:10,404
air freshener,

1600
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,070
uh,

1601
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,260
that submitting volatile
organic compounds that,

1602
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:13,920
uh,

1603
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,320
you may think are more pleasing
than the diesel exhaust,

1604
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,141
but they are,

1605
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,600
are largely untested.

1606
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:18,990
They're,

1607
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,640
they're completely unregulated.

1608
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,740
Also the idea of aroma therapy,

1609
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,250
uh,

1610
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,080
not knowing what those compounds are,

1611
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,443
fragrances.

1612
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,060
Uh,

1613
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,860
when we talk about plastics next week,

1614
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:29,041
we'll,

1615
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:29,900
we'll find that a,

1616
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,380
there are plasticizers that are,

1617
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,990
are hormonally active in,

1618
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,430
in humans and many species of mammals,

1619
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,001
uh,

1620
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,331
that,

1621
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:36,511
uh,

1622
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:41,370
are components of some of the most
heavily used fragrances and also laundry

1623
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:42,180
detergents.

1624
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,420
And many people are experiencing
reactions to these fragrances.

1625
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:46,830
And we're getting them in,

1626
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,390
in mixtures that really are not,

1627
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:48,840
uh,

1628
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,860
not well understood.

1629
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,130
So I'll leave you with that thinking that,

1630
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:53,580
uh,

1631
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:53,821
you know,

1632
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:55,350
as you walk through your daily life,

1633
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:55,920
uh,

1634
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,150
think about ways you could modify your
behavior in a way that would reduce your

1635
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:00,984
exposure.

1636
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,460
Thank you very much.
