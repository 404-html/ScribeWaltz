1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,680
Today I want to talk about water and the,
uh,

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:09,030
the law that surrounds drinking
water, uh, to talk about its quality.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,680
Talk about, uh, what your
rights are to clean water, uh,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,910
to also give you a sense of what
key threats are to drinking water.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,560
Uh, what's your exposure might be, and a,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,650
what we might do about it both
legally but also personally.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,410
Uh, water is a critical component
of our environment in our bodies.

8
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:35,250
Your body is close to 70% water.
Uh,

9
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:39,960
you can go for several weeks, two
to three, on average without food.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,780
You can only go for about
four minutes without air,

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,890
and you can go for maybe four or five
days without water before you die.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,740
So water is absolutely critical.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,120
And one of the key arguments I want
to make today is that it's a largely

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,720
neglected area of environmental law,
uh,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,590
given the rapid increase
in our knowledge about, uh,

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,600
chemical threats to water quality and,
uh, where those threats come from.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,120
So what are the major challenges in water
on a global scale? No, clearly one is,

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,150
is a waterborne diseases diarrheal
diseases are recognized to kill,

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,040
uh, between, uh, uh, four and
5 million people per year, uh,

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,040
in Africa, uh, oh aquifers,

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,450
they cross-property and jurisdictional
boundaries are a critical issue. Uh,

22
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:32,370
so many rivers form the boundary
between nations or between states.

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,720
Connecticut. Uh, the Connecticut River
is a very good example separating, uh,

24
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,900
uh, Vermont, uh, from New Hampshire

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,380
point source control versus a surface
runoff. Uh, we've had a long history,

26
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:46,830
uh,

27
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,800
in the last half of the 20th century of
trying to control a point sources or a

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,870
pipe releases to water supplies as opposed
to thinking about how chemicals may

29
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:01,450
accumulate on the surface, uh, and
then be washed into rivers, uh,

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,830
that are used for drinking water sources,
uh,

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,850
following serious rain events,
groundwater depletion. Uh,

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,050
the Oglala Aquifer in the southwestern
part of the United States and in,

33
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:17,310
in the western part of Texas, uh,
is being rapidly depleted, uh,

34
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,590
and it's contamination is well recognized.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,480
Aquifers around the nation and most
industrialized countries, uh, are,

36
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,410
are now a more intensively tested
than they have been before.

37
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,150
And it's recognized that they contain
chemicals that never were anticipated to

38
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:37,120
persist or, or to migrate
private wells. Uh,

39
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:42,121
the safe drinking water act has been
established in the United States,

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,380
uh, to require testing and
control the chemical content, uh,

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,150
only in water systems that
supply more than 15 households,

42
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,860
15 or more households.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,160
So if you grew up perhaps in a rural
part of the nation or you live outside of

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,310
new haven, uh, you may have your
own well, as I do, uh, so I have a,

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,240
I have a 600 foot deep. Well, and,
uh, when I purchased my house, I was,

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,450
I was quite happy with that prospect
thinking that a water on the surface who

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,830
would need to be filtered
down through the soil, uh,

48
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:19,670
before it got down into the well.
And it was quite striking. A,

49
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,860
I had quite a lesson from a, a well
driller. My well went dry one day.

50
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,300
I didn't know what happened.
Uh,

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,980
so I called the well driller and he
came out and it was pretty remarkable.

52
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,220
A lesson for me.
Within 45 minutes,

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,020
he had pulled up the wellhead. He'd coiled
the water, uh, called, called the pipe.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,490
Uh, and, uh,

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,170
I recognize that I hadn't paid any
attention to the fact that that, uh,

56
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,460
the casing that surrounds the well could
convey water that had been contaminated

57
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,710
on the surface,
uh,

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,960
down the side of the casing and
into the underlying water supply.

59
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:57,370
I'll tell you more about the plastics side
of that story, uh, in a, in a few weeks.

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,930
So wells that, uh, uh,

61
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,940
service greater than 15 households are
regulated under the Safe Drinking Water

62
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,500
Act, which means that if a chemical
is listed on the EPA is list,

63
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,260
then community supplies have to test
for the presence of that chemical. A,

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,040
and if a maximum contaminant level has
been set, uh, that means that, that,

65
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,390
uh,

66
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,050
the provider has to demonstrate that
that ceiling has not been breached or he

67
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:27,310
would have to, he or she would have to
install some sort of filtration system.

68
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,880
So within Connecticut,
by the way,

69
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,840
that means that approximately a 30 to
40% of the Connecticut population, uh,

70
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,210
is getting water that has not managed in
any way by the safe drinking water act,

71
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,651
surface water.

72
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:45,550
In the United States is generally believed
now to be on drinkable for variety of

73
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:50,100
reasons, mostly because of
biological contamination. Uh,
the threat of [inaudible],

74
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,900
but also Giardia, which is carried
by both humans and by animals, uh,

75
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,570
in their waists, monitoring and
surveillance needs much improvement.

76
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,640
I'll talk more about the monitoring
system that is currently in place and why

77
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:07,390
it's deficient. A public water
infrastructure also is inadequate.

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,490
How many of you know, uh, the,

79
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:14,080
the way that water moves from
its source, uh, to your tap?

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,680
Uh, what, uh, what kind of
equipment does it go through?

81
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,540
What kind of filtration
does it go through?

82
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,920
What kind of land uses are allowed in the
watershed that surrounds the, the, uh,

83
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:28,390
the lakes and that, uh, provide
new haven's water supply. Uh,

84
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:32,920
and what about, uh, the pipes that
convey the water to wherever your tap is?

85
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,430
Do you know what they're made
out of? Are they plastic? Uh,

86
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,750
are they copper or they bronze? Are
they metal? Uh, or they are, excuse me.

87
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,190
Are they a,
are they leaded?

88
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,570
There are many connectors in many cities
that are quite old but are no longer

89
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,650
allowed to be installed that connect the
water main itself into your apartment

90
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,810
or into your house. Uh, but uh,

91
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:57,811
they exist and remain because
it's extremely expensive
to dig up every connector

92
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,800
and replace it with a one
that does not contain lead.

93
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,480
How about your faucet itself? Uh,
what's your faucet made out of? Well,

94
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,360
many faucets are made out
of brass and increasingly,

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,350
or they're made out of plastic plastic
that a is painted to look like it's metal

96
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,730
painted silver. Uh, you have to be
really careful when you buy a, uh, a,

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,090
a faucet system or you put in a
drinking water supply system, uh, to,

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,953
to really think

99
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,100
deeply about the source of the materials
and their leach ability into your

100
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:32,720
supply. The leach ability is driven by
a variety of factors. It could be heat.

101
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,250
Uh,
so for example,

102
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,550
you certainly would not want to make a
cup of tea by turning your hot water,

103
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,420
tap on a and then putting
a teabag in the water.

104
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,170
Or you wouldn't want to feed
infant formula to a small
child by putting powder,

105
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,150
uh, for example, in a,

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,860
in a glass and then not filling it up
with hot tap water because the hot tap

107
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:55,880
water is likely to leach more
compounds from the pipe or whatever.

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,000
The conveyance system is
a then cold water wood.

109
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,210
How long do you wait before you,
uh, to let the water run before you,

110
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:07,440
you take a drink out of your tap?
Make sense not to drink a water that,

111
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,220
that has been sitting
in your tap overnight.

112
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,950
They'd come back from vacation
for a couple of weeks. Uh,

113
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,410
we now recognize that a water
that sits in pipes takes,

114
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,010
takes up contaminants from
the conveyance system.

115
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,540
So all of these issues are, we're
thinking about in terms of infrastructure.

116
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,800
How about water rights? Really? What
are your rights to clean water on?

117
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,990
The core question of this
lecture is really, uh,

118
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,700
how safe is safe enough and
how do we define safe, uh,

119
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,580
particularly using the language of the
safe drinking water act. And finally,

120
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,010
how does land use affect water supply?

121
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,810
So many people are not at all thoughtful
about where watershed boundaries in the

122
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:49,010
vicinity of where they live.

123
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,270
They're not thoughtful about how
chemicals can migrate long distances.

124
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,160
I worked in,
in California,

125
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:59,240
in the central valley near Fresno for a
while on a project where chemicals were

126
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:03,710
recognized to migrate more than five miles
from their point of application to an

127
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,890
agricultural field, uh,
into underlying aquifers.

128
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,330
So it depends very much on the
underlying, uh, surficial geology,

129
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,400
the soil structure, the
bedrock, the groundwater
regime, how fast to a chemical,

130
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,190
we'll move some move a
really quite quickly.

131
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,520
Others move really quite slowly if
they can bind to organic matter.

132
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,260
So once again,

133
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:28,160
the safe drinking water act to cover
his supplies that have more than 14

134
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,160
connections or more than 24 individuals.

135
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,360
There are 53,000 water systems in the
United States and 43,000 of those rely on

136
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:42,320
groundwater and about 10,000 rely on
surface water and they're roughly split 50

137
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,030
50 public and private.

138
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,810
And there are 15 million wells in the
United States that serve individual

139
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,090
residences.
And roughly 45 million people,

140
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:54,010
maybe 15% of the population in the nation.
Uh,

141
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,630
our drinking water that
completely unregulated by
the safe drinking water act.

142
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,100
I wondered about this and
I wondered about, uh, uh,

143
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,710
what we could find out about
well, water vulnerability, uh,

144
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
and also if a casing
surrounding a well is cracked,

145
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,170
that means that chemical is
applied to the surface, uh,

146
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,590
have a higher chance of migrating
down the inside of the casing.

147
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,030
So I asked the Department of Environmental
Protection and the Department of

148
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,820
Health here in Connecticut,
if I could get ahold of their database,

149
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,710
a g I s a geographic information system
that they had that identified the

150
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:30,360
location of all wells in
Connecticut, all wells that, uh, uh,

151
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,600
uh,
had been mapped and geocoded.

152
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,680
And then I overlaid that data
with the surficial geology.

153
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,850
And then I started looking at old air
photos wondering about a former land uses.

154
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,830
And a pattern started to emerge
that a, in many areas, uh,

155
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,360
that had been former agricultural lands,
uh,

156
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,900
these have been developed
into residential areas, uh,

157
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:54,120
and wells had been dug into those areas,

158
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,140
provided unregulated water
supplies. Uh, to, uh,

159
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,700
uh, almost a million people in
the, in the state of Connecticut.

160
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,660
It's kind of an interesting story.
When I asked for that database,

161
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,860
I was denied access to it.
Uh,

162
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,760
this was post nine 11 because they
were worried about releasing the, the,

163
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,720
a geo coded data on precisely
where the wells were.

164
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,450
So I had to sign a paper that promise
that I would be legally responsible for

165
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,690
securing that data and
maintaining its confidentiality.

166
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,020
And I would not release it to
anybody who could do something, uh,

167
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,520
a nasty to a public water supply.
So

168
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,950
what about compliance? How are we doing
in the area in the area of compliance?

169
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,990
Well, 30 million people,
uh, drink a water each year.

170
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,160
Little Hiccup there.
For some reason,

171
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,820
30 million people drink water each year
from systems that report violations of

172
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:53,960
health based standards.

173
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,950
There are about 93 chemicals that are
not now on the safe drinking water list,

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,510
uh, that have maximum contaminant levels
assigned to them. So 30 million people,

175
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:05,700
10% of the population drinking
water that report, uh,

176
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,030
with that the systems have
reported are in violation.

177
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,080
10,000 systems violated health
based drinking water standards.

178
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,570
And about 80% of the public water
systems have reported no violations. Uh,

179
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:22,220
an EPA has issued 86,000 violations of
federal requirements to monitor or to

180
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,210
report results.

181
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,040
So the overwhelming number of violations
are associated with a failure to

182
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:32,870
monitor and the failure to report. So
if you don't look, if you don't monitor,

183
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,100
you can't find a problem.

184
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,150
And if you find a problem and
you're a municipal supplier, uh,

185
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,530
that's going to cost a lot of money.

186
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,720
You're either going to try to pass that
cost back on to consumers as increased

187
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:49,280
prices, uh, for, for, uh, prices
per gallon for their water. Uh,

188
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,940
uh, but certainly, uh, you're, you're
not going to want two, excuse me,

189
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,133
one second.

190
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,853
Yeah.

191
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,560
This commonly a delay in reporting.

192
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,180
So what does an MCL g a
maximum contaminant level
goal? EPA established, uh,

193
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,560
both the maximum contaminant level,
which is a legally enforceable women,

194
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,710
but they also established a
maximum contaminant level goal,

195
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:24,270
which is a health based ceiling.

196
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,400
So you would hope that the legal limit
would be the same as the health based

197
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,710
limit. Uh, but that's really not the case.

198
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,030
Okay.

199
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,780
So the safe drinking water
act, uh, creates, uh,

200
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,810
the contaminant level limit as the highest
concentration of a contaminant it's

201
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,744
allowed.

202
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,760
And it also allows a cost benefit
analysis that's required under the safe

203
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:53,200
drinking water act to consider what the
cost would be of meeting that, that, uh,

204
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,200
that limit. If the cost is
found to be excessively high,

205
00:12:56,201 --> 00:13:00,260
they'll set a goal that would be higher
to protect human health and allow a

206
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:03,040
contamination level to
be higher than that.

207
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,260
So here's a chart that gets us to really
what our present level of regulation is.

208
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,350
A,
and you see that after the,

209
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:15,351
the safe drinking water act
was passed back in 1976 that,

210
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,610
uh, no new standards were
enacted. It's kind of interesting.

211
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,990
So Congress basically gives EPA
the mandate, uh, to regulate,

212
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:27,600
monitor water supplies. Uh, but EPA
doesn't really do very much about it. Uh,

213
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,660
this period in the late,

214
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,840
in the 1970s and early 1980s was a period
that EPA was concentrating on source

215
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:37,740
emissions, uh, from,
uh, uh, smokestacks, uh,

216
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,420
as well as auto emissions. Uh, and
also a variety of pesticides, uh,

217
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,670
but really it was paying very
little attention to drinking water.

218
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,870
So it added seven volatile
organic compounds in 1987 about a,

219
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,370
uh, 11 years later, uh, copper
and lead. We're not, uh, uh,

220
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,980
our revised, uh, based upon
new evidence of their toxicity,

221
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,030
uh,

222
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,530
from data that had been collected
back in the 1970s until 1991.

223
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,210
So remember, I argued earlier that there's
often this delay between recognizing,

224
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,230
uh, that, uh, a compound is more
hazardous than earlier thought, uh,

225
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,650
before the agency would take action and,
and set a new limit.

226
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,190
We're saying seeing the same
thing play out here. Well,

227
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,720
Congress was upset at this delay and a,

228
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,730
they demanded that a variety of new
chemicals be added and including a 39

229
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:34,370
pesticides, uh, volatile
organic compounds, metals. Uh,

230
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,250
so these were added in 1991. And then
during the period of the 1990s, uh,

231
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:41,170
seven years,
there were no new standards.

232
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,390
That's kind of interesting because
you might, uh, uh, uh, assume, uh,

233
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,560
quickly that a,
in a,

234
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,530
in a more liberal administration that,
uh,

235
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:53,480
you'd have more rapid
listing of chemicals,

236
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:58,220
you'd have a more protective a character.
This is not the case. Uh, so that, uh,

237
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,121
the,
uh,

238
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:03,170
the liberalism or the conservatism of
the administration seem to have little

239
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,840
influence on this rate rate of adoption.

240
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,800
So today we're sitting here with about
93 different chemicals and just to give

241
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:14,080
you a sense of, of, uh, how
limited, uh, coverage, uh,

242
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,200
and limited the protection level
is, uh, think, think about this.

243
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,290
But among the 39 pesticides, uh, that are,

244
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,760
are monitored and a have these
maximum contaminant limits,

245
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,030
there are approximately a thousand
more that are completely neglected.

246
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,630
Nobody's testing for them, but they're
allowed to be used on agricultural crops.

247
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,760
Uh, and many of these
have not been, uh, uh,

248
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,130
fully study to know how they move
through different kinds of ecosystems or

249
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:47,330
different kinds of geologic systems and
what their potential is to contaminate

250
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,150
the water supply. I think also that, uh,

251
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,230
more than 800 other chemicals,
including industrial chemicals,

252
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:57,560
have been detected in water supplies
by the u s geological service.

253
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,431
And by the way,

254
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:01,790
the u s geological services playing
a really unusual role in this,

255
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,870
in this a regulatory
process, uh, in that, uh,

256
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,940
they sit within the department of the
Interior. They're completely unrelated,

257
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,130
related to the environmental
protection agency,

258
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,020
but they're playing a more vigilant role
in monitoring chemical content and, and,

259
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:15,854
uh,

260
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,450
I hazards and underlying aquifers
as well as surface waters, uh,

261
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:24,990
than the environmental protection agency
had during this period of time. So this,

262
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,590
this is a history of neglect,

263
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,670
of a limited surveillance and it's
being driven by one fundamental

264
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,510
characteristic of the statute.
This is a listing statute,

265
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,640
which means that every time a new chemical
is discovered, uh, and EPA decides,

266
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:45,350
they, they hope to either, uh,
set a goal or to set a limit,

267
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,200
they're going to get a fight,
uh,

268
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,660
from the all the municipal suppliers
or the private suppliers because the

269
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,420
testing costs are going
to be passed on to them.

270
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,070
At least testing costs are
often not minor. Uh, by the way,

271
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:02,930
it's interesting to think about what the
effect might be of establishing a new

272
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:06,800
chemical limit. Well, it may
mean that, uh, you, you need to,

273
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,620
to conduct a, a, a brand new type of test,

274
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,780
it may also mean that you need to install
filtration equipment, uh, perhaps,

275
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:18,140
uh, activated carbon filtration,
which is extraordinarily expensive.

276
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,000
And the smaller the water system is,
uh,

277
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:26,090
the more expense it's going to
allocate per individual household.

278
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,320
So if New York City, for example, a,

279
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,190
is facing a new standard
that DPA has adopted a,

280
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,460
they can pass the cost of a monitoring
and filtration onto a very broad group of

281
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:42,020
people. Uh, but if you have a much
smaller community, say in the rural west,

282
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,020
uh, uh, of, uh, a couple of hundred
people in an isolated area, uh,

283
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,980
that's going to be much more
difficult for them to comply.

284
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,340
So there's been a trend
towards source protection, uh,

285
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,320
instead of consumer protection and a,
in part,

286
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:01,160
you can see this happening, uh, the,

287
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,390
what the public response to this has been,

288
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,040
which is to rely increasingly
on bottled water. And, uh,

289
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,380
many people have the perception
that bottled water is,

290
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,330
is much safer than tap water is.
Well,

291
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:16,190
it's not at all clear that that
is the case. Uh, many people, uh,

292
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,520
do not understand the filtration
techniques of bottled water companies. Uh,

293
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:24,440
we don't really have a
clear, clear standards. Uh,

294
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,680
and also many of the companies
that are marketing heavily in the,

295
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:32,940
in the United States are, are now,
uh, uh, foreign companies. So,

296
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,050
uh, the, the public's perception
of, uh, safety, uh, is,

297
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:41,190
is a really poorly founded
in scientific evidence. Also,

298
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:44,030
there's a story about plastic.
Uh, what about the, uh,

299
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:47,940
the plastic or the potential
plastic ingredients to
migrate into water supplies?

300
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,190
I'll give you one example. Uh,
I, uh, about 15 years ago, um,

301
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,420
I had bottled water in
my house, uh, as we were,

302
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,860
we were putting in a new, uh,
uh, water supply system. And,

303
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,140
uh, so the bottled water came in,
uh, a jug that was polycarbonate,

304
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:10,410
a five gallon jug. You probably
have all seen these, uh, that, uh,

305
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:14,730
you'd flip upside down. And,
uh, I had, uh, left that,

306
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,650
that bottle outdoors. Uh, actually
I'd been away for the weekend.

307
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:22,500
That was delivered on a Friday
during the summer months.

308
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,760
And the temperature had
gone up to about 102, uh,

309
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:29,910
and it was sitting on my driveway in
the sun when the ambient temperature was

310
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:31,590
102.
So it was really baking.

311
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,960
So when I opened the bottle and I
put it on the stand, I, I found that,

312
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:41,640
uh, it had a really, uh, very
accurate taste to it, a bitter taste.

313
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,630
So I called the water company and I
asked the, uh, uh, the bottling company,

314
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,290
you know, what might that be? And, uh, the
response was, oh, you know, we'll have a,

315
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,930
a new shipment out to you right away.

316
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,820
It was probably just the cleaning
agent or the disinfecting agent that a,

317
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,950
we put the bottles through. Well,
you know, I studied the, uh,

318
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:02,790
the problem more intensely
and found that, uh, uh,

319
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,410
they were using a disinfectant that a
was actually a registered pesticide. Uh,

320
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:11,620
and, and also this was perfectly
allowable, uh, because it,

321
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:15,290
it makes sense to try to disinfect water
bottles that are coming back that, uh,

322
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,510
may have had stagnant water within them.
Uh,

323
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,540
but somehow the rinsing process hadn't
effectively removed the cleaning agent.

324
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,930
Well, the bottled water problem,
uh, goes on in that, uh, uh,

325
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:35,370
I look more carefully at the potential
of plastics to migrate from the

326
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:38,340
polycarbonate into water and heat.

327
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,950
A solvent's solvents such as some
cell such, such as some biocides, uh,

328
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,140
uh, are, are mixed with, uh,

329
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:51,141
also a in the bottles themselves can
cause the chemicals to migrate more

330
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:55,970
frequently. Uh, the, the
offending chemical in this
case is [inaudible] la. Uh,

331
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,760
and, uh, we'll talk more about that later.

332
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,870
If you look across the maximum contaminant
limits and you compare them to the

333
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:09,310
public health goal. Uh, this study by
the state of California found that, uh,

334
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,590
the maximum contaminant limit,

335
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:15,830
the allowable concentration
was often too for a,

336
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,250
even 16 times higher. Uh, then the, uh,

337
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,530
health goal, uh, which
tells us that in many cases,

338
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:27,360
the agency is making a determination,
uh,

339
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,990
that we can be exposed to the
limit that they believe is,

340
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,750
is not health protective.
Uh,

341
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,160
there are other studies that have
demonstrated a similar finding, uh,

342
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,990
for other chemicals besides the elements.

343
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,960
So one of the ways to think about the
effectiveness of any statute is to think

344
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,350
carefully about how it's monitored.
Uh,

345
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,390
so what sampling design should be created
in order to figure out whether or not,

346
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,700
uh, we're effectively, uh, uh,

347
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,050
searching for chemicals that pose
the greatest threat. Well, you know,

348
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:03,020
I asked this question of the new
haven water, uh, authority and, uh,

349
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,810
found to my surprise that that the
systems of 25 to a thousand people,

350
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,260
uh, are only required to
provide one sample per month.

351
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,270
And it's pretty clear that, uh, there
are certain climatological events,

352
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:21,271
like a very serious rainstorms that
can wash contaminants off of surfaces,

353
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,180
whether it's an agricultural
field or a, a, uh, uh,

354
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,020
say a large shopping center parking lot,
uh,

355
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,910
into surrounding water supplies if
they are nearby. So thinking about, uh,

356
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,020
the importance of, uh, uh, the
sampling period is really critical.

357
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,390
Uh, and if recent reports have
demonstrated compliance with curtains,

358
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,050
certain standards,
uh,

359
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,210
then EPA allows the testing to be
limited to only four times per year.

360
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,170
And for some types of systems
such as new haven water company,

361
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,490
they've not found certain
pesticides. Uh, so they're,

362
00:22:56,491 --> 00:23:00,070
they're allowed to monitor
only on an annual basis.

363
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,150
They can appeal to the
environmental protection agency
to reduce the periodicity

364
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,860
of their sampling.
And this of course,

365
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:08,290
is very important to them because
it saves them a lot of money.

366
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,530
Triazine herbicides provide a, a really
good example of this in the Midwest.

367
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,030
So triazine herbicides are there
known as a pre emergent herbicides,

368
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,410
and they're commonly sprayed on field
such as corn fields, uh, and, uh,

369
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:25,960
they're sprayed during
the spring in the spring.

370
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:30,190
And the Midwestern part of the United
States is a kind of famous for the

371
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:33,540
intensity of its rainstorms. So, uh, uh,

372
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,170
the sampling design relative to the rain
events really proved to be extremely

373
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:41,740
important to, to, uh, the findings. Uh,

374
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,350
you can pay more attention
to this slide online. Uh,

375
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:47,360
but these data demonstrate the ways that,
uh,

376
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,400
increasing the stringency of standards,

377
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:54,401
passes costs onto a water supply
companies and to people that are served,

378
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,970
uh, and really an inequitable way that
is dependent upon the size of the public

379
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,804
water system.

380
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:05,350
So I want to concentrate today and
tell you a story about this chemical.

381
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,870
This is, and that this is a triazine
herbicide and it's a, uh, uh,

382
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,140
now it's about a 27 year old story,

383
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,720
but the atrazine has become infamous as
one of the most heavily used herbicides

384
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,820
in the world. Uh, it's uses in the
United States include food crops,

385
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,980
uh, field corn, sweet corn, sugarcane,
sorghum, a winter wheat, guava,

386
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,590
macadamia nuts.
Uh,

387
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,890
it's used also on non food crops
such as Hay pasture lands. Uh,

388
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,180
it's also used in forestry.

389
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,220
It's also used in residential and
industrial and recreational areas, uh,

390
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,690
on residential turf, uh, within
parks and a on institutional turf,

391
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,870
also on golf courses.
And it's used for landscape maintenance.

392
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,940
And the whole idea behind an herbicide
is to kill other species of plants so

393
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:57,880
that they don't rob nutrients away from
the desired or highly valued plant. Uh,

394
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,280
so it's also sprayed on roadways.
And this is an interesting idea.

395
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,270
That'd be a great student project.
Now think about, uh, the, uh,

396
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,030
number of miles of roadways
in the United States, uh,

397
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,660
that are treated with herbicides.
Now, my town is a good example,

398
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:12,800
a little town of killing worth.

399
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,280
They don't like to cut the
vegetation next to the guard rails.

400
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,810
So what do they do instead?

401
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,750
They come along with a truck and
they just spray the side of the road.

402
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,350
Next time you get on Amtrak, uh,
take a look at the vegetation that,

403
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,410
that goes along the track and
you'll see almost nothing.

404
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:29,900
You'll see it devoid of vegetation.
How do they do that?

405
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,390
I said that just that they
didn't plan anything. No,

406
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,960
because seeds would blow into the area
and they would grow less chemicals were

407
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:36,794
applied.

408
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,930
So along major highways in the United
States along state highways, uh,

409
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:46,460
in many communities in areas that
have guard rails, a alarm, uh,

410
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,360
corridors that are used for
power, uh, power lines or,

411
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:53,900
or a rail, uh, on the, uh, uh,

412
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,370
runways of many air, air, airports,
uh, pesticides are applied.

413
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,810
So if you count up the total area in
the nation where these herbicides are

414
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,810
applied,
uh,

415
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,370
you can quickly get up to hundreds of
millions of acres of the landscape.

416
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,460
It's really quite striking. So, you know,
finding a chemical such as this, uh,

417
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,410
in the water supply really should
not be that much of a surprise,

418
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,940
but no one has really
looked systematically at
a where concentrations of

419
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:21,320
applications are going on.

420
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,420
But I'll give you one example of where
you might conduct this kind of a study.

421
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,670
And that's with a golf courses.

422
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,090
So that about $225 million per year in
the United States are spent on chemical

423
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:39,080
treatments of golf courses. There is
almost no landscape that I could imagine,

424
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,620
including agricultural lands that are
treated more intensely than golf courses

425
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,850
and particularly putting surfaces.
Uh,

426
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:50,490
so about $1,300 per acre,

427
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,460
a of 35,000 acres of putting surfaces are,
are receiving are uh,

428
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,280
quite a, uh, uh, a variety
of different, uh, uh,

429
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,890
bio Seidel compounds as a nation.
You know,

430
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:06,720
we need to think about where
are we applying chemicals
the most and we're doing

431
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:10,500
it predominantly to field crops.
Field Corn,

432
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,590
about 59 million acres of field
corn is treated sorghum sugar cane,

433
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,850
sweet corn, uh, and uh,

434
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,880
in both processed and a and fresh form.

435
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,590
So large percentages of these crops
are treated, uh, uh, with atrazine.

436
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,220
So if you map out the concentration
of atrazine and streams in the United

437
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,140
States, you see it centered on the
Midwestern part of the country.

438
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,730
And this is the primary corn
growing region. So the, uh,

439
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,990
I want you find is concentrations
in the microgram per liter level,

440
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:47,940
which is a part per billion level.
And the maximum concentration level,

441
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:51,360
the MCL for atrazine is a,

442
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:55,890
I believe it's a three or 4.3 and a.
If you look in the nation,

443
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,440
uh, what you find, excuse
me, parts per billion.

444
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,480
And if you look across the nation
to the number of people now that the

445
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,920
Environmental Protection
Agency think, uh, are,

446
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,360
are drinking residues of this
chemical in the water supply. Uh,

447
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,160
you see this adds up
to millions of people.

448
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,400
So large circles like the
one around Texas, you know,

449
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,460
represent more than 8 million people,
uh,

450
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,970
circles around Florida represent
a about 4 million people. Uh,

451
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,130
so you see that a,

452
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:26,640
they're finding it in the water where
it's most heavily used for agricultural

453
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:27,474
purposes.

454
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,580
So this was first registered
in 1958 and by registered me,

455
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:37,110
I mean it was given a license. It's like
a driver's license. Uh, so atrazine is,

456
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:39,240
it's regulated under the
Safe Drinking Water Act.

457
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,280
It's regulated under the clean water act
as well. And Epa began a special review,

458
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,840
uh, that they reserve for chemicals that
they have particular concerns about in

459
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,300
1994. Now, special review has had a, a,

460
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,710
a rather infamous history
in inside EPA. And, uh,

461
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,370
I have a good friend who graduated
from Yale who, who, uh, uh,

462
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,600
has worked her way up to a high level
inside the agency and she refers to EPA

463
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,960
parking lot and the parking lot is
a place where EPA stores chemicals,

464
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:10,681
not literally,

465
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:14,670
but figuratively when it decides it's not
going to take any regulatory action on

466
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:19,530
them. So atrazine was put in the
parking lot, so to speak, uh,

467
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,560
receiving a little attention for much
of the 1980s when these data came out,

468
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:28,290
when people realize that a,
the concentrations were going up.

469
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,130
Now when the parking lot fills
up, uh, with additional chemicals,

470
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,330
it basically means that, uh, uh,

471
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,270
the chemicals take longer and longer to
receive review and you have a lower and

472
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,440
lower probability, uh, that,

473
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,220
that a health based standards are going
to be set in response to new evidence of

474
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,050
serious contamination or risk.

475
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,720
Another problem with atrazine is that
it's structurally so similar to other

476
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:56,770
kinds of herbicides including
[inaudible] and proposition.

477
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,620
Uh, and it produces similar chlorinated
metabolites and metabolites are,

478
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,760
are, uh, uh, byproducts, uh,
that, uh, uh, the compound,

479
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,210
the original compound breaks into a,

480
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,430
that it makes sense to think about how
we might be exposed to clusters of these

481
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:17,680
compounds instead of
treating them individually.

482
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,360
So remember my argument earlier that EPA
is attention is focused chemical at a

483
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:26,800
time, so they'll make a
decision on atrazine without
thinking about Sam azine or

484
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:29,590
proposition.
But in terms of your exposure,

485
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,660
in terms of its behavior inside your body,
uh,

486
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,490
there is a presumption that that,
uh, chemicals that are similar,

487
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,520
so similar in structure will
behave similarly in your
body and impose a similar,

488
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,230
similar threat.
So as a society,

489
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,520
we want the government to pay
attention to these mixtures, uh,

490
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,410
particularly if there's a
plausible reason that, that, uh,

491
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,250
we might be exposed to the next years.
So in 1991,

492
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:57,400
the MCL was set at three parts
per billion, and the MCL,

493
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:00,580
Gigi was set up three parts
per billion, uh, as well.

494
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,050
And the compliance was determined based
upon a running annual average, uh,

495
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,520
with quarterly, quarterly samples
required by EPA. Or a single, uh,

496
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,050
average sample.
Also in the late 1980s,

497
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:18,510
this was classified as a possible
human carcinogen. Uh, but then, uh,

498
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,210
the environmental protections
production agency, uh,

499
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,020
reviewed it as not a likely
human carcinogen. Now, how
do they make these choices?

500
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,310
Well,

501
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:31,900
they submit evidence to what they
call a scientific advisory panel.

502
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:37,420
And I've had the experience of sitting
on EPA scientific advisory panels for

503
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,780
nearly a decade and reviewing new evidence
of risk and the decision on the part

504
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:49,261
of the panel to recommend a classification
as a carcinogen or not a carcinogen

505
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,420
or chemicals of high
concern or low concern. Uh,

506
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,540
it really depends very much upon who is
asked to sit on the scientific advisory

507
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:02,770
panel. And I want to recommend to you
the work of a professor at Harvard,

508
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,170
Sheila Jazz.
And off she,

509
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,220
Sheila came here as a visiting professor
for a while and her work has been very

510
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:14,030
important on what she calls the,
uh, fifth branch of government, uh,

511
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,820
which are these advisory panels.

512
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,830
So evidence is often so complex that an
agency is not really clear what they're

513
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:25,060
going to do. Uh, is the risk higher?
Is it lower? Should we regulate? Uh,

514
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:28,120
should we just, uh, uh, warn
people? How are we going to,

515
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,440
how are we going to manage this chemical?

516
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,250
They'll submit this question
to a scientific advisory
panel to gain their advice

517
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,870
while the political makeup of these
panels makes a terrific difference. Uh,

518
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,640
depending in guiding the ultimate outcome.

519
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,980
So the food and Drug Administration,

520
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:46,130
the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, EPA,

521
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,300
most regulatory agencies rely very
heavily on the scientific advisory panels.

522
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,380
But just because the scientific advisory
panel makes a recommendation, uh,

523
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,710
doesn't mean that you ought to,
you ought to believe it.

524
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,200
Prior Regulation, uh, uh,

525
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
they looked at the chemical a more
intensely and they found that prior

526
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:09,500
regulation was insufficient, uh,
so that they deleted range land,

527
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:13,580
millet and pineapple uses. So instead
of prohibiting the chemical outright,

528
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,140
they would look at particular
uses, uh, probably uses that,

529
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:21,520
did not have a very high economic value
and decided to go after those two to

530
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,010
prohibit or further restrict those.
They also use what they call it,

531
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:29,930
a restricted use classification and
pesticide law. Fifth, uh, the acronym,

532
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:33,410
Federal Insecticide fungicide.
And rodenticide act, uh, it,

533
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,250
it has this restricted use classification.
This is an interesting idea.

534
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:41,900
I was telling a section last night
that it's similar to the idea of a,

535
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,820
of a pharmacist, a in other words, uh,

536
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,150
in the world of pharmaceuticals,

537
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,250
we had this intervening layer of expertise
so that the pharmacist plays a role

538
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,480
of interpreting exactly
what the appropriate dose
is a four for you. So the,

539
00:33:57,481 --> 00:34:00,800
the, the physician doesn't give
you the drug directly normally,

540
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,820
although this happens in a, in
a hospital often, uh, but, uh,

541
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:09,821
in the pharmacy you get access to a
chemical that poses certain risks,

542
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,220
uh, because experts are there to behind
the counter, uh, to make sure that,

543
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,180
that you're getting the proper dose
and that you understand that, uh,

544
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,790
there could be drug
interactions or that, uh, uh,

545
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,660
there may be certain side effects
that you should be aware of.

546
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,950
So this same concept was
built into pesticide law,

547
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:32,951
but in a very different way of
training licensed applicators.

548
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,530
So if a chemical is classified as being
restricted use because it is more toxic

549
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:43,220
or it's more persistent, or it poses
a certain kind of a health threat,

550
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,560
then someone has to be trained before
they're allowed legally to apply it.

551
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,860
And within the pesticide regulations,
uh,

552
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,810
there is a provision so that
supposing I went and I got my license,

553
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,630
so I was licensed to apply dangerous
chem, dangerous pesticides, uh,

554
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,880
particularly in a, he
say restricted, uh, uh,

555
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,140
areas that were ecologically vulnerable
or maybe inside schools or hospitals.

556
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,450
So that I have the legal authority to
delegate that responsibility to you.

557
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,560
And if you have no training at all,
uh, makes no difference. I mean,

558
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,720
I would tell you what to do.

559
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,740
I would tell you to follow the
label directions very carefully. Uh,

560
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:29,060
but remember what I was saying about
literacy and background literacy. So, uh,

561
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,800
how do you mix, uh, uh,
how do you mix a, a, a,

562
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,530
a quarter ounce of a toxic substance in,
say,

563
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:39,950
water in kerosene or some other, uh, uh,

564
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,910
solvent that it's
supposed to be sprayed in?

565
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,820
And how do you know that you've got
exactly the right concentration?

566
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,340
Will it take some
mathematical skill to do that?

567
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:50,430
And I run across a couple of cases
that I was describing last evening,

568
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,350
where people that, uh, were
delegated this authority, uh,

569
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,450
not only had a minimum level of literacy,

570
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,090
but also had virtually no mathematical
capacity to make these kinds of

571
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:07,570
judgments. So Epa realize this
eventually and they started, uh,

572
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,050
requiring containers that
were in a sense foolproof, uh,

573
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,920
so that you would have a, you would tip
it, they call it a tip and poor mechanism.

574
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,030
So you could pour out only a,

575
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,410
the correct proportion
of the active ingredient.

576
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,420
And then all you had to figure out was
whether or not you had to add one or,

577
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:29,910
or two gallons to, so this
reduced the, uh, the error rate.

578
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,670
But if you are spraying a
pesticide as an example and a,

579
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,190
you've got a backpack on and
you've got a, a spray wand, I mean,

580
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:42,630
I could be a spraying the, a, the edge
of this podium and walking along, uh,

581
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,010
my cell phone could ring, I could
stop. It could look at my watch, um,

582
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:52,080
and then I could move on. Uh, and
the effect would be what? Well,

583
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:54,420
when I looked at my watch,
wherever the wand was pointing,

584
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,620
it would get a dose that probably would
be dozens of times higher than if I were

585
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:00,240
walking in a uniform way.

586
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,490
It's kind of an interesting analog to
that with respect to a spray planes or,

587
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,180
or tractors. So you can imagine
a tractor that has a, uh, a,

588
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,970
a bar across the back of it, uh, across
the back end with holes on it, such as,

589
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,100
as it, uh, going to irrigate
a field. Well, no, the,

590
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,480
the truck goes along,
it gets to the end of the field,

591
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,150
it turns around and comes back this way,

592
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,360
and eventually it covers the entire field.
Well,

593
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,880
if it has the same application
rate, uh, the same, uh,

594
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,200
emission rate from the pipe or
regardless of the speed of the truck, uh,

595
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,540
were in the field, are you going
to get the higher concentrations

596
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,860
at the ends of the field where the truck
slows to, to turn around. Similarly,

597
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:51,230
if you can think about a spray plane
coming in and uh, uh, spraying a,

598
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,480
the hypothetical field, which is
the, uh, the platform up here, uh,

599
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,590
they pass this way, then they come
back, then they passed another way.

600
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,520
I've seen farm workers in California
standing there and with just shorts and a

601
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:04,670
straw hat on,
kind of waiting as a,

602
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,070
as a marker for the spray
plane being sprayed repeatedly.

603
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:12,360
There's an occupational
side to a pesticide control
that I don't have time to

604
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,880
express to you.
Uh,

605
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,090
but then you get this overlap
of the spray in the field.

606
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,930
So these have these kinds of,
uh,

607
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,130
practical conditions have a
really important implication
for how you set up your

608
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:29,780
sampling design. So if you sampled
in the middle of the field, uh,

609
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,460
that was treated by the
truck or the tractor,

610
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,920
you're going to get a lower
level of concentration that
if sampled at the end of

611
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:40,720
the field, the same may be the
case with respect to, to, uh, uh,

612
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,330
spray planes and a,
the way that they spray fields.

613
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,790
So the dance or regulation a is one
where, uh, the government will say, look,

614
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:52,230
we've got to cut back your, your
use. We have to protect the water or,

615
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,060
or we want to reduce the
worker exposure. And the, uh,

616
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,020
industry that manufactures that will
say, well, you know what, uh, uh,

617
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,130
don't cut back in this area,
uh,

618
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,040
cutback and restrict its use
on a specific commodity. Uh,

619
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,840
probably one that is not a, uh, uh,

620
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:11,150
an economically productive one for them,
uh,

621
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,300
or a particular kind of use.

622
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,320
So the argument about what uses are
restricted as opposed to which ones are

623
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,900
prohibited gets quite
technical quite quickly.

624
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,270
So if a chemical comes back as a
recognized serious threat to human health,

625
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,140
that doesn't mean it's going to be
prohibited. Prohibition is very unlikely.

626
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,620
I mean, there've been so few bands
and environmental history, uh,

627
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:37,150
probably fewer than a 300 bands
outright bans of chemicals.

628
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,510
I talked to you about a couple of
them. Ddt is a good example. Uh,

629
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,580
and Aldrin and chlordane chlordane.
These are all pesticides, but, uh,

630
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,140
for the vast majority of compounds,
instead you get this,

631
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,090
a minor revision in the way the chemical
is allowed to be mixed or applied is

632
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:58,660
put into the restricted use category
that's allowed to be used on corn but not

633
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:02,890
on another crop. Uh, so that, uh, uh,
the market share can be maintained.

634
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:08,920
Here's a graph of the seasonal
pulse of atrazine in water supplies.

635
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,890
Uh, that was recognized in the
Midwestern part of the United States.

636
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:16,390
You can't see the years here,
but this is 1995, 1996, 1997,

637
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:17,224
1998.

638
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,220
And you see this pulse that because
they apply it in the spring and then the

639
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:26,110
rains will like wash it into the
surrounding, uh, water supplies. Well,

640
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,770
so another sampling design issue
here that really is critical to the

641
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:30,190
effectiveness,

642
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:33,340
the effectiveness of the statute is that
if you decided that you were going to

643
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:38,170
sample, say in September of each year,
uh, you're going to miss this pulse.

644
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:44,020
So it's only by, uh, uh, you know, sitting
down and thinking about the, the, uh, uh,

645
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,300
method of application. The timing
of the application, uh, and,

646
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:51,910
and thinking about it, uh, in a more
systems or ecological men or, uh,

647
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,840
that considers climate, uh, that, uh,
you would be able to pick this up.

648
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,610
And there was a very interesting
legal debate as well about, uh,

649
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,210
what this chemical is doing, where
it's moving. Uh, and the, uh,

650
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:08,120
US geological service found
that it travels actually
hundreds of miles from its

651
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,300
site of applications.
So it's running off the fields,

652
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,390
it's getting into streams and
it's getting into rivers, uh,

653
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:17,960
such as the Mississippi River.
It's moving long distances. So, uh,

654
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,910
this study found that states,
uh,

655
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:25,840
some states will receiving 50% of their
pollution load, uh, from out of state.

656
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,540
So if atrazine is a
reaching, say Louisiana, uh,

657
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,340
but we know that it's not applied in
Louisiana, what right do they have to,

658
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,690
to sue,
uh,

659
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:39,130
the Environmental Protection Agency for
the failure to regulate that chemicals

660
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,580
application up in Ohio or
Illinois or in, uh, Minnesota.

661
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:49,190
And, uh, they do have the authority to see
the environmental protection agency or,

662
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,080
or a, a particular chemical
companies that are responsible.

663
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,920
So this transboundary movement of, of, uh,

664
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:59,330
of these chemicals raises
a very serious issue.

665
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,000
And also you've got to think
about the fact that that, uh,

666
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,750
many of these cities get their water
supplies from these rivers, uh,

667
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:10,220
and they use filtration systems that
do not have the capacity to extract,

668
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,530
uh,
many of the pesticides that are used.

669
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,700
So water is typically filtered by
running it through sand to take out

670
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,180
particulate matter. Uh, then it's
treated with, uh, with chlorine.

671
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,330
It's not normally treated with gay, uh,
activated carbon, uh, which could barn to,

672
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,380
to this,
to these chemicals.

673
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,500
Now that shouldn't ring bells in your
head if you're concerned about your own

674
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:35,270
water intake because water is the
most consumed food in your diet. Uh,

675
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:38,570
it should ring a bell that you should be
concerned about the quality of water in

676
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:42,080
your tap. And you should think
carefully about the wisdom of,

677
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:45,750
of using activated carbon at the tap,
uh,

678
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,990
because it's not likely that
the government has, has, uh,

679
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,640
kept it perfectly safe.
So I'm going to scoot ahead here,

680
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,610
uh, with one final
aspect of this story. Uh,

681
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,030
the atmospheric transport of
some of these chemicals, uh,

682
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,940
was a surprise to many inside the agency
as well as the scientific community.

683
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,140
I ran into this in California,
uh, when I found that a chemical,

684
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,280
a dry died bromo chloro propane that had
been injected into the soil and cotton

685
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:18,530
fields,
uh,

686
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,210
had actually volatilized
and gotten up into the fog.

687
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,680
Anybody here from the Central Valley?
Well, the Central Valley of California,

688
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,440
which is sandwiched between coastal
range, uh, and then the, the, uh,

689
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,910
Sierras is a flat basin.

690
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,670
It's a former lake bed
and climatologically it's
interesting because of fog will

691
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:41,660
settle on that area, uh, and
stay there for a good part,

692
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:45,730
a of January, sometimes December
six, two to eight weeks. Uh,

693
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,740
so what they found was DPCP,
uh,

694
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:51,770
was actually volatilizing and
it was detectable in the fog.

695
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,480
They found toxaphene that had been
applied in Texas, uh, in the Great Lakes.

696
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,800
Uh, then they found atrazine,
uh, in the Great Lakes as well.

697
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:06,070
So [inaudible] 0.6% of atrazine
is deposited in one study,

698
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:06,810
uh,

699
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:11,810
and rainfall and the concentration
of atrazine in precipitation,

700
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,310
uh, in some areas were, had not been
applied, was one part per billion.

701
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,110
And what was,
what did I tell you?

702
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:22,820
The maximum contaminant level
was three parts per billion,

703
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,280
but fairly striking. Uh, so it's moving
long distances in clouds and raining down,

704
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,440
uh, and you know, perhaps
acting as a, uh, uh,

705
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,970
pre emergent herbicide to areas that were,
it was never intended to be used.

706
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,650
So the degradation of the chemical and
aquatic environments is increasingly

707
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,250
concerned.

708
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:46,250
The half life is between
41 and 237 days on average,

709
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:50,160
half life of the chemical of 159 days.
Uh,

710
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:55,050
and Lake Michigan, uh, is a repository
for atrazine because of its use,

711
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:59,280
particularly in Minnesota
and Michigan, Indiana, Ohio,

712
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:01,920
and the pattern of rainfall in that area.

713
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,480
So it's cold water, it's low
productivity, it's high Ph,

714
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:09,000
low nitrate and low dissolved oxygen,
uh,

715
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,570
all contribute to increase
persistent of the chemical.

716
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,590
So the estimated halflife, uh, in
Lake Michigan is about 31 years.

717
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,220
So Epa conducted a study that
found that, that, uh, I, they,

718
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,660
when they tried to figure out what the
mass balance was at atrazine or is of

719
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:25,494
atrazine.

720
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,500
So atmospheric wet deposition is
about 2,493 kilograms per year.

721
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:36,360
Uh, the watershed loading directly in
surface water runoff to the lake is about

722
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,400
5,000 kilograms per year,

723
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,140
2,500 kilograms exported to Lake Huron,

724
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,850
and, uh, it's exported to a
Chicago, uh, by water diversions, a,

725
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,500
a more minor amount, and even the lake
itself is verbalizing the chemical.

726
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,360
So recognizing that the agricultural
practice of, of, uh, uh,

727
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:02,370
using atrazine as an herbicide and
EPA is neglect of this compound and

728
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:06,030
misunderstanding of its ecological
behavior, uh, could, uh,

729
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,210
cause a gradual buildup to 182,000
kilograms of the compounds sitting in the

730
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:15,420
lake. It was really quite striking. Uh,

731
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,420
so I'm gonna just pause with
reflections on, on, uh, uh,

732
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,530
the work of Tyrone Hayes, who is a, uh,

733
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,490
a former chemical company employee,

734
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:30,180
a scientist who worked
for Syngenta and, uh, uh,

735
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:35,180
Tyrone Hayes has been responsible
for some controversial work. Uh,

736
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,490
so he took his students and he,
uh,

737
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,810
rented a tractor trailer and they
drove across the country, uh,

738
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,660
taking a look at the concentrations
of atrazine and leopard frogs.

739
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,130
And a what was interesting
about his finding a,

740
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,460
because he sampled from areas of the
country, uh, where the leopard frogs live,

741
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:55,230
but to atrazine was not used.

742
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,680
And then he went into the heart of
the Midwestern atrazine use belt, uh,

743
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:04,630
and sampled in those areas. And he found
to obviously higher concentrations, uh,

744
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,520
in the, in the areas where it
was used. But he also found, uh,

745
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,470
that, uh, these frogs had
both ovaries and testes.

746
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,970
So his argument is that, uh, this
chemical is hormonally active,

747
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,660
at least in, uh, the African clawed frog.

748
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,990
And he, he also is claiming that, uh,

749
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,930
there are important lessons
here for humans, uh,

750
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:32,680
that this compound could be also
hormonally active in humans. So atrazine,

751
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:37,630
he argues, uh, in a exposed males
that have ovaries in their testes,

752
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,340
uh, also had much smaller larynx's and
larynx's are important if you're a frog,

753
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:46,150
because it's a way that you can understand
where other frogs are or other frauds

754
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:49,680
can understand where you are a
for reproductive success. Uh,

755
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,520
and it's also recognized to lower
that the testosterone levels in frogs.

756
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,750
So I'm not going to go further today
other than to suggest that there's a whole

757
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:03,480
emerging area of concern now about
hormonally active compounds. Uh,

758
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,110
and atrazine is a good compound to, to pay
attention to. Okay. That's it for today.

759
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,220
Thank you very much.
