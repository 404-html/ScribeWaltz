1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,890
Today, I want to talk about the
relationship between risk and law.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,070
And I want to do this in the context
of the history of agriculture and

3
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:14,250
regulating pesticides
during the 20th century.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,350
And also I want to have you
considered the idea of, of risk.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,690
And I'm a reminded, uh, as
I think about this of Tsla,

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,740
it's line only those who will risk going
too far can possibly find out how far

7
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,580
one can go.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,400
So many believe that environmentalists
are in the business of trying to

9
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:40,170
absolutely minimize risk
as opposed to balance, uh,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,160
the threat of loss or danger
or against other opportunities.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,280
And others argue that without risk
in life things will be pretty boring.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,690
It's traveling through Europe.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,490
Last summer on a lecture tour and I saw
this village sitting on the top of a

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
cliff and I wondered to myself about the
village and I wondered how they chose

15
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:10,491
to build so close to the edge and what
kind of thinking was in their minds.

16
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:15,981
And I could imagine that this used to be
an a number of fields where they graze

17
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:21,180
cattle and sheep and they probably
worried about losing cattle.

18
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,340
And sheep across the cliff.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,250
Then as it grew into a little village,

20
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,520
I can imagine them worried about
their children playing near the edge.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,960
So much of environmental law is about
thinking about the buffer zone or the

22
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,600
safety factor that you would
want to use to offer sufficient,

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,960
sufficient protection
against significant damage.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,313
So

25
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,590
the idea of risk and understanding risk
is really a fundamental aspect of human

26
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:56,400
logic and instinct.
Within law,

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,260
it tends to become defined
as probability of loss.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,680
Probability of damage, uh, might be an
endangered species. It might be, uh,

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,730
air quality.
It could be human health,

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
and it's often expressed in both
quantitative and qualitative terms.

31
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,730
So particularly over the past 30 years,

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,240
the field of quantitative risk
assessment has grown in importance, uh,

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,070
to try to understand what happens
to chemicals or to species, uh,

34
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,200
what kinds of pathways
they travel, uh, what,

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,260
what kinds of problems might occur
from a chemical release and chemical

36
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:39,610
movement. And increasingly, uh,

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,750
it's more sophisticated mathematically
and more difficult to understand the

38
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:48,540
different sources of uncertainty that
are embedded in these estimates of risk.

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,120
You may have heard of,

40
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:54,780
of the idea of a unacceptable risk
level for cancer or some or some other

41
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:59,470
undesirable outcome as being one in
a million or the government used that

42
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:04,090
standard on many occasions, a one
in a million excess risk. Well,

43
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:08,260
to put that into perspective, you might
think about the h one n one infection.

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,690
So what was the actual morbidity rate,

45
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,220
uh, over the past year?
Uh, for h one n one? Well,

46
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:22,990
it turns out that you would first think
about the number of people in the United

47
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,710
States know,

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,710
say roughly 300 million people and you'd
want to know what the incidence rate

49
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,850
was and the illness and those.

50
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,450
Now I was looking at them last night
on the Centers for Disease Control and

51
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,470
prevention website.

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,210
Their estimate is that between
30 and 45 or 50 million people,

53
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,400
uh,
uh,

54
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,690
carried the virus and had
some adverse effect from it.

55
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,950
And then I was looking at the statistics
for mortality and between 15 and 20,000

56
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,040
people, uh, might be, uh,

57
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,680
how are or were killed by the illness.

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,240
Why the uncertainty associated with
the estimate? Well, uh, it's a,

59
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:07,390
it's an illness that, uh, uh, can harvest,

60
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,610
so to speak in epidemiological terms,
uh,

61
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,550
the more susceptible those that
have serious background illnesses.

62
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,630
So the expression of risk for morbidity,

63
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,631
which means illness would be
roughly let's say a 30 million

64
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,970
out of a 300 million, uh,
which is really quite striking.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,890
You know, there are few illnesses that
uh, uh, have that have that rate. So,

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,570
you know, roughly a one in 10 risk.
And I mentioned when I started this,

67
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,710
a brief aside, uh, that a one in a million
risk is often thought of as acceptable.

68
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,980
The distinction between
environmental risks, uh,

69
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:50,981
that are not biologically based or or
generated by pathogens like h one n one

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,160
and chemical risks is often that a,

71
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:59,161
there was a clear causal relationship
between exposure and an understanding of

72
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:04,240
the source of the illness and also
what might be done to manage it more

73
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,610
effectively, such as
the vaccine. By the way,

74
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,230
the vaccine that was produced
and distributed this year,

75
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:13,670
it was really pretty remarkable,
was extremely effective. And the,

76
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,290
the incidents rate was projected to be
far higher than it actually turned out.

77
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,440
So this concern over
quantitative risk assessment,

78
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,240
trying to understand who's most
vulnerable, who is going to, uh, uh,

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,160
basically sustain the, the, the most
serious effects this preoccupies,

80
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,490
uh, the environmental protection agency,
the food and Drug Administration,

81
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:40,480
when they're thinking about allowing a
new drug to be added to the marketplace.

82
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,570
Uh, and really the decision
is all about balancing, uh,

83
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,900
trying to think through what the quality
of the evidence evidence is and should

84
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,030
the danger's be balanced
against the benefits.

85
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,160
And this standard for balancing
has shifted dramatically
over the 20th century.

86
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,260
So that, uh, the lecture of
the day really, we'll trace
the evolution of law, uh,

87
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,170
and demonstrate how it's shifted
from 1906 to the present.

88
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,040
And I want you to think about how it
really reflects changing science, uh,

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,560
as well as changing human values so
that as the science gets a stronger,

90
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,570
we understand the relationship between
an exposure and an adverse outcome. Uh,

91
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:24,170
and oftentimes the government will
intervene by setting a new law or a new

92
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:28,220
regulation.
So the back in 1906,

93
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,050
uh, the food drug and or the, uh, um, uh,

94
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,603
jump ahead here,

95
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,440
but pure food and drug act of 1906 was
passed after Upton Sinclair published the

96
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:47,060
jungle. The describe the filthy
slaughtering conditions in, in Chicago.

97
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,190
The two or food and drug act
was passed in 1906 as well.

98
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,970
And at four bayed foreign
in Interstate Commerce,

99
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,700
adulterated or fraudulently
labeled, uh, food and drugs.

100
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,290
So products could now be sees
and condemned and offending
persons could be fine

101
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:07,940
or jail, uh, and fresh, canned or frozen
food shipped in interstate commerce.

102
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,510
It must be pure and wholesome.
That was the new standard back in 1906.

103
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,100
So basically the idea of adulteration,
uh,

104
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:18,830
and the idea of fraudulent
labeling became important.

105
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,030
So the very first attempts to try
to control a risk in society, uh,

106
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,850
related to food and agriculture,

107
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,820
a really concentrated on
the idea of labeling a,

108
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,760
the idea of,

109
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,620
of making sure that the product inside
the package was what it claimed to be.

110
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,740
On that it had an effectiveness
that, uh, was also claimed.

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,200
And then it wasn't a
excessively dangerous.

112
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,880
They really worried about farmers buying,
uh, pesticides, I suppose at pesticides.

113
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,070
And then basically, uh, uh,

114
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,010
having the container filled
with sugar or flour. Uh,

115
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,210
how would they know the difference?
Uh, there were many cases of,

116
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,790
of fraudulent manufacturing
practices early in the,

117
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,670
in the 20th century before this
law was put into, into place.

118
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,120
Another critical statute that built on
this was the insecticide act of 1910.

119
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,010
Uh, that similarly PR prohibited, uh,
uh, fraudulently labeled pesticides, uh,

120
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,350
and set standards for purity.
Uh,

121
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,380
so the idea of ingredient labeling was
added to the insecticide act and it was

122
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:25,100
designed to protect farmers from
dangerous and impotent pesticides.

123
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,980
You jump forward,
you find that the federal food,

124
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:32,630
drug and cosmetic act of
1938 is important. And it
became the, uh, it can't,

125
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:37,410
became the home for pesticide
regulation for, for many years, uh,

126
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,170
until, uh, uh, Epa took over
that responsibility in 1970.

127
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,520
And the food and Drug Administration
was authorized to set in 1938, uh,

128
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,190
limits for Chemicals and food.

129
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,780
So the recognition that if you
sprayed a field of corn and a,

130
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:58,350
you harvested the corn, uh, and then
you, you sold it in the supermarket,

131
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,730
that it might still carry residues.

132
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,480
This was beginning to be well
recognized back in the 1930s.

133
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,210
The criteria used to set the tolerances,
uh, was really quite interesting.

134
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:12,030
At that time.
It wasn't a health based criteria,

135
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,850
wasn't an environmentally based criterion.

136
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,230
It was how much residue and
should be allowed to, to uh, uh,

137
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,370
remain on the food product if the chemical
is sprayed in the field and a dose

138
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,890
that's effective to get the job done.
In other words, to kill the pest.

139
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,270
So that's kind of interesting.

140
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,930
So it was really a standard that was
set to make sure that the residues would

141
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:41,100
not cause the food to be pulled out
of the marketplace because they were

142
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:41,934
adulterated.

143
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,560
So they were really designed to protect
the farmer and the economic value of the

144
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:50,610
crop rather than the health of the
population or the environmental quality.

145
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,140
The Miller amendment of 1954 required
tolerances for all pesticides if they

146
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,940
might remain as food residues.

147
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,420
And then the Delaney amendment in 1958
became infamous because it set a zero

148
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:10,800
risk standard, uh, a tolerance
for carcinogens in food.

149
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,910
So the,
the exact language is that if a,

150
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,140
a pesticide or other food additive is
carcinogenic in laboratory animals or in

151
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:24,310
humans, and it was the
first time in law that, uh,

152
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,350
using evidence from laboratory animals
was considered to be sufficient in order

153
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:30,300
to ban the use of a chemical,

154
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,730
then it could not be used in a way that
would cause the residue to be present in

155
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:36,924
the food supply.

156
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,360
Now you can imagine that these chemicals
were applied to too many different

157
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:46,580
crops. And, uh, I mentioned
to you that that Ddt, uh,

158
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,870
in my last lecture was applied so
heavily to so many different foods, uh,

159
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,020
300 different food crops had
tolerances by the mid 1950s.

160
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,970
But the government's ability to detect
these chemicals is really important to

161
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:00,804
this story.

162
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,060
So if you use insensitive detection
technology and other words supposing that

163
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,000
you're,

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
you're a chemical detection equipment
is only capable of finding residues at

165
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:15,480
the, uh, uh, part per 100,000,

166
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:20,370
level 10 to the minus fifth, uh,
or even part per million level,

167
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,480
and the chemical is there, but it's there
at the high part per billion level, uh,

168
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,570
the chemical test is going
to come back negative.

169
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,470
It's going to come back as a non-detect.
So gradually you see this, uh,

170
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,700
a very interesting evolution
in the concept of purity,

171
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,240
in what constitutes a safe and pure
environment that's very much driven by the

172
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:46,140
sensitivity of the detection equipment.
So during the century, as the,

173
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,790
as the detection equipment became more
and more sensitive, now for some dioxins,

174
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,880
we can detect those down to
the part per quadrillion level.

175
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,350
In many chemicals are present and
food of the a part per trillion level.

176
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,910
It's got people thinking about, well, what
does that mean? What's that mean to, to,

177
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,150
to uh, uh, their potential
to influence human health.

178
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,550
So back in the forties and 50s,

179
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,770
the detection technology
was really quite limited.

180
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,010
And also the sampling was quite limited
so that there really weren't sampling

181
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:18,160
that many foods.
And you can imagine that the,

182
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:21,280
the scale of the problem this prince
presents today given the international

183
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,600
character of our food supply.

184
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,860
And I asked this question with
respect to several commodities. Uh,

185
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,250
first I started with apples and wondered
how many times the government tested

186
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,990
apples for,
for pesticides.

187
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,820
And then I looked at a bananas and for
bananas for a chemical that was, uh,

188
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,650
when I looked about eight years ago,

189
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:43,030
one of the most heavily used
insecticides on bananas. Uh, you know,

190
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:47,530
grown in the tropics. The
government was looking at, uh,

191
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,220
uh,

192
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,220
about a 15 to 18 samples of
bananas a for this compound.

193
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,450
Uh, when, uh,

194
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:59,260
I then was able to calculate that several
trillion individual bananas had been

195
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:03,300
imported into the nation
during that year. So, you know,

196
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,470
one needs to think about, uh, uh,

197
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,420
what standards are in place in
different parts of the world, uh,

198
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,180
where that food is likely to go, uh,
keeping records of imports, statistics,

199
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,050
and then think about what
kind of a sampling design
would be necessary in order

200
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:20,170
to find these residues,
uh, in a way that, uh,

201
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,420
might eventually lead
to health protection.

202
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,910
So the Delaney amendment that was really
quite striking. It was, uh, adopted,

203
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,970
uh, really, uh, uh,

204
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,330
with great support in Congress in part
because of the u s fascination with

205
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,550
cancer and also cancer management.

206
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,020
So this grew in part because of the
nuclear weapons testing euro. Uh,

207
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,380
but it is curious that, uh,
within the European nations,

208
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,210
the regulatory approach to environmental
quality has not been as concerned with

209
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:49,631
cancer.

210
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:53,500
It's been more concerned with a
neurological decline and also reproductive

211
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,334
health.
Uh,

212
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,820
so race is really interesting questions
about why the preoccupation in the

213
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:02,650
United States with cancer. So the first
seriously health protective statute, uh,

214
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,960
that, uh, we can find
an environment of law.

215
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,810
It has to do with food and
it has to do with pesticides.

216
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,690
And it's contained in this
Delaney amendment. By the way,

217
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:14,300
this amendment applies to
all food additives in the
food additive could be in a

218
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,790
defined, also as a coloring agent,
like the salmon calling I spoke of.

219
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,260
It could be defined as a
packaging material migrant. Uh,

220
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:27,940
it could be a flavoring agent as well.
Uh, so that the standard is very clear.

221
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,860
If it induces cancer in animals or in
humans, uh, then it is not allowed.

222
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,201
Curiously,

223
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:40,201
there's a clause within the statute
that applies only to pesticides,

224
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,510
uh, that are defined as food
additives if they concentrate.

225
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,580
And you remember the story I told you
the other day about, uh, taking a,

226
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:51,240
a grape and extracting all the
water out of it, or taking a, uh,

227
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,460
corn and extracting the oil out of it
and having to be thoughtful about what

228
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,220
that really might mean for, for
chemical residues. So if you,

229
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:02,070
if you are concerned about oil extraction,
uh,

230
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,400
you need to think about lipophilicity.

231
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,780
So if you've got a chemical such as a
chlorinated carbon that is likely to bind

232
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,870
onto, to fats of, of one form or another,

233
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,120
extracting the oil out will likely
also concentrate the chemical residue.

234
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,260
So if you look in the code of federal
regulations, it's very curious.

235
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,110
You can go over to the law library and
pull out the code of federal regulations

236
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,550
on pesticides.
It's actually a good,

237
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,530
it'd be a good assignment for
a teaching fellows to, to, uh,

238
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,070
disseminate a go look at the code of
federal regulations for pesticide residues

239
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:38,600
in food. And you'll see a 40 CFR, uh,

240
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,470
one 35,

241
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,520
and you go to the appendix and the
appendix is several hundred pages long of

242
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:46,610
individual pesticide food combinations.

243
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,610
So I was quite struck by this, uh, uh,

244
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,550
several years ago and I added all of
these up and it turns out that there are

245
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,090
about 10,000 different
pesticide food combinations.

246
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,690
And if you look carefully at these
combinations, uh, that set limits for Ben,

247
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:06,560
the Millon Bananas or, or, uh,
say chlorpyrifos and, and, uh, uh,

248
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,330
apples or DDT and milk, uh,
that standard is still in place.

249
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:14,050
By the way, it's kind of interesting,
even though DDT was banned,

250
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,740
as I said the other day and in the 1970s,
but if you look carefully,

251
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:23,090
you'll see that you get a different
residue limit allowed for fresh corn or a

252
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:27,590
fresh apples or fresh soybeans than
you do for the process product.

253
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,090
And it's basically because of this
concentration factor. So water extraction,

254
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,830
you know,
making raisins out of grapes,

255
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,660
making wine out of grapes
or making oils out of, uh,

256
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,360
different kinds of grains
can have this effect.

257
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,280
The Federal Insecticide fungicide and
rodenticide act in 1947 was the, uh,

258
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,870
central, uh, statute that was,

259
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,360
was passed and it really set the stage
for the u s department of Agriculture's

260
00:16:56,361 --> 00:17:01,010
authority to issue licenses
or registrations. So,

261
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,510
and as I mentioned earlier,

262
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,280
the idea of registering a pesticide or
allowing it to be used for a certain crop,

263
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,640
uh, this, these registrations
were given out one after another,

264
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,460
after another,
a decade after decade.

265
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,650
So that by 1960 there were 50,000
different pesticide registrations, uh,

266
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,080
that had been issued.
And by 1970,

267
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,020
there were nearly 70,000
pesticide registrations.

268
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,610
And registration has given for a
specific chemical use and it may be also

269
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:32,240
assigned for a specific package.
So the,

270
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,480
you may have chemical x,
uh,

271
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:39,980
and that has one registration and then
it may be sold also with chemical why or

272
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,000
chemical y and Z.

273
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,480
And they would have different
registrations assigned to
them and they might have

274
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,840
different registrations assigned
for different kinds of uses.

275
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,900
So that these are not just used
on, on food commodities. Uh,

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,230
where else might they be used?
Well, you know, think about it, uh,

277
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,260
many of many of the buildings at Yale
or sprayed by pesticides indoors, uh,

278
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,920
so that type of use often had to have a
separate registration sprayed in subway,

279
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:07,440
sprayed in vehicles,

280
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,650
added to materials such as plastics
that are components of cars or that,

281
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:17,400
uh, uh, uh, are components of urethanes
for example, that coat the wood here.

282
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,280
So that plastics,
uh,

283
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,210
have carried biocides into our
environment in a whole set of ways.

284
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,010
And the government had to keep track of
where these chemicals were going and had

285
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:33,310
to license each of these distinctive uses.
So the,

286
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:35,730
the fifth Pfiffer of 1947,

287
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,030
I was important because it defined
these chemicals as economic poisons a

288
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,030
implying yes, they're poisonous, uh,

289
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:46,560
but they also carry an economic benefit
so that, uh, we need to look at this and,

290
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,720
uh, using a utilitarian
balancing standard. Uh,

291
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:53,410
so that risk benefit balancing
became the phrase, uh, that,

292
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,020
that guided us department, the Department
of Agriculture to crank out these,

293
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,100
these registrations.

294
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,210
It also extended the right regulations,
not just to insecticides,

295
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,070
but two herbicides and rodenticides.

296
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,490
And right now in terms of volume
of chemical released in the world,

297
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,140
you find that herbicides are the
most heavily, uh, type of pesticide.

298
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,580
So there are pesticides or insecticides,
herbicides,

299
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,770
rodenticides designed to
kill a rats or mice, ah,

300
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,930
Sliema sides that are applied to kill
slime and algae on the side of nuclear

301
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,330
power plant cooling, cooling towers. Uh,

302
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,890
there are nearly a hundred different
chemicals. Uh, any swimmers in the,

303
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,860
in the room? Well, probably a
few are former swimmers. Uh,

304
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,180
well there they're nearly a hundred
different pesticides that have been

305
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,530
registered for use in swimming pools,
uh, to kill a variety of viruses,

306
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:51,210
bacteria, uh, as well as, as
molds and other pathogens.

307
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,500
And if you think about that, uh, uh,

308
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,670
carefully and you think about the relative
risk that is associated with using

309
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:01,560
those chemicals as
opposed to not using them,

310
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,700
it's probably a really good choice
given the illnesses that could,

311
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,150
could live in that environment.
So that this statute, uh, was,

312
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,900
was the first to really break down these
different categories of biocides and

313
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:20,820
really assigned different regulatory
responsibility nor authority was given to

314
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,290
the Department of Agriculture.
However,

315
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:27,030
to remove hazardous chemicals from the
marketplace so that they always found

316
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:28,620
that the benefits outweighed the risk.

317
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,720
There are no instances that I can point
to a that the Department of Agriculture,

318
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,400
uh, either abandoned chemical or
found that the risk was too serious.

319
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,130
They may have adjusted the
allowable use rates or,

320
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:45,120
or the type type of environment it could
be released to or the type of crop, uh,

321
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:48,490
but, uh, no product bans.
And think about this.

322
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,710
The government gave the Congress,

323
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:54,850
gave the Department of Agriculture
the Authority to manage this program,

324
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,820
to implement the program.
Now is that a good idea?

325
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,940
What's the Department of
Agriculture is basic role? Well,

326
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:05,050
it's really to promote economic
production of a variety of different

327
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:10,290
agricultural commodities and they really
also do not have and have not had much

328
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,150
expertise in environmental science to
know what happened to the chemicals once

329
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:21,151
they were released or two to think
carefully about the health effects.

330
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,530
Uh, so the medical expertise it within
the Department of Agriculture, uh,

331
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,030
throughout their period of jurisdiction,

332
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,370
which ended in 1970 when the environmental
protection agency was formed,

333
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:33,930
uh,

334
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,570
was a period when they really had very
little expertise in environmental science

335
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,340
or in medical science,

336
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,760
which is really fundamental to the way
that we're thinking about regulating

337
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:43,630
pesticides today.

338
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,210
The fifth for amendments in 1964 came
after Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring,

339
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,300
uh, raised the alarm and caused, uh,

340
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,630
the population to be quite
upset about pesticide residues,

341
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,550
particularly their effect on wildlife,
uh, but also growing recognition that,

342
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,600
that these chemicals could build in the
human body and also the food and Drug

343
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,170
Administration's admission,
uh, that, that, uh,

344
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,190
they had found pesticides in human
breast milk as early as 1952.

345
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,870
The public wasn't a warned about this.
Uh,

346
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,960
and basically if you find a chemical,
regardless of what it is,

347
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,880
you find it in a another
species of mammals, breast milk,

348
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,070
you can presume that it's likely to
get into human breast milk as well.

349
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,000
So Rachel Carson silent spring
turned out to be a real watershed,

350
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:39,001
not just legally for pesticides because
it really increased the sense of

351
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:45,370
susceptibility to biocides
or the economic poisons. Uh,

352
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,080
but it really met with quite a
bit of resistance in Congress. Uh,

353
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,810
again, this was the end of the
nuclear weapons testing, uh, in the,

354
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,690
in the atmosphere.

355
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,770
And it was also a period of great
unrest in the United States. The, the,

356
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:04,250
the origin of the civil rights movement,
uh,

357
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,010
maybe a trace to this period,

358
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,650
the civil rights act of 1964
a recall that also we were,

359
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:14,440
we're getting more deeply embedded in
the war in Vietnam at that point in time.

360
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,600
And Environmental Ism was, uh, growing
up, uh, uh, creeping up on the agenda. Uh,

361
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:24,370
but it was really quite an
interesting period. Congress
Hower was preoccupied, uh,

362
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:29,230
other than making some minor revisions
to the statute that included adding these

363
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:33,340
words, caution, warning and hazard
depending upon the relative toxicity.

364
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,420
This didn't really help very much because
of public confusion about what those

365
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:41,320
phrases meant. And the Department
of Agriculture Secretary,

366
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,770
I was given the authority finally to
remove pesticides from the market, uh,

367
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,020
based upon a finding of
imminent hazard to the public.

368
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,140
Now EPA was created in 1970 a and it
was given the responsibility to manage

369
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,650
pesticides and it was
consolidated from other agencies,

370
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,540
some 15 or 16 different sub units of
different agencies were pulled together to

371
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,750
create,
to create EPA back in 1970,

372
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,270
including the department of Agriculture
that had formerly had the pesticide, uh,

373
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,850
management responsibility. So you can
imagine, you know, an entire, uh, uh,

374
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,510
sub bureaucracies picking up and
moving their materials to EPA and a,

375
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:25,190
the stories from some of the early
administrators about how they did this and

376
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,360
what the effect was, or a really quite
striking. Uh, they described that, uh,

377
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,780
the Department of Agriculture had
kept files on individual chemicals.

378
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,370
They were completely disorganized.
I'll often just handwritten, uh,

379
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,910
often with no environmental science data,
often no testing of,

380
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:42,160
of chemical presence in,

381
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:46,250
in a different commodities that it had
been a license license to be used on.

382
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,270
And, uh, some chemicals
had no data at all.

383
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,780
So Epa was in this situation of becoming
immediately responsible for 70,000

384
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,300
different pesticide registrations.
Uh,

385
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:03,620
the public was quite concerned about
these residues getting into their bodies

386
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,380
and into the environment and
the wildlife effects. Uh,

387
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,660
so they felt a lot of heat
and increasingly environmental
laws had these, uh,

388
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,200
citizen's suit provisions.

389
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,520
So Epa was getting sued in the early
1970s and they got sued on, on a,

390
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:19,940
a variety of compounds such as
DDT and Aldrin, the Dieldrin.

391
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,410
And they were forced to go back and look
at the data that they had available.

392
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,240
And they found that they really had very
little data to justify many of these

393
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,074
registrations,

394
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,570
but the law was set up that forced them
to look at at a this problem chemical at

395
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,404
a time.

396
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,510
So if you've got 70,000
different chemicals and the
law requires that you look

397
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:45,230
at them one at a time and you've got a
staff that doesn't have the basic data in

398
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:49,490
place, this basically put the
regulatory process in deep freeze.

399
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,990
So how would you manage
that if you are responsible?

400
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,221
Well,

401
00:25:55,221 --> 00:26:00,080
Congress thought about this and they
allocated more and more money to the

402
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,510
Environmental Protection Agency and EPA
became much more aggressive and started

403
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:03,440
banning chemicals.

404
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,980
They ban DDT first and then Aldrin
and then Dieldrin haptic floor,

405
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,970
and then Cordain. All of these
were the coronated hydrocarbons.

406
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,150
The fifth for amendments in 1975 gave
the secretary of Agriculture Authority to

407
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,990
be notified a pending cancellations,
uh,

408
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,030
which meant that he was given a voice,
uh,

409
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:27,710
to oppose cancellations. Uh, but, uh,
the environmental protection agency,

410
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,060
he really became the, the
stewards for, for, uh,

411
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,870
a human health and environmental quality
so that the secretary of ag agriculture,

412
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:38,990
his voice was diminishing in the 1970s.
Uh,

413
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:41,300
Congress also recognize that boy,
you know,

414
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:44,190
EPA is not making much progress
on this sea of chemicals,

415
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,930
so they better do something about it.

416
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,200
They mandated that each chemical had to
be reviewed within a nine year deadline.

417
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,510
Well,
EPA was not able to accomplish that.

418
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,010
So the 70s and the eighties and
nineties are all great examples, uh,

419
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,130
of what I call the rule of 20,
uh, that each chemical, uh,

420
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:05,430
might get some attention every 20 years.
But what does that mean?

421
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,910
You can think about the fact that a
new chemicals are being added to the

422
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,200
marketplace. A new registrations
are being issued. Uh,

423
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,220
the data aren't lousy and a EPA is taking
20 years to review a single chemical.

424
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,400
Uh, that doesn't make sense.
The science is evolving at a,

425
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:24,720
at a lightening pace on where the
chemicals are in the environment, uh,

426
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,950
or what the health effects are or what
the effects on different species are.

427
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,730
And Epa is like this,
uh,

428
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,140
ship is a frozen, it's, it's icebound, uh,

429
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:40,020
unable to move with the speed that,
that it really need me to, to, well,

430
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:44,370
this was recognized by the National
Academy of Sciences in to two publications

431
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,980
that I had a chance to work on a one
regulating pesticides and food. Uh,

432
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,850
that really critique the Delaney paradox.
And, uh, a bunch of us thought that, uh,

433
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:57,990
the zero risk standard is it had
been interpreted by the food and Drug

434
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,000
Administration.
A really did not make much sense.

435
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,770
A FDA had had interpreted zero
risk to mean a little bit of risk.

436
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,520
So a de minimis is the
phrase that, uh, uh, it used.

437
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,820
And De minimis means a trivial amount of
risk and they define that generally as

438
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:18,350
a one in a million risk
threshold. So that, uh,

439
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,260
this was a, a, a curious experience
for me because it was my first, uh,

440
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,720
uh, exploration of the human
diet and its variability.

441
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,380
So I started pouring through
food intake surveys, uh,

442
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,000
which is the reason that I asked a section
on Monday night to keep track of just

443
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:39,590
one day of your own diet. You
know, think about that. Uh, uh,

444
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,580
what foods do you eat as a way of thinking
about how patterns in your diet might

445
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:46,370
lead to predictable patterns of,

446
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:49,530
of your exposure to residues that
had been allowed by government.

447
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,830
So in this case, uh, we were looking only
at that subset of chemicals, uh, that, uh,

448
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,300
had some evidence of carcinogenicity so
that these chemicals induce cancer in

449
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:03,240
animals or we're known to
induce cancer cancer in humans.

450
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,630
And when we were thinking particularly
about how cancer risk might add up across

451
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:12,890
the chemicals, so a hundred different
chemicals, uh, that are, are,

452
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,660
are cancer inducing and
laboratory experiments,

453
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,650
how would you deal with that
issue of risk additives? It would,

454
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,710
would it be possible that, uh, uh,

455
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,770
there may be a negative effect on risk
if you had to chemical exposures at the

456
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,580
same time?
Well,

457
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,780
scientists have found some cases where
that actually occurred where a lower risk

458
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:38,400
chemical is able to bind onto a site
in a cell and prevent a higher risk

459
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,010
chemical from doing the same thing.
In other cases,

460
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,810
there's a synergistic relationship
so that, uh, the, the,

461
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:47,700
the risk is not just additive,
uh,

462
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,680
but if you're exposed to chemical
a and then chemical B, Oh,

463
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:52,870
you've got a higher risk of,
of getting cancer.

464
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,590
So working with a bunch of specialists
and cancer as well as specialists in and

465
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,850
residue chemistry and exposure, uh,
analysis. We came up with, uh, uh,

466
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,250
uh, not to, uh,

467
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,040
complimentary picture of the way that
EPA had regulated carcinogens in the food

468
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,280
and recommended also that,
uh,

469
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,840
they pay much more attention
to the individual diet, uh,
that the Diet, uh, was the,

470
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:17,170
uh,

471
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,910
likely to be the key root of exposure
to a variety of different chemicals.

472
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,590
The second book flowed from the first by
the National Academy of Sciences called

473
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,990
Pesticides in the diets
of infants and children.

474
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,990
And at this focused on of
finding inside the red book, uh,

475
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,960
the finding that there's
a lot of variability out
there in the diets that, uh,

476
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,510
people eat, that that is quite
predictable. So if you're Italian,

477
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,110
you're likely to eat more tomato
products. Uh, if you're Latino,

478
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,490
you're likely to eat more corn
products. Uh, if you are, uh, uh,

479
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:52,360
an African African American from the
southern part of the United States, uh,

480
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,310
people generally eat more greens.
Uh, if you are living in California,

481
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:59,980
you're going to eat more fresh produce
than you would if you live in the

482
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,680
northeast. Uh, it's a,

483
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,960
it's cost does not go up the way
that it does in the northeast.

484
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,370
So diet vary by season. I had
varied by region of the country. Uh,

485
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,980
it varies by age. Uh, and it also
varies quite a bit by ethnicity.

486
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,190
So if you don't understand these
differences and dietary patterns,

487
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,750
you really don't have much hope of,

488
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,920
of understanding the variability in the
chemical matrix that these individual

489
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:28,240
diets might convey into your body.

490
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,650
So it also presents a really kind of
an interesting idea that you could use

491
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:37,651
cropping patterns is a way of predicting
which chemicals make their way into

492
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,100
certain environments. So if, if, uh,

493
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,380
you were looking at the effect of corn
on environmental quality in the United

494
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,213
States corn production,

495
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,450
you'd want to know where is it planted
predominantly in the Midwestern part of

496
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:53,270
the u s uh, Ground Zero is,
is, uh, uh, pretty much, uh,

497
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,400
Iowa through Ohio and
Pennsylvania. And, uh, if,

498
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,600
if you map out the pattern of
chemical use, you'll see that, uh,

499
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,190
herbicides are applied
much more intensely, uh,

500
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,010
in this area than in other
parts of the nation. Uh,

501
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:11,800
and that explains why herbicide residues
are detectable in the water supplies of

502
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:15,990
a nearly 30 million people in
the United States and also in,

503
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:17,260
in a human tissues.

504
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,060
So that this understanding of dietary
diversity turned out to be extremely

505
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:23,050
important,
uh,

506
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:28,110
because it had been completely neglected
by environmental law and the diversity

507
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:32,830
in patterns of exposure in
environmental law is something that, um,

508
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,790
uh, I became curious about and wondered
about whether or not you'd find the same

509
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,260
thing relative to a drinking water.

510
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,180
Would you find the same issue
relative to air quality? Uh,

511
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,270
are there pockets of high exposure out
there in the population that could be

512
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,140
predictable,

513
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,210
that would make environmental law and
regulation able to focus in a way that was

514
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:55,880
more effective? And the answer is yes. Uh,

515
00:32:55,881 --> 00:33:00,350
so as we look across cases over the
next, uh, next couple of a weeks,

516
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,510
we'll see the same pattern emerging that
once you understand variability in the,

517
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:09,350
in the Diet, in other words,
once you focus in and you,
you look for, uh, you know,

518
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:11,330
pockets of a high exposure,

519
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,010
high a consumption of corn or hike
consumption of a certain cluster of foods,

520
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,710
or you look at a certain
populations such as athletes, uh,

521
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:24,560
that have a higher respiration rate,
then then nonathletes to, uh, that, uh,

522
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,700
that because of that higher respiration
rate, they're going to absorb more,

523
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,760
more chemicals that are present
in the, in the air. So, uh,

524
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:35,360
across a whole array of different kinds
of environmental problems that are

525
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,430
managed by law, there's basically, uh,

526
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,910
there had been a neglect of
this issue of variability.

527
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,990
So how do you take a body of law such
as the body that I just described to you

528
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:49,470
for a, these chemicals and transform
it to be more sensitive, uh,

529
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,150
to the reality of these patterns
of chemical use and exposure.

530
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,460
So what I'm painting here is a picture
of what I think of is fractured a science

531
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:02,960
and fractured law so that
the legal authority from
pesticides is now broken into

532
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,760
three different bureaus,

533
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:08,450
the environmental protection agency that
is responsible for tolerance setting,

534
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,700
but also toxicity testing.

535
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,630
The Food and drug administration is
responsible for detecting residues in the

536
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:15,464
food supply.

537
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,340
And the Department of Agriculture is
responsible for the enforcement of these

538
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:23,720
statutes in meat and poultry and also
for the assessment of economic benefits

539
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:27,170
associated with producing
the nation's food supply.

540
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,400
So you've got these different agencies
with different legal mandates and they

541
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:35,300
tend not to talk to one another.
So that the a in Great Britain,

542
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,880
they've created a new food
safety organization that, uh,

543
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,030
is really quite a distinctive as a model.

544
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,570
They had the same fractured pattern of
bureaucratic control and Great Britain.

545
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,540
And, uh, they decided that that,
uh, they would consolidate,

546
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:50,320
that they'd centralize the
authority in one group. And it's,

547
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,460
it's very curious because by doing that,
uh,

548
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,640
it is allowed conservative
administrations, uh,

549
00:34:56,641 --> 00:35:01,610
to slow down regulation and to become
less environmentally protective, uh,

550
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:05,390
much more quickly than if the authority
is, is diffused among different agencies.

551
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,670
So this is a very interesting
kind of a problem.

552
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,190
The primary authority for tolerance
setting was taken away from the Department

553
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,610
of Agriculture,

554
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,610
just like the authority for regulating
nuclear power was taken away from the

555
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,140
Atomic Energy Commission. So the nuclear
regulatory commission was created.

556
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,041
So you don't,

557
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:29,120
you don't want the producer and the
protector of the public interest to be

558
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:32,510
sitting inside the same organization.
That's really the key principle

559
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,190
for those

560
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,850
of you that I haven't stunned to death,
uh, enough with this lecture so far. Uh,

561
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,080
if you want to know more about
pesticide science and history in law,

562
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,120
I published this book, uh, about 10
years ago and this really details the,

563
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,360
the description of how we discovered
that kids were more exposed to many

564
00:35:56,731 --> 00:36:01,210
different pesticides and
adults, uh, that, uh, uh, uh,

565
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,230
was eventually adopted into the Food Crop
Quality Protection Act passed in 1996.

566
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,180
So this law was designed to,
to deal with this problem of,

567
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:16,181
of risk being not equally distributed
in society and it included a new general

568
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:17,220
safety standard.

569
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,300
It did away with the risk
benefit balancing standard
and it said, okay, instead,

570
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,000
uh,
uh,

571
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
EPA must make its choices based upon the
phrase reasonable certainty of no harm.

572
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,460
It's kind of interesting. If you were, if
you were given the assignment to, to uh,

573
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,420
uh, include a decision standard in a
statute that was health protective, uh,

574
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,080
what would you choose?
Would you choose a balancing standard?

575
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,070
Probably not a,
would you choose the Delaney clause model,

576
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:48,350
which is a zero risk
standard? You might, uh,

577
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,630
would you choose a standard such as
this reasonable certainty of no harm?

578
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,630
While you can imagine that this is
hammered out politically, uh, in,

579
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,580
in Congress with great interest on the
part of chemical companies and also, uh,

580
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,180
uh,

581
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,570
food manufacturers to try to understand
what its implications might be for them,

582
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,150
it also requires a finding of safety.

583
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,260
This had not been part
of the law until 1996.

584
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:14,610
So we pay must now find that uh,
uh, chemicals are safe for children.

585
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,480
This is really quite new and striking.
Uh,

586
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,580
and it requires a 10 fold additional
safety factor to account for uncertainty

587
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:26,760
and the data that they have as they
set their limits so that this idea of a

588
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:29,190
buffer zone,
if you think the risk is x,

589
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,770
then you have to allow x over what,
uh,

590
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,800
in order to set your standard
for exposure. While is it, uh,

591
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,240
do you want a 10 fold safety factor?
Uh,

592
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,360
do you want to a hundred
fold a thousand fold? Well,

593
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:45,180
the tradition had been to use
a hundred fold safety factor.

594
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,600
So if you think that this is what it is,
you account for your,

595
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,680
your absence of knowledge or
your ignorance by dividing
the allowable level by a

596
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,140
hundred. And in this case, Congress
said, that's not good enough.

597
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,950
You have to divide it by an additional
10 to account for the uncertainty about

598
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,520
the distributional patterns
and also the issue of,

599
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:06,420
of some groups being more susceptible
to these chemicals than, than others.

600
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,190
It also required that the
agency for the first time, uh,

601
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,500
needed to consider how people might
be exposed to the same chemical, uh,

602
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:20,520
not just from, from a food, uh, or, uh,

603
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,600
different crops, uh, but
food, drinking water, uh,

604
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,950
and other kinds of environments.

605
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,360
So the same chemical might be sprayed on
the fruits and vegetables and it might

606
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:31,920
get into dairy cattle,
uh,

607
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,340
but it also might be sprayed in your
apartment building or also might be a used

608
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:39,700
as an algaecide in a, in a
swimming pool. Uh, so that, uh,

609
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,930
formerly EPA had just kind of given up
licenses as USDA had to these different

610
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,300
allowable uses and not thought about
the fact that to somebody is a basically

611
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,220
walk through their daily life.
Uh,

612
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:53,740
it could be exposed to
the same chemical across,

613
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,170
across these environmental compartments,
so to speak.

614
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,190
So the idea of aggregate risk is new
and it's an attempt to think about the

615
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:06,280
complexity of the way that these
compounds can move through a environments.

616
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,500
The idea of cumulative risk is also knew,
uh,

617
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,060
the government had to consider
the idea that, uh, you know,

618
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:16,840
a group of chemicals might act the same
way in the human body and the risk might

619
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:20,350
be at least additive if not a synergistic.

620
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,740
So for the first time in 1996, EPA had
to review all of his tolerances to,

621
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,680
to think about this
issue of cumulative risk.

622
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,520
And the pace of review was also sped
up so that all chemicals that, uh, had,

623
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:36,180
had licensed had to be reviewed by 2006,
uh, that was accomplished. You know,

624
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,190
we're quite remarkably,
uh, but, uh, the, uh,

625
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:42,630
the critique I could give you a
of the quality of the review is,

626
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,630
is a different matter.
Uh, and finally, uh,

627
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,780
Congress directed the agency not to
give equal attention to every pesticide,

628
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,810
but to come through or to develop
some sort of a strategy to,

629
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:57,811
to concentrate and focus on chemicals
that it thought a would be the most risky.

630
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,440
So how would you do that?

631
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,720
How would you define the most risky
chemicals while you try to find those that

632
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:07,300
had the highest a dose response rate?
In other words,

633
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:10,390
they seem like they were the most potent,
are the most toxic,

634
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,870
but you also probably want to concentrate
on chemicals that were persistent

635
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,760
chemicals that got into
different environmental
compartments or chemicals that

636
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:23,480
were used in, in, uh, food or, or
environments that people freak.

637
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,710
Frequent foods that people eat a lot
of, or environments that, uh, uh, we're,

638
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,710
we're highly frequented such
as schools or, or, uh, uh,

639
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,810
such as, uh, uh, occupational
settings or, or, or homes. Uh,

640
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,270
so that the idea of strategic attention
to the most toxic chemicals is an

641
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,440
important concept. So,
uh, what's happened here,

642
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,690
as you think back across history,

643
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,100
you've got kind of a sequence of
changing regulatory priorities.

644
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,970
And you might ask yourself, well, why
is that? So the first attempt backed in,

645
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:56,500
in 2019 Oh six,

646
00:40:56,501 --> 00:41:00,690
was to protect the economy of farmers
against fraudulent labeling. Uh,

647
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:05,920
then the obligation, uh, became
to protect food and a crap uses.

648
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,590
So set limits for levels of revenue
in different kinds of foods.

649
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,150
Uh,
then wildlife,

650
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,570
wildlife remedies became extremely
important as people worry about, uh,

651
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,360
how chemicals were causing decline
in species that, uh, were really, uh,

652
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,220
much loved in the United
States, particularly large
raptors, a bald eagles, uh,

653
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:30,550
the national symbol or the Golden Eagle,
uh,

654
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,410
the Peregrine Falcon ospreys that,
uh,

655
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:37,370
now you can see coming back along
the shoreline here in Connecticut.

656
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:40,070
If you take the train from new
haven up to Boston, for example,

657
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,150
and look out over the salt marshes,
you'll see these polls, uh,

658
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,760
sitting in the middle of the salt marshes
with Osprey's ospreys came very close

659
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:50,500
to extinction because of the chemical
DDT that was building up and it's,

660
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,640
it's body and causing its
egg shells to thin. Uh,

661
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:58,580
so it's reproductive success declined.
Soil contamination became important,

662
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,410
uh, as instances where chemical had
been used in the field one year and had

663
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,510
persisted in that field.
Uh,

664
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,410
another tenant farmer comes along the
next year and plants a different crop.

665
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,670
That crop is not permitted to
have that chemical used on it,

666
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:18,230
but it absorbed the chemical
up through, uh, its roots,
uh, and becomes adulterated.

667
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:22,760
So that failure to think about soil
contamination was causing some foods to

668
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:26,150
become adulterated in ways that were
not predictable and drinking water

669
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:29,330
contamination has come late to the
attention of the environmental protection

670
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:31,050
agency. Why would that be? You know,

671
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,720
if you think about water as one of the
most consumed foods in the human diet,

672
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,650
why wouldn't the government have
paid more attention to water? Also,

673
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:41,330
think about indoor environments.
Uh,

674
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,010
I've come to believe that all of
the attention given to food, uh,

675
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:50,090
is really probably misplaced a relative
to exposures that occur in indoor

676
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:55,091
environments so that in many situations
today people can be in rooms,

677
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,850
uh, when they are sprayed
by a licensed applicator.

678
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,900
So they exposures that occur
after that, uh, often are far,

679
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:06,410
far higher than the exposures that
come from food borne residues.

680
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,350
The idea that the susceptible need,
need attention.

681
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:14,351
This is new and environmental law has
of 1996 and new areas that deserve

682
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:17,030
additional attention that, that, uh,

683
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,240
I think are extremely important is
the use of these chemicals as they're

684
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:27,020
impregnated into a variety of consumer
products. So, you know, if you're,

685
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,510
if you're hiking long distances,

686
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:34,220
you may want a pesticide impregnated
into the fabric that you buy if you don't

687
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:38,930
have an opportunity to, to
wash your clothes. Uh, but
what, what does that mean? Uh,

688
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,220
there are whole new array of products
in the marketplace now that carry these

689
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,480
residues,
uh,

690
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,230
for obvious functions
such as is durability,

691
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:52,280
keeping them from degrading pesticides
are added to paints, for example,

692
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:57,080
to keep the bacteria in
paint from breaking it down
and shipping and causing you

693
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:59,870
to have to, uh, to, uh,
you know, repaint in,

694
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:04,310
in a short period of time so that the
functional side of these chemicals used in

695
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,870
consumer products is
pretty well understood. Uh,

696
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,670
but the longterm implications for
environmental quality and human health,

697
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,863
really or not.

698
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:17,290
So the underlying problems here include
the human inability to sense chemical

699
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:18,260
risk.
You know,

700
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:21,530
we basically don't know
where these chemicals are in
our environment because we

701
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:25,880
can't see them. We can't taste them.
Uh, we can't feel them. We have to,

702
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,480
we have to imply where
they are, uh, by, uh,

703
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,460
by proxy a thinking about,
Gee, you know, I live near,

704
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,550
I'm living on a track of
land and I've got a, well,

705
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,100
and this used to be a farmland. Maybe
I had a test my drinking water, uh,

706
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:44,130
or I'm living next to a field that is
plant that is planted with a crop that's

707
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:48,730
routinely sprayed by a plane that
flies over. Maybe the drift is,

708
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:51,570
is getting into my, uh,
into my environment.

709
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,900
So that thinking about where these things
are in the environment really demands

710
00:44:57,211 --> 00:45:00,580
a certain level of background
literacy and knowledge, uh,

711
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,840
that often is not present. The underlying
problem of lack of sensitivity to,

712
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,010
to susceptibility is really important.
Uh, who's susceptible? Well, the,

713
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:10,870
the very youngest are,
uh,

714
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,300
remember that all of these concentrations
are measured how they're expressed per

715
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:19,160
unit of your body weight.
So when in life, uh,

716
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,200
does a human had the lowest body
weight in utero first trimester.

717
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,820
So if the concentration in
the mom is the same, uh,

718
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:35,821
moving across the placenta
as the concentration in
the fetus and you get to an

719
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:42,711
exposure estimate by taking
that concentration and
dividing it by body weight

720
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,000
and the mom's body weight might be 160
pounds and the fetus is body weight might

721
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,240
be a quarter of a pound. I'm
sorry. Sorry Laura. About this,

722
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,930
you get the idea.

723
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,860
The same concentration in the environment
affects the fetus much more than it

724
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:01,110
would, uh, the average adult.

725
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,220
So this has really transformed the way
that a government regulators have begun

726
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,600
to think about chemical management.

727
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,950
We've had poor monitoring
of chemical release. Uh,

728
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,770
we have thought much more about chemical
persistence and environmental fate

729
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,640
having learned from strontium
90 and the DDT story. Uh,

730
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,450
and we've under misunderstood
variability in human exposure. Still,

731
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,600
we're not putting monitors
on individual people,

732
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,730
although increasingly the government
is, is uh, uh, monitoring human tissue,

733
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:34,440
taking blood and urine, uh, and hair
samples to try to figure out, you know,

734
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,500
what the, what the Matrix
or chemicals might be that,

735
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,270
that an individual is exposed to.

736
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,680
So looking not just by a
sampling in the marketplace, uh,

737
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,450
but looking at this pattern by
taking human tissue samples,

738
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,680
this is a whole new wave that's giving
people the opportunity literally to go to

739
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:57,660
a doctor and say, I want to be measured
for this entire array of chemicals.

740
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,920
So it may cost you a couple thousand
dollars to go through that process.

741
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:03,570
But increasingly people are doing this,

742
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,840
trying to make some sense out of the way
that they feel their medical condition

743
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,160
and a environmental quality,

744
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,670
single chemical exposure is
still the focus of government.

745
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,170
No company wants it's chemical
to be compared to another
company. When, uh, when,

746
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,270
uh, uh, they're making
a regulatory choice, uh,

747
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,860
toxicity testing is incomplete and a
variety of areas, uh, especially, uh,

748
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,970
relative to the immune system. And,
you know, the rise in allergies that a,

749
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,270
we're experiencing a severe allergies.
Uh,

750
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:38,590
more people are walking around with
Epi pens today because of, of, uh, uh,

751
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:40,750
worries about anaphylaxis
than ever before.

752
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,710
Something is happening to the human
immune system. It's not clear why,

753
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,070
but many of the chemicals that are
released such as some pesticides, uh,

754
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,010
do influence the human immune system.

755
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:55,180
That's one example of an area of human
health that has been neglected by,

756
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,040
by the government. Uh, also
the Endocrin, uh, affects are,

757
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,260
are quite, uh, uh,
misunderstood the, the, uh, uh,

758
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,110
behavior of these chemicals as human
hormones that we'll speak about a bit next

759
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,350
week. Uh, also failure of
labeling as a management strategy.

760
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,160
Labeling is still the dominant approach
that EPA takes to try to inform the

761
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:15,994
public,

762
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:20,260
to educate the public how they might be
able to use these economic poisons a in

763
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:21,094
a safe way.

764
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,370
But you need to think about whether or
not that's really a potentially effective

765
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:28,450
way of controlling these kinds of risks.
And we're also misunderstanding, uh,

766
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,340
trends in human illness.
Uh, W for example, uh,

767
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,460
we had no asthma registry in
Connecticut until I'm not 2003,

768
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,210
so we couldn't figure out
whether or not, uh, uh,

769
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,410
people that lived in areas that had
higher levels of air pollution, uh,

770
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:46,030
were more likely to have asthma.

771
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,170
So the absence of surveillance
of health conditions, uh,

772
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,670
makes it impossible to correlate
these exposures to health outcomes.

773
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,300
And finally, a variance and
human capacity to manage risk.

774
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,740
There's a real environmental justice
here that needs to be paid attention to,

775
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:07,190
that there are many members of society
that do not have the capacity, uh,

776
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,800
to get the education necessary
to self manage risk. Uh, so that,

777
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,970
uh, some people, uh, simply
are more reliant on government
standard setting than,

778
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,240
than other people are. So these are
all underlying problems of law. Uh,

779
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,250
and all of them are pretty
well exemplified by this
history of pesticide, uh,

780
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:31,400
uh, uh, management. Okay.
That's it for today. And, uh,

781
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,550
we'll come back on Tuesday,
have a great weekend.
