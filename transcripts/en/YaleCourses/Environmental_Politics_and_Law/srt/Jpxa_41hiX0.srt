1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,010
I wanted to continue talking
about property rights and
the environment and also

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:09,000
to talk more about public lands and
natural resource management problems.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,870
And I wanted to pick up on some of the
questions that were raised on Tuesday.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,601
Uh,

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:20,010
with respect to the property regime that
was created by the state of New York in

6
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,030
the Adirondack Park.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,220
And,

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:22,440
you know,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,880
part of the problem with,

10
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:24,270
uh,

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,270
encouraging people to behave in
accordance with law is their perception of

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,330
legitimacy or the purpose of the law.

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:33,811
You know,

14
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:37,830
how consistent are there values with the
values that are embedded in law has a

15
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:38,664
mission statement.

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,320
So what factors,

17
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:45,000
can you imagine a would influence your
perception of the legitimacy of a new

18
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,834
regulation?

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,460
You know,

20
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,060
one thing might be a,

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,500
the way that you might have been allowed
to participate or were excluded from

22
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,470
the decision making process to
set up the new rule to begin with.

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:56,641
Uh,

24
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,560
another might be resistance,

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,730
a annoyance,

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,593
uh,

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,740
or a perception of immorality that,

28
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:03,900
uh,

29
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,430
some other group or individual
is imposing their values on you.

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,790
So one way to think about the history
of the Adirondack park is that prior to

31
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,360
1973,

32
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:15,900
uh,

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,141
the,

34
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,860
the local governments
really had authority to,

35
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,070
to control land use.

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:20,820
Uh,

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,350
and after the passage of the law,

38
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:23,280
the next day,

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,740
all of a sudden they did not
have that authority anymore.

40
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,920
And the rights of private
landowners were radically reduced.

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,610
So they went from a condition of being
rather free to develop their land as they

42
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:39,831
pleased to one where they really had to
understand the technical nature of law

43
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,630
as well as where they
were on this map that,

44
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:42,780
uh,

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,740
had had a,

46
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,613
the force of law,

47
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,430
let's zone did they fall within a,

48
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:52,431
and the argument is also the perception
of legitimacy is also a curiously tied

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,330
to science.

50
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,260
Uh,

51
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,760
and what's the relationship then
between science and law so that,

52
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,594
uh,

53
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,051
if,

54
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:01,210
uh,

55
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,210
this law was designed in a way to
prevent damage from being incurred by new

56
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:07,854
development.

57
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,140
Uh,

58
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,480
then how certain are these experts
sitting inside the government agency,

59
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,061
uh,

60
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:14,880
that the damage is likely to occur?

61
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,391
You know,

62
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:15,841
what's the,

63
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:17,040
what is the likelihood?

64
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,190
Are they thinking about it formally in,

65
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:23,970
in terms of probabilities of damages and
magnitudes a distribution of damages?

66
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,920
How are they thinking about,

67
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:26,754
uh,

68
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,060
uh,

69
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,060
the need to bring evidence data and
a strong science to questions about,

70
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,450
uh,

71
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,690
uh,

72
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,520
damage that supposedly justified these
new restrictions on their liberty and

73
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:38,940
what,

74
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,300
uh,

75
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,571
would,

76
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:39,631
uh,

77
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:40,530
population,

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,771
uh,

79
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,131
that,

80
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:41,401
uh,

81
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:41,721
is,

82
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,980
is low and income a relatively low,

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,280
uh,

84
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,100
in educational attainment compared
to other parts in New York?

85
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,611
You know,

86
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,640
what's their capacity to
challenge these new regulations?

87
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,271
I mean,

88
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:51,991
do they had the,

89
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:52,260
uh,

90
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,700
do they have the ability to,

91
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:58,380
or the or the money to hire a cologists
or soil scientists or atmospheric

92
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,214
scientists,

93
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,260
water quality experts to challenge the
government's claim that if they build the

94
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,230
way they want to,

95
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,831
that,

96
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,240
uh,

97
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,610
uh,

98
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,960
damage is going to occur.

99
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,320
Also the idea of compensation.

100
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,540
We'll talk more about that.

101
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:12,740
Uh,

102
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,660
especially next week when we think about
climate change in the coastal zone and

103
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,630
what that means for all the property
owners and the trillions of dollars of

104
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,470
property value,

105
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:20,921
uh,

106
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:21,880
in the coastal zone.

107
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,361
Uh,

108
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:22,901
so that,

109
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:23,021
uh,

110
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,820
under what kinds of conditions,

111
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,360
uh,

112
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,650
to do land,

113
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,420
uh,

114
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,190
uh,

115
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,420
uh,

116
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,420
can they expect compensation for loss
and property value that's associated with

117
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,260
these new laws and regulations.

118
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,920
And I want to also mention the work,

119
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,840
uh,

120
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,930
of Max Vapor.

121
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,160
Max Faber was a social scientist in
the early part of the 20th century,

122
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,230
a latter part of the 19th century.

123
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,850
And he wrote about the idea of
authority and a I mentioned on Tuesday,

124
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:56,560
and I want to reinforce this idea that
that a property is a form of authority.

125
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,180
It basically is,

126
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,960
is a social relationship among
those who are given rights,

127
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,400
uh,

128
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
and those who are obliged
to follow those rights to,

129
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,900
to not invade those rights in a way a
right is a kind of a sphere of liberty.

130
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,801
Uh,

131
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,251
and,

132
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:12,730
uh,

133
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,091
uh,

134
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,610
what happened in the
Adirondacks is that a,

135
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,670
this fear of liberty was
reduced and it was reduced,

136
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:18,910
uh,

137
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,780
largely based on the claim of the
government and a environmental experts.

138
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,321
Uh,

139
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,980
that damage was occurring from new
development and that it should be stopped.

140
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,810
Now when you think about the
sources of legitimacy in law,

141
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,501
if you look,

142
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,540
go back into political and social theory,

143
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,280
you'll find really a three dominant
sources that are commonly mentioned.

144
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:39,851
You know,

145
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,440
one is the authority,

146
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,940
the authority of the state,

147
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,600
uh,

148
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,871
to,

149
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,920
to pass law,

150
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,791
uh,

151
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,031
their,

152
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,080
their sovereign authority.

153
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,830
Uh,

154
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,690
the state meaning any level of government,

155
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,081
uh,

156
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,240
another would be a charisma.

157
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,010
Uh,

158
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,410
the,

159
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,470
the authority that is committed by a,

160
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:56,770
a charismatic leader,

161
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,330
perhaps a religious leader.

162
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:58,790
Uh,

163
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,190
and the third that I find to be most
relevant to this discussion today is the

164
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,150
idea of tradition.

165
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,200
Uh,

166
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,610
so that the idea that,

167
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:07,090
uh,

168
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,271
you know,

169
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:11,300
there's been a traditional pattern of
behavior that has been acceptable in a

170
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:12,134
society.

171
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,820
We've always been allowed to
sell off five acres a year or a,

172
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,770
we've been able to develop when we,

173
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:18,450
when we,

174
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:18,670
uh,

175
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,503
wanted to.

176
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,580
And now you're telling
us that we can't do that.

177
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,150
So possession is often thought of
as being nine tenths of the law.

178
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,370
And I'm sure you've heard
that phrase well that,

179
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:27,851
that uh,

180
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:31,390
this idea that tradition
and custom really underlie,

181
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,900
uh,

182
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,180
uh,

183
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,611
the,

184
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:32,711
uh,

185
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,200
the sense of legitimacy
is really quite important.

186
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,110
So when people have rights taken away,

187
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,160
they appeal to a,

188
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,670
their customary pattern of behavior
that their traditional rights.

189
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,360
You might also think about theories and
politics about the origin of property.

190
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,230
You know,

191
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,650
how,

192
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,220
how is,

193
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,560
uh,

194
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,970
uh,

195
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,200
property drived?

196
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,250
What's its source?

197
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,030
Well,

198
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,863
John Locke,

199
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,183
John Locke,

200
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:57,831
uh,

201
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:00,260
argued that a one source was God.

202
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,080
God gave humans a the right to
expropriate resources from the land.

203
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,550
Another is labor.

204
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:07,940
Uh,

205
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,271
and,

206
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:08,390
uh,

207
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,641
you,

208
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:13,340
you probably have heard about deluxe
labor theory so that if you invest in your

209
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,230
Labor in,

210
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,610
in,

211
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:14,840
uh,

212
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,520
improving land,

213
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,710
then you are justified in
claiming ownership to the
fruits of that improvement.

214
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,521
Another,

215
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,550
his inheritance in Rousseau roped,

216
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:24,770
uh,

217
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,460
uh,

218
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,030
extensively about the
unfairness of inheritance laws,

219
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,511
uh,

220
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,910
and argued that inheritance allowing,

221
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:32,390
uh,

222
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,270
the next generation to take the
property from the previous one,

223
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,030
that inherent inheritance,

224
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,630
how it really is the,

225
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,040
uh,

226
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,230
uh,

227
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,870
the fundamental origin
of inequality in society.

228
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Another is scarcity.

229
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,560
So you can imagine yourself being that
alone on an island as a Robinson Crusoe

230
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,311
was a,

231
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,190
so that there's really no need
for definition of property rights.

232
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:52,790
Uh,

233
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,150
basically there was no ma,

234
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,210
no there,

235
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,990
there may have been
conditions of scarcity,

236
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:57,951
but,

237
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,310
uh,

238
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,490
there,

239
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,330
there was no need to set up rules about
who could get access to the scarce

240
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,520
resources so that there are other,

241
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:04,671
uh,

242
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,930
origins as well,

243
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,400
including regulation.

244
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,631
And I think I'm a,

245
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:08,891
I'm,

246
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:11,660
I'm becoming a fascinated
by the relationship,

247
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,080
uh,

248
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,880
between,

249
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,220
uh,

250
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,310
the act of regulation and the
creation of new property rights.

251
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,890
So you might think about,

252
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,400
uh,

253
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,233
uh,

254
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,500
what we all now are concerned
about relative to climate
change is being stalled

255
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:28,620
out because we can't agree on a regulation
to cap the amount of carbon that

256
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,740
would be allowed to be
admitted to the atmosphere.

257
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,410
So once that cap is established,

258
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,620
that's going to set the stage for the
evolution of markets and trading schemes,

259
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,171
uh,

260
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,630
among groups around the world so that,

261
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:42,010
uh,

262
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,290
uh,

263
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,520
property rights are often created
by regulation in ways that are not,

264
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,150
uh,

265
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,330
uh,

266
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,110
generally,

267
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,290
uh,

268
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,420
proceed on other ideas that,

269
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:50,601
uh,

270
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:50,871
you know,

271
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:55,160
when government regulates and creates
permits or a demands that you come and you

272
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:55,791
get a license,

273
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,750
whether it's a driver's
license or a license to use a,

274
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,050
a new pesticide,

275
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,040
uh,

276
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,790
whatever it is.

277
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,470
If you're required to get a permit,

278
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,290
uh,

279
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,420
then that permit,

280
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:05,640
uh,

281
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,080
automatically has value and
a developers will often,

282
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,920
uh,

283
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,753
by land,

284
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,150
uh,

285
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,950
and then try to get approval,

286
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,400
uh,

287
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,400
to develop that land with no anticipation
that they are going to actually carry

288
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,400
through the development.

289
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:19,910
Uh,

290
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,990
but they're going to sell that,

291
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,560
right?

292
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,080
They're going to sell the
land along with the permit,

293
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,650
uh,

294
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,340
so that they will basically accrue
the increase in property value that's

295
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,380
associated with a new permit.

296
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,030
And we saw on the atomic weapons
testing area and also related to a,

297
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,810
uh,

298
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,381
private,

299
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:36,560
uh,

300
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,610
trade secrecy.

301
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,280
That secrecy creates property rights.

302
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:40,971
Uh,

303
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:41,531
so that,

304
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:41,710
uh,

305
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,120
creates great value in the secret.

306
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:44,631
And,

307
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:44,751
uh,

308
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,750
there is often a black market
in the trade of secrets.

309
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,010
So there are variety of different kinds
of property you're most familiar with

310
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,770
the idea of private property
and public property.

311
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,321
Uh,

312
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:59,310
but there's also an idea in the literature
about the comments so that there are

313
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,210
these areas,

314
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:00,720
uh,

315
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:00,860
uh,

316
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,860
of the environment or the universe of
that might be thought of as a Commons

317
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,150
where the property rights
are really not well defined.

318
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,480
And Garrett harden a wrote a piece in
1968 called the tragedy of the Commons.

319
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,751
If you haven't read it,

320
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,584
I commend it to you.

321
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,980
And it was a piece that argued that if
you have common land with an a defined

322
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:23,484
rights to it,

323
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,460
then people are going to try
to take advantage of that land.

324
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:31,461
And he used the example of a past year
in Great Britain where everybody wanted

325
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,150
to graze their sheep on the past year.

326
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:33,631
Well,

327
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,464
that's fine.

328
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:34,831
Uh,

329
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:36,960
until you get a critical mass,

330
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,100
a sheep on the past year,

331
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,580
and all of a sudden you lose the capacity
of the landscape to regenerate the

332
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,414
grasses,

333
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,721
uh,

334
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,870
eventually as more and more people
come in and to graze their sheep,

335
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,321
uh,

336
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:46,831
than the,

337
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,170
the resources going to
be degraded and lost.

338
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,000
And he was using that as an argument to
justify a regulation or a new form of

339
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:57,420
control over who would have
access to the common lands.

340
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,410
Uh,

341
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,240
we also think about public lands,

342
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:00,691
I think in,

343
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,160
in a very simplistic way.

344
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:02,581
And the,

345
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:02,881
the,

346
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,300
uh,

347
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,200
the rest of this lecture is going to
focus on public lands and also the ways

348
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:07,810
that a,

349
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,491
the very,

350
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,850
very different ways that rights
can be allocated to public lands.

351
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,390
Uh,

352
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,350
and the implications of that for
sustainable resource management.

353
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,760
And also the fact that,

354
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:18,001
you know,

355
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:22,160
as you look out across the landscape
where you think about a nation or any,

356
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,380
uh,

357
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,213
territory,

358
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,840
you're going to have a pretty,

359
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,380
uh,

360
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,060
pretty complex hybrid among these
different forms of private property.

361
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,900
And you know,

362
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,620
somebody who might think of
themselves as a pursuing a career to,

363
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,220
uh,

364
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,780
manage environmental quality.

365
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,231
Uh,

366
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:37,651
I'm,

367
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:38,970
I'm going to make an argument that,

368
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,813
uh,

369
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,840
you have very little capacity to manage
an environmental problem unless you

370
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,340
understand with great clarity,

371
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:47,941
uh,

372
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:52,380
the relationships that are created
by these hybrid property systems.

373
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,410
So once you understand the
property regime in an area,

374
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,590
you have a much higher
capacity to manage it.

375
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,670
Uh,

376
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,000
and especially next week we'll be talking
more about the fifth amendment to the

377
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:03,900
Constitution,

378
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,890
nor shall private property be taken for
public use without just compensation.

379
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,490
Uh,

380
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:08,821
that,

381
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:09,240
uh,

382
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,073
presented a,

383
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,680
uh,

384
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,760
an opportunity for courts through
the 20th century to the present,

385
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,301
uh,

386
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:15,960
to,

387
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,291
to,

388
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:16,500
uh,

389
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,310
debate,

390
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,550
uh,

391
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,840
where the threshold is.

392
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,070
What's an acceptable limit on government
authority to take private property and

393
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:27,480
when do they cross that threshold and
therefore have to compensate the private

394
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,314
land owner,

395
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,501
uh,

396
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,850
for taking away those rights.

397
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,690
Uh,

398
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,730
so what's justifiable public use?

399
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:35,370
This has been heavily
debated in the courts.

400
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:35,880
Uh,

401
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,460
what government appropriation
becomes a taking a,

402
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:40,470
when has it been when
his land been rendered,

403
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,304
valueless,

404
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:41,740
uh,

405
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,420
and should government's regulation
of private property be restricted.

406
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,861
So let's,

407
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:47,070
uh,

408
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,270
kind of drop some of these ideas
down on to the Adirondack park.

409
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,120
And I mentioned that it's a 6 million
acre track of land and you know,

410
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,820
we could have used a different
park or a different area.

411
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,211
Uh,

412
00:11:58,211 --> 00:11:59,440
we could have used Yellowstone,

413
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,110
I'll use a couple of examples in
a few moments about Yellowstone,

414
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,650
but in this area you have
6 million acres of land.

415
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,190
And about roughly 50% of
it is privately owned.

416
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:09,850
Uh,

417
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,650
and the other 50% is publicly owned
and a was as I described on Tuesday,

418
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:14,930
the,

419
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,780
the Adirondack Mountain Reserve.

420
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,620
Uh,

421
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,191
so that,

422
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:18,341
uh,

423
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:20,170
it was forest preserve land,

424
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,620
uh,

425
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,120
that the constitution of New York protects
against any sort of timber harvesting

426
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,230
and he sort of structural development
unless that development is necessary to

427
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,570
protect that land on the part
of the state of New York.

428
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,530
Uh,

429
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,250
and this land has been
classified under this statute,

430
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,640
uh,

431
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,350
that was adopted in 1973.

432
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:43,351
The Adirondack Park Agency statute
into a variety of different categories,

433
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,080
including wilderness and
the orange at the top.

434
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,030
So about 18% of the area,

435
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:51,790
20% of the area now has been
designated as wilderness.

436
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,330
Uh,

437
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,770
using a standard that is more rigorous
than the federal wilderness designation,

438
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,160
uh,

439
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,993
standard,

440
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,810
which requires only 5,000 acres for
a new wilderness area to be created.

441
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,430
There are nearly 20 separate wilderness
areas in the Adirondacks right now and

442
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,671
the,

443
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:07,030
uh,

444
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,560
the minimum size requirement
to create them as 10,000 acres.

445
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,270
So it's double the
federal standard in the,

446
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:13,410
uh,

447
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,860
in the total area that's required.

448
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,690
They also have primitive areas.

449
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,670
Primitive areas are like wilderness,

450
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:21,520
except that they might have
certain facilities on the interior,

451
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:21,970
uh,

452
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,990
perhaps roadways,

453
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,310
perhaps fire towers,

454
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,140
perhaps ranger street stations,

455
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:26,591
maybe,

456
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:26,950
uh,

457
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,120
uh,

458
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,300
some electric lines.

459
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,440
And these primitive areas
constituted a rather small percent.

460
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,950
Another areas and experimental area that
I'll show you a slide of an a moment

461
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,390
called a canoer area.

462
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,750
And then about 22.4% of the,

463
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:40,871
uh,

464
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:41,980
this public land,

465
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,500
22.4% of 3 million acres,

466
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,040
uh,

467
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,780
is classified as wild forest.

468
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,700
So just think about this for a moment.

469
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,680
This is the largest track of intact
forest in the eastern United States.

470
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,150
Uh,

471
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,150
it's extremely rich and
biological diversity and it
has had this century long,

472
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:00,730
longer than a century,

473
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,340
a system of control,

474
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:03,730
uh,

475
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,031
that,

476
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,190
uh,

477
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,460
is embedded in the constitution
of the state of New York.

478
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,970
And then further refined by this
Adirondack park agency statute,

479
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,540
uh,

480
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,860
into these different categories that
allow very different and specific kinds of

481
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:15,694
uses.

482
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,400
Now think about the definition
of wilderness for just a moment.

483
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,870
This is contained in the wilderness
act of 1964 a wilderness.

484
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,500
In contrast with those areas where man
in his own words dominate the landscape

485
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,700
is hereby recognized as an area where
the earth and its community of life or

486
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:31,780
untrammeled by man,

487
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:34,960
we're man himself as a visitor
who does not remain well.

488
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,640
This is a very interesting definition.

489
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,740
It implies that a human
presence or any human influence,

490
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,080
uh,

491
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,770
in this area is not tolerable.

492
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,180
So that a,

493
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:47,110
the Adirondacks,

494
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,591
uh,

495
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:47,981
again,

496
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:48,491
with a,

497
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:48,731
you know,

498
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:49,470
roughly,

499
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:49,860
uh,

500
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,030
uh,

501
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,130
a million,

502
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,040
million a quarter acres,

503
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,740
a designated wilderness offers many,

504
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,150
many opportunities to,

505
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:56,420
uh,

506
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,870
uh,

507
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,860
seek solitude and get off
on your own and test your,

508
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:00,860
your physical and,

509
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,431
and,

510
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:01,730
uh,

511
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,660
personal skills.

512
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,070
But what's quite interesting about it
is that people within these designated

513
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,170
areas are really drawn to very,

514
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,300
a very small percentage of the area.

515
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,310
People are drawn to the mountain peaks.

516
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,600
And one reason why this,

517
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:14,691
uh,

518
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:15,740
this mountain peak is,

519
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,611
is bald,

520
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:18,890
is because people have,

521
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,060
have hiked to the summit,

522
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,780
uh,

523
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,740
so often.

524
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,300
And the soils on the summit's a of
peaks throughout New England are very

525
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,134
shallow.

526
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,630
So they're very vulnerable with a,

527
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
if the vegetation that,

528
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:30,081
uh,

529
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,640
this young man is about to jump on,

530
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,230
if that vegetation is lost,

531
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,940
the soil that it sits on will be lost,

532
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,540
uh,

533
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,010
and it will erode down to bedrock and
thereby will never have a opportunity to

534
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,890
support additional vegetation
if it kind of interesting.

535
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,270
Uh,

536
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,670
oh,

537
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,271
I'll show you a,

538
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:44,740
uh,

539
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,573
a clear cut,

540
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,071
uh,

541
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:46,371
that,

542
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:46,730
uh,

543
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,220
uh,

544
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,380
in,

545
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,980
in a western forests in just a moment.

546
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,260
Now,

547
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,830
I want you to start also think about,

548
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:52,120
uh,

549
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,620
uh,

550
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,090
uh,

551
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,480
goals that people have for going
into wilderness in different areas.

552
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:56,721
And,

553
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,080
uh,

554
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,501
I just,

555
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:57,681
uh,

556
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:02,681
was looking at the cost of taking a trip
and a climbing Mount Everest in Nepal.

557
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,570
And for a single climber,

558
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,140
it's $25,000.

559
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,560
Uh,

560
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,161
for two people,

561
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,060
it's 40,000.

562
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:10,310
And for seven people at $70,000.

563
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,750
It was kind of interesting that,

564
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:11,990
uh,

565
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,920
the governments in,

566
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,320
in different parts of the world are,

567
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:14,780
are,

568
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,090
are thinking about the right to climb,

569
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,691
uh,

570
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:19,730
and the value of the right to climb.

571
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,630
Uh,

572
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,291
at the same time,

573
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,980
they're thinking about the costs that
the government might incur if something

574
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,330
goes wrong on those trips.

575
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,403
And they have to,

576
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,390
they have to fund a,

577
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:28,670
uh,

578
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,540
a rescue effort.

579
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,403
By the way,

580
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,090
uh,

581
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,090
Mount Everest is about
29,000 feet in elevation a,

582
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,640
but Denali in Alaska is about
20,000 feet in elevation.

583
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,060
So if you're willing to give
up that last 9,000 feet,

584
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,510
uh,

585
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,090
you can go to the top
of Denali for only $200.

586
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,201
By the way,

587
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:49,011
there are also,

588
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:49,320
uh,

589
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,580
uh,

590
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,810
many parts of,

591
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,091
of,

592
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:51,300
uh,

593
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,240
the world were climbing.

594
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,310
Parties are required to post a bond,

595
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,670
a bond that would cover the total cost of,

596
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,271
of,

597
00:16:59,271 --> 00:16:59,480
uh,

598
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,620
an expedition to,

599
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,810
to go in and rescue them in the case.

600
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:03,770
It's something goes wrong.

601
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,040
Now in the Adirondacks.

602
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:06,171
Uh,

603
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:08,360
another way to think
about wilderness or my,

604
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,223
my view of,

605
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,093
of wilderness,

606
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,760
uh,

607
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,151
was,

608
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:12,200
was shifted dramatically.

609
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:13,220
And just as an aside,

610
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,640
when I,

611
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,660
when I was working,

612
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,230
uh,

613
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,120
in the Adirondack park when I was younger,

614
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,630
uh,

615
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,590
my responsibility was to manage the
policy for these wilderness lands.

616
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,251
Uh,

617
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:22,821
so that,

618
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:23,260
uh,

619
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,430
I faced constant,

620
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,070
uh,

621
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,830
tension and an argument debate about,

622
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,210
uh,

623
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,250
what user groups should be
allowed access into which areas.

624
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:31,851
And,

625
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:32,240
uh,

626
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,490
if new wilderness area
was being designated,

627
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:35,301
people would fight,

628
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:36,920
tick to keep the roads open,

629
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:37,551
to keep the,

630
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:37,960
uh,

631
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,650
a ranger cabins open to,

632
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:39,950
uh,

633
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,390
to basically maintain these traditional
or customary patterns of use.

634
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,770
So one thing that I
was struck by was this,

635
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,410
that sits on the top of whiteface
mountain white face was the site of,

636
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,260
is the site of the Olympic,

637
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:55,600
uh,

638
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,070
uh,

639
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,730
training,

640
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:56,880
uh,

641
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,990
downhill facilities.

642
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,483
And,

643
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,090
uh,

644
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,930
the,

645
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,801
it's also a,

646
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:01,960
a,

647
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,960
a national weather station that started
to collect data during the 1970s and

648
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,544
early 1980s.

649
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,840
The demonstrated that,

650
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,090
uh,

651
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,560
uh,

652
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,140
we were experiencing significant
changes in the atmosphere.

653
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:13,890
Uh,

654
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,320
we were experiencing a increases in,

655
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,400
in software and,

656
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:17,701
and,

657
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:18,270
uh,

658
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,510
uh,

659
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,350
sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides that we're,

660
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,310
we're producing sulfuric and
nitric acids and these acids.

661
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,870
We're having an effect on,

662
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,240
uh,

663
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,410
a force in the Adirondacks and
shifting the biological diversity,

664
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:35,520
particularly a high elevations in
ways that really were not anticipated.

665
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,040
Why high elevations
and not low elevations?

666
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,001
Well,

667
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,440
it turns out that nobody had really
thought about the contribution of,

668
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,720
of fog and clouds that cluster around
mountain peaks as a creating a kind of an

669
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,490
intense and chronic
exposure to the plants,

670
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,091
uh,

671
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:51,540
or,

672
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,850
or animals that live in those areas.

673
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:54,931
So that the,

674
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:55,140
uh,

675
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,890
the red spruce decline in the
Adirondacks is now now related to this.

676
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,503
The Red Spruce,

677
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:01,710
uh,

678
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,100
uh,

679
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,650
become susceptible to
a variety of different,

680
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:05,310
uh,

681
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,850
kinds of insects in,

682
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,150
in response to their,

683
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,410
their exposure to increased acidity

684
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,260
paradox of wilderness.

685
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,360
And thinking about how to manage it,

686
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:15,930
uh,

687
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,341
is that,

688
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:16,640
you know,

689
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,900
we tend to think about
it as nature in the wild,

690
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,640
but it really is a social construction.

691
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,480
Uh,

692
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,090
and there's a very strong
association with liberty.

693
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,010
And,

694
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,900
and the paradox is that if you're
managing or wilderness area,

695
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,490
then you have to think carefully
about what intensity of human use,

696
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,031
uh,

697
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:36,960
it could sustain and still maintain
its character and many people,

698
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,380
uh,

699
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,660
and I am included think that,

700
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:40,140
uh,

701
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,000
when I go into a wild area,

702
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm not really interested in signing up
at a ranger station and getting a permit

703
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:49,320
to go into a wilderness and being told
where I can camp and where I can't camp.

704
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,270
And that kind of defeats the purpose of,

705
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,193
in my mind,

706
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,640
of what wildness is.

707
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,800
So what's the origin of that worry?

708
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,041
Well,

709
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,910
it's basically the Association of
wildness with personal freedom,

710
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,691
uh,

711
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:03,440
but obviously is more and
more people want to climb a,

712
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,460
a Denali or Mt.

713
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,320
Everest or go into the high
peaks of the Adirondacks.

714
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,910
It raises the question,

715
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,650
I know of carrying capacity,

716
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,041
you know,

717
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,620
what is a,

718
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,840
what's inappropriate limit.

719
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,700
So the Adirondack Park Agency face this
question with respect to many different

720
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,210
ecosystems that it had the
responsibility under this law to,

721
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,044
to manage.

722
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,650
Uh,

723
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,180
there are some 2000 different
islands on a more than a thousand,

724
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:27,510
uh,

725
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,340
uh,

726
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,561
uh,

727
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,540
lakes and ponds in the Adirondacks.

728
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,130
And these tend to be pretty small,

729
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,450
a couple of acres in size.

730
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,900
They also tend to be a,

731
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:35,150
uh,

732
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,983
basically just,

733
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:36,910
uh,

734
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,220
granitic bedrock,

735
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:38,941
uh,

736
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:39,271
that,

737
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:39,580
uh,

738
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:39,721
uh,

739
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,220
has very shallow soils.

740
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,490
So that new development
on these islands was,

741
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:48,280
was quite highly restricted and islands
are extremely from a developer's

742
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,140
perspective and also from,

743
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,401
from a,

744
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:51,810
uh,

745
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:51,901
uh,

746
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:54,520
the perspective of a recreational sites.

747
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,550
So that a,

748
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,090
you mean if,

749
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,140
if you were canoeing down this lake in
the Adirondacks and you saw one of these

750
00:20:59,141 --> 00:20:59,471
islands,

751
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:02,330
you probably would want to canoe
over to one and explore it or,

752
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,530
or,

753
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,363
or camp on it.

754
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,451
And the state is,

755
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,160
has built campsites on this,

756
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,023
on these islands.

757
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,860
So there are always questions about,

758
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:09,071
you know,

759
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,860
how much development and
what kind can it sustain,

760
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,480
how much recreational in,

761
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:13,900
in,

762
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,120
uh,

763
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,460
intensity can it sustain,

764
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:15,880
uh,

765
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,713
without damage.

766
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,471
In this case,

767
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:19,630
one of the key questions
would be sewage disposal.

768
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:23,980
As I was mentioning with the camp
Sagamore slide back on Tuesday.

769
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,450
So,

770
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:25,571
uh,

771
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:25,811
the,

772
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:27,100
the foot group here,

773
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,671
uh,

774
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,680
when I was working with foot,

775
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:29,921
uh,

776
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,820
as an advisor,

777
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,720
uh,

778
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:31,960
uh,

779
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,890
some years ago,

780
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,190
uh,

781
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,023
the foot crew,

782
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,301
uh,

783
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:37,420
went up to the Adirondacks and I
helped them lay out trails through the

784
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,254
Adirondacks,

785
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:38,621
uh,

786
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:38,921
that,

787
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:39,754
uh,

788
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,020
seemed like they were suitable.

789
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,531
Uh,

790
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:42,880
but it was quite curious because the,

791
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:43,061
the,

792
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:43,601
the park,

793
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:44,030
uh,

794
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,140
uh,

795
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,950
became much more concerned about
loss of soil on the peaks and,

796
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:48,161
uh,

797
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:48,411
the,

798
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:48,630
the,

799
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,091
the roots.

800
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,090
And they decided that don't,

801
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,750
one approach was going to be to
limit the size of the parties.

802
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,300
I can't remember the size of what,

803
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:54,490
you know,

804
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,020
some of you probably went on foot,

805
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:56,860
anybody in the room,

806
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,451
what's the,

807
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:58,630
uh,

808
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,040
party size and in foot?

809
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,893
Yes,

810
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,190
about 10 while this party size has
been now restricted to eight in the

811
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:06,821
Adirondacks,

812
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:11,320
which basically meant that the foot was
going to keep using the area that it

813
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:13,870
would have to reduce its party size
so that they were kind of interesting

814
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,100
questions about cost efficiency and uh,

815
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,160
the program effectiveness
related to party size and uh,

816
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,960
many logistical questions so that
they decided to back out and,

817
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,720
and a to move to two other sites.

818
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,190
So this idea that,

819
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:27,580
uh,

820
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,580
for any wilderness area you would have
both a kind of a physical biological idea

821
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:35,110
of what it's carrying capacity might be.

822
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,681
But,

823
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:35,801
uh,

824
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:36,041
there,

825
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,910
there was also a very interesting
literature on the psychology of wilderness

826
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:40,121
that,

827
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:40,300
uh,

828
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,250
has been pioneered by the forest service,

829
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:42,770
uh,

830
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,200
about what people expect.

831
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,310
What do people want?

832
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,240
Do they want to see people when
they go back into a remote areas?

833
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,600
And most people would presume
that the answer would be no.

834
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,860
But then if you look at the,

835
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:53,990
uh,

836
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,360
the pattern of wilderness use and national
park use in our country and pretty

837
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,194
much around the world,

838
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,350
what you see is that a wilderness is a
playground for a social cohesion in a

839
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:05,800
way.

840
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,130
I mean,

841
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,030
families go back,

842
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:12,031
friends go back into a remote areas
so that very few people go into a very

843
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:13,870
remote areas alone.

844
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,890
I find that to be kind
of interesting so that,

845
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,361
that,

846
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:17,530
uh,

847
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,490
it becomes a,

848
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,690
it becomes an outdoor,

849
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,130
a opportunity for,

850
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,830
uh,

851
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,110
a socialization.

852
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:23,860
You know,

853
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,680
another kind of write that,

854
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:25,750
uh,

855
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,750
you might not think about is this a right
to use motor vehicles and the right of

856
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:31,624
access.

857
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,110
And if you allow a float
plane operators in,

858
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,690
in a national park or our wilderness area,

859
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,490
you are creating a,

860
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:42,310
a variety of management headaches.

861
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:42,911
Now,

862
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:45,100
float planes are not
allowed in wilderness areas.

863
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,651
And,

864
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:45,831
uh,

865
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:47,870
when we decided we were
going to close off a,

866
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,040
a large number of lakes,

867
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,520
uh,

868
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,910
to,

869
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,600
to a motor vehicle access either
by car or use of boats or,

870
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,591
or,

871
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:55,140
uh,

872
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,310
uh,

873
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,440
jet skis or,

874
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,430
or access by my aircraft.

875
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,540
You can imagine the Howells that went up
because people had gone onto the public

876
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,630
land as they have in many remote
parts of the u s and including,

877
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,131
uh,

878
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:06,310
in,

879
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,740
in,

880
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,200
uh,

881
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,490
uh,

882
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,450
large tracks of,

883
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,343
of uh,

884
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:09,770
uh,

885
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,090
large areas of Alaska.

886
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,160
And they have built these camps,

887
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,270
uh,

888
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,270
on public land and they claim that
they've been using this camp for the past

889
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:18,711
couple of decades.

890
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:22,370
That there they're a daddy use that camp
and to that they really have a right to

891
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:24,620
continue access and continue use.

892
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,550
Well,

893
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:25,821
the,

894
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,270
uh,

895
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,571
the,

896
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:26,940
uh,

897
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,590
uh,

898
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,670
strength of the conflict is really
driven by what options they've got.

899
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,061
And,

900
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:33,560
and luckily in the Adirondacks,

901
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:35,270
remember you've got this
wilderness category,

902
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:37,010
but you've got these
other categories as well.

903
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:41,120
We're motor vehicles are allowed and
they would have similar opportunities to,

904
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,890
to fly into two other lakes so that the,

905
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:45,260
the politics was managed.

906
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,680
Uh,

907
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,410
basically because of the existence of,

908
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,890
of alternative sites,

909
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,000
still those people that had gone back
to their camps and invested in building

910
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:54,560
camps and these camps,

911
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:56,150
some of these camps were actually quite,

912
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,223
quite nice.

913
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,470
Uh,

914
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,251
they had stoves,

915
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:00,020
they had propane gas stoves,

916
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:00,854
they had heaters,

917
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,890
and they had a refrigerators.

918
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:03,321
So that,

919
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:03,770
uh,

920
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:03,921
you know,

921
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,900
these were more than modest little sites.

922
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,420
The evolution of small motorized vehicles
is also created a very significant

923
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,340
management headache so that,

924
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:13,680
uh,

925
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,090
and whether or not it's
a jet jet ski or a,

926
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,170
an ATV.

927
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,820
The forest service,

928
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,740
the park service and the
bureau of land management,

929
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,930
a nature conservancy,

930
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:26,120
anybody who manages a large track of land,

931
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,690
uh,

932
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,920
in the United States today,

933
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,300
he's faced with a worrying and
trying to figure out how to,

934
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,310
how to manage access by these vehicles.

935
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,330
They're fast,

936
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,163
they're light.

937
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,410
Uh,

938
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:36,920
they can,

939
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,130
uh,

940
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,050
basically a,

941
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:39,800
a zip around and escape,

942
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,350
uh,

943
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:40,521
uh,

944
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:44,390
rangers so that the amount of damage
to these can cause is really quite,

945
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,010
quite,

946
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,150
uh,

947
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:45,983
interesting.

948
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,240
And many of the,

949
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,510
many of the users are also interested in,

950
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:50,960
uh,

951
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,370
and hunting and,

952
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:52,581
uh,

953
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:54,460
the ATVs provide a,

954
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,170
basically a vehicular method to,

955
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:57,370
uh,

956
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,630
to,

957
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,570
to pull game out of a remote areas.

958
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,310
The shot of,

959
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,060
of a snowmobiles in west Yellowstone
is also interesting to me.

960
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,260
West Yellowstone,

961
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,160
uh,

962
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,960
during the wintertime in periods of peak
usage by snowmobiles where they have

963
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:14,840
conventions of thousands of
snowmobiles in west Yellowstone,

964
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,380
the particulate and,

965
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:16,521
and,

966
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:16,730
uh,

967
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,120
uh,

968
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,280
ozone air quality is,

969
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:19,670
uh,

970
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,760
often worse than it is in New
York City or it is in Los Angeles.

971
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,470
So that there is a,

972
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,150
there has been an improvement in the
emissions from the smaller engines.

973
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:29,691
Uh,

974
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,100
but,

975
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,440
uh,

976
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,400
still they are significantly
less efficient than,

977
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,510
than our a motor vehicle engines,

978
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,590
excuse me,

979
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,820
such as a cars.

980
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,450
Uh,

981
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,880
I also wanted to mention that,

982
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,151
that,

983
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:41,660
uh,

984
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,170
uh,

985
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,370
the Adirondacks has a bunch of scientific
experiments and one of the values of,

986
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,490
of wilderness is,

987
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,660
is to provide an environment where
scientific experiments can take place.

988
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,730
And the,

989
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,760
the idea that,

990
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:54,594
uh,

991
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,170
uh,

992
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:00,170
the ecology and the chemistry of a
Adirondack ecosystems is being transformed

993
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:01,440
by,

994
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,280
by our coal burning behavior in the
Midwestern part of the United States.

995
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,121
So that the,

996
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:06,330
uh,

997
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,270
the emissions from the Midwest
sweep up the Ohio valley,

998
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:09,670
uh,

999
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,550
they sweep into Pennsylvania and,

1000
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:12,570
and the New York state.

1001
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,081
And that,

1002
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:15,240
that's really one of the
predominant sources of,

1003
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:15,691
of uh,

1004
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:16,050
the,

1005
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,200
the acid aerosols here
and now these lakes are,

1006
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,390
are basically a barren
of native strains of,

1007
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,233
of trout.

1008
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,770
And that's primarily because they're,

1009
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:26,560
they're highly dependent upon a,

1010
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,391
on the acidity level,

1011
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:29,890
not getting a above or the,

1012
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:29,980
uh,

1013
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,890
the Ph not getting below a certain level.

1014
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,270
In this case,

1015
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:33,500
uh,

1016
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,520
a variety of different
experiments had been,

1017
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,090
uh,

1018
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,630
attempted including Liming
lakes when I was there.

1019
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,640
We would fix buckets,

1020
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,560
these really large buckets of lime and
helicopters would pick up the buckets and

1021
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,520
drop the lime over the lakes in an,

1022
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,440
in an attempt to,

1023
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:49,830
uh,

1024
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,910
to buffer the acidity and make it more
suitable for the native strains of trout.

1025
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,720
Eventually this became so
cumbersome and they realize that,

1026
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:56,860
uh,

1027
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,380
it would cost way too much to apply
this broadly across different lakes and

1028
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:06,381
ponds that instead they thought about
genetic modification of fish to increase

1029
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:10,340
their tolerance so that
they're now a variety of,

1030
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,430
of different species of trout that had
been genetically engineered to make them

1031
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,264
more tolerant.

1032
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,340
So that when I mentioned earlier that,

1033
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:17,641
um,

1034
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:17,821
you know,

1035
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,810
my perception of,

1036
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,200
of,

1037
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,620
uh,

1038
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:19,861
you know,

1039
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:21,030
what wilderness is,

1040
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,560
was transformed by,

1041
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:23,000
uh,

1042
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,190
uh,

1043
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,460
the atmospheric testing that took
place on the top of Whiteface Mountain.

1044
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,750
Now this is what I meant.

1045
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,390
Uh,

1046
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,620
also if you go back to some of
the old growth timber in the park,

1047
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,440
a timber that's been there for at least,

1048
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:34,780
uh,

1049
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,100
a,

1050
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,630
say 50 or 60 years.

1051
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,080
Uh,

1052
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,920
and if you did a,

1053
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:38,011
a,

1054
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:38,910
a core,

1055
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:39,310
it's,

1056
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:39,751
in other words,

1057
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,730
if you took a a screw and you,

1058
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:42,091
you,

1059
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,300
uh,

1060
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,660
you cord into the tree and you pulled
out a core of wood all the way from the

1061
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,494
center of the tree,

1062
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,250
you could test back in
time and have a chemical,

1063
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:50,910
uh,

1064
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,700
uh,

1065
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,170
replication of what was
in the air during a,

1066
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,530
uh,

1067
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,363
different years.

1068
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:56,810
Uh,

1069
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,080
so one of the interesting things that
you could find is the period between 1945

1070
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,490
in 1963,

1071
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:05,250
which was the atomic weapons testing era.

1072
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,080
You would find the radionuclides in some
species of timber that are of that age

1073
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,914
up there.

1074
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,360
So that in some way they become a,

1075
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:13,440
a,

1076
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,930
a chronicle of past atmospheric quality,

1077
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,740
the Olympic training
facility and the Adirondacks.

1078
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,830
Also a presented many different
kinds of property rights questions.

1079
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,820
Uh,

1080
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,451
this is,

1081
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:27,601
uh,

1082
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:31,170
the downhill ski facility on the
top of which is the weather station.

1083
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,600
And this is the long been the site of,

1084
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:34,434
of uh,

1085
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,070
uh,

1086
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,140
national and international ski racing,

1087
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,470
uh,

1088
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,310
competitions.

1089
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,431
And there was a,

1090
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:40,950
a very curious debate about,

1091
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,490
because this is on Adirondack forest
preserve land and this facility was not

1092
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,420
allowed to be built,

1093
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:46,731
uh,

1094
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:50,020
until the legislature passed
on two successive occasions,

1095
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,300
an amendment to the New
York state constitution.

1096
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,180
It's quite interesting so
that no development remember,

1097
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,250
could be built on forest preserve lands,

1098
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,600
uh,

1099
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,670
unless there was a
constitutional amendment that
required this two successive,

1100
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,553
uh,

1101
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,260
uh,

1102
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,670
actions on the part of the legislature.

1103
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,511
So they did this,

1104
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,450
but they also constrain the
trail with a to 80 feet.

1105
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:07,991
Well,

1106
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:12,460
the International Olympic Committee said
we can't have a downhill ski race on a

1107
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,570
trail that's only 80 feet.

1108
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,380
And with our ratios are
likely to go speeds of 80,

1109
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:17,681
90,

1110
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:20,170
a hundred miles an hour
and the steepest areas,

1111
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,850
and we've got to do something about that.

1112
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,270
We want to cut [inaudible]
swaths in the landscape that are,

1113
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,080
I mean,

1114
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,570
one case in order to cut one that
was about a hundred yards in width,

1115
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,440
uh,

1116
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,850
in the argument of safety.

1117
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,660
Well,

1118
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:31,901
the,

1119
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:32,021
uh,

1120
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:34,630
the eventual s the eventual solution was,

1121
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,080
uh,

1122
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,351
no,

1123
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:39,160
you can't cut the trail is up to that
level because that would be a violation of

1124
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:39,994
the constitution.

1125
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:40,450
Uh,

1126
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,420
but instead you can install
netting on the sides of the trails.

1127
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,101
So the,

1128
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:45,310
the skiers go out of control.

1129
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,620
They'll become entangled in the
nets and they won't hit the trees.

1130
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,790
Kind of a very interesting debate between
the environmentalist's on the one hand

1131
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,320
and those that are promoting the value of,

1132
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,960
of the Olympics and the
international comradery and,

1133
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,780
uh,

1134
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,620
good spirits that it generates and those
concerned about the health and safety,

1135
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,020
uh,

1136
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,030
of the ski racers.

1137
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,800
Another facility that,

1138
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:06,400
uh,

1139
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,880
uh,

1140
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,500
I had the opportunity to,

1141
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:09,070
uh,

1142
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,903
uh,

1143
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,020
uh,

1144
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,560
manage the permit issuance
for was the ski jump facility.

1145
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,620
I don't know,

1146
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,140
are any of you a ski jumpers?

1147
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,410
Uh,

1148
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,520
probably not here.

1149
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,421
But,

1150
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:19,990
uh,

1151
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,490
uh,

1152
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,460
when I taught at Dartmouth,

1153
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:23,080
I had a number of ski jumpers in the,

1154
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:23,980
in my classes.

1155
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,051
And the,

1156
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,540
these facilities are a,

1157
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,820
it's a 90 meter ski jump,

1158
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,331
meaning that,

1159
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:28,660
uh,

1160
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,890
if you take off from the end,

1161
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:30,430
uh,

1162
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,300
the maximum flight distance
Safelite distances,

1163
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:33,520
uh,

1164
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:33,910
uh,

1165
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,050
roughly 90 meters,

1166
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,000
and then the 70 meter jump has next to it.

1167
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,060
And a,

1168
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,800
these were highly contested because they
are the tallest structures now between

1169
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:42,221
Albany,

1170
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:43,570
New York and Montreal,

1171
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,840
and they lie immediately adjacent
to the high peaks wilderness area.

1172
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,300
So the question posed
to the park agency was,

1173
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:49,751
well,

1174
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:52,950
what kind of a effect would
these towers have on the,

1175
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:53,310
the,

1176
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,230
the wilderness character
of the high peaks region?

1177
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,350
And the Olympic organizing
committee loved the idea.

1178
00:31:59,550 --> 00:31:59,800
Uh,

1179
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,190
they thought that these towers
would become a symbolic of,

1180
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:03,761
of,

1181
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:04,170
uh,

1182
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:04,510
uh,

1183
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,410
lake placid and the Adirondacks being a
winter sports capital and training site

1184
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,683
for the nation.

1185
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,360
Uh,

1186
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,500
but the environmentalist's,

1187
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:12,050
uh,

1188
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,190
uh,

1189
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,120
threatened to sue.

1190
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:15,700
They argued that this
should not be allowed,

1191
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,181
uh,

1192
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:16,481
that,

1193
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:16,661
uh,

1194
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:16,991
it is,

1195
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:17,130
uh,

1196
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:17,231
uh,

1197
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,064
clear,

1198
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,460
uh,

1199
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,040
intrusion into the wilderness
character of the area.

1200
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,490
And eventually the,

1201
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,280
the state of New York decided that,

1202
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:24,570
uh,

1203
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,280
these towers should be
built or rather obviously,

1204
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,010
and,

1205
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,590
uh,

1206
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,423
uh,

1207
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:29,880
uh,

1208
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,701
despite the,

1209
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:31,240
uh,

1210
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,571
the,

1211
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:31,840
uh,

1212
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,440
uh,

1213
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,750
requirement of the National
Environmental Policy Act,

1214
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,590
uh,

1215
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,071
that,

1216
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:36,400
uh,

1217
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,890
demands that whenever federal
funds are being expended,

1218
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,720
that alternative sites
have to be explored.

1219
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,201
And,

1220
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:42,590
uh,

1221
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,120
so that in this case that meant well,

1222
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:47,870
could you find an alternative site where
you didn't have to build a 350 foot

1223
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:48,704
tower?

1224
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,150
And the answer was yes.

1225
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,720
Uh,

1226
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,570
several alternatives existed that
would even be lower in costs.

1227
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,770
And here's an example,

1228
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:55,010
uh,

1229
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,460
from,

1230
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,460
from Europe of how many European
communities such as a Garmisch part and

1231
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,750
character in Innsbrook.

1232
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,051
And,

1233
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:03,590
uh,

1234
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,010
uh,

1235
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,311
the,

1236
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:04,980
uh,

1237
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,813
uh,

1238
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:06,990
uh,

1239
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,190
uh,

1240
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,080
jumps in Sweden and Norway,

1241
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,520
they're built into the hillside.

1242
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,710
So basically the problem is it's a,

1243
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,390
an engineering problem of sorts.

1244
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,231
You know,

1245
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:18,930
that you have a very specific
profile that is necessary in the,

1246
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,000
in the jump design.

1247
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,580
Uh,

1248
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,020
and you also have a specific profile
in the landing hill that is required.

1249
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,250
It has to be precise,

1250
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:27,000
otherwise the jumpers are,

1251
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:27,580
are,

1252
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,413
are endanger.

1253
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,380
Also they need to point north because,

1254
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:30,740
uh,

1255
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,090
if,

1256
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,470
if the sun comes down
and beats on the track,

1257
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:33,950
you'll,

1258
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,820
it'll make the a,

1259
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:38,930
it can change the consistency of the snow
on the end run and make it unfair for

1260
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,690
say,

1261
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,600
a jumper that's going later in the day.

1262
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,080
Uh,

1263
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,820
they also have to a point in a direction
that is opposite a prevailing winds,

1264
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,331
uh,

1265
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:49,070
because when a jumper goes off the jump,

1266
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:53,240
you don't want them blowing around so
that they have very specific site design

1267
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,074
criteria.

1268
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,640
However,

1269
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,210
one was found in lake placid and National
Environmental Policy Act demanded that

1270
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:00,500
that site be considered.

1271
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,310
Uh,

1272
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,970
and uh,

1273
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,220
it was a eventually rejected
by the state of New York,

1274
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,080
which resulted in the
building of that tower.

1275
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:06,681
No.

1276
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:11,681
One additional example of an intrusion
into wilderness that was being proposed

1277
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,430
was the mount van Hoven Berg,

1278
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,310
a cross country ski run.

1279
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,673
And this is a,

1280
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,160
this is now a terrific run.

1281
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:19,970
Uh,

1282
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,310
and they have a 50
kilometer races that are,

1283
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,810
are,

1284
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,490
uh,

1285
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:24,980
uh,

1286
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,850
held in the Olympics.

1287
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,280
And,

1288
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,930
uh,

1289
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:28,160
uh,

1290
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,120
when this was proposed,

1291
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:29,720
people thought,

1292
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:29,931
well,

1293
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:30,291
you know,

1294
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:30,500
uh,

1295
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
these trills really don't need to be a,

1296
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,200
anything that,

1297
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,190
perhaps wider than,

1298
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:34,710
uh,

1299
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,180
uh,

1300
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,220
this table on the top of the podium here.

1301
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,383
And,

1302
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,210
and it turned out that they
had to be a quite a bit wider.

1303
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:43,520
They needed to motorized
vehicles that could,

1304
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:43,941
could,

1305
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:44,030
uh,

1306
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,180
move through and they could
plow the snow up the way that I,

1307
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,280
a snowcat Woodard,

1308
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,123
a ski area,

1309
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,070
and then San attract behind them for,

1310
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,490
for the racers to follow.

1311
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,031
Uh,

1312
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:54,140
so the question became,

1313
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:54,321
well,

1314
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,310
should we allow,

1315
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,820
uh,

1316
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,590
should we allow motorized access,

1317
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:57,711
uh,

1318
00:34:57,711 --> 00:34:59,150
in wilderness areas to,

1319
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,550
to facilitate the
development of this facility?

1320
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,810
And the answer was no.

1321
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,963
Uh,

1322
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,140
the government,

1323
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,020
uh,

1324
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,760
the state of New York
decided that instead,

1325
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,120
uh,

1326
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,660
there was an adjacent track of
land that could easily be used and,

1327
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:12,040
uh,

1328
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,810
they would even have
to use less land area,

1329
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,411
uh,

1330
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:15,711
and,

1331
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:15,950
uh,

1332
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,400
cut down fewer trees if
they would use bridges.

1333
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,250
The way that to many of the
European communities that
have these facilities have

1334
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:22,810
done,

1335
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:22,940
uh,

1336
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,241
that,

1337
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:23,450
uh,

1338
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,950
the cross the trails so that a wooden
bridge crosses the trail so that you don't

1339
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:28,790
have interference.

1340
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,361
Uh,

1341
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:29,780
as a,

1342
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,920
as the race progresses,

1343
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,380
a wilderness often creates additional
debates about the kind of interior

1344
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:37,980
management that should occur.

1345
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,200
Should you have facilities
on the interior,

1346
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:40,590
uh,

1347
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,820
such as a ranger station,

1348
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,361
uh,

1349
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:44,840
should arrange your live on
the interior or should a,

1350
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,770
the rangers be roving through the area.

1351
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,000
Very interesting questions,

1352
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:48,540
uh,

1353
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,550
related to emergency response time.

1354
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,300
And,

1355
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,751
and the,

1356
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:51,931
uh,

1357
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:55,710
the access by helicopter obviously
reduces that response time.

1358
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,360
Uh,

1359
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,701
and the,

1360
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,061
the,

1361
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:57,171
uh,

1362
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:57,901
advent of,

1363
00:35:57,901 --> 00:35:58,560
uh,

1364
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:58,771
uh,

1365
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,570
wireless communications makes it,

1366
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,280
makes it much easier to,

1367
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,430
to get injured people out of these areas.

1368
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,031
Uh,

1369
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:06,421
but you know,

1370
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:07,070
every year,

1371
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,320
uh,

1372
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,200
several people will die in the
Adirondacks in the middle of the winter.

1373
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,741
It's a,

1374
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:11,730
it's famous for,

1375
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:14,490
for its storms where they start out at a,

1376
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,331
say,

1377
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:17,190
37 degrees and it's raining,

1378
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,851
and then,

1379
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:18,030
uh,

1380
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,421
by,

1381
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:19,080
uh,

1382
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,410
uh,

1383
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,880
maybe eight or 10 hours later,

1384
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,400
how the temperature
drops to 10 below zero.

1385
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,410
So people first get frozen,

1386
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,980
they first get cold and then
they become a hypothermic.

1387
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,090
So that a response time is,

1388
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:32,280
is really an important issue.

1389
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,330
Uh,

1390
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,320
within the Adirondacks,

1391
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:38,290
they decided to remove the ranger
cabins from the interior and instead a,

1392
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:38,761
a higher,

1393
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:41,010
more rangers that a would have a more,

1394
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,480
uh,

1395
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,270
requirements for patrolling
the interior area come.

1396
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,750
An interesting trade off between,

1397
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,921
between,

1398
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:47,430
uh,

1399
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,540
a response time.

1400
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,081
And,

1401
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:49,440
uh,

1402
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,801
the,

1403
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:49,921
uh,

1404
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:53,520
the wilderness character of the area are
also really interesting debates about

1405
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:56,860
how to manage fire and
wild lands and these very,

1406
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:57,320
uh,

1407
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,570
uh,

1408
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,950
agency to agency.

1409
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,790
So the forest service has a very
different policy toward a managing,

1410
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,710
managing fires.

1411
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:04,921
And,

1412
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:05,021
uh,

1413
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,600
the national park service has had,

1414
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,111
and,

1415
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:07,171
uh,

1416
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,640
this was very apparent in the,

1417
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:08,940
uh,

1418
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,540
uh,

1419
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:09,691
uh,

1420
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:12,300
enormous Yellowstone national park fires,

1421
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:12,871
uh,

1422
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:13,201
that,

1423
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:13,410
uh,

1424
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:13,831
burned,

1425
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,664
uh,

1426
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,080
tens of thousands of acres.

1427
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,760
So imagine the national parks service
lying next to us forest service land and

1428
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:23,190
the park service has a no burn policy.

1429
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:23,731
You know,

1430
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:25,260
let nature take its course.

1431
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:26,130
Lightening Strikes,

1432
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:26,671
uh,

1433
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:26,941
the,

1434
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:27,031
uh,

1435
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:28,440
the fire starts and,

1436
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:28,740
uh,

1437
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,850
we're not going to suppress it.

1438
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:35,160
So what that meant to the forest service
was that their timber leases were quite

1439
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:38,610
vulnerable and the timber companies
were claiming they had private property

1440
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:39,361
rights to those,

1441
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:39,830
uh,

1442
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,110
uh,

1443
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,250
timber and a,

1444
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,710
the government had an
obligation to ensure that a,

1445
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:45,750
it fought forest fires and,

1446
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:46,020
uh,

1447
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,660
to the best of their ability
to protect their rights.

1448
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,970
So very interesting conflicts over,

1449
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,601
over,

1450
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:51,810
uh,

1451
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,760
attitudes about,

1452
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:53,100
uh,

1453
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,320
how to manage a wilderness,

1454
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,790
how to minutes nature,

1455
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,260
and it's wild or form.

1456
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:58,711
Uh,

1457
00:37:58,711 --> 00:37:59,820
and once you,

1458
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,170
once you a permit,

1459
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,190
a commodity such as as a,

1460
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:03,970
uh,

1461
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,360
a timber REIT or a,

1462
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:05,770
uh,

1463
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,150
uh,

1464
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,310
a hunting right or a mineral extraction,

1465
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:09,140
right,

1466
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,140
then in a way government becomes obligated
to ensure continued access to the

1467
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,100
corporation to get those rights
out of the public domain,

1468
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,070
like you to think about.

1469
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,230
A couple of other ideas
about property rights,

1470
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,501
uh,

1471
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:22,731
and,

1472
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:23,101
and,

1473
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:23,934
uh,

1474
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,770
we're almost running out of time.

1475
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,090
And I'm going to give you a,

1476
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:30,960
just this one example here of
development in the coastal zone.

1477
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,230
This is a track of land that lies between
Los Angeles and Diego on the Pacific.

1478
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,510
And here you see basically a,

1479
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:41,020
uh,

1480
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,820
uh,

1481
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,060
a,

1482
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,900
a planned unit development area,

1483
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,440
uh,

1484
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,360
where you have gated communities in the,

1485
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:46,600
uh,

1486
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,770
in the hills overlooking the Pacific
and they basically ran out of land.

1487
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,480
So you can imagine if you have,

1488
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,161
if you've got a,

1489
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:58,161
a town and you a lay a grid over it
that is a one acre zoning and the entire

1490
00:38:58,241 --> 00:38:58,930
town,

1491
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,081
no,

1492
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:02,140
eventually you're going to have one
house on every one of those acres.

1493
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,920
And that a is then thought of as a
concept of build out a town has added to

1494
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:06,700
build out.

1495
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,860
So if that is the case and
what are you going to do?

1496
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,161
I mean,

1497
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:11,150
I suppose you could allow people,

1498
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:11,260
uh,

1499
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,660
through a variance to a
zoning ordinance to build up,

1500
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,230
uh,

1501
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,880
to build higher structures.

1502
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,950
But in this case that granted a developer,

1503
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,170
the right to build a marina.

1504
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,760
Now a marina,

1505
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:22,594
what's up marina?

1506
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:22,871
Well,

1507
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:23,740
this is some marina.

1508
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,430
Uh,

1509
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,900
this marina has hundreds and
hundreds of bursts and these,

1510
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,190
these boats are not a minor minor boats.

1511
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:30,791
And a,

1512
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,470
you can think about this one community,

1513
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,100
uh,

1514
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,520
to,

1515
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,810
and,

1516
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,050
and think about the process.

1517
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:39,130
The developer goes to the state of
California because the California coastal

1518
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:40,480
commission has jurisdiction.

1519
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,520
It goes to the town of Dana Point.

1520
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,650
It eventually it has to go to the,

1521
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:44,981
the,

1522
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:45,814
uh,

1523
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:46,421
uh,

1524
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:50,140
the coast guard and to a variety of
other federal agencies to get permits to

1525
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:50,974
develop this.

1526
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,300
But once they do that,

1527
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,980
it creates an enormous,

1528
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,060
uh,

1529
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,800
enormously profitable business.

1530
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:57,760
Uh,

1531
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,230
not only do do these people
I have to pay slip fees,

1532
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:02,680
uh,

1533
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,740
but they have to pay fees
for having their sewage,

1534
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,370
uh,

1535
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,510
pumped out of their boats.

1536
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,021
Uh,

1537
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:08,440
they,

1538
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,280
the town put up,

1539
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,790
uh,

1540
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,300
uh,

1541
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,890
recreational opportunities that,

1542
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:12,240
uh,

1543
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,110
the the users will pay for.

1544
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:14,830
Uh,

1545
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,830
and the tax revenues to the community
are in the millions of dollars per year

1546
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,901
because they,

1547
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,380
the community is able to
tax the value of the boat.

1548
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,240
Some of these boats are a 40,

1549
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:25,781
50,

1550
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:27,550
a 70 feet in length.

1551
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,361
So that,

1552
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:28,481
uh,

1553
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:28,691
the,

1554
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:31,750
the average estimate of real estate value,

1555
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,201
uh,

1556
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:32,411
you know,

1557
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:35,980
the boats are always changing
depending upon who buys a Elise to,

1558
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:36,521
to the,

1559
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:36,601
uh,

1560
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,434
the burst.

1561
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,410
But about $250 million in
increased real estate value,

1562
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:41,800
uh,

1563
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,800
was created out of what was formerly
public land common land owned by and

1564
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,150
managed by the state of California.

1565
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,970
So I'm going to leave you
just with a thought that,

1566
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:52,480
uh,

1567
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,691
you know,

1568
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:53,710
managing land,

1569
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,160
uh,

1570
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,890
is all about managing property rights and,

1571
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:57,270
uh,

1572
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,580
uh,

1573
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,580
conflicts over access to scarce and
valuable resources and the Adirondacks,

1574
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:03,290
uh,

1575
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:03,850
provides.

1576
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,280
I think one pretty
interesting example of that.

1577
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:06,730
Uh,

1578
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,420
because of the complexity of land
classifications that were created,

1579
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,030
I tend to think of the Adirondacks,

1580
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,163
uh,

1581
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,250
as having a dramatically
shifted my perception of,

1582
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,900
uh,

1583
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,900
the potential for us on earth any
longer to experience wildness.

1584
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,170
My idea of wildness is not what,

1585
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:26,621
it was.

1586
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:26,800
A,

1587
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,640
when I worked there,

1588
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,160
I had no understanding of
the chemical dimension of,

1589
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:33,670
of the Adirondacks and how humans
have changed the chemistry of,

1590
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:34,504
of the park.

1591
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,760
And also raises a very interesting
question about climate change.

1592
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,410
Uh,

1593
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:38,891
so that,

1594
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:39,020
uh,

1595
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,460
Melinda Smith professor in ecology
and evolutionary biology gave a very

1596
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:48,260
interesting lecture yesterday about the
influence of increasing temperature and,

1597
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:48,560
uh,

1598
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,890
uh,

1599
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,690
changes in moisture on,

1600
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,711
on,

1601
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:51,980
uh,

1602
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,310
uh,

1603
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,080
the future of grasslands.

1604
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,670
And she argued that,

1605
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:55,850
uh,

1606
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,850
will 3% of the world's grasslands
are now in protected area status.

1607
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,880
Only 3%.

1608
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,440
However,

1609
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,440
changes in the humidity changes in the
temperature are causing reductions in

1610
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:14,330
productivity and changes in biological
diversity that we're never imagined when

1611
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,350
these legal regime,

1612
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:17,810
such as the Adirondack
park agency were created.

1613
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,220
Now in the Adirondacks,

1614
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,930
you've got also changes in
temperature and you've got changes in,

1615
00:42:21,931 --> 00:42:23,420
in biological diversity.

1616
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:29,140
And what that means is that the approach
to managing these property rights,

1617
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,290
uh,

1618
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:34,070
has been insufficient to manage
the ecological change that it's now

1619
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:34,904
experiencing.

1620
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,970
So it's dramatically shifting
my perception of what they,

1621
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:38,390
uh,

1622
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,760
uh,

1623
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:38,930
the,

1624
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,930
the future of a parking protected areas
should be as ecological systems and

1625
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,060
habitats are literally migrating through,

1626
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,610
uh,

1627
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,610
these different parks and protected areas.

1628
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,620
So what this means really is that a to,

1629
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:53,480
to tackle,

1630
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:53,920
uh,

1631
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,170
if we have the objective of managing
biological diversity in parks,

1632
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,410
that we really need to
think more closely about.

1633
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,030
It's linked to climate change,

1634
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,420
so that a regulatory regime that manages
climate is really essential for a

1635
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,130
longterm effective management
of biological diversity.

1636
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
So that's it for today.

1637
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:12,890
Have a great weekend.
