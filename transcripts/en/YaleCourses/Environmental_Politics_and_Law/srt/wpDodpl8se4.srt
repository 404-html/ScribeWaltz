1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,010
So today I want to explore
the problem that we face,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,230
which is much more than a dilemma.

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,540
I'd say quad lemon in a in a way,

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,790
or a quit lemme have a,

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:15,150
how we manage our future energy demands,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,020
uh,

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,010
and how we invest our resources
in alternative forms of energy.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,220
And I'm going to spend most
of this session talking about,

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,430
uh,

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:23,930
the,

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,790
the possibilities and
limitations of nuclear power.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,480
And this will provide a foundation for,

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,140
uh,

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,060
the lecture on next Tuesday,

15
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:33,760
which will be,

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:33,960
uh,

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
particularly directed at wind,

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,220
uh,

19
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,571
but,

20
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:36,900
uh,

21
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,280
more broadly at renewables.

22
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,350
So first I'd like to,

23
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:40,500
uh,

24
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,170
have you considered the distribution of
nuclear power plants in the world and

25
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,210
really reflect on where
they're not located.

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,141
Uh,

27
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:49,531
and,

28
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:49,620
uh,

29
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,850
they're high concentration,

30
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,060
particularly in the eastern
Midwestern part of the United States,

31
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,550
uh,

32
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,740
but also in Europe.

33
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,800
So within the u s you see that a,

34
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,810
they're really concentrated
up in the northeast,

35
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,351
uh,

36
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,950
but also a south and a nearby Chicago.

37
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,860
And California is quite striking in that,

38
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:07,951
uh,

39
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:12,720
in 1976 of the state of California enacted
a moratorium against new new nuclear

40
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,830
power plant development.

41
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,980
If you look more closely,

42
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:17,610
uh,

43
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:17,971
at,

44
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:18,211
uh,

45
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:18,880
Europe,

46
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,230
uh,

47
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,760
and particularly it at France,

48
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,120
uh,

49
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,840
you can see a very high dependence in
some nations in the European Union on

50
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:25,674
nuclear power.

51
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,890
France now receives approximately 75%
of its power from nuclear plants and

52
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,870
inside the United States also,

53
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:37,020
there's quite a bit of variability
and reliance on nuclear.

54
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,680
Uh,

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,580
so in Connecticut,

56
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,414
for example,

57
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,230
uh,

58
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,610
on nearly a 65% of the power
that we consume in the state,

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,390
it comes from nuclear
nuclear plants in Niantic,

60
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:51,450
which is about a 45
miles to the east of us,

61
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,170
uh,

62
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,730
on the Thames River from the
millstone nuclear power plants.

63
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,300
So it's a quite curious how
different parts of the country,

64
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:00,760
different,

65
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,470
uh,

66
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,771
uh,

67
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:02,700
economies have,

68
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,190
uh,

69
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,480
uh,

70
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,740
treated nuclear power,

71
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,420
uh,

72
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,020
and explaining the cultural predisposition
to accept the risks and accept the

73
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:10,854
costs,

74
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,071
uh,

75
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,330
is not an easy thing to do.

76
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,900
So just so you have an overview of,

77
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,290
of,

78
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,540
uh,

79
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,970
the status of the nuclear
industry in the world.

80
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,250
There are about 434 and 36
different reactors that are
operating in 30 different

81
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,084
countries.

82
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,361
Uh,

83
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,520
50 reactors are now under construction,

84
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,690
uh,

85
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,250
mostly in Asian nations.

86
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:29,920
Uh,

87
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
and within the U S,

88
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,290
uh,

89
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,990
there are proposals for 20 new reactors.

90
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,670
And of these four to eight,

91
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,410
maybe online in 2020,

92
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,311
uh,

93
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,940
China has 11 online at present
with 22 under construction.

94
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,630
And as a nation where nuclear
development is most rapid in the world,

95
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,680
uh,

96
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,700
within the u s,

97
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,090
uh,

98
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,460
the operating licenses that have had,

99
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:50,940
uh,

100
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,660
limits placed on them
of a operating licenses,

101
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,260
uh,

102
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,000
between 30 and 40 years.

103
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,900
Uh,

104
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,000
most of these are going to be
granted operating extensions.

105
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,870
And the concern was that the plant or
the infrastructure would not have the

106
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,730
capability of,

107
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,010
of lasting longer than
40 years at the outside,

108
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,150
but they're finding that,

109
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,391
uh,

110
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:10,721
the,

111
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,021
the,

112
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,410
uh,

113
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,340
engineering integrity of
many of the plants is higher
than they thought it might

114
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,420
be a,

115
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,760
but,

116
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:16,940
uh,

117
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,030
this basically is,

118
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,520
is a,

119
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,910
uh,

120
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,170
a short term lease on,

121
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,470
on the problem of decommissioning
these nuclear plants.

122
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,071
Uh,

123
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,791
and also,

124
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:24,941
uh,

125
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,650
what we'll be talking
about in a few moments,

126
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,280
uh,

127
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
which will be the problem
of managing a nuclear waste.

128
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,120
The MIT report,

129
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,710
the faculty report that was issued in
2003 and then recently updated that we've

130
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,544
asked you to read,

131
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,653
uh,

132
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,860
has some really,

133
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,270
I think important lessons and
conclusions and better within a,

134
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,130
so they concluded that
after five years from 2003,

135
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,360
so this is two years ago,

136
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,270
no new plants are under
construction in the United States,

137
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,180
and insufficient progress has
been made on waste management.

138
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,670
The sober warning is
that if more is not done,

139
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,840
nuclear power will diminish as a practical
and timely option for climate change

140
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,770
risk mitigation.

141
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,620
So as one thinks about,

142
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,330
uh,

143
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,490
uh,

144
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,570
what our options are,

145
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,290
particularly coal as opposed
to investments in renewables,

146
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:11,831
uh,

147
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,930
as opposed to investments
in nuclear power.

148
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,531
You know,

149
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:14,801
one,

150
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,920
one might think about it as
a problem of relative cost,

151
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,521
uh,

152
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:23,521
but you also might think about a relative
risk and ease of bringing a additional

153
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,820
capacity online.

154
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,600
I'll give him,

155
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,770
given the different sources.

156
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,390
Uh,

157
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,260
and underlying this I think is a,

158
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,460
a,

159
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,340
an under,

160
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:30,940
uh,

161
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,340
underestimated a cultural factor,

162
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,240
which is a,

163
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,290
what we worry about in the United
States and our predisposition,

164
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,251
uh,

165
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:39,641
to,

166
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:40,090
uh,

167
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,450
uh,

168
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,230
remember,

169
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,440
uh,

170
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,460
not just Chernobyl,

171
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:44,800
but also what happened
at Three Mile Island.

172
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,480
And in 1979,

173
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,130
the capital costs of constructing
a new plant or are often enormous,

174
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,691
uh,

175
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,650
and because so much can go wrong,

176
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,080
uh,

177
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,913
including,

178
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,660
uh,

179
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,300
construction delays that can
cause interest rates to rise and,

180
00:04:59,301 --> 00:04:59,621
and,

181
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,180
uh,

182
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,430
uh,

183
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,400
the amount that has to be paid
back to investors to rise.

184
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,510
It's caused,

185
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:08,920
what's a thought of as a risk premium
being put on investment funds.

186
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,280
So a banks or private investment
companies often will loan the money to a

187
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,980
utility company that wants
to build a new plant,

188
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,510
but they will do so at a higher rate
when it's measured by a kilowatt hour.

189
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,861
And,

190
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,390
uh,

191
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,520
uh,

192
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,810
so there's about a 2 cent per kilowatt
hour difference between nuclear,

193
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,320
uh,

194
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,090
compared to coal and natural gas,

195
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,510
uh,

196
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,890
which makes this a very,

197
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,390
very expensive proposition.

198
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,490
Basically the money costs more.

199
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:37,960
Uh,

200
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,250
the leg,

201
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,750
a legal and regulatory structure that
surrounds a nuclear power is a rather

202
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,584
complex,

203
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:44,950
uh,

204
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,610
the,

205
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:45,761
uh,

206
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,500
initial statute that govern,

207
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,480
uh,

208
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,821
what,

209
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:49,480
uh,

210
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,721
uh,

211
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:54,721
now exists was the atomic energy act back
in 1954 that we discussed a bit during

212
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,340
the beginning of the term when we were
talking about the atmospheric weapons

213
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,120
testing.

214
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,511
But you know,

215
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,210
recall that the technology that the,

216
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,270
the science and Engineering
Foundation for nuclear power plants,

217
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,570
it really evolved out of the
nuclear weapons development program.

218
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,080
Uh,

219
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,820
so many of the nuclear power plants,

220
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,340
uh,

221
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,541
uh,

222
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:11,901
that,

223
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:12,734
uh,

224
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,120
were the earliest versions,

225
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,510
uh,

226
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,700
say at Hanford,

227
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:16,250
uh,

228
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,230
or at a Oak Ridge in Tennessee.

229
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,541
Uh,

230
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,510
these plants were first generation,

231
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,220
but they were designed predominantly,

232
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,670
uh,

233
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,610
to provide enriched
fuel for atomic weapons.

234
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,080
This defines both state and
federal authority concerning
nuclear nuclear energy.

235
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,650
Uh,

236
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,700
and it really,

237
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:31,941
uh,

238
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:32,541
was the,

239
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,000
uh,

240
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,380
uh,

241
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,400
the watershed that,

242
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,731
that,

243
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,180
uh,

244
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,480
uh,

245
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,470
ended the monopoly,

246
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:39,020
the government monopoly
on nuclear technology.

247
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,810
And it gave the private sector
a role in nuclear development,

248
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,810
uh,

249
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,390
and it expressly prohibited states
from any role in transfer delivery,

250
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:48,470
receipt acquisition,

251
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:52,340
possession or use a of nuclear materials.

252
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,340
And it also gave the
Atomic Energy Commission,

253
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:55,730
uh,

254
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,860
the exclusive authority
to manage these issues.

255
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,530
Uh,

256
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,140
and what,

257
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,610
what is interesting about the history of,

258
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,230
of the AEC is that they were both
the promoters of the technology,

259
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,790
the developers of the technology,

260
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,240
uh,

261
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,040
and they were supposed
to be the regulators.

262
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,911
So the,

263
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:11,170
uh,

264
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,220
the Fox watching the hen house,

265
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,054
so to speak,

266
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,763
and,

267
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,310
uh,

268
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,420
this was recognized,

269
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:17,720
uh,

270
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,380
uh,

271
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,890
uh,

272
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,120
quite early in the history of the AEC
when Congress decided to break off the

273
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:25,700
responsibilities
associated with regulation,

274
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,241
uh,

275
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:26,750
to,

276
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,140
to,

277
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,560
uh,

278
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,410
have a higher probability of safety
and environmental protection,

279
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,020
uh,

280
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,030
and worker safety,

281
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,810
uh,

282
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,410
so that the nuclear regulatory commission
was given these responsibilities.

283
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,690
So this is an independent agency now that,

284
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,350
uh,

285
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,920
uh,

286
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,000
has commissioners assigned to it that
make choices about issuing licensing

287
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,360
decisions and about,

288
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,040
uh,

289
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,650
safety violations or
environmental violations,

290
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,101
uh,

291
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:54,101
associated with the industry so that a
states have retained the authority over

292
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,770
electric power generation
sale and transmission.

293
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,600
And another aspect of,

294
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,340
of the development of
the nuclear industry,

295
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:02,570
which is important to know,

296
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,021
uh,

297
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:03,610
is that,

298
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:03,681
uh,

299
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:08,150
this is not being protected by
private insurance companies.

300
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,630
Uh,

301
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,550
the price Anderson nuclear industry's
Indemnity Act really holds the industry

302
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,503
harmless,

303
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,060
uh,

304
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,530
uh,

305
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,230
from damage claims in the
event of a serious accident.

306
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,150
And it also sets up a procedure for
compensation or that has criteria that are

307
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:24,110
really pretty clear,

308
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,620
uh,

309
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:24,921
that,

310
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,161
uh,

311
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:25,760
the,

312
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,790
those that claim damage
have to show what it was.

313
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,980
They have to calculate
their monetary loss.

314
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,610
Uh,

315
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,790
and they also have to
demonstrate causality,

316
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,300
uh,

317
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,601
that,

318
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:35,841
uh,

319
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,440
is,

320
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,771
is,

321
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,030
uh,

322
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,251
you know,

323
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,970
route relatively easy to demonstrate in
this case because of a specific isotope

324
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,170
mixed your signature that
would come from any sort of a,

325
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,110
a,

326
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,340
a,

327
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,680
a nuclear explosion or,

328
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:48,514
or an accident.

329
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,960
So the nuclear regulatory
commission was created in 1974.

330
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,080
Now,

331
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,370
you can imagine also that,

332
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:56,880
uh,

333
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,713
many states,

334
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,080
uh,

335
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,350
might be more worried about
nuclear power than a other states.

336
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,900
And California is really a
pretty good example of that.

337
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:04,831
So that,

338
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:05,260
uh,

339
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,510
the 1976,

340
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:10,350
the state of California created a
moratorium on new nuclear power plant

341
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,184
construction.

342
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:11,690
Uh,

343
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,940
so states might have the
authority to do that.

344
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,370
Uh,

345
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,330
and until the federal government
approved a methods to dispose of,

346
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,350
of high level waste,

347
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,573
uh,

348
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,400
the state of California was
really quite concerned about,

349
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:23,770
uh,

350
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,060
uh,

351
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,060
what the longterm costs might be to manage
that waste and also what the longterm

352
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,690
costs might be associated with
decommissioning the plant.

353
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,820
So the Pacific gas and
electric company argued that a,

354
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:41,070
the congression congressional intent
intent to preempt state regulation of the

355
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:45,120
nuclear industry was implicit
in the Atomic Energy Act.

356
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,781
A cell,

357
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:46,081
again,

358
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,470
preemption is a critical,

359
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,750
a legal tool,

360
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,171
uh,

361
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:49,501
that,

362
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,334
uh,

363
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:50,700
uh,

364
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,830
the industry relied upon
in order to a claim that a,

365
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:58,380
the state of California did not have
authority to create this moratorium.

366
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,860
So the Supreme Court
eventually ruled on this case.

367
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,630
And it's finding is quite interesting.

368
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,141
Uh,

369
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:08,430
the federal government possesses exclusive
with regulatory regulatory authority

370
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:12,510
over construction and operation of
nuclear facilities and over radiological

371
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,290
safety.

372
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,410
And the states hold authority
over decisions concerning
the need for additional

373
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,640
generating facilities,

374
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,750
licensing rate,

375
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,170
making,

376
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,250
land use and planning.

377
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,620
And the Supreme Court argue that federal
law would preempt the moratorium if it

378
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,120
was related to safety concerns.

379
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,950
So that's an interesting idea.

380
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,031
The federal government,

381
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:30,360
uh,

382
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,710
would be the expert,

383
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,100
uh,

384
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,130
experts in the area of risk assessment
and environmental assessment.

385
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:35,971
Thank you.

386
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:36,241
Emily.

387
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:36,870
Jack Scott,

388
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,980
you seem to be,

389
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,630
had been quite successful.

390
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,883
Persuasive.

391
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,271
Uh,

392
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:42,841
so that,

393
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,650
uh,

394
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,540
if it's related to safety concerns,

395
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,680
the court argued that,

396
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,340
uh,

397
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,240
California did not have the authority
to establish a moratorium because it was

398
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:54,180
worried about the health effects
or environmental dangers,

399
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,680
but it concluded the federal law would
not preempt a moratorium if California,

400
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,660
his logic was based on economics.

401
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,100
Uh,

402
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,960
so if they were worried about
cost considerations down the road.

403
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,520
So a very interesting distinction,

404
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,000
uh,

405
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,301
that,

406
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:06,510
uh,

407
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,830
allowed this moratorium,

408
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,160
uh,

409
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,720
to,

410
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,553
uh,

411
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,940
sustain a California,

412
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:14,070
his assertion that the legislature
at an act of the moratorium,

413
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:17,610
a moratorium based upon the
economic concerns was eventually,

414
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,510
uh,

415
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,343
accepted.

416
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,011
So that,

417
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,844
uh,

418
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,420
the nuclear waste policy
act of 1982 is important,

419
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:24,870
uh,

420
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,040
because most nuclear waste had
been and is now being stored,

421
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,910
uh,

422
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,130
in or nearby nuclear power plants.

423
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
So it's highly dispersed
around the country.

424
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,500
Uh,

425
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,860
think back on the u s map that I showed
you where the different dots of the

426
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:38,760
location of plants,

427
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,110
that's where the nuclear,

428
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,290
uh,

429
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,160
spent fuel.

430
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,430
The fuel rods that are
highly radioactive active,

431
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:44,770
uh,

432
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,280
are being stored within Connecticut.

433
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,570
This would include the,

434
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,330
a Haddam neck nuclear power
plant that's now been closed,

435
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:51,750
uh,

436
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,070
that's about 20 miles from a Yale,

437
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,520
uh,

438
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,060
to the east.

439
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,400
And it would also include
the three millstone plants,

440
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:57,821
uh,

441
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,660
over a Niantic.

442
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,251
So that,

443
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:00,480
uh,

444
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,420
under this statute,

445
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,280
the Department of Energy was granted the,

446
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,550
uh,

447
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,383
authority,

448
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,810
uh,

449
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,810
to begin to centralize a nuclear
fuel reprocessing and a repository.

450
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,050
So basically just a,

451
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:13,600
a,

452
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,831
a,

453
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,900
a storage facility where this,

454
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,360
this waste could be handled
until it might be a reprocessed.

455
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,800
They run open and able to open
the facility and by an amendment,

456
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,790
uh,

457
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,121
the,

458
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:25,480
uh,

459
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,750
uh,

460
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,950
site at Yucca Mountain was,

461
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,310
it was established by a doe,

462
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,250
a to be the single repository.

463
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,250
So you can imagine that if
you were the state of Nevada,

464
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:38,290
you probably would not
be too happy about that.

465
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,370
Uh,

466
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,960
but if you are the state of California,

467
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:41,621
Connecticut,

468
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,930
or any other state that
had nuclear power plants,

469
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,351
uh,

470
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:47,140
you'd be really happy about the prospect
of getting rid of the waste that's

471
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,100
sitting inside your,

472
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,960
your a state boundary.

473
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,090
So this prompted a,

474
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,301
uh,

475
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:53,800
a lot of literally litigation,

476
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,760
uh,

477
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,470
litigation on the partner in Nevada,

478
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:56,831
uh,

479
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:57,101
that,

480
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:57,450
uh,

481
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:57,670
uh,

482
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,250
did not want the repository
to be located there.

483
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,580
Uh,

484
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,290
and litigation on the
part of other states,

485
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,460
including the state of Washington,

486
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:07,420
most recently arguing that they
wanted their ways taken to this,

487
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,290
this power plant.

488
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:08,941
And that,

489
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:09,041
uh,

490
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:13,090
the Obama administration did not
have the right to decide that,

491
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:13,241
uh,

492
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:13,840
this,

493
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,081
this,

494
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:14,190
uh,

495
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,590
process,

496
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:14,890
uh,

497
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,890
the storage facilities should not open a,

498
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,660
when one thinks about the location
of either the plants or the storage

499
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:23,494
facilities,

500
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,800
you need to think carefully
about evacuation requirements.

501
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,491
Uh,

502
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:32,050
so before the Three Mile Island
accident in Pennsylvania,

503
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,330
the emergency response plans,

504
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:34,750
uh,

505
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,080
by nuclear power plants in
the U S we're voluntary.

506
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,310
That's quite striking.

507
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,150
Uh,

508
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,871
given what a,

509
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,280
the Atomic Energy Commission,

510
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:42,760
uh,

511
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,260
and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
understood about the potential for these

512
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,094
new clients to,

513
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,083
to move,

514
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,451
uh,

515
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:52,180
over long distances being
transported in the air.

516
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,791
Now the,

517
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,070
uh,

518
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,800
the plans have to cover a 10 mile radius.

519
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,140
Now think about that 10 miles.

520
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,160
Would that be sufficient?

521
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,671
Well,

522
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:04,090
we're about 20 miles from the
nearest nuclear power plant here.

523
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,600
Uh,

524
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,900
but if you think about the Indian point
nuclear power plant outside of New York

525
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:08,600
City,

526
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,890
uh,

527
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,311
then you,

528
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:12,940
you need to think about the capacity
to move tens of millions of people,

529
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,601
uh,

530
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:18,550
away from a zone that would likely be
highly contaminated in the event of a

531
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:23,500
meltdown or an explosion or a serious
fire such as existed at three mile island

532
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,360
or a Chernobyl.

533
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,530
So the nuclear facility prompted,

534
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:29,670
uh,

535
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,000
Governor Pataki to commission a report
to evaluate the evacuation plan,

536
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:34,931
uh,

537
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:38,080
and criticized the communication
between local agencies,

538
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,470
the size of the area that affected
that would be effected by a release,

539
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,071
uh,

540
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,860
and the plans premises that
are not orderly evacuation,

541
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:45,401
uh,

542
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,020
rather than mass panic would likely.

543
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,800
And Sue,

544
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,170
it's kind of interesting because
if you drive around Connecticut,

545
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,650
uh,

546
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,990
within 10 miles of the
nuclear power plants,

547
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,360
occasionally you'll,

548
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,680
you'll see a sign on the side of the road,

549
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,060
sometimes very rural roads,

550
00:14:59,330 --> 00:14:59,521
uh,

551
00:14:59,521 --> 00:14:59,740
that,

552
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,051
that,

553
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:00,410
uh,

554
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,620
notify the public that this is
part of an evacuation route,

555
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,110
uh,

556
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,360
in the event of,

557
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,091
of a,

558
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:07,040
a nuclear accident.

559
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,660
So that,

560
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:08,850
uh,

561
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,150
the capacity to,

562
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:10,271
uh,

563
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:13,760
to move people away from a contaminated
zone to be able to predict,

564
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,330
well,

565
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,790
how that zone might vary
given weather patterns,

566
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,380
it really is quite limited.

567
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:18,980
Uh,

568
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,980
also there was no consideration of the
probability or a likelihood of a tour or

569
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:27,260
a terrorist attack at these plants.

570
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:27,591
And,

571
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:27,890
uh,

572
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,611
this raised the,

573
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:28,730
a,

574
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,870
the possibility that,

575
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,330
that,

576
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:30,420
uh,

577
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,060
there ought to be aerial surveillance,

578
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,451
uh,

579
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:32,721
that,

580
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:32,901
uh,

581
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:33,181
there,

582
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:37,600
there ought to be planes that are flying
nearby these nuclear power plants as

583
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:37,820
there.

584
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,653
There was,

585
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,380
uh,

586
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,620
shortly after the nine 11
terrorist attack in New York,

587
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,870
so that the commission,

588
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,111
uh,

589
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,620
reported that any plant adjacent to high
population area should have different

590
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:50,660
requirements than plants
otherwise situated.

591
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,170
Uh,

592
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,460
because protective actions
are more difficult and the
consequences of failure or

593
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:56,540
delay or higher,

594
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,840
and the planning problems are more
serious because of the large population

595
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,710
concentrations.

596
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,953
So,

597
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,140
you know,

598
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,040
jump ahead here.

599
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,170
But the core problem associated with
waste is a radioactive halflife.

600
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,221
Uh,

601
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,220
and the,

602
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:11,601
the,

603
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,080
uh,

604
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,550
key concern is over
plutonium and there are 270,

605
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,330
uh,

606
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,051
tons of,

607
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:23,051
of separated plutonium from reprocessing
a of a fuel rods around the world that

608
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,800
now are sitting at sites,

609
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,400
uh,

610
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,480
and being stored.

611
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,900
And it has a half life
of roughly 24,000 years.

612
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,560
So when engineers and a safety experts,

613
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:38,330
we're thinking about the problem
posed by a Yucca Mountain,

614
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,020
uh,

615
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,220
this is the mountain in Nevada,

616
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:40,731
uh,

617
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:41,181
where the,

618
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,470
the storage facility,

619
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:42,920
uh,

620
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,920
has been partially constructed using
about $9 billion of taxpayers' money.

621
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,130
Uh,

622
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,781
so that the,

623
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:49,931
the,

624
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:54,931
the problem really here was how do
you ensure the integrity of a storage

625
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:58,790
facility for nearly a million years.

626
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,601
Uh,

627
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,000
and the,

628
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:01,190
uh,

629
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,620
they chose this site
because of its remoteness.

630
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,580
Poor Nevada member of Nevada was also
the site of the atmospheric weapons

631
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:08,250
testing,

632
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,140
a facility,

633
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,930
the largest and most
often used in the u s uh,

634
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,290
and they designed a machine
that would bore into the Rock,

635
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,741
uh,

636
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:16,071
and,

637
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:16,370
uh,

638
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,203
create a,

639
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,150
a,

640
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,983
a,

641
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:19,910
uh,

642
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,500
tunnel within which,

643
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:21,950
uh,

644
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,520
either,

645
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,870
uh,

646
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,270
uh,

647
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,550
canisters would be
stored as dry fuel or a,

648
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:28,250
they could be stored in water.

649
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,171
So the,

650
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:32,660
the fuel is highly radioactive and
it's cooled and pools of water,

651
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,171
uh,

652
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:34,520
or in these dry casks.

653
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,121
And,

654
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:35,440
uh,

655
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,500
it's currently stored at
66 sites in the u s uh,

656
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:42,080
this is what one of the storage
facilities might look like in that,

657
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:42,861
to honeycombed,

658
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,300
uh,

659
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,780
uh,

660
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,120
uh,

661
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,330
set of boxes that you can barely see
in the bottom of the pool over here.

662
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:47,730
Uh,

663
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,530
that's how they store the,

664
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:49,621
uh,

665
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,361
the fuel rods.

666
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,420
So side by side,

667
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,281
by the way,

668
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,130
it also creates a radioactive water,

669
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,461
uh,

670
00:17:56,461 --> 00:18:00,990
so that the amount of liquid waste that
is contaminated is far larger and volume

671
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:01,290
than,

672
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:01,561
than,

673
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:01,890
uh,

674
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,810
the amount of,

675
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,950
of waste that is either low
level or high level waste.

676
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,350
So it was also curious that,

677
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,980
uh,

678
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,980
if you're projecting out a risk management
strategy over tens of thousands or

679
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,860
hundreds of thousands of years,

680
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,101
you know,

681
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:22,101
what happens if something occurs and a
society no longer speaks a language that,

682
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:23,471
uh,

683
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:23,780
is,

684
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,960
is understood today.

685
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,771
Uh,

686
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,011
you know,

687
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:26,531
what if a,

688
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:26,700
uh,

689
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,560
some massive accident occurred,

690
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,371
nuclear war,

691
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:30,000
whatever it,

692
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,840
whatever it is,

693
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,070
uh,

694
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,371
that,

695
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:32,800
uh,

696
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,120
uh,

697
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,541
leads,

698
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:33,790
uh,

699
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,140
uh,

700
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,170
whatever society exists that
stumbles across this plant,

701
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:37,591
uh,

702
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:38,490
to recognize it.

703
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,420
Kind of interesting.

704
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:39,871
It was a,

705
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:39,961
a,

706
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,790
in a way it was a labeling issue.

707
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,211
Uh,

708
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:42,660
how do you,

709
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,900
how do you communicate risks?

710
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,030
Uh,

711
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,420
not using a language but
using symbols instead.

712
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,051
So,

713
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:49,111
uh,

714
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:53,220
the Department of Energy Commission to
anthropologists to think about different

715
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:57,090
forms of symbolism and they
went back and looked at at,

716
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,331
uh,

717
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:58,170
what symbols,

718
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,741
uh,

719
00:18:58,741 --> 00:18:59,450
would,

720
00:18:59,450 --> 00:18:59,940
uh,

721
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,510
best,

722
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:00,810
uh,

723
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,050
convey the idea that there was
something extremely dangerous nearby,

724
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,440
uh,

725
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,400
or to stay away.

726
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,421
And,

727
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:06,840
uh,

728
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:06,961
uh,

729
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:07,780
the symbolism,

730
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,230
uh,

731
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,870
uh,

732
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,211
that,

733
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:09,720
uh,

734
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,630
is chosen is not represented here.

735
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,021
Uh,

736
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:13,411
but the,

737
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:13,501
uh,

738
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:18,060
the nuclear symbols that you see in the
upper right hand side of this slide are

739
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:19,410
those that are commonly used,

740
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,880
uh,

741
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,240
by the nuclear industry.

742
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,630
Uh,

743
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,250
but you can imagine that if you'd never,

744
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:23,720
uh,

745
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:23,910
uh,

746
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,640
if you did not know the culture today,

747
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,030
uh,

748
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,470
if you'd never seen any,

749
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:29,470
any assemble on,

750
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:30,510
on the side of a truck,

751
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:31,141
for example,

752
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:35,090
sometimes trucks have some
of these symbols that you
wouldn't have any idea with

753
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,993
what this meant.

754
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,460
The symbols on the lower
right are symbols that,

755
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,560
that are,

756
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,710
are commonly applied,

757
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,070
uh,

758
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,170
for industrial and worker safety,

759
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,100
uh,

760
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,940
situations.

761
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,400
Uh,

762
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,380
where as a symbol on the,

763
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,250
on the left is,

764
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:47,780
uh,

765
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:47,970
uh,

766
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,510
several,

767
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,343
uh,

768
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,550
several hundred years old.

769
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,491
So that a,

770
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,070
I mentioned a lawsuit
this most recent lawsuit,

771
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:56,251
uh,

772
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:57,084
this year,

773
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,240
uh,

774
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,410
the spring by Washington state
versus the Department of Energy was,

775
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,070
uh,

776
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,130
designed to encourage the federal
government to keep the Yucca mountain

777
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,050
repository viable.

778
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
So the Attorney General Mckenna,

779
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,120
uh,

780
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,600
made the right decision to file
this lawsuit today to stop the Obama

781
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,920
Administration from closing
down Yucca Mountain.

782
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,250
Now,

783
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,100
another problem with nuclear power is,

784
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,700
uh,

785
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,270
the potential for proliferation
of nuclear weapons.

786
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,120
So,

787
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,210
uh,

788
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,800
one might think that we need to think
about an international strategy,

789
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,340
uh,

790
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,580
to control the distribution of,

791
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,210
of nuclear fuel.

792
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,700
So a nuclear,

793
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,270
uh,

794
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,870
processed,

795
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,020
uh,

796
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,390
nuclear fuel could be further enrich to,

797
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:39,780
to,

798
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,111
to,

799
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:40,201
uh,

800
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,720
form a weapon grade,

801
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,291
uh,

802
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:43,621
that,

803
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:43,890
uh,

804
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,280
could,

805
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,720
could produce nuclear weapons.

806
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,370
So the International Atomic Energy Agency,

807
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:48,941
uh,

808
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:49,900
and several other,

809
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,590
uh,

810
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,510
private organizations banded together to,

811
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:52,961
to,

812
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:53,420
uh,

813
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:53,590
uh,

814
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,530
encourage the creation
of a nuclear fuel bank,

815
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,010
uh,

816
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,310
so that the ga has been proposed to,

817
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,420
to constitute this bank and be responsible
for the dissemination of nuclear

818
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:05,080
fuel.

819
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,621
And then four,

820
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:08,620
it's a recovery once it's spent,

821
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,190
uh,

822
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,023
in this way,

823
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,580
they would have a collaborative,

824
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:12,970
uh,

825
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,320
attempt to try to,

826
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:14,980
uh,

827
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,813
uh,

828
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,281
to,

829
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:16,361
uh,

830
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:16,841
manage,

831
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,350
uh,

832
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,681
uh,

833
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:18,514
the fuel.

834
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,823
Uh,

835
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,400
thinking also about the MIT faculties
conclusions regarding safety.

836
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,360
Uh,

837
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,470
they ended their report saying that
parallel with improved operations,

838
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:29,890
uh,

839
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,570
the safety record of the nuclear industry
has really been quite remarkable in

840
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:35,530
the last 20 years.

841
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,221
Uh,

842
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:41,221
and that plays the nuclear power industry
displays by far the highest capacity

843
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:44,500
factor among all generation technologies,

844
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,520
providing now about 20% of the
u s elect a electrical supply.

845
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,401
Uh,

846
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:49,991
so that,

847
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:50,530
uh,

848
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:50,910
uh,

849
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,040
that the belief is that the,

850
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,471
the,

851
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:54,040
uh,

852
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,970
most reactors,

853
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,240
uh,

854
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,710
particularly the latest
generation reactors have the
capacity to operate safely,

855
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,630
uh,

856
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,151
that the,

857
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:01,241
uh,

858
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:05,290
the probability of bringing them online
in a way that would make a significant

859
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,080
difference,

860
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,370
uh,

861
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,203
in,

862
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,220
in the world with respect to,

863
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,271
to,

864
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:10,750
uh,

865
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:10,941
uh,

866
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:11,774
affects of,

867
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,500
uh,

868
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,300
uh,

869
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,640
energy consumption or climate change is,

870
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,930
is really quite limited.

871
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,513
So that,

872
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,000
uh,

873
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,770
with respect to the enrichment problem,

874
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,281
uh,

875
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:22,120
for example,

876
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,560
uranium when it's mind,

877
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,533
uh,

878
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,190
is a approximately 0.7%,

879
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:28,720
a uranium two 35,

880
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,290
but it needs to,

881
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,730
to,

882
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:30,940
uh,

883
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,940
have that increased to four to 5%
in order for it to be a usable,

884
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,291
as,

885
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,980
as fuel in a nuclear power plant,

886
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,030
uh,

887
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,440
compared to 20%,

888
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:41,950
uh,

889
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,251
uh,

890
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:44,800
that it has to be for a nuclear devices.

891
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,791
Now,

892
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,080
the Three Mile Island,

893
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,740
uh,

894
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,020
example in 1979 created a,

895
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,380
uh,

896
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,100
quite a,

897
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,320
uh,

898
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,050
a bit of alarm in the United States.

899
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:53,770
Uh,

900
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,770
and it was also a time when a movie
came out called the China Syndrome.

901
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:00,770
Uh,

902
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,780
that dramatized,

903
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:02,020
uh,

904
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,680
the,

905
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,011
the,

906
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:03,220
uh,

907
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,053
effects of,

908
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,250
of a nuclear accident in an urban area.

909
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,350
And the nuclear,

910
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,950
uh,

911
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,630
facility at Three Mile Island,

912
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,630
I experienced what was
about a 60% meltdown.

913
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,440
And,

914
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,670
you know,

915
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,450
like most major accidents,

916
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:17,380
whether or not it's the,

917
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:17,830
uh,

918
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,921
uh,

919
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:21,040
the space shuttle blew up or the,

920
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,581
the,

921
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:21,790
uh,

922
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,530
Bhopal incident in India where a testimate
to that more than a hundred thousand

923
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,820
people were killed in a,

924
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,460
in a chemical plant explosion,

925
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,011
uh,

926
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:31,570
or,

927
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,560
or ensure noble.

928
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,370
Uh,

929
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,580
many people think about
the problem being assigned,

930
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,390
uh,

931
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,390
to and,

932
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:38,920
uh,

933
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,360
cause by technical failure,

934
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,070
a technology failure,

935
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:42,711
uh,

936
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:43,810
the hardware failure,

937
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,200
uh,

938
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,033
when in,

939
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,570
it's almost always human failure,

940
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
human failure to monitor
equipment effectively.

941
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:56,201
And that was certainly the case at three
mile island when a worker's mistook the

942
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:01,511
need to open a valve to allow cooling
water to go in and a cool down the fuel

943
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:02,894
rods that were,

944
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,763
were heating up.

945
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,420
So both Paul,

946
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,170
it was a problem of gauges with
the space shuttle blowing up.

947
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,040
It was a problem of,

948
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,720
of Miss Recognizing the,

949
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:11,841
uh,

950
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:15,080
the heat shield tiles that had fallen off,

951
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:15,441
uh,

952
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:15,861
and that,

953
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:16,694
uh,

954
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,730
we're highly temperature sensitive
so that the shuttle took off during a

955
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,390
temperature conditions that,

956
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:23,920
uh,

957
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,020
uh,

958
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,070
some recognized,

959
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:25,550
uh,

960
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,480
made a dangerous.

961
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,520
So the,

962
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,543
Eh,

963
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,600
the case history that is most important,

964
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,040
I think for us to think about,

965
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,551
uh,

966
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:37,220
which caused the greatest
amount of environmental damage,

967
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:37,731
uh,

968
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:40,430
in history were with respect
to a nuclear power plant,

969
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,050
uh,

970
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,610
occurred at the Chernobyl
plant in Pripyat.

971
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,780
Uh,

972
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,351
then the,

973
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:45,680
uh,

974
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:45,801
uh,

975
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:46,491
Soviet,

976
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:46,930
uh,

977
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,740
uh,

978
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,500
uh,

979
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,333
uh,

980
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,260
then within the Soviet Union.

981
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:51,951
And,

982
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:52,340
uh,

983
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,340
this occurred in April of 1986 and a
occurred during a yearly maintenance

984
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,454
operation,

985
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,121
uh,

986
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:02,600
where they were pursuing a
gradual power reduction and a,

987
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,660
they basically lost control of their,

988
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,820
of their maintenance efforts.

989
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,640
And the control rods
were removed to quickly.

990
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,241
Uh,

991
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:13,340
and then the power shot,

992
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,030
uh,

993
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,540
uh,

994
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,990
back down to low and,

995
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:16,521
and the,

996
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:16,920
uh,

997
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,120
uh,

998
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,080
water and the plant,

999
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:18,914
uh,

1000
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:19,520
uh,

1001
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:19,941
was,

1002
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:20,280
uh,

1003
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,361
uh,

1004
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,160
turned in improper direction.

1005
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,030
Uh,

1006
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,400
the workers were confused
about what to do.

1007
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:25,940
Uh,

1008
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,980
the power surge 1500 times,

1009
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,580
uh,

1010
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,530
it's safe level within five seconds.

1011
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,550
And a steel shield on
the roof of the building,

1012
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,000
uh,

1013
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,980
was blown into the sky and a,

1014
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:41,570
the entire facility caught fire
for a period of several weeks.

1015
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,300
So four days later,

1016
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,360
after the Soviet Union had
maintained their silence,

1017
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,991
uh,

1018
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:51,710
the government announced an accident has
occurred at the Trenoble atomic power

1019
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:52,370
station.

1020
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,380
One of the nuclear
reactors has been damaged.

1021
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,740
Measures are being taken to eliminate
the consequences of the accident.

1022
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,980
Eight is being given to the victims
and the government commission has been

1023
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:01,814
established.

1024
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,240
So anyone who knows anything
about industrial accidents
or nuclear power plants

1025
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:08,570
would recognize that,

1026
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,280
that,

1027
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,000
uh,

1028
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,310
uh,

1029
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,470
being able to warn the public,

1030
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:12,830
uh,

1031
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,300
immediately after an accident,

1032
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:14,841
uh,

1033
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,130
was exceptionally important.

1034
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,020
The only nuclear,

1035
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,540
uh,

1036
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,400
event that,

1037
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,150
uh,

1038
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,481
uh,

1039
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:24,360
this could be compared
to was one at Windscale.

1040
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,210
Now known as tele field in the
northern part of Great Britain,

1041
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,750
where in the 1956,

1042
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,500
uh,

1043
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
there was a fire in the plant,

1044
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,511
uh,

1045
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:39,650
and a significant amount of radiation
was released into the air and the workers

1046
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:44,651
of the plant went out and commandeered
the tractors and cars of farmers that

1047
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,230
lived in the surrounding area.

1048
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,760
And the farmers were standing in their
field watching these workers basically

1049
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:51,680
drive away in a,

1050
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,820
in a caravan as quickly as they could,

1051
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,331
uh,

1052
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:54,871
so that,

1053
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:55,021
uh,

1054
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,400
they could reduce their exposure.

1055
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:56,971
Again,

1056
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:57,990
no government warning,

1057
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,620
uh,

1058
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,453
no,

1059
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,361
no,

1060
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:00,740
uh,

1061
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:00,930
uh,

1062
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,000
attempts to evacuate the area.

1063
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,451
Uh,

1064
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:04,020
so that,

1065
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,351
that,

1066
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:04,780
uh,

1067
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:04,950
uh,

1068
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,420
the failure to take action,

1069
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,581
uh,

1070
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:08,130
soon after an accident like this,

1071
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,203
uh,

1072
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,093
uh,

1073
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,870
results in the population
being exposed at the highest,

1074
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:13,350
uh,

1075
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,400
at the highest levels.

1076
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,080
So the Soviets then disclosed a
certain leak of radioactive substances,

1077
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,691
uh,

1078
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:24,060
and then finally told the public
that a 200 people were hospitalized,

1079
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:24,480
uh,

1080
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,730
but the water in the
year in Kiev were safe.

1081
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,190
They were reassuring the public.

1082
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:29,880
In fact,

1083
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,480
at the same time that they were air
force was seeding the clouds in the area

1084
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,930
trying to induce a rain so that it could
wash the radiation from the sky before

1085
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:39,950
it reached the,

1086
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,320
the,

1087
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,720
uh,

1088
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,250
uh,

1089
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:41,730
Soviet,

1090
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,060
uh,

1091
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,893
the Russian state.

1092
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,330
And also to protect the,

1093
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:45,421
uh,

1094
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:46,830
the a reservoir,

1095
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,250
uh,

1096
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:47,551
that,

1097
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:48,020
uh,

1098
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,270
uh,

1099
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,601
is,

1100
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:48,720
uh,

1101
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,530
to the south of,

1102
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,430
or to excuse me,

1103
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:51,870
to the north of Kiev.

1104
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,190
So finally,

1105
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,023
uh,

1106
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,510
President Gorbachev and 86 came
on the news one evening and said,

1107
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,440
good evening comrades.

1108
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:00,660
All of you know that there's
been an incredible misfortune.

1109
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,930
The accident at the Chernobyl plant as
his painfully affected the Soviet people

1110
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,171
in shock,

1111
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,250
the international community.

1112
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,360
And for the first time,

1113
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,970
we confront the real force
of nuclear energy out of,

1114
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,020
out of control.

1115
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,130
There are a variety of different
stories and lessons here,

1116
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,391
but perhaps the,

1117
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:18,740
uh,

1118
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,050
uh,

1119
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:19,700
one that is,

1120
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,220
uh,

1121
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,840
most sad is the way that
a workers were mistreated.

1122
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:25,650
Uh,

1123
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,040
the affects of,

1124
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,420
of,

1125
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:27,660
uh,

1126
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,100
being exposed to radiation,

1127
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,670
uh,

1128
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,500
in the absence of protective gear,

1129
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:31,870
uh,

1130
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,920
was very well known to the Atomic
Energy Commission into the Soviet,

1131
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:35,400
uh,

1132
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,790
uh,

1133
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,390
scientific experts from their
experiences with nuclear weapons.

1134
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,370
But other than potassium
iodide pills and a,

1135
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,430
the normal kind of a,

1136
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,140
uh,

1137
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,120
a suit than a,

1138
00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:46,241
a,

1139
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,170
a fire men might wear as protective gear.

1140
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,680
They were left helpless even
though they were told to a,

1141
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:53,491
to go in and,

1142
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,990
and try to put out the flames,

1143
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,920
uh,

1144
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,371
of the,

1145
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:56,630
uh,

1146
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,790
uh,

1147
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,590
burning,

1148
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,991
uh,

1149
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:59,340
and charring fuel rods.

1150
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,840
So also,

1151
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,190
uh,

1152
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,790
the s the Soviets and others,

1153
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,270
uh,

1154
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,340
misunderstood the pattern of distribution,

1155
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,100
other radionuclides once
they reach the atmosphere.

1156
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,151
So here you see,

1157
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,110
April 26th,

1158
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:10,560
uh,

1159
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,230
the White,

1160
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:11,740
uh,

1161
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,910
that you see in the right
hand side of the upper left,

1162
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,010
uh,

1163
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,350
uh,

1164
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,730
air photo here is demonstrating
the direction of the plume,

1165
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,360
uh,

1166
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,050
by,

1167
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,320
uh,

1168
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,340
April 28,

1169
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:23,870
the plume,

1170
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,350
it reached up over Norway,

1171
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:25,891
Sweden,

1172
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:26,820
and Finland.

1173
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,420
Uh,

1174
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,530
by April 30th.

1175
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,011
Uh,

1176
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:30,150
you can tell that the,

1177
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,180
the plume was being dispersed and being
blown back around northern Europe.

1178
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,090
Uh,

1179
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:36,511
and,

1180
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:36,661
uh,

1181
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:36,901
you know,

1182
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,280
eventually by May 6th,

1183
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:38,761
uh,

1184
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:41,070
it had scattered itself
pretty much all over Europe,

1185
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:41,591
uh,

1186
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:43,780
with a patchy kind of a concentration.

1187
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,800
And you remember the surprise on the
part of the Atomic Energy Commission,

1188
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,250
uh,

1189
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,020
to the patchiness of the fallout,

1190
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,471
uh,

1191
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:50,681
you know,

1192
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,500
finding a,

1193
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,160
a high levels of strontium 90,

1194
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,110
and in New York and Connecticut,

1195
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,741
uh,

1196
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:57,341
when the,

1197
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:58,990
the cloud intersected a rainstorm.

1198
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,500
And this affected us a,

1199
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,110
a fallout pattern that was really
quite similarly a nonuniform,

1200
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,321
uh,

1201
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:06,154
in Europe.

1202
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,670
And it took roughly about 10 days for
this plume to make its way all the way

1203
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:12,700
around the world,

1204
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,091
uh,

1205
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,510
moving across China and then the Pacific
Ocean to reach the United States,

1206
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:16,921
uh,

1207
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:19,940
when it became detectable
in the milk supplies in a,

1208
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,130
in the states such as Utah
and Arizona and in California.

1209
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,031
So that,

1210
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:25,400
uh,

1211
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,830
the sensors that existed,

1212
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,330
uh,

1213
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,410
at that point in time,

1214
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,280
we're picking up contaminants eventually
distributed around the United States

1215
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,230
and eventually the rest of the world.

1216
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,630
So as you look at this map,

1217
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:38,291
you see a,

1218
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:38,950
uh,

1219
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,221
a,

1220
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:39,530
uh,

1221
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:39,730
uh,

1222
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,350
radiation deposition,

1223
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,430
a gradient from lightest
color to darkest color.

1224
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,080
And a what's so striking about it is
that you see the patchiness demonstrated

1225
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,800
here where you have a significant
deposition in Austria,

1226
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,311
uh,

1227
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:58,990
a significant deposition and Finland
and up in both Norway and in Sweden.

1228
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,960
And the distance by the way,

1229
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:02,430
uh,

1230
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,840
is probably about six to 700 miles,

1231
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,290
uh,

1232
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,360
maybe about 800 miles from,

1233
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,140
uh,

1234
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,060
Chernobyl up to,

1235
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,510
to a northern Europe.

1236
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,780
So one thing that this did was it created
a complete chaos in a European food

1237
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:18,274
markets.

1238
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,050
So,

1239
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,540
uh,

1240
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,300
if it reached the ground it was
getting into the food supply,

1241
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,250
while they realize that the
different nations all had separate,

1242
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:26,560
uh,

1243
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,780
radiation standards so that they,

1244
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,550
they did not have a uniform
regulatory system to,

1245
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,280
to protect against a one
nation selling a one commodity,

1246
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:36,761
uh,

1247
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,121
that,

1248
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:37,570
uh,

1249
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:37,900
uh,

1250
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,460
has had a radiation level
that might not receive,

1251
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,140
that might not be accepted by a another
nation that had a tougher standard.

1252
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,353
Also,

1253
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,180
uh,

1254
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,890
the,

1255
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,140
uh,

1256
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,280
detection process.

1257
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:52,180
You can imagine that,

1258
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:52,630
uh,

1259
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,180
the government was slow to
go out and try to figure out,

1260
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,840
uh,

1261
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,290
uh,

1262
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,240
this patchiness with precision and that
had tremendous implications for the

1263
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:03,610
period of exposure by the population.

1264
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,500
So here's a good example of,

1265
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,801
uh,

1266
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:06,201
of,

1267
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:06,670
uh,

1268
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,380
the distributional pattern as it was
being recognized by the Soviet Union back

1269
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,580
in the late 1980s.

1270
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,200
And as they tested more,

1271
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:14,561
uh,

1272
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:19,120
they found more so that this map was
constantly changing in response to,

1273
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,860
to a more rigorous testing.

1274
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,160
So that the different
zones that you see here,

1275
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,670
uh,

1276
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,460
are designated as confiscated areas,

1277
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,320
permanent control areas,

1278
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:29,950
uh,

1279
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,890
period control areas
and unregulated areas.

1280
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,791
So that the,

1281
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:33,910
uh,

1282
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,020
the darkest red,

1283
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:35,310
uh,

1284
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,320
are the confiscated areas so that a lands,

1285
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,710
agricultural lands,

1286
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,610
urban lands,

1287
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,140
uh,

1288
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,400
uh,

1289
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,230
homes,

1290
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,580
residential communities,

1291
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:44,060
uh,

1292
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,470
commercial areas,

1293
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,850
we're literally confiscated so that a
hundreds of thousands of people were moved

1294
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,710
off of their land because the soils,

1295
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,750
uh,

1296
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,650
the plants,

1297
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,190
uh,

1298
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,550
as well as the building materials and
even the vehicles were contaminated.

1299
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,160
Hundreds of thousands of vehicles,

1300
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,610
uh,

1301
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,050
turned into hazardous waste,

1302
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,461
uh,

1303
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:06,290
almost a within a matter of days.

1304
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,570
So what to do with this area.

1305
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,110
What do you do with people that you're
going to pull out of their homes?

1306
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:12,531
Well,

1307
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,740
they had to build new communities and
in some instances they even built new

1308
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:19,160
communities in areas that
were contaminated because
they hadn't tested carefully

1309
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:19,994
enough.

1310
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,360
Kind of interesting because it should
ring bells with you with respect to the

1311
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:27,620
Bikini island history where the Bikinians
were allowed to move back into an area

1312
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,090
that the government supplied a
funds for constructing new homes.

1313
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,300
And then they went in and tested that
more carefully and found that they had to

1314
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:36,134
move out.

1315
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,090
So that the tension here is that the
government will want to limit its own

1316
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:41,924
liability,

1317
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,080
its own costs for evacuating or for
dealing with hazardous waste or for,

1318
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,021
for,

1319
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:48,260
uh,

1320
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,520
rebuilding a community.

1321
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,130
So it has very little incentive
to disclose with precision,

1322
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:56,030
the intensity of,

1323
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:56,610
of,

1324
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:56,950
uh,

1325
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,130
of the concentrations.

1326
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,260
So in this case,

1327
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,801
uh,

1328
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:05,801
the precision grew in response to
international pressure because they were

1329
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:07,000
finding an Apache year,

1330
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,370
the Apache,

1331
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,610
uh,

1332
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,230
uh,

1333
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,580
highly contaminated areas,

1334
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,120
uh,

1335
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,010
in many different,

1336
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,240
uh,

1337
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,370
European communities.

1338
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,610
And those different countries wanted to
have international authority to take the

1339
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,370
Soviet Union to court so that they
could be compensated for their losses as

1340
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:23,204
well.

1341
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,760
The construction workers that we're
trying to put out the fire and then deal

1342
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:29,371
with the,

1343
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:29,460
uh,

1344
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,370
the contaminated areas,

1345
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,360
uh,

1346
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,870
would drive vehicles in a,

1347
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,600
whether they were aircraft,

1348
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:36,530
whether or not they were,

1349
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,100
they were,

1350
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,550
uh,

1351
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,200
cars or trucks such as this.

1352
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,621
Uh,

1353
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:44,090
the workers eventually were suited up
in protective gear and they had to wash

1354
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:49,091
down the vehicles as they left the site
to keep the vehicles from tracking the

1355
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:50,930
radionuclides different parts of,

1356
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,471
of,

1357
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:51,740
uh,

1358
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,760
the effected area.

1359
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,320
I mentioned that agricultural
lands were obviously affected,

1360
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,060
uh,

1361
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,370
especially those within the red
zones on the map that you just saw.

1362
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,370
What do you do with
contaminated lands like this?

1363
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,390
Well,

1364
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,110
you basically have to scrape the surface
off of it and figure out how you're

1365
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:12,440
going to bury the
contaminated material so that,

1366
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,370
uh,

1367
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,240
think about this,

1368
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,263
uh,

1369
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,520
76,000 square kilometers
of contaminated land.

1370
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,870
And what about,

1371
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,110
uh,

1372
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,100
the forest plans?

1373
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,500
What would happen to the timber that,

1374
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:24,900
uh,

1375
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,190
uh,

1376
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,360
we're growing in the area?

1377
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,841
Well,

1378
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,060
they also absorb the radionuclides.

1379
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,040
And many of those trees
are still standing.

1380
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:31,760
Uh,

1381
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,910
and many people would cut
down the contaminated trees,

1382
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,350
cut the timber,

1383
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,110
uh,

1384
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,943
saw it up,

1385
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,510
turn it into building material,

1386
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:40,960
and people would build their houses of it.

1387
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,760
It was a similar analogy to
the way that the uranium mines,

1388
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,893
uh,

1389
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,930
created that,

1390
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,390
uh,

1391
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,871
created,

1392
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:49,330
uh,

1393
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:49,500
uh,

1394
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,821
the,

1395
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:49,980
the,

1396
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,813
the fuel,

1397
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,181
uh,

1398
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:51,690
for,

1399
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,081
for,

1400
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:52,230
uh,

1401
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,063
the power plants,

1402
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,700
uh,

1403
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,930
the way that those minds,

1404
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,770
uh,

1405
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,950
left a waste of uranium mine tailings.

1406
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,491
Uh,

1407
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,600
so what do they do with that?

1408
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,201
Well,

1409
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:01,301
in,

1410
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:02,190
in some instances,

1411
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:06,030
they use the mine tailings as a
construction material for homes,

1412
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,631
uh,

1413
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:06,991
and,

1414
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:07,380
uh,

1415
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,600
particularly on native
American reservations.

1416
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,391
So there's a,

1417
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:15,391
a on a very unhappy and a
costly history of how Navajo's,

1418
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:16,880
uh,

1419
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,160
uh,

1420
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,491
we're,

1421
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:20,130
we're living in homes
that were built from,

1422
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:20,850
from,

1423
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,240
uh,

1424
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,940
cement products that contained a uranium.

1425
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,021
So that,

1426
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:25,141
uh,

1427
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:25,351
the,

1428
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,570
the enormity of,

1429
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:26,960
of,

1430
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,161
uh,

1431
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:27,350
the,

1432
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,890
the effect of the contamination,

1433
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,180
uh,

1434
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,880
was just a beyond anybody's expectation,

1435
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,840
uh,

1436
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,673
cars,

1437
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,670
trucks,

1438
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,080
tanks had to be buried.

1439
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,620
Uh,

1440
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,130
and there are many stories about
how cars would be buried at night.

1441
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,980
They'd be dug up before dawn,

1442
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,173
uh,

1443
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:45,841
and,

1444
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:46,300
uh,

1445
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,470
uh,

1446
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,800
parts from those cars would then be
removed and sold on the black market.

1447
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,290
So you all know that,

1448
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:51,520
uh,

1449
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,140
there's a very robust
used car part market,

1450
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:56,670
uh,

1451
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,020
virtually everywhere in the world.

1452
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,590
Uh,

1453
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,251
so that,

1454
00:36:59,251 --> 00:36:59,610
uh,

1455
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,120
these,

1456
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,130
these radioactive a used parts,

1457
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:02,671
uh,

1458
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:03,504
were brought back,

1459
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,380
recycled back into circulation in Sweden.

1460
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:10,410
It's interesting because the
Swedes found out about this book,

1461
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,920
not because they were notified by
the Soviets or any other nation,

1462
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,700
uh,

1463
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,450
but because their workers showed up
at their nuclear power plants and they

1464
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:22,440
started setting off alarms so that the
power plants in Sweden were shutdown one

1465
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,274
after another,

1466
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,890
but not because there was
a problem at their plant,

1467
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,360
but because the workers were walking
in the door to the plant in the morning

1468
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:30,931
and,

1469
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:31,260
uh,

1470
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,620
uh,

1471
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,430
they had picked up the radionuclides
that have been deposited on the,

1472
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,660
on the streets or the sidewalks,

1473
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,580
uh,

1474
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,000
in a,

1475
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,310
in,

1476
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,143
in Sweden.

1477
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,481
And,

1478
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:39,571
uh,

1479
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:42,120
that contamination had set off the alarms.

1480
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,210
And that's when they started looking at
weather patterns and trying to figure

1481
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:46,680
out what the source might be.

1482
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,420
There was no evidence that a nuclear
weapon had been at detonated a.

1483
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:54,120
So they started looking at the location
and nuclear power plants and were able

1484
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:55,170
to piece together the,

1485
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:55,261
uh,

1486
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:57,630
the weather pattern over
the past several days,

1487
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,140
uh,

1488
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,410
to pinpoint the Trenoble plant so that,

1489
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:01,860
uh,

1490
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,430
within,

1491
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,720
within several days,

1492
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:07,320
the radiation in Sweden was a thousand
times higher than it a previous

1493
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,370
previously had been.

1494
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,910
So I'm going to jump ahead here to,

1495
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:12,744
uh,

1496
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,830
uh,

1497
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,070
uh,

1498
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,660
discussion about evacuation.

1499
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,680
A civil defense officials were finally
able to convince the government and plan

1500
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:20,470
officials,

1501
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,690
uh,

1502
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,510
of the need to,

1503
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,160
to evacuate areas,

1504
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,990
areas that were closest to the plant.

1505
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:25,771
Uh,

1506
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,750
but 36 hours had passed.

1507
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,351
And,

1508
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:28,450
uh,

1509
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:28,891
these are,

1510
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:29,721
if you look at the,

1511
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:30,000
uh,

1512
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,250
the,

1513
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,980
the current charts about,

1514
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,560
uh,

1515
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:32,971
the,

1516
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:36,190
the periodicity of
release of the radiation,

1517
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:40,330
you find that this first 36 hours a was
a crucial period when that population

1518
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:40,571
should,

1519
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:45,130
it should not have been allowed
to stay in the area so that,

1520
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:45,330
uh,

1521
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:45,600
they,

1522
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,433
they really had no,

1523
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,560
they had no plan.

1524
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,060
The government eventually was able to
put together a thousand buses and picked

1525
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:55,420
up first the children and then move
them a hundreds of miles away to,

1526
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:55,930
uh,

1527
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,860
to different camps.

1528
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,640
So,

1529
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:57,940
I mean,

1530
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,230
as they studied the,

1531
00:38:59,231 --> 00:38:59,650
uh,

1532
00:38:59,650 --> 00:38:59,870
the,

1533
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,990
the pattern of deposition,

1534
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,770
they found that their evacuation
zone had been defined too narrowly.

1535
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,350
So the evacuation zone,

1536
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,710
uh,

1537
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,550
had to be continually expanded so that,

1538
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:12,820
uh,

1539
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,960
by May 3rd,

1540
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,471
this was,

1541
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:14,820
uh,

1542
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:14,950
uh,

1543
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,491
only,

1544
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:15,910
uh,

1545
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,361
about,

1546
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:16,720
uh,

1547
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,010
six or seven days later,

1548
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,030
45,000 residents had been evacuated
from a 10 kilometer radius.

1549
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,530
Eventually a 210,000 people were
resettled into a less contaminated areas.

1550
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:29,890
By the way,

1551
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,270
if you take the United States requirement
that every nuclear power plant in our

1552
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,104
nation,

1553
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,100
I have a,

1554
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:36,560
uh,

1555
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,930
an evacuation plan that would cover an
area that is defined by a 10 mile radius.

1556
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,840
And you compare it to the,

1557
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:45,040
the movement of contamination
from this plant.

1558
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,520
Uh,

1559
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,300
you can see the 10 mile radius
in green here compared to the,

1560
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:49,631
the,

1561
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:50,050
uh,

1562
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,291
uh,

1563
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,510
eventual location of the,

1564
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:52,860
uh,

1565
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,140
uh,

1566
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,330
deep red colored confiscation zones.

1567
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,170
Uh,

1568
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,670
I'm more than a hundred miles away,

1569
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,410
so I'm going to jump ahead here
because I'm going to run out of time.

1570
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,121
The safety,

1571
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:04,460
uh,

1572
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:04,601
uh,

1573
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:05,680
regulations vary,

1574
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,580
uh,

1575
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,180
quite,

1576
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,600
uh,

1577
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,370
highly among the different nations,

1578
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,000
uh,

1579
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,100
leading to a chaotic set of bands.

1580
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,940
Uh,

1581
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,340
so that finally the
Europeans decided to ban,

1582
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:17,650
meet live animals and produce from,

1583
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,251
uh,

1584
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,570
all areas within a thousand kilometers of,

1585
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:21,404
of the site.

1586
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:21,920
Uh,

1587
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,080
the economic consequences were
enormous so that the Australia Austrian

1588
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,330
government banned the
import of east block milk,

1589
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:29,290
fruit and vegetables.

1590
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,350
The Dutch agricultural ministry
prohibited cattle grazing.

1591
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,770
The Swiss warned against providing
fresh milk to young children.

1592
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,530
Italy ban the sale of
its own leafy vegetables.

1593
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,131
And,

1594
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:39,370
uh,

1595
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,390
even the u s,

1596
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,720
uh,

1597
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,720
was warning people not to go to several
European nations because of the extent

1598
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:47,080
of the contamination.

1599
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,070
So the economic consequences just
associated with the food supply,

1600
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:51,580
uh,

1601
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,780
and it's contamination,

1602
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,230
uh,

1603
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,000
were far higher than anybody imagined.

1604
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,320
There's also a,

1605
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,760
a sad story about,

1606
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:58,270
uh,

1607
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:58,391
uh,

1608
00:40:58,391 --> 00:40:59,224
the same,

1609
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,970
uh,

1610
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,490
uh,

1611
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,390
indigenous group in northern
Sweden that have long relied upon,

1612
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:05,170
uh,

1613
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,740
the,

1614
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,160
the,

1615
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,520
uh,

1616
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,353
uh,

1617
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:07,990
uh,

1618
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,160
livestock of a reindeer and a
reindeer feed on Moss and Lichen.

1619
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:12,731
And,

1620
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:12,880
uh,

1621
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,680
the radionuclides built up,

1622
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,280
uh,

1623
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,760
heavily and the Moss and Lichen
and were detectable in their meat,

1624
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,301
uh,

1625
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:22,120
within a matter of several
days following the accident.

1626
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,961
So that,

1627
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:23,081
uh,

1628
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,680
the Swedish government decided
that it was going to ban the,

1629
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,051
the,

1630
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:26,131
uh,

1631
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:28,030
the sale of all future products,

1632
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,780
uh,

1633
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,300
from these animals except for,

1634
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:31,810
uh,

1635
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,890
the sale of fors.

1636
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,460
So to,

1637
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,320
to come to a conclusion here,

1638
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,363
I want you to,

1639
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,620
you'll be able to study this slide,

1640
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:39,970
uh,

1641
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:40,430
uh,

1642
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:40,671
uh,

1643
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:41,730
not from a,

1644
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,713
this lecture,

1645
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,010
uh,

1646
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,390
but upon the classes server,

1647
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,261
so that,

1648
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:45,380
uh,

1649
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,800
if you think about the relative amount of,

1650
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,500
of,

1651
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:48,890
uh,

1652
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,220
uh,

1653
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,990
radioactivity that was released by
the first atomic bombs and curious,

1654
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,801
you see the,

1655
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:55,230
uh,

1656
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,620
uh,

1657
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,620
first atomic bombs up here on the top and
Nagasaki and Hiroshima having released

1658
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:03,020
about 250,000 curies,

1659
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,740
uh,

1660
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,260
from atomic weapons testing.

1661
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,300
Totally during that period.

1662
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:08,631
The,

1663
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:09,140
uh,

1664
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,150
the atmospheric weapons testing,

1665
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,230
uh,

1666
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,520
those figures are given here.

1667
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,640
But then if you look
down here at Chernobyl,

1668
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,060
uh,

1669
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,490
you find that the estimates of exposure,

1670
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,270
uh,

1671
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,103
and,

1672
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,470
and the estimates of those
exposed are really quite,

1673
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:24,950
uh,

1674
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,371
uh,

1675
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:26,204
amazing.

1676
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,540
17,400,

1677
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,380
uh,

1678
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,810
fatal cancers were expected.

1679
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:34,790
A mode 2.9 billion people exposed.

1680
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,420
So more than half of the
world's population was
exposed to fall out from this

1681
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:40,100
nuclear power plant explosion,

1682
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,060
uh,

1683
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,361
with,

1684
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:41,520
uh,

1685
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:41,670
uh,

1686
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,670
a very serious estimate of a fatal
cancer outcomes compared to the atomic

1687
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:48,620
weapons testing program.

1688
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,420
Where among everybody,

1689
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:50,720
uh,

1690
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,470
at the time this report was done back
in the 1990s by the national cancer

1691
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,190
institute,

1692
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,160
everybody in the world was
anticipated to have been exposed,

1693
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,780
but only 12,000,

1694
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,300
uh,

1695
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:00,920
uh,

1696
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,620
fatal cancers were expected
from that entire program.

1697
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,791
So that the,

1698
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,170
the magnitude of exposure,

1699
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,870
the magnitude of risk is associated with,

1700
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:09,231
with,

1701
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:09,820
uh,

1702
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,010
uh,

1703
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,180
this kind of a failure,

1704
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:11,480
uh,

1705
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,280
has long been a underestimated.

1706
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,680
Let me leave you,

1707
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:14,980
uh,

1708
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,771
at this,

1709
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:16,604
uh,

1710
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,900
time with one other thought because I
opened the lecture saying that we're

1711
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,810
facing a very difficult decision
among how to allocate our,

1712
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:24,411
our,

1713
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:24,740
uh,

1714
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,010
uh,

1715
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:29,060
resources and investments
in different kinds of fuels.

1716
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,050
Uh,

1717
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:34,040
and I want you to think too about the
relative risk associated with coal fired

1718
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:34,874
power plants.

1719
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:35,930
Uh,

1720
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,390
we don't have too much
time to talk about coal,

1721
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,390
but coal produces a,

1722
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,680
not just a sulfur and nitrogen
oxides produces particulates,

1723
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,230
uh,

1724
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,770
and particulates
particularly in combination,

1725
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,350
particularly,

1726
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:49,851
particularly,

1727
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:50,684
sorry,

1728
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,880
particularly particularly
it's in combination,

1729
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,300
uh,

1730
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,290
with the sulfates,

1731
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:54,890
uh,

1732
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,870
pose a very serious health threat.

1733
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,910
And many people don't realize that between
20,000 and 60,000 premature deaths in

1734
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:06,590
the United States alone every year are
now attributable to coal fired power

1735
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,990
plants on a world scale.

1736
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,240
And the number is far more significant.

1737
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,900
So these are deaths that
are premature deaths,

1738
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:15,980
particularly among,

1739
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,550
uh,

1740
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,970
those that have a background
conditions of cardiovascular illness,

1741
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,430
uh,

1742
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,263
or,

1743
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:21,891
or,

1744
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:22,210
uh,

1745
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:22,970
uh,

1746
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:23,550
uh,

1747
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:23,711
uh,

1748
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:26,170
other kinds of a respiratory illnesses.

1749
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,810
So that premature deaths from this form
of energy are far higher than it ever

1750
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:33,781
been.

1751
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:35,230
A counted for,

1752
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,490
uh,

1753
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,920
with respect to the nuclear industry,

1754
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,520
so that the,

1755
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:39,780
uh,

1756
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,590
uh,

1757
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:41,040
uh,

1758
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,761
coal has,

1759
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:42,240
uh,

1760
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,420
uh,

1761
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,840
this image of being a,

1762
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,820
a relatively safe fuel
compared to nuclear power.

1763
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:48,210
Uh,

1764
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,560
but I'm hoping to get you to,

1765
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,670
to rethink that.

1766
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:51,420
Uh,

1767
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,950
the nuclear waste issue I think is
an overwhelmingly persuasive to me,

1768
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,460
uh,

1769
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,960
that the nuclear industry,

1770
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:58,831
uh,

1771
00:44:58,831 --> 00:45:00,540
should not be seriously encouraged.

1772
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,171
And,

1773
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:01,411
uh,

1774
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:01,620
I,

1775
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:01,981
I,

1776
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:02,450
uh,

1777
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:02,820
uh,

1778
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,840
am disappointed and a surprise by
the Obama administration support,

1779
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:06,990
uh,

1780
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,460
that came out to just a few,

1781
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,200
a few weeks ago for it.

1782
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,951
Uh,

1783
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:14,820
and on next Tuesday we'll be talking
about the future of renewables in

1784
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:18,900
particularly the different kinds of
legal strategies that have been employed,

1785
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,470
uh,

1786
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,970
including tax strategies,

1787
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,410
different subsidies,

1788
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,700
uh,

1789
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,240
different kinds of credit systems,

1790
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:24,690
uh,

1791
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,523
in order to,

1792
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,521
to,

1793
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:26,670
uh,

1794
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,503
try to,

1795
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:27,721
uh,

1796
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,351
increase,

1797
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:28,890
uh,

1798
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,090
human investment in,

1799
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,460
in,

1800
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,020
uh,

1801
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,010
renewable sources.

1802
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:32,970
So a,

1803
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,070
have a great weekend
and enjoy the weather.
