1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,450
Today,

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:06,090
I want to continue talking about a tobacco
because tobacco law is a paradigm for

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,200
many other problems that,

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:07,800
uh,

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,131
uh,

6
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:08,964
we discussed,

7
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,511
uh,

8
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,344
but also,

9
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:10,950
um,

10
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,250
demonstrates a difficulties
of managing the relationship,

11
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:14,490
uh,

12
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,323
between,

13
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,540
uh,

14
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,740
freedom of choice and,

15
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,071
and,

16
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:17,440
uh,

17
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,640
uh,

18
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,320
freedom of speech as well as a managing
certain kinds of hazards in the

19
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,154
environment.

20
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,510
And I want it to go to a,

21
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,880
refresh your memory about this idea that,

22
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,571
that uh,

23
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:30,840
this industry evolved with
a clear recognition that,

24
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,360
uh,

25
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,400
the product that they were selling was
not aesthetically appealing on its own.

26
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,150
Uh,

27
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,380
so the idea that you would have to create
a cultural preference for the product

28
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,580
is really intriguing.

29
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,360
It,

30
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:42,750
uh,

31
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,520
think about a,

32
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,890
if you are a corporate leader and you
were trying to figure out how to invest

33
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:47,131
your,

34
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,140
your finances to increase your sales,

35
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,221
increase,

36
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:51,540
your profitability will,

37
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,500
you'd wonder about,

38
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,070
uh,

39
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,281
you know,

40
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,100
what forms of advertising you could use a,

41
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:59,700
you'd think carefully about the way
that you would characterize hazards as

42
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,440
opposed to product benefits.

43
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,600
And you probably would think very heavily,

44
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,020
very carefully about the way that,

45
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:06,630
uh,

46
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,250
you would conduct your own research.

47
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,520
And I wanted to reemphasize
a couple of points here.

48
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,360
And one is the,

49
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:12,720
uh,

50
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,090
the way that the advertising
had been targeted,

51
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,370
particularly to those that,

52
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:17,970
uh,

53
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,240
were most vulnerable to
adopting a cigarette products,

54
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,110
tobacco products,

55
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:22,741
uh,

56
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,940
in the early teens,

57
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,451
uh,

58
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,060
really between the ages of 12 and 50,

59
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:28,200
15 years of age.

60
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:28,981
Uh,

61
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:33,840
and I also wanted to bring to your
attention a one target of advertising,

62
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,250
but I didn't discuss the other day.

63
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:35,700
Uh,

64
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,570
which is interesting.

65
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,950
Uh,

66
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,220
there is an overlap obviously between
the intensity of physical activity among

67
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:41,980
the young,

68
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,690
uh,

69
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,523
uh,

70
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,280
so that,

71
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,341
uh,

72
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,260
the youngest are most physically active.

73
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:46,700
Uh,

74
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,240
and those that participate in sports,

75
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,631
uh,

76
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,430
became figures that promoted tobacco
use in a variety of different media.

77
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,020
Uh,

78
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,440
there was a concentration,

79
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,200
not just a to target
women and ethnic groups,

80
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,740
uh,

81
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,740
but also exceptional athletes in
a variety of different sports.

82
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,360
So claims that they don't get your
wind as an example appeared in popular

83
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,194
mechanics,

84
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,910
uh,

85
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,310
uh,

86
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,690
more than half a century ago.

87
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,140
I also did not talk about other
kinds of tobacco products.

88
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:13,381
And,

89
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:13,531
uh,

90
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,770
it was curious because I had,

91
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,150
uh,

92
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,983
a class,

93
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,290
uh,

94
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,460
several years ago with,

95
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,090
uh,

96
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,601
perhaps,

97
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:18,870
uh,

98
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,703
four or five,

99
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:19,920
uh,

100
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,940
baseball team players.

101
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,950
And I got to understand that a chewing
tobacco is not uncommon at all among boys

102
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,880
baseball players.

103
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,510
Uh,

104
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,400
and there's very little
understanding about,

105
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,030
uh,

106
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,271
uh,

107
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,570
the chemical content or the
relative risk of tobacco products,

108
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,470
uh,

109
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,720
cigarettes as opposed to smoking tobacco.

110
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,201
Uh,

111
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,690
so just to provide a,

112
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,020
uh,

113
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,020
a quick back background set of statistics
of the National Cancer Institute,

114
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:44,490
uh,

115
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,260
has a site that reviews the presence of
28 different carcinogens in smokeless

116
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,094
tobacco.

117
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,400
Uh,

118
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,510
in one dose of,

119
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,530
of smokeless tobacco,

120
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,540
depending upon the size that
you pull out of the camp,

121
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,650
uh,

122
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,630
has three to four times
the nicotine level,

123
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,930
so that those that are chewing tobacco
absorb far more nicotine and it can be

124
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,210
measured in at higher
concentrations in the blood.

125
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,920
Then if you have a cigarette,

126
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,580
and it's now used by almost 8
million people in the United States,

127
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,550
it's also recognized to increase risk of,

128
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:13,970
of,

129
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,470
uh,

130
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,340
oral cancer,

131
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,911
uh,

132
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,211
that,

133
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:16,420
uh,

134
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,290
can cause bone degeneration and
a different other illnesses,

135
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:20,441
uh,

136
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,070
of the,

137
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,870
of the nasal pharyngeal cavity.

138
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:23,980
Uh,

139
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,570
I also did not talk much about specific
advertising targeted to young kids,

140
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,140
uh,

141
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,740
but the idea that the big
league chew chewing gum,

142
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:33,574
for example,

143
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,270
uh,

144
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,601
would,

145
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,090
uh,

146
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,890
uh,

147
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,010
allow a kid to think that they
were behaving like a major leaguer,

148
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,490
uh,

149
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,323
by,

150
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:40,930
by,

151
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,190
uh,

152
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,500
uh,

153
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,370
chewing bubblegum,

154
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,031
uh,

155
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,590
the way that,

156
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:43,690
uh,

157
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,570
the major leaguers chew
tobacco and also the,

158
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:46,960
uh,

159
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,291
uh,

160
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,890
the sale of cigarettes and candy form,

161
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,401
uh,

162
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,000
to children.

163
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,080
These are still marketed,

164
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,600
uh,

165
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:53,860
uh,

166
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,000
in the United States today.

167
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,090
One other fact that I didn't discuss is
the idea of freedom of choice relative

168
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,730
to children growing up
in families that smoked.

169
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,680
Um,

170
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,280
I grew up in a family that smoked,

171
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:06,830
uh,

172
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,810
and just have vivid memories of
being in the backseat of a car,

173
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,350
uh,

174
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,190
filled with smoke,

175
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,790
uh,

176
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,860
or a sitting around the kitchen table.

177
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,140
Uh,

178
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,491
we're,

179
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,890
we're parents smoked and many mid,

180
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,560
perhaps some of you had that
have had that same experience.

181
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,191
Uh,

182
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,750
the estimate today is about 25% of kids
between the ages of three and 11 grew up

183
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,370
with one smoker in the household.

184
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,593
So thinking about,

185
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,890
uh,

186
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,260
the,

187
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,930
the freedom of choice argument
on the part of the industry,

188
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,290
uh,

189
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,920
relative to this population
poses some particular problems.

190
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,050
And I left you the other day talking
about the efforts on the part of the

191
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:41,800
industry,

192
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,130
uh,

193
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,400
to understand nicotine and a,

194
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,850
the human response to nicotine.

195
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,430
And I want you to think about
this a little bit more carefully.

196
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,343
So,

197
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:50,950
uh,

198
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,420
this general counsel to Brown
and Williamson back in 1963 so,

199
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:55,690
uh,

200
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,370
almost a 50 years ago,

201
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,390
uh,

202
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,870
claimed.

203
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,350
Well,

204
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,200
we are then in the business of
selling nicotine and addictive drug

205
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,050
beyond nicotine.

206
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:05,561
By the way,

207
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,950
there are many other hazardous
chemicals in tobacco smoke.

208
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,070
And I'm not going to spend
any more time on this than to,

209
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:12,480
uh,

210
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,100
uh,

211
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,300
uh,

212
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,770
let you know that that dozens of compounds
are really a very well recognized and

213
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:18,310
they are,

214
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,770
are the targets of a variety
of different types of,

215
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,210
of environmental laws.

216
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,911
So,

217
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:23,650
uh,

218
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,580
these chemicals are,

219
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,170
are,

220
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,003
uh,

221
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,010
tightly restricted under
the safe drinking water act,

222
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:31,270
the clean air act,

223
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,100
uh,

224
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,220
hazardous air pollutant,

225
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,910
uh,

226
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,271
uh,

227
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:35,110
regulations.

228
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:35,801
So that,

229
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:36,370
uh,

230
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,370
the idea that they would escape regulatory
attention in a tobacco product where

231
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,700
the dose would be so much higher than
you would get if you were exposed to

232
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,280
outdoor air or too low levels in,

233
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,203
in drinking water.

234
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,010
It's really a very interesting thought.

235
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,641
Now,

236
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,474
David Kessler,

237
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,280
who wrote question of intent,

238
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:54,791
uh,

239
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,170
when he,

240
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,320
he spoke in this lecture,

241
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:56,980
uh,

242
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,880
knew of my interest in and,

243
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,260
uh,

244
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,410
the research I was then
doing on pesticides and he
pointed me to an expert in

245
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,520
Switzerland who had pulled
together information on pesticides,

246
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,900
used to produce tobacco.

247
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,440
Uh,

248
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,030
so nobody had ever looked at the number
of chemicals that were allowed for use

249
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,550
or what happened to them more
than tobacco itself burned.

250
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,450
Uh,

251
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,620
so it turned out that,

252
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,454
uh,

253
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,730
uh,

254
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,520
there are about 101 different
pesticides used on tobacco.

255
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,040
Uh,

256
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,990
and when they are burned,

257
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,660
some concentrations,

258
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:25,850
uh,

259
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,200
make their way into indoor air.

260
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:27,501
Uh,

261
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,640
but others transform,

262
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,151
uh,

263
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:32,330
so that the mixture of known
carcinogens that are not pesticides,

264
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:32,871
uh,

265
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,460
with,

266
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:33,740
uh,

267
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,190
these pesticide metabolites
or combustion byproducts,

268
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,590
uh,

269
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,421
is really quite a,

270
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:38,810
uh,

271
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,230
quite a remarkable mixture of,

272
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:40,480
of,

273
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,313
of substances.

274
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,210
Now,

275
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,480
another idea that Kessler had,

276
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:44,721
uh,

277
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,880
that I've taken up in
a variety of different,

278
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:47,390
uh,

279
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,451
uh,

280
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:52,451
research projects has been to explore
patents as a way of understanding what a

281
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:57,200
corporation knew about a product a
and when they knew it and how they're

282
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:01,460
advertising matched up with
their background knowledge
of benefit as opposed to

283
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:02,150
risk.

284
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,700
So if you look at,

285
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:04,070
uh,

286
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,560
some of these patent examples,

287
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,041
uh,

288
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,341
that,

289
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:07,910
uh,

290
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,031
uh,

291
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,330
the food and Drug Administration
was able to conduct research on,

292
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:11,720
uh,

293
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,070
you find that back as early as
the 1960s and through the 70s,

294
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:16,461
eighties,

295
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,450
in 1990s.

296
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,140
Uh,

297
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,410
the companies we're
conducting intensive research,

298
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,011
uh,

299
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,420
on nicotine content.

300
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,231
Uh,

301
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,370
so take a look at the,

302
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,860
if you take a look at the
first patent description,

303
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,000
I'd increase nicotine content and the
tobacco smoke by use of a nicotine ion

304
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,680
exchange placed in the filter.

305
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,810
What placed in the filter?

306
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,350
I thought filters were supposed
to take out particles or,

307
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,250
or dangerous chemicals.

308
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:40,911
Uh,

309
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,600
so they're thinking that they might
even add the nicotine to the filter.

310
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,200
Uh,

311
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,680
the second increased nicotine content
and the smoke of a tobacco product by

312
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,530
adding nicotine to carbon
black in the filter,

313
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,480
the next add tobacco extract containing
nicotine to the filter of cigarettes.

314
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,620
The next one create a device to deliver
increased nicotine by applying nicotine

315
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:03,800
solutions to the filter.

316
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,230
And finally on the sheet method of
producing a rapper for a smoking rod,

317
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,660
uh,

318
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,490
a cigarette which has
a screen printed on it,

319
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:13,910
uh,

320
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,960
among other things,

321
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,660
they physiologically active
agent such as nicotine.

322
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,140
So thinking about adding ink to the paper,

323
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:21,710
uh,

324
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,000
thinking about adding,

325
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,900
uh,

326
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,350
uh,

327
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,330
liquids and vapors to a,

328
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,164
to the filters,

329
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,860
uh,

330
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,870
as well as the example that
I described the other day,

331
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,700
increasing the ammonia content,

332
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,630
uh,

333
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,990
in the,

334
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,681
in the tobacco.

335
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,780
That would free up more nicotine.

336
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,550
So all of an idea to manipulate the dose
that the individual would get per per

337
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:41,384
cigarette.

338
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,500
Uh,

339
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:42,701
the,

340
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:43,700
the list goes on,

341
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,360
uh,

342
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,841
and,

343
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,320
uh,

344
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,153
uh,

345
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,031
the idea of,

346
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:47,320
of,

347
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,810
uh,

348
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,380
um,

349
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,610
putting other additives in,

350
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,000
uh,

351
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,301
that,

352
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:50,511
uh,

353
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,620
would make high nicotine content,

354
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,850
uh,

355
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,720
less harsh because nicotine can
can be very irritating to the,

356
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:56,800
uh,

357
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,350
the throat and the nose,

358
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,600
and also lowering the ratio of particulate
matter of nicotine and smoke using

359
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:07,020
internal heat sinks and special
nicotine containing absorbance.

360
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,650
Uh,

361
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,960
so the cigarette product itself,

362
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,320
uh,

363
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,330
many have the idea that
it's simply tobacco.

364
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
It's not at all.

365
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a very interesting combination of
different technologies are all designed

366
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:18,240
to,

367
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,920
to manipulate the chemical
mixture that the smoker receives.

368
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,920
And as this research was going on,

369
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,780
this slide that I showed
you the other the other day,

370
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,410
uh,

371
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,410
kind of reinforces that this knowledge
was being incorporated in a manner that

372
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,490
allowed them to figure out how to increase
the nicotine content in cigarettes

373
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,960
during the same period.

374
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,500
There was an interesting article that
was published in 1998 in the British

375
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,410
American are,

376
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:47,720
uh,

377
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,940
by uh,

378
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
uh,

379
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,780
uh,

380
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,420
uh,

381
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,240
a researcher in the
Tobacco Control Journal.

382
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:54,961
Uh,

383
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,870
and it references a memo that
it was quoted in that journal.

384
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,440
Uh,

385
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,910
we are searching explicitly,

386
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,810
uh,

387
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,130
for a socially acceptable addictive
product involving a pattern of repeated

388
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:05,964
consumption.

389
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,640
A product which is likely to
involve repeated handling.

390
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,470
The essential constituent is most likely
to be nicotine or a direct substitute

391
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,304
for it.

392
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,800
So this is all just to say that,

393
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:17,100
uh,

394
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,700
as these debates were
going on inside Congress,

395
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,141
uh,

396
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,490
over whether or not nicotine
is an addictive drug.

397
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,761
There is a,

398
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:24,911
a,

399
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:29,911
a video that I'll put up on the website
for you that shows all of the de facto

400
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:33,300
executives in major corporate
executives appearing before Congress.

401
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:33,931
And,

402
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:34,110
uh,

403
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,520
we were one congressmen asked them,

404
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,200
Henry Waxman from California,

405
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:38,910
uh,

406
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,060
uh,

407
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,660
gentlemen,

408
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:39,810
uh,

409
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,340
is tobacco,

410
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:41,700
uh,

411
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,230
or is nicotine addictive,

412
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,040
uh,

413
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,660
and each one of them went down the row.

414
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,140
No,

415
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,040
it is not addictive.

416
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,450
Uh,

417
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,980
and this was well after this
research had been published.

418
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,640
Plan.

419
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,473
Well after,

420
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,450
uh,

421
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,250
excuse me.

422
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,620
Well after this memorandum was,

423
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,454
was written,

424
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,960
so that a central debate,

425
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,351
uh,

426
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:02,370
in the management of the technology has
been over the management of nicotine.

427
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,953
Okay.

428
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:07,811
Oh,

429
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:09,100
by the late 1990s,

430
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,390
major medical organizations around the
world had concluded that nicotine is

431
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:14,110
addictive,

432
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,060
including the US surgeon general,

433
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:17,260
the World Health Organization,

434
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,593
et Cetera.

435
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,411
So that,

436
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:20,850
uh,

437
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,830
this eventually prompted Kessler once
he had all of this information derived

438
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,541
from patents,

439
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,740
but also derived from,

440
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,170
from a National Institute of Health,

441
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,680
uh,

442
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,730
independently conducted
research in recognizing that,

443
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:34,230
uh,

444
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,390
uh,

445
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,570
there was much research that had gone
on in these companies that was not

446
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,490
disclosed to the food
and Drug Administration.

447
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,290
They develop their proposal.

448
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,010
This proposal is pretty well laid
out and the question of intent,

449
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,800
uh,

450
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,100
and it included a ban on cartoon graphics,

451
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:48,580
uh,

452
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,120
particularly with an eye to the Joe camel
ad that I showed you a few days ago.

453
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,400
A text is allowed in the,

454
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:57,880
in the advertising banning
brand names on hats,

455
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:58,361
tee shirts,

456
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,194
and other products.

457
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,460
Uh,

458
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,230
they targeted event sponsorship,

459
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,550
uh,

460
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,490
requiring corporate,

461
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:03,730
uh,

462
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,510
names,

463
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:04,751
uh,

464
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:05,890
but not product names,

465
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,600
eliminating vending machines,

466
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,261
free samples,

467
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,310
and mirror mail order.

468
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,683
Uh,

469
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,930
and eliminating self service in stores
and suspending licenses to sell to those

470
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:16,511
who,

471
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,170
uh,

472
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,741
did not,

473
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:18,280
uh,

474
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,430
uh,

475
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,020
restrict sales to minors.

476
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,800
So the history of this Fda rule
is I think very interesting and,

477
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,330
uh,

478
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,790
uh,

479
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,100
will lead to what I think of as,

480
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,420
as one of the more
important success stories,

481
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:28,900
uh,

482
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,600
in the late 20th century
that a swirl around these,

483
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,121
these,

484
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:32,230
uh,

485
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,520
environmental health cases,

486
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,550
the FDA rule proposed in August of,

487
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,880
uh,

488
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,790
1996 by President Clinton,

489
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,570
uh,

490
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,130
at Kessler's urging,

491
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,293
uh,

492
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,280
was announced by the food
and Drug Administration.

493
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
The tobacco industry,

494
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:47,950
uh,

495
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,270
within a matter of a couple of months,

496
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,710
filed a lawsuit against the FDA
rule arguing that the food and Drug

497
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,260
Administration had no authority over
tobacco products under the food,

498
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,340
drug and cosmetic act.

499
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,180
Uh,

500
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,013
basically that,

501
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,620
uh,

502
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,780
tobacco products were not a drug,

503
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,381
uh,

504
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:02,681
that,

505
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,514
uh,

506
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,300
uh,

507
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,601
that,

508
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:04,781
uh,

509
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:06,910
the cigarettes or the ship cigars,

510
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,481
uh,

511
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:09,220
we're not a drug delivery device.

512
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:09,970
Uh,

513
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,030
and they also argued that FDA's rules,

514
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,571
uh,

515
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:16,360
on marketing restrictions
violated the first amendment.

516
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,280
So we had the right to make claims
about our product and to sell it.

517
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,751
Uh,

518
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,130
the major plaintiff's in the,

519
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,530
in the case included a these corporations.

520
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,220
Uh,

521
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,510
and as a side show,

522
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,010
which is a bit interesting,

523
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,660
back in 1997,

524
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:35,710
John Mccain introduced the
Universal Tobacco Settlement Act.

525
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,730
Uh,

526
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,031
and,

527
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:37,864
uh,

528
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,291
uh,

529
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,400
it passed the revised,

530
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,621
uh,

531
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:42,370
the Senate passed a revised
version of the Mccain Bill,

532
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:42,821
uh,

533
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,750
that included many,

534
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,350
uh,

535
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,700
elements of the FDA rule.

536
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,530
So,

537
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:46,720
uh,

538
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,553
rather than,

539
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:47,920
uh,

540
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,820
the government agency,

541
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:50,110
the food and Drug Administration,

542
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,970
just adopting these regulations,

543
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,450
uh,

544
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,160
without going specifically to Congress.

545
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:54,700
Uh,

546
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,360
the,

547
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,631
the,

548
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:55,890
uh,

549
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,020
uh,

550
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,130
McCain strategy was,

551
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:57,281
well,

552
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:00,310
let's try to push this through
Congress and see how far we can get.

553
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,080
But it was defeated in the Senate.

554
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:02,340
Uh,

555
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,340
just about a year later,

556
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,120
the U S court of Appeals ruled in a
two to one vote that eight FDA had no

557
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:13,900
authority to regulate
tobacco products in 1999.

558
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,770
Uh,

559
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,050
because it ruled that
the FDA had no authority.

560
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,390
Uh,

561
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,850
the force circuit did not rule on
whether or not FDA is rule mark rules.

562
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,211
Uh,

563
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,830
our marketing restrictions,

564
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,670
uh,

565
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,550
violated the first amendment
and just as background.

566
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:27,681
But I,

567
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:31,900
because we haven't spent much time on
the overall structure of the judicial

568
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:32,650
system,

569
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:32,890
uh,

570
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,540
there are 94 federal district courts in
the u s there are 10 regional appellate

571
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,374
courts.

572
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,310
And then obviously one supreme court
would want justice and eight associates.

573
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,553
Now,

574
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,070
in part because of recognition of the
medical costs associated with treating

575
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,910
people that tobacco related illnesses,

576
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:53,810
uh,

577
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,760
attorneys general from more
than 40 states got together and,

578
00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,120
uh,

579
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,480
uh,

580
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,900
launched a lawsuit and
eventually it was settled.

581
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,720
It was called the master settlement
agreement with the tobacco industry.

582
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,420
And,

583
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,890
uh,

584
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,360
as you may or may not know,

585
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,830
most lawsuits,

586
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,100
uh,

587
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,640
don't make their way to
a trial or to a jury.

588
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,230
Most are settled.

589
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,760
And in this case,

590
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:17,690
in 1998,

591
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,230
uh,

592
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,230
the attorneys general from 46 states
signed this agreement with four of the

593
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:24,434
biggest companies,

594
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,450
tobacco companies in the nation,

595
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,330
and it prohibited tobacco advertising,

596
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,750
uh,

597
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,870
that targeted kids younger
than 18 years of age.

598
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,210
So,

599
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:34,370
you know,

600
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:34,971
once again,

601
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:36,410
that isn't kind of an interesting story,

602
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,870
uh,

603
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,540
that a kid's play an important role in
the history of the product regulation.

604
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,290
So what we're a key
elements of this ingredient,

605
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,981
or excuse me,

606
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:46,814
of this settlement.

607
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:47,871
Well,

608
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:48,171
first,

609
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:48,381
that,

610
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:48,800
uh,

611
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,100
uh,

612
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,980
tobacco companies could
not use cartoon characters.

613
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,581
Uh,

614
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:56,960
the tobacco companies could not target
a youth and advertising or promotion.

615
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,470
Uh,

616
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,980
tobacco companies could not
sponsor concerts or other events,

617
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,460
uh,

618
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,610
with significant youth audiences
and tobacco brand names,

619
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,030
uh,

620
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,100
cannot be advertised
at stadiums and arenas.

621
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,640
So here you see three
different institutional arenas,

622
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,743
basically,

623
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,530
uh,

624
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,110
considering the same issues.

625
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,620
Uh,

626
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,251
you see,

627
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:16,401
uh,

628
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:19,730
the food and Drug Administration
attempting to regulate,

629
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,180
uh,

630
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,570
by,

631
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:20,901
by,

632
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:21,141
uh,

633
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:21,560
you know,

634
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:21,980
uh,

635
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,050
adopting regulations and,

636
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,220
uh,

637
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,100
you find,

638
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:25,311
uh,

639
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:25,940
the,

640
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,301
uh,

641
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:27,050
attorneys,

642
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,070
attorneys general,

643
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,431
uh,

644
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:30,980
using litigation as a way
of forcing settlement,

645
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:31,790
uh,

646
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,210
so that you get the companies themselves
to agree that they're not going to do

647
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,044
these things.

648
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,580
That's a very different approach than,

649
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,880
than having Fda tell them that
they can't do those things.

650
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,670
And then you have the Mccain
initiative in Congress.

651
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,391
So,

652
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:44,601
you know,

653
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:44,800
the,

654
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,310
the curious thing about this,

655
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:46,710
uh,

656
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,241
is that,

657
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:47,840
uh,

658
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,470
uh,

659
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,860
you can think about a variety of
different institutional targets for legal

660
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:52,694
reform.

661
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,210
Uh,

662
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,470
should you target a,

663
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,310
the federal government?

664
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,210
Should you target,

665
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:56,810
uh,

666
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,643
uh,

667
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,510
a federal regulatory agency trying to
get them to adopt new regulations or

668
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,010
should you use the judicial system?

669
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,350
Uh,

670
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,440
so that in this case,

671
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,871
uh,

672
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:07,704
all three,

673
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,091
uh,

674
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:10,700
institutional venues were being exercised.

675
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,340
I also wanted to pose a,

676
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:14,040
another,

677
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,660
uh,

678
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,500
problem to you.

679
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,590
And that is that a,

680
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,400
like other types of
environmental problems,

681
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,950
there are certain groups in
society that are at special risk.

682
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,140
And in this case,

683
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,631
uh,

684
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:27,630
the Americans for
disabilities or the American,

685
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,130
uh,

686
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,170
Americans with disabilities act,

687
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,303
uh,

688
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:31,701
uh,

689
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,020
was used to authorize,

690
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,710
uh,

691
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:33,980
or,

692
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,700
uh,

693
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,150
uh,

694
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,690
limit,

695
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,141
excuse me,

696
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,160
to eliminate or,

697
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:37,350
uh,

698
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,140
uh,

699
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,973
uh,

700
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,200
uh,

701
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,610
limit environmental tobacco smoke in
the workplace and requires an employer,

702
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,480
employer make a reasonable
accommodation to the known disabilities,

703
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:51,120
have an employee who requests
the accommodation so that,

704
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:51,211
uh,

705
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:52,044
workers,

706
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,540
uh,

707
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,540
use the Americans with disabilities act
effectively to clear up the air within

708
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:58,824
workplaces.

709
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,641
Uh,

710
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:03,270
another settlement proved interesting
and occupational question as well.

711
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:03,750
Uh,

712
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,520
the airline flight attendants were
concerned about their intense exposure to

713
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,354
tobacco smoke.

714
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,600
And you're probably too
young to remember flying,

715
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,141
uh,

716
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:15,390
when cigarette smoking
was allowed in aircraft.

717
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:15,900
Uh,

718
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,040
but the distinction between the smoking
and the no smoking zone was simply a row

719
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:20,760
number.

720
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,810
So a row number 23 a might and,

721
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,470
and a forward might allow smoking
and ruin number 24 and back.

722
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,304
That would not,

723
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:28,770
uh,

724
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,820
so you could very easily be
sitting next to somebody smoking.

725
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,271
Uh,

726
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,560
and the air inside the cabin,

727
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:34,950
uh,

728
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,430
is,

729
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,430
is a controlled by the pilot who decides
on what the refresh rate will be.

730
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,910
It's called bleed air that comes off of
the engines and circulates back through

731
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:46,620
the aircraft so that a,

732
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:47,550
at high altitudes,

733
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:51,810
the temperature is really low so that
it means that they have to expend more

734
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:56,070
fuel the more they recycle or refresh
the quality of the air from the outside,

735
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,490
uh,

736
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,580
to heat it back up to a
comfortable cabin temperature.

737
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,010
So there's a tendency
not to refresh that air.

738
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,980
It's an interesting case at to
couple months ago about an airliner,

739
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,401
uh,

740
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:05,701
that,

741
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:05,940
uh,

742
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,930
had a fuel leak,

743
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,450
uh,

744
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:07,771
that,

745
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:07,980
uh,

746
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,790
had seeped into that bleed air and
passengers claimed that they were,

747
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,320
were,

748
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,600
uh,

749
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,100
quite ill once they landed,

750
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,510
including many of the flight attendants.

751
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,100
So let's take a look at the
food and Drug Administration,

752
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,410
a case versus Brown and Williamson.

753
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,011
Uh,

754
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:26,040
and the Supreme Court
ruling on March of 2000,

755
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:26,701
uh,

756
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,001
that,

757
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:27,420
uh,

758
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,130
was issued in the five to four decision.

759
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,050
This was interesting because it basically
concluded that a existing law does not

760
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:37,770
provide FDA with authority over
tobacco or tobacco marketing.

761
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,510
Uh,

762
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,530
they claim that the FDA consistently
stated before 1995 that it lacked

763
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:44,880
jurisdiction over tobacco.

764
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,170
So the,

765
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,981
and the shift in,

766
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:50,070
in the administrator of the
food and drug administration,

767
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,820
they were arguing was the only reason
that they were taking this issue on.

768
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,420
And the congress had enacted
several tobacco specific statutes,

769
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:57,871
uh,

770
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:01,410
that fully demonstrated that,

771
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:01,910
uh,

772
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,040
uh,

773
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,210
they had not intended,

774
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,690
uh,

775
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,200
that these regulations proposed by the
food and Drug Administration be adopted.

776
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,160
Uh,

777
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,490
so congress considered and rejected many
bills that would have given the agency

778
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,324
to have authority.

779
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,440
So the argument,

780
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,631
uh,

781
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:14,190
that,

782
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,461
that,

783
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:15,294
uh,

784
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,820
the Supreme Court bought a was that,

785
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,180
you know,

786
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,450
this was a matter that should have been
dealt with in Congress specifically.

787
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:21,840
Uh,

788
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,640
but Congress chose not to deal with it.

789
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,970
So what if you look more carefully at it?

790
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,391
Well,

791
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:28,590
what if you asked the question,

792
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:28,801
well,

793
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,930
should it be considered to
be a drug under the food,

794
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:31,950
Drug and cosmetic act?

795
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,330
Uh,

796
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:33,721
and,

797
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:33,871
uh,

798
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:34,141
you know,

799
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:34,591
you might,

800
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:34,960
uh,

801
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,430
uh,

802
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,360
read the statement by an
RJ Reynolds executive.

803
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:39,900
Uh,

804
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,440
in a sense the tobacco industry may
be thought of as being a specialized,

805
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:46,800
highly ritualized and stylized segment
of the pharmaceutical industry.

806
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,800
Tobacco products uniquely contain and
deliver nicotine a potent drug with a

807
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:53,170
variety of physiological effects and say,

808
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,004
case closed.

809
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,570
Now the evidence is clear.

810
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:56,470
They even believe that,

811
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:56,790
uh,

812
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,020
they believe themselves
that a tobacco products,

813
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,380
uh,

814
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,510
should be classified or,

815
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,110
or are a type of duct drug.

816
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:02,831
Well,

817
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:05,440
the decision as the Supreme
Court interpreted it.

818
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,140
And don't forget that this
is a five to four decision,

819
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,360
which is interesting because the,

820
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,210
the descending opinions or something
that you probably have not read,

821
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,520
but you,

822
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,640
I commend to you the,

823
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:15,731
uh,

824
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,980
the opinion of Steven Brier,

825
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,620
which I think is perhaps the,

826
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,673
the most,

827
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,533
uh,

828
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,150
uh,

829
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,983
cogent,

830
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,380
uh,

831
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,981
so that,

832
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:24,101
uh,

833
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,940
the definition of a drug turned out
to be a dependent and turn about,

834
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,510
uh,

835
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,700
whether or not there was
an identifiable benefit.

836
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,920
So I'm going to quote various provisions
in the act require the agency to

837
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,690
determine that at least
for some consumers,

838
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:41,740
the products therapeutic benefits
outweigh the risks of illness or serious

839
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:42,574
injury.

840
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,770
This the FDA cannot do because tobacco,

841
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,490
tobacco products are unsafe for
obtaining any therapeutic benefit.

842
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,420
The inescapable conclusion is that there
is no room for tobacco products within

843
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,390
the FT CAS food,

844
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:56,560
Drug and Cosmetic Act regulatory scheme.

845
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,890
If they cannot be used safely
for any therapeutic purpose,

846
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,401
uh,

847
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,750
and yet they cannot be banned.

848
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,160
They simply do not fit.

849
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,010
They do not fit the legal scheme
that Congress had intended.

850
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,010
And Sandra Day O'connor
wrote this opinion.

851
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,380
The agency has amply
demonstrated the tobacco use,

852
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,520
particularly among
children and adolescents,

853
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,010
uh,

854
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,980
poses perhaps a single most significant
threat to public health in the United

855
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,370
States.

856
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,700
Yet we believe that Congress has
clearly precluded FDA from asserting

857
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,830
jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products.

858
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,970
Now,

859
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,080
many people heard about this decision
and they assume that the Supreme Court,

860
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,620
uh,

861
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,610
was off their rocker,

862
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:30,840
that,

863
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,150
that,

864
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,270
uh,

865
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,501
they,

866
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,334
they really,

867
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,710
uh,

868
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,300
we're,

869
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,670
we're,

870
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:33,940
uh,

871
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,150
uh,

872
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,620
concluding something that,

873
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:35,771
uh,

874
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,210
was not morally defensible.

875
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,110
Um,

876
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,943
but I think,

877
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,280
you know,

878
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,000
that their job is not to conclude
what is morally appropriate or morally

879
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,691
defensible.

880
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:46,720
Their job is to determine
whether or not a,

881
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:47,170
uh,

882
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:47,470
uh,

883
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,510
an agency action in this case,

884
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:49,900
uh,

885
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,020
complied with the intent
and letter of the law.

886
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,650
Uh,

887
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,221
so that,

888
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:54,341
uh,

889
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:54,541
it's,

890
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,840
it's important too to recognize that
these are debates about the nature and the

891
00:22:58,841 --> 00:22:59,360
language,

892
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,770
the very specific language and
definitions contained in the statutes,

893
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,371
uh,

894
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:03,671
that,

895
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:03,820
uh,

896
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,480
provide the authorizing language to the
administrative agencies such as the food

897
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:08,440
and Drug Administration.

898
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,330
So that,

899
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,530
uh,

900
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,700
continuing with his opinion,

901
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:14,980
Congress's foreclosed
a ban on such products.

902
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,700
Choosing instead to create a distinct
regulatory scheme focusing on the labeling

903
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:23,380
and advertising and cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco compared to pesticides

904
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,030
where they created a scheme
that now stands that the agency,

905
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,990
in that case,

906
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,310
the environmental protection agency has
to make a formal finding of reasonable

907
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,570
certainty of no harm.

908
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,950
Not In this case,

909
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,870
not in this case at all.

910
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,011
So that,

911
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:39,131
uh,

912
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:43,510
the focus on labeling and advertising
rather than on risk assessment or risk

913
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,560
minimization,

914
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,140
uh,

915
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,140
is a very different approach to managing
a product or a technology and the

916
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,044
marketplace.

917
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,790
So it's express policy is to protect
commerce and the national economy a while

918
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,100
informing consumers about
any adverse health effects.

919
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,431
Now,

920
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:59,900
one might argue as well.

921
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,470
Well,

922
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,650
how did the tobacco industry
get away with this legal regime?

923
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,820
How were they so successful
in escaping regulation?

924
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,680
It's almost the ideal situation.

925
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,431
Uh,

926
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:10,980
so that,

927
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,630
uh,

928
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,110
they,

929
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,390
they have the sense of being regulated,

930
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,050
uh,

931
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,730
because of the advertising controls.

932
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,330
Uh,

933
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,140
but they have virtual
freedom to manipulate the
chemical composition of their

934
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:21,974
products.

935
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,371
Uh,

936
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:22,911
so that,

937
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:23,031
uh,

938
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:23,241
you know,

939
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:24,710
if I were a tobacco executive,

940
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:26,560
I would think that legal regime is,

941
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,470
it's pretty good.

942
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,810
And I would,

943
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,390
uh,

944
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,020
definitely defend against any change in
the legal regime that would increase the

945
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:36,170
authority of the food and Drug
Administration on the part of Congress.

946
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,790
So justice briars descent on,

947
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,330
on FDA's authority is interesting.

948
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,800
So according to the FDA,

949
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:46,190
only 2.5% of smokers successfully
stopped smoking each year,

950
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:51,430
even though 70% say they want to quit and
34% actually make an attempt to do so.

951
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,330
The fact that only a handful of those
who try to quit smoking actually succeed

952
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,620
illustrates a certain reality.

953
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,490
The reality that the nicotine
in cigarettes creates a
powerful physiological

954
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,940
addiction flowing from a chemically
induced changes in the brain.

955
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,260
The FDA found that the
makers of cigarettes and 10
these a physical effects,

956
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,940
hence nicotine is a drug.

957
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,440
The cigarette that delivers the nicotine
to the body is a device and the FTC A's

958
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:19,700
language read in light of its basic
purpose permits the food and Drug

959
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,180
Administration to assert
the disease preventing
jurisdiction that the agency now

960
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,014
claims.

961
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,040
So the issue seemed like it was over,

962
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,473
uh,

963
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,290
until the Obama administration
came into power.

964
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,560
And all of these provisions,

965
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,160
uh,

966
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,270
that had been in the proposed regulations
on the part of the Food and Drug

967
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,720
Administration,

968
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,020
uh,

969
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,370
made their way into bills that were
introduced to the house and the Senate,

970
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,000
uh,

971
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,080
that eventually became the family smoking
prevention and Tobacco Control Act,

972
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:51,890
uh,

973
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,510
in June of 2009.

974
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,130
So this bill,

975
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,713
uh,

976
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,310
adopted by Congress,

977
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:02,720
amends the Food Drug and cosmetic act to
grant the food and Drug Administration

978
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,980
Authority to regulate the advertising,

979
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,920
marketing and manufacturing
of tobacco products.

980
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,563
What does it do?

981
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,231
Well,

982
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:10,520
it restricts tobacco marketing,

983
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,830
marketing and sales to youth and bands,

984
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,650
all outdoor advertising within
a thousand feet of schools.

985
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,550
Uh,

986
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,010
it bands a free giveaways,

987
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,680
uh,

988
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,410
of,

989
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,030
uh,

990
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,810
any non tobacco items with a
purchase of a tobacco product,

991
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,840
uh,

992
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,100
advance the sponsorship of sporting
events and entertainment events,

993
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:28,701
uh,

994
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:32,840
at limits to black and white text
only advertising in publications with

995
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,440
significant teen readership and restricts
vending machines and self service

996
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,300
displays to adult only facilities.

997
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,690
And it continues to require
retailers to verify age,

998
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,580
uh,

999
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,950
for all over the counter sales.

1000
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,931
By the way,

1001
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:48,390
I didn't mention a point
that I meant to earlier.

1002
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:48,931
You know,

1003
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,770
we talked about preemption before and,

1004
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,091
and,

1005
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:51,271
uh,

1006
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:51,631
you know,

1007
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:54,150
under the different statutes
that we've looked at,

1008
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,170
uh,

1009
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,430
when would the federal government
preempt or prevent states from adopting

1010
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:00,930
different kinds of regulations?

1011
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,501
Well,

1012
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,710
preemption turns out to be an important
component in this case as well.

1013
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,430
Uh,

1014
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,470
with respect to the tobacco settlement.

1015
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,161
Now,

1016
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,210
the tobacco settlement,

1017
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,481
uh,

1018
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,314
was not,

1019
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:10,820
uh,

1020
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,170
it was not law that was formed by statute.

1021
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:13,740
Uh,

1022
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,240
it was not formed by regulation.

1023
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,100
It was formed by agreement between
attorneys general of the states,

1024
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:20,551
uh,

1025
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:20,791
in the,

1026
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,960
in the tobacco companies.

1027
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,650
Uh,

1028
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,730
but the states started to enforce
the provisions of that settlement,

1029
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,460
uh,

1030
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,250
that brought the questions into court.

1031
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,180
And some states such as
Massachusetts in California,

1032
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,810
proposed advertising
that a was distinctive,

1033
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,410
uh,

1034
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,100
and more restrictive outdoor advertising
bans so that no billboards could be

1035
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:43,410
located within a thousand
feet of a school,

1036
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,130
uh,

1037
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,410
in,

1038
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,630
in the state of Massachusetts.

1039
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,770
Uh,

1040
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,370
similar kinds of legislation in
a variety of different states.

1041
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:51,821
So that the,

1042
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:55,860
the supreme court considered
this a in the 2000 decision,

1043
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,020
and it basically reinforced,

1044
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,481
uh,

1045
00:27:58,481 --> 00:27:59,370
the preemption,

1046
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,343
uh,

1047
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,463
provision,

1048
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,651
uh,

1049
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:01,951
that,

1050
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:02,784
uh,

1051
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,301
uh,

1052
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:06,180
was part of a variety
of different statutes.

1053
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,150
So that a,

1054
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,140
the court found that a
preemption would prevent,

1055
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:10,740
uh,

1056
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,521
Massachusetts,

1057
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:12,061
California,

1058
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:15,150
and other states from adopting more
rigorous advertising restrictions.

1059
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,920
It's just kind of an interesting point,

1060
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,580
uh,

1061
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:17,940
uh,

1062
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,170
how the attorney's general could,

1063
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,580
could draw the settlement issue back
into court and then it would capture the

1064
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,900
supreme court's attention.

1065
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,980
So that basically you see the language
being moved from the food and Drug

1066
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,520
Administration's proposed regulations,

1067
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:32,950
uh,

1068
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,950
into statutory language.

1069
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,430
Uh,

1070
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,260
and this was blessed by Congress.

1071
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,210
It provides FDA with authority,

1072
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:43,380
develop regulations that restrict
advertising and promotion,

1073
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,980
uh,

1074
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,030
to the full extent permitted by
a amendment to the constitution.

1075
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,400
And it requires a detailed disclosure
of tobacco product ingredients for the

1076
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:58,140
first time so that tobacco
companies have to disclose not just,

1077
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:58,640
uh,

1078
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:58,890
uh,

1079
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,723
chemicals used,

1080
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,210
uh,

1081
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,010
for,

1082
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,380
uh,

1083
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,640
the growing of tobacco.

1084
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,810
But the chemicals in,

1085
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,050
uh,

1086
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,760
in the tobacco plants themselves,

1087
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,830
whether or not they're
genetically modified,

1088
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,310
uh,

1089
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,110
and what kinds of additives they placed,

1090
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,650
not just in the tobacco but in
the filter as well as the paper.

1091
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,720
It also requires FDA to change,

1092
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,820
to require changes to tobacco that,

1093
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,913
uh,

1094
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,460
would protect public health.

1095
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,630
So public health now is a,

1096
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,140
a,

1097
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,310
uh,

1098
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,930
decision making standard that
has to be viewed and treated,

1099
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,380
uh,

1100
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,180
with every decision that FDA makes.

1101
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,140
Oh,

1102
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,780
and one critical aspect of,

1103
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:39,480
of this new statute is
that FDA would be allowed,

1104
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:39,810
uh,

1105
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,630
is now allowed,

1106
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,770
uh,

1107
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,380
granted the authority to reduce
nicotine content or the band,

1108
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,250
uh,

1109
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,140
ingredients that it
believes are hazardous.

1110
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,800
Uh,

1111
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,210
but it's not allowed to
require the reduction of
nicotine to zero or to ban any

1112
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:53,740
particular class of products,

1113
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,020
say cigars or chewing,

1114
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,120
chewing tobacco as an example.

1115
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,770
And also controlled,

1116
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,150
gives FDA the authority to,

1117
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,471
to,

1118
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:04,541
uh,

1119
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,374
control,

1120
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,680
uh,

1121
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,150
reduced harm products.

1122
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:07,631
Uh,

1123
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,231
so that,

1124
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:08,680
uh,

1125
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:08,840
uh,

1126
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,980
those descriptors such as
light or mild or low on labels,

1127
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,600
uh,

1128
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:12,960
uh,

1129
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,140
or an advertising a will now become
subject to the review of the agency.

1130
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,150
And you remember that the light products
that I showed you last Tuesday had

1131
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:24,610
higher nicotine content and in them than,

1132
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:24,850
uh,

1133
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,330
the,

1134
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:25,631
the,

1135
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:26,464
uh,

1136
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:26,920
uh,

1137
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,790
normal products.

1138
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,250
And it requires a larger and more specific
health warnings to cover the top 50%

1139
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,380
of the front and rear
panels of the package.

1140
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,050
Uh,

1141
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,900
and it directs FDA to issue a rule
requiring graphic warnings on labels,

1142
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:41,501
uh,

1143
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:42,670
within a year from now.

1144
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,230
So a recall,

1145
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:44,710
the,

1146
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,250
uh,

1147
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,240
Canadian governments,

1148
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,480
uh,

1149
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,330
tobacco labeling
requirements as an example.

1150
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,710
Uh,

1151
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,543
curiously,

1152
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,950
they also transfer the
costs of all regulation,

1153
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,370
uh,

1154
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,740
back to the companies so that,

1155
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:56,860
uh,

1156
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,800
all tobacco related food and
Drug Administration costs,

1157
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,400
uh,

1158
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,190
now have to be allocated among
the manufacturers of cigarettes,

1159
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,601
a cigarette,

1160
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:07,720
tobacco in smokeless tobacco
products sold in the u s,

1161
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,590
uh,

1162
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,580
based upon their,

1163
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,920
they're a different
shares of the marketplace.

1164
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,520
So in this interim time between when,

1165
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,691
when,

1166
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:16,840
uh,

1167
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,750
the food and Drug Administration was
found by the Supreme Court not to have

1168
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,340
authority to move forward on tobacco.

1169
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,260
And when in 2009,

1170
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:23,761
uh,

1171
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:24,131
the,

1172
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,080
the congress adopted the new statute,

1173
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,590
uh,

1174
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,400
what was happening?

1175
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,521
Well,

1176
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:31,750
states became very active in their
own tobacco control programs.

1177
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,350
Uh,

1178
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,800
and these programs turned out to be
really remarkable social experiments.

1179
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,810
Now they turned out to be quite effective.

1180
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:38,650
And in California,

1181
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,050
adult smoking drop from 26%,

1182
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:41,884
18%,

1183
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,340
uh,

1184
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,360
in about an eight year period following
a variety of educational campaigns,

1185
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:47,740
public service announcements,

1186
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,810
a school programs,

1187
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,180
uh,

1188
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,711
so that,

1189
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:50,920
uh,

1190
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Massachusetts similarly found a
31% decline between 1992 in 1999,

1191
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,151
uh,

1192
00:31:58,151 --> 00:31:58,960
in Oregon,

1193
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,800
tobacco use fell 11%
in Florida in one year.

1194
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:03,700
Teen Smoking,

1195
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,450
uh,

1196
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:04,780
had,

1197
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,440
had gone down the fastest
that had had since 1980.

1198
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,890
The key elements had been
a mass media campaigns,

1199
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:12,310
uh,

1200
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,750
smoking bans and restrictions,

1201
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:17,270
particularly in public places and
buildings as well as restaurant,

1202
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,130
uh,

1203
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,210
price increases.

1204
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,381
They found that,

1205
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:20,720
uh,

1206
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,040
uh,

1207
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,120
tobacco adoption rates were
extremely sensitive to tax levels.

1208
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,760
So in the states that had
the most elevated taxes,

1209
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,270
you had the lowest adoption
rates in states that had the,

1210
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:31,721
the,

1211
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:31,990
uh,

1212
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,380
uh,

1213
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,531
uh,

1214
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:33,364
highest,

1215
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:33,930
uh,

1216
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,240
uh,

1217
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,930
intensity of bands on a
place based restrictions,

1218
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,070
restrictions and buildings.

1219
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,441
Uh,

1220
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:43,100
they had the highest rates of quitting a,

1221
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,470
so that a price sensitivity
turned out to be,

1222
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,910
uh,

1223
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,350
a really important
component of the strategy.

1224
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,220
Uh,

1225
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,780
and they also found that a different
types of physician interventions,

1226
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,260
uh,

1227
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,340
nicotine patches,

1228
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:55,870
uh,

1229
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,270
we're more much more effective when
they were combined with these other

1230
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,250
educational programs than they had early,

1231
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,173
earlier believed.

1232
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,890
So basically,

1233
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,400
uh,

1234
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,770
on another lesson here
is that mass media works.

1235
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,401
Uh,

1236
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:07,761
and,

1237
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:08,000
uh,

1238
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,760
remember the 1967 fairness
doctrine campaign,

1239
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,480
uh,

1240
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:11,751
that,

1241
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:12,350
uh,

1242
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,183
itself,

1243
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,520
uh,

1244
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,560
resulted in a significant
decline in smoking,

1245
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,221
uh,

1246
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:16,970
in California.

1247
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,970
The media campaign reduced sales of
cigarettes by 232 million packs in only a

1248
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,020
two year period.

1249
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:24,801
Uh,

1250
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:28,580
and when media spending dropped from
16 million to 6 million of the program

1251
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:29,960
became less effective.

1252
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,360
So that education is really
important and it works well.

1253
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,460
I want to step back from this case
and I want you to think about,

1254
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,190
uh,

1255
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,630
how this history,

1256
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,740
uh,

1257
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,450
should be conceived a,

1258
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:47,030
should you be thinking about
this as a success story?

1259
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:47,690
Uh,

1260
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,850
should you be thinking
about this as a offering?

1261
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:52,730
Other lessons for other kinds
of environmental problems.

1262
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,200
And I've got a number of students that
went to Copenhagen in December and came

1263
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,050
back at kind of throwing
their hands up in the air,

1264
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,080
not knowing really what happened and
feeling rather disillusion with the

1265
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,440
inability of nations to,

1266
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,980
uh,

1267
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,880
decide to agree on,

1268
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:09,714
on what level of,

1269
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:10,963
uh,

1270
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,320
carbon in the atmosphere,

1271
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,310
uh,

1272
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,180
should be allowed,

1273
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:14,810
uh,

1274
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,740
or what the rate of,

1275
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,630
of uh,

1276
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:16,820
uh,

1277
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,950
use of alternative forms
of energy should be.

1278
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,760
Uh,

1279
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,050
and,

1280
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,770
and this history as well as the other
histories that I've showed you that you've

1281
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:24,890
read about through the term.

1282
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,460
I think she'd give you some sense
that legal reform is a long road,

1283
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,370
uh,

1284
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,203
demands,

1285
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,681
demands,

1286
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:32,420
education that demands a,

1287
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,890
a shift in values.

1288
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,521
Uh,

1289
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:37,190
and it demands willingness
on the part of those that,

1290
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:37,750
uh,

1291
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,540
uh,

1292
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:38,971
are the,

1293
00:34:38,971 --> 00:34:39,021
uh,

1294
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:39,651
the culprit,

1295
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:40,281
so to speak.

1296
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:43,370
The people that are behaving in a way
that adversely affects the environment.

1297
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,750
It requires them to earn,

1298
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,600
internalize the values that
are embedded in the law,

1299
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:48,860
otherwise it's not going to work.

1300
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,990
So I view this as as a,

1301
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:51,320
uh,

1302
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,710
uh,

1303
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,250
one of the,

1304
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:52,541
the,

1305
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:52,721
the,

1306
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:53,554
the greatest,

1307
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,080
uh,

1308
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,080
examples we've got about how science
had moved out of the tobacco industry,

1309
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,681
uh,

1310
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,514
into the,

1311
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,240
uh,

1312
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,073
public sector,

1313
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,651
uh,

1314
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:04,730
funded by the government.

1315
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,040
A very different view of all of what
was a risky and what was not a different

1316
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,240
quality of knowledge,

1317
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,390
uh,

1318
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,670
developed about the nature
of the health risks.

1319
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,421
And,

1320
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:15,090
uh,

1321
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,530
it eventually led the
public to realize that,

1322
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:17,660
uh,

1323
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,493
this was a,

1324
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,000
this was a technology,

1325
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:20,900
this was a product,

1326
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:21,381
uh,

1327
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:21,681
that,

1328
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,120
uh,

1329
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,260
uh,

1330
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,720
demanded greater public attention.

1331
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,230
And you can think of the parallels
between nuclear weapons testing.

1332
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:29,600
Think of the parallels between pesticides.

1333
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,231
So,

1334
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:30,471
you know,

1335
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:31,304
once again,

1336
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,870
I'm not doctor doom and gloom.

1337
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,980
I'm sure I'm showing you examples in
history that I think are really remarkable

1338
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,480
stories such as the
limited test ban treaty,

1339
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,030
uh,

1340
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,700
the Food Quality Protection Act,

1341
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,300
uh,

1342
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,451
in,

1343
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:43,280
in this case,

1344
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,530
uh,

1345
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,970
the statute that was just passed.

1346
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,140
Now,

1347
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,520
when,

1348
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,353
uh,

1349
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,020
uh,

1350
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,100
you discussed this in,

1351
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:50,550
in your sections this week,

1352
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,220
uh,

1353
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,640
you probably will think about
the different strategies,

1354
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,040
uh,

1355
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,250
that might be applied to control tobacco.

1356
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:56,911
Uh,

1357
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,700
and how the freedom to choose
a should best be limited.

1358
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,420
Uh,

1359
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,950
so I'm going to do my own little survey.

1360
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:06,480
Here are how many people here think
that the control of advertising is

1361
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:10,470
inappropriate way to control tobacco
products and associated risks?

1362
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,710
How many people feel that individuals
want to have the right to choose whether

1363
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,540
or not they use tobacco products?

1364
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,610
How many people feel that tobacco
products should be banned?

1365
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:26,851
Well,

1366
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:31,560
I'd say maybe a eight to 10% of you
think that tobacco products should be

1367
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:32,394
banned.

1368
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,680
There's remarkable
consistency year to year.

1369
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:37,170
I've asked this question for
the past decade in this class.

1370
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,100
Uh,

1371
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,080
and the number of people
that believe that,

1372
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:40,250
uh,

1373
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:40,831
for example,

1374
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,460
DDT or rather a hazardous air pollutants,

1375
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:44,940
uh,

1376
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,590
or pesticides should be banned,

1377
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,240
is normally far higher,

1378
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:48,661
uh,

1379
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:49,310
than,

1380
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:49,950
than uh,

1381
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,280
uh,

1382
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,690
it is for tobacco.

1383
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,640
So explaining why that is,

1384
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,930
is really quite interesting.

1385
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,891
And I think that,

1386
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:56,400
uh,

1387
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,611
uh,

1388
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:56,881
the,

1389
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,150
the advertising schemes that I
displayed to you over the past couple of

1390
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:00,960
lectures,

1391
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,410
uh,

1392
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,410
play some role in having shaped cultural
attitudes and acceptance of this

1393
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:09,060
technology in ways that
really is quite remarkable.

1394
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,570
Now I want you to think about
the nature of the politics too.

1395
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:14,700
And then the last few
minutes of the lecture,

1396
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,420
uh,

1397
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,231
what do you know,

1398
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:16,410
how,

1399
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,820
what could you say about the,

1400
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:18,210
uh,

1401
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,140
the forms of argument that we've seen
across the different cases that we've

1402
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:22,974
looked at?

1403
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,440
How were they consistent
and how are they different?

1404
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,011
Well,

1405
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:31,011
first I'd like you to take a look at some
of the key industry arguments that a,

1406
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,260
we've seen where the promoter of the,

1407
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:34,681
the,

1408
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:34,771
uh,

1409
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:35,491
the product,

1410
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:36,660
the promoter of the service,

1411
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:38,070
the promoter of the technology,

1412
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:39,630
the promoter of national security.

1413
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:40,464
In the case of,

1414
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:40,930
of,

1415
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,100
uh,

1416
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,510
the weapons testing or the,

1417
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,130
the,

1418
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:43,660
uh,

1419
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,460
uh,

1420
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,350
war games testing and VA case,

1421
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,270
they emphasize the benefit of the product
or technology or the social demand for

1422
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,270
it as a logic for why it
should be allowed to continue.

1423
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:54,880
Uh,

1424
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,140
they argue that evidence is
insufficient to justify regulation.

1425
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,700
They play the good scientist,

1426
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,500
they develop the science in the house,

1427
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:01,980
uh,

1428
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,680
and then present their
interpretations of it,

1429
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,190
uh,

1430
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,190
to the regulatory body in the industry
or proponent would trivialize claims of

1431
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,334
hazards.

1432
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:11,940
Uh,

1433
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,520
and compare the hazards
always to natural hazards.

1434
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,180
Like we experience a risks
from flying across the country,

1435
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,781
uh,

1436
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:19,200
from,

1437
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,620
uh,

1438
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,453
radiation.

1439
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:20,821
Uh,

1440
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:21,900
so the,

1441
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:22,021
uh,

1442
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:25,920
the radionuclides in our milk
are relatively insignificant.

1443
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,490
So figure out ways of,

1444
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:32,430
of trivializing risk by using
comparative metrics exposure.

1445
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,330
Uh,

1446
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,010
you find consistently that a,

1447
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,070
across these cases,

1448
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:41,071
that exposure is often averaged among
different populations and it's all

1449
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,930
averaged over a,

1450
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,690
uh,

1451
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,081
time.

1452
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:46,060
It's an average to over space.

1453
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:49,870
It's averaged demographically in
this act of averaging when you have,

1454
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,710
uh,

1455
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,670
a really,

1456
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,253
uh,

1457
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,870
of the image is really
one of pockets of risk.

1458
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,250
The averaging is going to
compress people's perception
of the nature of and the

1459
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,780
magnitude of the risk.

1460
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,210
So paying attention to the
distribution of risk is,

1461
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,900
has been very important to legal
reform in all of these cases.

1462
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,591
Uh,

1463
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:09,401
age restrictions.

1464
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:11,170
Also the role of kids,

1465
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:12,760
the concern of society for,

1466
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,310
uh,

1467
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:13,670
the,

1468
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,860
the very young for the fetus,

1469
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:15,431
for the kids,

1470
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:16,600
for future generations.

1471
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,031
Uh,

1472
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:17,860
this is a,

1473
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,050
an appeal on the part of consumers,

1474
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:20,930
uh,

1475
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,251
that,

1476
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:21,760
uh,

1477
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,091
uh,

1478
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,760
is often quite effective
in Leeds industry to,

1479
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,140
to still find a ban on,

1480
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,210
to fight prohibition.

1481
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:28,630
Uh,

1482
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,910
but to accept age restrictions,

1483
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,080
to accept labeling,

1484
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,350
to accept training requirements
or licensing requirements.

1485
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,880
So the strategy if you are the corporate
executive is to well fight those,

1486
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:43,120
but to accept them instead
of taking a product,

1487
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,840
a prohibition registration
is a property right.

1488
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,470
They will always fight that if you take
away the right to do what they did in

1489
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,200
the past,

1490
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,491
uh,

1491
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,130
that you have to compensate for them
under the fifth amendment of the

1492
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:54,964
Constitution.

1493
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,710
So treat your registration,

1494
00:39:56,711 --> 00:40:01,711
treat your path of freedom to sell
your freedom to choose a as a property,

1495
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,970
right and demand compensation.

1496
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,660
And courts have traditionally
responded favorably to these arguments.

1497
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,203
Patent Life,

1498
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,570
uh,

1499
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,880
pushed for the longest
patent life that you can.

1500
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:13,450
Uh,

1501
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,530
and you basically want to fight regulation
until the end of your patent life,

1502
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,130
uh,

1503
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,470
which at that time the
product becomes generic.

1504
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,390
It can be picked up by other corporations.

1505
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,830
You find this with pesticides,

1506
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:24,940
you find this with drugs.

1507
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,390
So that the industry will fight to keep
the product in the marketplace till the

1508
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:29,350
end of that patent life,

1509
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,880
which is now a 20 year period.

1510
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,600
Uh,

1511
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,130
and you often find litigation,

1512
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:33,491
uh,

1513
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:37,420
effective in delaying
prohibitions for 15 to 20 years.

1514
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:38,770
So it's a very effective strategy.

1515
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,450
And often if you've invested,

1516
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:40,751
say,

1517
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:41,140
uh,

1518
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,130
$100 million is one pesticide that
I've worked on where $100 million was

1519
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:46,330
invested in this chemical,

1520
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,080
uh,

1521
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,030
to bring it to the
marketplace and to study it.

1522
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,770
If you invested that amount of money,

1523
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,330
it often takes you to,

1524
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,810
uh,

1525
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,470
to,

1526
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,220
uh,

1527
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,790
uh,

1528
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,720
75% of the patent life to start to
get a return on that investment.

1529
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,120
So the profitability for new drug,

1530
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,590
the profitability for a,

1531
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,990
a new expensive technology,

1532
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,800
expensive to bring to the marketplace
and often doesn't pay off until that last

1533
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:09,634
five year period.

1534
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,640
So that it's a guarantee that
you're going to have a legal fight,

1535
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:13,360
uh,

1536
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,720
strategically regulate
rather than band argue that,

1537
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:16,990
uh,

1538
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,261
well,

1539
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:18,400
can I use it in a,

1540
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,720
can I use the product in
this way but not that way?

1541
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,140
Uh,

1542
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,680
can I continue to sell the
tobacco and cigarettes?

1543
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:26,880
Uh,

1544
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,820
if not cigars?

1545
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,170
Can I continue to,

1546
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:29,790
uh,

1547
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,840
use a pesticide,

1548
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:31,180
uh,

1549
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,800
outdoors if you've been an indoors?

1550
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,380
So try to maintain market
share any way that you can.

1551
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,160
Uh,

1552
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,960
and if you can't,

1553
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,010
if they decide no,

1554
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:40,860
it's going to be banned,

1555
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,310
uh,

1556
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,740
then let us export it.

1557
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,260
Please let us export it to other nations.

1558
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,820
Uh,

1559
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,653
substitutes.

1560
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,730
Don't compare us among competitors.

1561
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,540
Uh,

1562
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,070
make sure that you focus exclusively on
our product because we don't want the,

1563
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:55,521
uh,

1564
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:55,721
the,

1565
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,480
the risk,

1566
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,200
the threat,

1567
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,830
the environmental damage from our product
to be thought of in an additive way

1568
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,450
with competitor's products.

1569
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,291
Uh,

1570
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:06,140
another logic is a comparative risk.

1571
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,980
Well,

1572
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,850
the risk associated with our product
or our behavior or our technology,

1573
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:11,360
uh,

1574
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,030
is really minimal compared to the risk of,

1575
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:14,720
uh,

1576
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,020
he know not to using the latest
safety technology in a car.

1577
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,920
Uh,

1578
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,581
trying to,

1579
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:20,030
uh,

1580
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,920
launch a suicide prevention program,

1581
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,540
a drug control program,

1582
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,810
etc. Finally,

1583
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,110
a self study,

1584
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,820
self monitoring and self reporting.

1585
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,450
Let us do the studies and then
provide you with the data.

1586
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,830
Don't set up an independent
organization to do that.

1587
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,420
So let us report,

1588
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,810
uh,

1589
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,610
not only on the nature of the danger,

1590
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,080
but also on it's a distribution and
a what it's cost of society might be.

1591
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,100
Now,

1592
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,010
how about the environmental
and consumer groups arguments?

1593
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,520
Uh,

1594
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,540
how would they respond?

1595
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,410
Well,

1596
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,750
their response has been pretty consistent.

1597
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,640
Let's shift the burden of proof,

1598
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,240
uh,

1599
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,970
back to the private sector
to demonstrate safety.

1600
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,910
Why should the public have the
burden to demonstrate danger?

1601
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:02,900
In all of these cases,

1602
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,920
it takes too long and you often
can't demonstrate a danger.

1603
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,480
So let's have the,

1604
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,620
let's have the expense,

1605
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:09,970
uh,

1606
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,803
the time,

1607
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,150
uh,

1608
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,983
and uh,

1609
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:12,620
uh,

1610
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:12,911
the,

1611
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:13,101
the,

1612
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:16,730
the burden to rest on the
private sector a second,

1613
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:20,480
they'll argue that evidence is
insufficient to justify finding safety.

1614
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,990
So they will delay for the same reasons
that industry would delay saying that

1615
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:27,620
the evidence is insufficient to
justify increased regulation.

1616
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,110
But if this burden of proof is switched,

1617
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:30,651
uh,

1618
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,481
then the,

1619
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:31,851
the,

1620
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:32,120
uh,

1621
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,953
uh,

1622
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,790
uh,

1623
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:34,010
uh,

1624
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,190
the,

1625
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,530
it's basically providing
a mirror image to,

1626
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:36,950
uh,

1627
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:37,341
the,

1628
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:37,800
uh,

1629
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,320
form a regulatory regime.

1630
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,940
Susceptibility.

1631
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,150
Think about how susceptibility
varies in the population.

1632
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:44,930
Again,

1633
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,550
all the cases that we've looked at in the,

1634
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:51,740
in the course so far have involved
those that are especially vulnerable,

1635
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,000
those that are especially,

1636
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,360
uh,

1637
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,193
exposed.

1638
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:55,400
Uh,

1639
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,370
so look at a exposure patterns
and how they vary by age class.

1640
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,440
Look at variability by ethnicity.

1641
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:00,950
Uh,

1642
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:01,640
look at,

1643
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,210
uh,

1644
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,960
differences in use patterns or
behavior among different ethnic groups,

1645
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,440
uh,

1646
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,790
perhaps in different seasons,

1647
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:08,180
uh,

1648
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,830
perhaps in different parts of the country.

1649
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:10,760
So that,

1650
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,300
uh,

1651
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:11,931
looking at,

1652
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:12,270
uh,

1653
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:12,500
uh,

1654
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:17,420
variability and how that plays out and
how goods and bads are distributed is

1655
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,980
really important to all the cases.

1656
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,520
Uh,

1657
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,370
think about mixtures don't
just regulate single,

1658
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,270
uh,

1659
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,830
products or a single compounds,

1660
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,590
but think about regulating
the entire mixture.

1661
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,290
Uh,

1662
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,010
we've seen that with the respect
to diesel exhaust tobacco.

1663
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,430
Another good example,

1664
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,230
it's the mixture that's being regulated,

1665
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:37,170
not the individual component
with the exception of nicotine,

1666
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,100
uh,

1667
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,240
aggregated exposure.

1668
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:44,040
So think about where you might get exposed
to the same kind of a threat from a

1669
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,180
variety of different sources,

1670
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:45,541
from air,

1671
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:45,961
from water,

1672
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:46,794
from foods.

1673
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,320
Think about the pace of review,

1674
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,521
make sure that,

1675
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:50,910
uh,

1676
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,530
if you give an agency a burden,

1677
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:53,041
uh,

1678
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:53,874
to uh,

1679
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,470
know transforma a,

1680
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:55,780
uh,

1681
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:55,990
uh,

1682
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,990
an industrial sector from,

1683
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,350
uh,

1684
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,270
being risky to being safe,

1685
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,630
uh,

1686
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,700
what's the pace of review
that you're going to demand?

1687
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,450
Uh,

1688
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,770
how long are you going to give them?

1689
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,450
And remember the idea of a new technology
that would change a vehicle emissions

1690
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,100
under the clean air act that requires a
four year period that the industry has

1691
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:16,800
to retool to think about how
they're going to redesign their,

1692
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,430
their,

1693
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,440
their engines to meet that new standard.

1694
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,970
So restricted use and label changes and
ecological restrictions or are often,

1695
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,390
uh,

1696
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,600
uh,

1697
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,990
critical arguments of
environmental and consumer use,

1698
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,261
consumer,

1699
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:29,540
uh,

1700
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,120
uh,

1701
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,930
uh,

1702
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:31,830
protection groups,

1703
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,210
uh,

1704
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,350
and environmental testing,

1705
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,250
uh,

1706
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,520
make certain that the environmental
testing is independently conducted

1707
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,501
and,

1708
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:41,160
uh,

1709
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,580
uh,

1710
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,320
finally are the most exposed.

1711
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,270
Also the most susceptible.

1712
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,960
Try to figure out how to adjust
the legal regime if you can,

1713
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,500
to protect those that are exposed
and those that are most at risk.

1714
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:57,420
And can you do that in a way that would
allow a continued use of the technology?

1715
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,010
So it can you protect kids from tobacco,

1716
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:02,670
uh,

1717
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,670
in a way that would provide sufficient
respect for the value that we assign to

1718
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,600
the freedom to choose.

1719
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,483
And finally,

1720
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,030
uh,

1721
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,550
opposed federal preemption
of state and local,

1722
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:15,420
uh,

1723
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,560
local controls.

1724
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,370
So,

1725
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:17,501
uh,

1726
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:19,620
environmental groups will commonly oppose,

1727
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,180
uh,

1728
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,580
a preemption because they want
a thousand regulations to bloom.

1729
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,260
They want California to have
the opportunity to adopt
more rigorous regulations,

1730
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:28,711
uh,

1731
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:33,000
because California's population
and a consumer market share is so

1732
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,560
extraordinarily high as a percentage of
the u s what happens in California is

1733
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,120
going to happen in the United States.

1734
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,760
And what happens in the United
States is going to happen abroad.

1735
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,230
So if you restrict the ability of a
lower level of government to adopt these

1736
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,064
regulations,

1737
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,640
uh,

1738
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,520
then you are not going to
have the innovation in,

1739
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:50,850
in,

1740
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,420
uh,

1741
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:51,720
uh,

1742
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,850
legal reform that you otherwise might.

1743
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,320
So I'll leave you with,

1744
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:55,500
uh,

1745
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:55,980
these,

1746
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,220
uh,

1747
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,070
these ideas to think about,

1748
00:46:58,071 --> 00:46:58,700
uh,

1749
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,050
uh,

1750
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:04,050
and how you might conduct
these comparisons and also
how you might take some of

1751
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,200
these strategies to the
problems that you care about.

1752
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,460
So I'm going to break here.

1753
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:08,671
And,

1754
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:08,881
uh,

1755
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:11,190
I think that we are all
set to give the exams back.

1756
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:11,790
So,

1757
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,030
uh,

1758
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:12,661
if you could,

1759
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:13,260
uh,

1760
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,510
perhaps spread yourselves
out across the front,

1761
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:17,220
so not everybody comes to the same place.

1762
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:17,760
Uh,

1763
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,570
that would be terrific.
