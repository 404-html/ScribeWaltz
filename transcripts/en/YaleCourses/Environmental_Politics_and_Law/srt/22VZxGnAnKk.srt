1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,491
Okay.

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:03,324
Let's start in,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,600
got a fairly large agenda today

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,050
and I wanted to remind you that next
week we're moving on to air quality.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,040
So check your syllabus and,

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:18,810
uh,

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,020
uh,

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,920
read the material for section next week.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,370
And today I want to talk
about key principles in law,

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,211
uh,

11
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,580
one being preemption and
the other being defamation.

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,590
And to give you a couple of case histories
and I'm going to start out talking

13
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:37,660
about Bates v Dow.

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,690
And then I want to talk about two cases,

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,660
one on product disparagement,

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,190
uh,

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,880
and the other one is known as the LR case.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,730
Uh,

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,310
and another is a case that was brought
by the Texas cattleman's association

20
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:55,390
against Oprah Winfrey.

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,230
And I'll show you a couple
of video clips of that.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,483
First of all,

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,760
preemption has its origin
in the constitution,

24
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,020
uh,

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,430
within the supremacy clause.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,300
It states this constitution and the laws
of the u s shall be the supreme law of

27
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:13,080
the land.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,360
And the judges in every
state shall be bound thereby,

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,390
so that within air quality law,

30
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:20,820
within a pesticide management law,

31
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,200
within pharmaceutical law,

32
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:22,711
uh,

33
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:23,760
tobacco law,

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,900
uh,

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,980
occupational law,

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,820
uh,

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,320
states are prohibited
from adopting standards,

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,200
certain standards,

39
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,801
uh,

40
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,634
that are,

41
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,540
uh,

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,920
different than the federal government.

43
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,940
And the purpose behind
this is not to create a,

44
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:38,400
a,

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,561
a,

46
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,710
a patchwork quilt that,

47
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:41,280
uh,

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,100
is really comprised of
nonuniform standards.

49
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,971
So that a,

50
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,160
when corporations wish to trade goods,

51
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:47,620
uh,

52
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,800
or provide services
across state boundaries,

53
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,930
they basically had the same expectations.

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,320
It's often applied to situations that
are risky or products that are risky.

55
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,970
And the failure to warn is often a key
question and we'll raise that in the

56
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,210
case.

57
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,790
Today we respect to pesticides.

58
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,450
Uh,

59
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,680
Congress traditionally deferred to
states to regulate threats to health and

60
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,514
safety,

61
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:11,891
uh,

62
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,320
but since 1970,

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,230
it's exercises power,

64
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:15,690
uh,

65
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,760
to preempt state or local regulation,

66
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,671
uh,

67
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,650
in a number of areas,

68
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,700
particularly,

69
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,270
uh,

70
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,270
with respect to warning
labels on pesticides.

71
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,480
So there are a variety of
theories of damage recovery.

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,310
So if you imagine that,

73
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:29,850
uh,

74
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,390
uh,

75
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,841
say,

76
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:31,230
uh,

77
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,420
someone comes to your home and,

78
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,020
uh,

79
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,853
uh,

80
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,750
promises to give you a green lawn,

81
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,410
uh,

82
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,740
by applying fertilizers
and insecticides and a,

83
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,331
all of a sudden,

84
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:42,750
you know,

85
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,980
you notice an accurate,

86
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,300
uh,

87
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,630
a taste in your well water and also your,

88
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,231
your,

89
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:49,590
uh,

90
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,370
uh,

91
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,580
children start to feel awkward or strange.

92
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,510
Uh,

93
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,420
can you find out that the chemicals
that were applied were neurotoxic

94
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,254
substances?

95
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:58,711
Uh,

96
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,160
and,

97
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,680
and what,

98
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,700
what are your rights?

99
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,540
Uh,

100
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,620
basically you could argue that we have a,

101
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,570
we have a percussion
section out there in the,

102
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,081
in the,

103
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,650
uh,

104
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,090
on the street throwing I think a rocks
or bricks into one of these big metal

105
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,660
barrels.

106
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,830
So I apologize for that.

107
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,100
So you can imagine yourself in a situation
where you conclude that federal law

108
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,600
didn't protect you against that,

109
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,441
uh,

110
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,790
you feel like you've been damaged.

111
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,540
It's going to cost you money to either
drill a new well or to put in filtration

112
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,374
equipment.

113
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,570
And what about the health
effects on your family?

114
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,351
Uh,

115
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,830
so there,

116
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,540
there are a variety of theories
of damage recovery and one is,

117
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,991
uh,

118
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:38,321
that,

119
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:38,710
uh,

120
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,450
the failure to warn provides
a justification for seeking
a recovery of damages.

121
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,703
So,

122
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,220
uh,

123
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,690
remember what I argued about the,

124
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,150
the difficulty that,

125
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:49,630
uh,

126
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,250
most people have an understanding,

127
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:52,090
warning labels,

128
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,721
uh,

129
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,051
the,

130
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:56,620
the difficulty of taking complicated
scientific information and,

131
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,920
and reducing it in a way that
would make it intelligible and,

132
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,750
and make you capable of knowing,

133
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,171
you know,

134
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,780
how you should behave in
order to prevent risks.

135
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,573
For example,

136
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,150
uh,

137
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,060
should you have,

138
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,280
should you be responsible to know that
you have sandy soils and that your well

139
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:15,790
is a shallow well and it's an old
well and the casing is cracked?

140
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,030
I mean,

141
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,300
are you really responsible to know that a,

142
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,200
should that information
be on a warning label?

143
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,110
Negligence is another theory for recovery.

144
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,730
So was the,

145
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,031
uh,

146
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,840
the product,

147
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,300
uh,

148
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,560
uh,

149
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,070
made in a negligent way or was
it used in a negligent way?

150
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,200
How about design defects?

151
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,160
Uh,

152
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,010
listening to good morning America today.

153
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,791
Uh,

154
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,220
I was intrigued by litigation that,

155
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:39,391
uh,

156
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:39,701
is,

157
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,534
is growing,

158
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,230
uh,

159
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,230
class action suits against Toyota because
of their accelerator pad catching or a

160
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,910
brake defects.

161
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,601
So,

162
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,050
uh,

163
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,351
some,

164
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:52,430
some defect in production or,

165
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:55,940
or design that leads to a higher level,

166
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:59,740
a higher concentration of risk
or hazard in subsequent damage.

167
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,160
How about a failure to
disclose incident reports?

168
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
So that Dow Chemical Company was,

169
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,400
was fine,

170
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
nearly $800,000,

171
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:08,710
uh,

172
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,360
because it had been,

173
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,243
uh,

174
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,530
uh,

175
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,630
reported it to Dow by a variety of,

176
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,000
uh,

177
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,350
uh,

178
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,220
families that,

179
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,021
uh,

180
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:16,900
that they felt that,

181
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:17,050
uh,

182
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,760
they had,

183
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:17,980
uh,

184
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,730
medical problems that were associated
with using their products and,

185
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,050
uh,

186
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,790
they were required under federal
pesticide law to report those incidents,

187
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,210
uh,

188
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,070
back to the environmental
protection agency.

189
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,611
Uh,

190
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,190
and they did not do so
within the time limit,

191
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:35,380
there was a significant delay.

192
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,590
So the failure to disclose
incident reports and again,

193
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,250
with the,

194
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,640
the,

195
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:39,980
uh,

196
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,230
auto defects that,

197
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:41,410
uh,

198
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:41,890
we're,

199
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,260
we're a witnessing and the,

200
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,094
in the press and,

201
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,011
and,

202
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,640
uh,

203
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,750
in the showrooms today,

204
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,470
uh,

205
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,240
the same issue applies.

206
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,390
So when did the corporation
know that the pedals stuck,

207
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,881
uh,

208
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,130
or that the brake system,

209
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,460
uh,

210
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,030
was,

211
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,301
was,

212
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,134
uh,

213
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,243
not working.

214
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,820
So the failure to,

215
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,150
uh,

216
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,620
to report back to,

217
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,020
to,

218
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,280
uh,

219
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,920
government agencies that have
regulatory responsibilities,

220
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,650
whether it's pharmaceuticals or,

221
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:06,800
or cars or,

222
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,170
or pesticides or cosmetics or foods.

223
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:09,860
Uh,

224
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,170
these generally carry
significant penalties.

225
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,113
And

226
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,120
because of preemption that's built
into pesticide law and air quality law,

227
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:20,910
et Cetera,

228
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,200
uh,

229
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,950
states have often denied access to courts,

230
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,760
uh,

231
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,040
to use these theories of recovery to,

232
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,070
to secure compensation so that
the state courts have often,

233
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:33,870
uh,

234
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,340
uh,

235
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,880
uh,

236
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,470
not agreed to hear the cases.

237
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,300
Uh,

238
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,630
this is why a Bates,

239
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,950
the Dow is so important.

240
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,120
Uh,

241
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,290
Bates is a case in which a
29 peanut growers in Texas,

242
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,160
uh,

243
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,260
allege that Dow agrosciences,

244
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,830
uh,

245
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,220
had,

246
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,470
had produced a chemical called strong arm,

247
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,940
a strong arm.

248
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,920
They claim damage there.

249
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,430
Peanut plants back in the
year 2000 and the plate,

250
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,000
the pesticide label itself claim that,

251
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:02,834
uh,

252
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,870
use of strong arm as recommended in
all areas where peanuts are grown.

253
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,270
Now when it was used in the Texas a peanut
farm land where the soils exceeded a

254
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,990
Ph of 7.2,

255
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,590
it damaged both the peanut crop
and it feel to control the weeds.

256
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,500
So,

257
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,660
uh,

258
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,493
the,

259
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,980
the activity of this chemical is
mediated by the acidity of the soil.

260
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,090
Uh,

261
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,200
and by 2001 EPA approved a
new label for the chemical,

262
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,160
including a new warning,

263
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:35,540
do not apply strong arm to soils
with a Ph of 7.2 or greater.

264
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,010
So this case was decided in
2005 a this label was in,

265
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,080
in force,

266
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:41,900
uh,

267
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,220
for four years before the,

268
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:43,280
uh,

269
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,570
the decision date.

270
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,150
So eventually,

271
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,420
uh,

272
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,850
the case wound its way
up to the supreme court.

273
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,980
And this is quite,

274
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,890
this is quite a feat in many instances.

275
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,450
Uh,

276
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,160
claims that are brought in state courts,

277
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,820
uh,

278
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,430
do not make their way
up to the supreme court,

279
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,360
can often take decades or
even a half a century before,

280
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,080
uh,

281
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,030
cases is believed to be appropriate for
judicial review by the highest court in

282
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:11,864
the country.

283
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,590
So they found the congress surely would
have expressed its intent more clearly

284
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,550
if it had meant to deprive injured
parties of along available form of

285
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,384
compensation.

286
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,381
Moreover,

287
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:24,620
this history emphasizes the importance
of providing an incentive to

288
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:28,250
manufacturers to use the utmost care
and distributing inhere inherently

289
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:29,360
dangerous items.

290
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,823
In other words,

291
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,170
the Supreme Court was looking at,

292
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,920
uh,

293
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,371
the,

294
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:34,761
these,

295
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,080
uh,

296
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,420
uh,

297
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,170
lawsuits to seek recovery
is really a last resort.

298
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,200
So it represents the
failure of federal law.

299
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,090
It represents the failure of state
law or local law to offer sufficient

300
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,420
environmental protection or
protection of public health.

301
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,040
So what's a damaged party to do?

302
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,830
What are you going to do
if you've been damaged?

303
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,291
Well,

304
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:55,541
you,

305
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,390
you probably would consider litigation.

306
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,880
So the Supreme Court,

307
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,700
uh,

308
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,261
continued.

309
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,830
It seems likely unlikely that Congress
considered a relatively obscure

310
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,941
provision,

311
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:08,080
like section one 36 VB,

312
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:08,760
uh,

313
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,780
which is a preemption clause to get
pesticide manufacturers virtual immunity

314
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,700
from certain forms of tort liability.

315
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,210
And we'd been pointed to no evidence
that such tort suits lead led to a crazy

316
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,810
quilt of Fifth Fra,

317
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,550
federal pesticide law standards,

318
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,930
or otherwise created any real
hardship for manufacturers or EPA.

319
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,380
So the argument that you would
have an unequal on uneven,

320
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,340
uh,

321
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,491
uh,

322
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,710
regulatory playing field among the states,

323
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,310
uh,

324
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,310
had no substance to it or
that the manufacturers would
be damaged significantly

325
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,731
by,

326
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,030
uh,

327
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,863
uh,

328
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,810
by these claims because a,

329
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:46,650
they're expensive,

330
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,420
they're time consuming,

331
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,100
and a few people actually have the
resources or capacity to bring,

332
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:53,700
uh,

333
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,121
the,

334
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:54,954
the lawsuits.

335
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,000
So central questions today really a will
involve a question of freedom of speech

336
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,100
and when is it appropriate
to limit speech about,

337
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,560
uh,

338
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,990
environmental and health hazards,

339
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,470
uh,

340
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,970
intellectual property rights,

341
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,391
you know,

342
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:10,710
who should own the right
to a knowledge of risk?

343
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,181
Should it be,

344
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:12,510
uh,

345
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,020
uh,

346
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,770
uh,

347
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,270
should corporations be
capable of holding that as a,

348
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:16,750
a,

349
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,070
a,

350
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,870
a secret or are they out?

351
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,040
Should they be obligated
to disclose that to uh,

352
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,200
to the public in the form of a warning
label or a disclosure of an incident

353
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,034
report?

354
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,650
What should the standard of proof
be a and how should the falsity of a

355
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:32,280
statement,

356
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,490
uh,

357
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,420
be judged the falsity of the statement
on a label or the falsity of a statement

358
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,470
made by a party,

359
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:37,980
uh,

360
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,980
that is challenging a corporation that
they were damaged by exposure to their

361
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:43,944
product.

362
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,401
Uh,

363
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:47,490
and where should the burden of proof
watch or the burden of proof why with a

364
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:52,380
plaintiff to prove the
falsity of criticism or the
defendant approve a truth of,

365
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,240
of criticism and to,

366
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,793
to uh,

367
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,160
uh,

368
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,970
explore this area of product
disparagement a more fully.

369
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,680
I want you to consider one case.

370
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,520
Uh,

371
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,630
this is a case of a,

372
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:05,400
of a chemical known as Al are,

373
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:05,881
uh,

374
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:06,181
that,

375
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:06,600
uh,

376
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:06,781
can,

377
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,520
you probably did not experience,

378
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,451
uh,

379
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:09,781
but,

380
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:10,290
uh,

381
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:10,441
uh,

382
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,820
it was in wide use in
the United States and,

383
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,110
uh,

384
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,310
in different parts of the world,

385
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:14,730
uh,

386
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,980
back in the 1980s and early 1990s.

387
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,090
And it was used on apples and
it was used on apple orchards.

388
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,730
Basically to cause a stem thickening.

389
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,101
Uh,

390
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,690
so it would hold the apple on the tree
longer and it would keep the apple from

391
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,760
falling down and getting bruised.

392
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,000
So it would maintain the commercial
quality and the great of the Apple.

393
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,330
And it would also cause uniform ripening.

394
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,990
Uniform ripening is important because
you don't want part of a tree,

395
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,670
perhaps that's facing the sunshine,

396
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,240
uh,

397
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,410
to have apples that are ripe.

398
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:43,781
And then the,

399
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:44,280
the,

400
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,551
the,

401
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:45,384
uh,

402
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:45,871
all the,

403
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:45,971
uh,

404
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:46,804
apples that are,

405
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:46,980
uh,

406
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,210
on the north side of the tree,

407
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,900
uh,

408
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,270
in more shade that would remain green.

409
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,340
So it provided economic advantage to,

410
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,780
to orchard owners,

411
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:55,980
uh,

412
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,190
in,

413
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,460
in a variety of ways.

414
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,613
It's,

415
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,970
this is a systemic compound,

416
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,870
which is interesting.

417
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,800
It means that it's absorbed up through
the plant roots itself into the plant

418
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:06,634
tissue.

419
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,631
So,

420
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:07,770
uh,

421
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,620
you may think that,

422
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:09,240
uh,

423
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,460
uh,

424
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,790
some residues are only on the
surface of a fruit or a vegetable,

425
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,290
and if you peel it or if you wash it,

426
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,400
you could get rid of it.

427
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,510
Here's an example of,

428
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,650
of a compound that,

429
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,230
uh,

430
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,030
uh,

431
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,600
that would not be helpful for.

432
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,330
It's not easy to detect.

433
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:22,870
Uh,

434
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,310
when this chemical was
being reviewed and became a,

435
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,080
uh,

436
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,810
public,

437
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,643
uh,

438
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,583
public target,

439
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,643
uh,

440
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,240
for criticism of,

441
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,410
of its manufacturer.

442
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:32,771
Uh,

443
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:33,450
I went up to,

444
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:33,940
uh,

445
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,730
the state of Massachusetts because the
state of Massachusetts with trying to

446
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,330
figure out if they were going to
ban the compound as it was detected

447
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:41,440
increasingly in foods.

448
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,930
And I went to their laboratories,

449
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,400
their state laboratories,

450
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,810
and they had not even developed a
detection method yet speaking to their

451
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,644
analytic chemist.

452
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,190
They couldn't,

453
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,500
they didn't even know how
to find this in foods.

454
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,260
So thinking about that,

455
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,930
what that means is that the government
approved the use of a chemical on certain

456
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:06,031
crops when it knew that there was no
accepted method for detecting it in a,

457
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:07,610
in the food or in,

458
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,160
in processed forms of the food,

459
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,690
uh,

460
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,140
or in water supplies if it,

461
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,030
if it happened to
contaminate water supplies.

462
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,441
So that's,

463
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:17,350
that's quite curious and it
might give you some ideas,

464
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,861
uh,

465
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:18,311
about,

466
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:18,750
uh,

467
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,090
uh,

468
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,150
prior requirements before
introducing new technologies.

469
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,630
So it gives,

470
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,473
uh,

471
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,403
uh,

472
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,570
it has an unusual characteristic.

473
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,650
It produces a unsymmetrical
die methyl hydrazine,

474
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,873
Udm h,

475
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,520
which is also a space shuttle rocket fuel,

476
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,670
but only under conditions
where the chemical is heated.

477
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,391
Now,

478
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,180
where would a food be heated?

479
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,650
Well,

480
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,070
it's commonly heated when
it's so when it's processed,

481
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,541
uh,

482
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,750
or when it's pasteurized.

483
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,471
So,

484
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:47,740
uh,

485
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,140
when you take an apple
and you grind it up and,

486
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:50,920
and uh,

487
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,071
uh,

488
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,620
you squeeze all the juice out
of it and to make apple juice,

489
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,070
uh,

490
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,070
it's commonly heated up for the purposes
of killing bacteria and protecting

491
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:00,724
human health.

492
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,141
Apple juice,

493
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:02,500
uh,

494
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:02,830
uh,

495
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,210
at in the 1980s was also exploding into
the marketplace and in part because of,

496
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:07,900
of different,

497
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,200
uh,

498
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,550
packaging technologies.

499
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,510
So it used to be available
in large glass bottles,

500
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:13,991
uh,

501
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:14,441
but the,

502
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,240
the advent of juice boxes,

503
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,811
uh,

504
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:18,400
so that the children would take,

505
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:18,970
uh,

506
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,450
these,

507
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,800
these flavored juices to school on a
routine basis and in a really small

508
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,810
cardboard and plastic containers,

509
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,620
it costs,

510
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,900
caused apple juice
consumption to skyrocket.

511
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,140
So that apple juice within
a matter of a decade,

512
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,350
uh,

513
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,280
became one of the more heavily
consumed foods by young children.

514
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,960
So it was introduced by Uniroyal in 1966,

515
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,590
uh,

516
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,420
and registered by the
Department of Agriculture
because EPA wasn't in existence

517
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,010
until 1970 and in 1973 a,

518
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,460
it was found to produce cancer in mice.

519
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,180
Uh,

520
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,280
between 1977 and 78,

521
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,960
the National Cancer Institute,

522
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,230
uh,

523
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,890
uh,

524
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,720
found that that study
was credible and they,

525
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,310
they conducted their own studies,

526
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:01,940
uh,

527
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,040
that found carcinogenic
effects in animals.

528
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,521
You know,

529
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,390
raising the question,

530
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:08,690
how should we look at data
from animal testing and what,

531
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,780
what should we infer from that
about a human health risk?

532
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,621
Well,

533
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,930
during conservative
political administrations,

534
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,910
we've tended as a society,

535
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:18,320
not to worry too much about,

536
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:18,620
uh,

537
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,250
these,

538
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,890
these low level cancer
risks in the food supply.

539
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,140
But remember that at this point in time,

540
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,330
the Delaney clause in the Food Drug and
cosmetic act was in place that had what

541
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:32,180
was called the de Minimus
risk standard built into it.

542
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,600
So it also had the food and
Drug Administration that
was interpreting the de

543
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,550
standard to allow low
levels of risk in the,

544
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:41,480
in the food supply.

545
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,220
So EPA concluded eventually in
1980 that it was carcinogenic,

546
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,791
uh,

547
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,240
and then negotiated with
Uniroyal for several years.

548
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,860
And that produced no action.

549
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,150
Uh,

550
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,170
in 1985,

551
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,940
they found that both Lr,

552
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:58,550
which is the parent
compound and the metabolite,

553
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,400
the Udm h was a probable human carcinogen.

554
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,550
So this is the next step
up in the level of concern.

555
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,500
It's not just an animal carcinogen,

556
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,430
probable human,

557
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:07,971
uh,

558
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:09,140
the next step up by the way,

559
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:10,640
is known human carcinogen.

560
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,260
Uh,

561
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,700
and there are more than a hundred now,

562
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:13,930
uh,

563
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,180
uh,

564
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,011
compounds that are,

565
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:17,360
are characterized as
known human carcinogens,

566
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,180
such as benzene and,

567
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:19,990
uh,

568
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,900
a one three Butte,

569
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:21,651
Butte of dying,

570
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:24,080
which exists in diesel exhaust and,

571
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:24,261
uh,

572
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:24,681
other,

573
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:24,860
uh,

574
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,693
combustion,

575
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,540
uh,

576
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,880
situations such as in wood smoke or,

577
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,421
or,

578
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:29,750
uh,

579
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,330
hm.

580
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,020
Virtually anytime fossil fuel is,

581
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,361
is,

582
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:32,930
uh,

583
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,710
uh,

584
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,670
being combusted.

585
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,770
And in 1985,

586
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,880
uh,

587
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,730
some feedback from their own
scientific advisory panel,

588
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,270
uh,

589
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,430
raise questions about
the quality of the data,

590
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,770
can you actually calculate a cancer risk?

591
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,840
So what is the threat,

592
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,703
uh,

593
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,710
and what can publicly be
stated about that threat?

594
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,221
Well,

595
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,050
the natural resources defense council,

596
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,000
one of our largest environmental groups,

597
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,481
uh,

598
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,190
conducted their own analysis of,

599
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,300
of kids' exposure,

600
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:03,190
recognizing that kids were eating a
lot of apples and apple sauce and,

601
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,550
and drinking a lot of apple juice.

602
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,050
It was a very common,

603
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,650
uh,

604
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:06,711
uh,

605
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:09,480
drink to be served to infants in,

606
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,340
in place of,

607
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,400
of infant formula or milk and has
the EPA violated the public trust.

608
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,810
So let me see if I can get this going.

609
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,280
This is a 60 minutes report
that was prepared on this,

610
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,230
uh,

611
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,510
controversy so that the Natural
Resources Defense Council,

612
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,170
uh,

613
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,750
brought their study to
16 minutes and ask them,

614
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,560
would you like to release
this information on your show?

615
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,221
And,

616
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:36,790
uh,

617
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,270
the,

618
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,571
the,

619
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:38,350
uh,

620
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,531
uh,

621
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,940
answer was yes.

622
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,320
Who was

623
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,333
most of

624
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,720
you met him some data from this one call

625
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,070
for more than one a year down

626
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,100
the EPA that the EPA is known
about the cancer for 16 years.

627
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,283
There's no question.

628
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,900
Uh,

629
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,940
you told me something that,

630
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,300
I mean,

631
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,150
it's brand new.

632
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,510
It wouldn't get on the market because we,

633
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,513
you

634
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,710
one of the

635
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,340
pesticide gets it,

636
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,370
the license gets it.

637
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,050
It's on the market despite
what everybody might think.

638
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,350
The burden of carrying a reasonable
response basically goes onto the golf.

639
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,163
All right,

640
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,400
Margaret Prosecutors.

641
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,731
What you're saying,

642
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:16,290
we can't take them off because they were
already on the market and they went on

643
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:16,790
the market.

644
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,623
We didn't know that.

645
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,870
That's,

646
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,830
that's the paradox.

647
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,400
Is it fair to say more than there are
laws on the books that are putting,

648
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,560
all of us particularly are filled quickly,

649
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,973
quickly

650
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,270
while Dr. Warren Law,

651
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,240
which requires him to balance the
health risks to the public against the

652
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,100
economic benefits to the growers,

653
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,780
Congressman Juries of course,

654
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,313
but

655
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,520
why is the flu?

656
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,110
Because our laboratory animal not

657
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,180
being pulled off the market.

658
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,463
Jack,

659
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,250
you'd like to take it off the but

660
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,270
the manufacturer oil.

661
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,540
It makes us capable of good,

662
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,374
successful.

663
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Let us show.

664
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,900
That's his job.

665
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,670
He's with the environment I

666
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,903
all

667
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,560
wasting away a kid and then

668
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,633
the benefit

669
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,683
that

670
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,190
he drinks so much apple juice,

671
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,580
preschoolers race 18 times where apple,

672
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
who's done his or her mother.

673
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,840
If those apples,

674
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,130
the cancer risk is,

675
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,590
hi John Hathaway,

676
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,810
he's a senior attorney for the
natural resources defense council

677
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,313
agent news.

678
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,130
But Aka going to cause cancer children
with a lot of time you chemical,

679
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:12,460
which makes the design under the three
our declined to be interviewed for this

680
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:14,800
record or in the letter they said,

681
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,680
[inaudible] give you that exists
is negligible nonetheless,

682
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:25,951
preliminary results from your own study
already young high levels of cancer in

683
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:27,154
the laboratory

684
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,500
to say defendant's counsel has
completed the most careful study.

685
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,091
Yeah,

686
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,650
it will be effective in that aside.

687
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,783
And seven

688
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,063
30

689
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,633
what,

690
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,583
what

691
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,280
the level of cancer,

692
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,050
what that means is that

693
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,543
one.

694
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,100
What about parents?

695
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,510
[inaudible] one

696
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,050
[inaudible] [inaudible] it doesn't cost.

697
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,983
You kind of

698
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,920
need to send his children would be,

699
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,890
it was several hundred times.

700
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,833
Yeah.

701
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,823
Yeah.

702
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,441
I'm sorry.

703
00:22:58,441 --> 00:22:59,640
This will take just one second.

704
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,743
Yeah.

705
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,980
So think about what Janet Hathaway,

706
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:16,310
the senior attorney just
said over a lifetime.

707
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:20,900
One child that out of every 4,000 or so
of our preschoolers will develop cancer

708
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,250
from just these eight pesticides.

709
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,841
I think about the wording.

710
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,370
The phrasing got very carefully.

711
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,290
This is quantitative risk assessment.

712
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,290
It's loaded with uncertainty
from many different sources.

713
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,124
You're,

714
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,620
you're forced to infer
from animal evidence.

715
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,820
You're forced to,

716
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:35,691
to,

717
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:36,200
uh,

718
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,321
uh,

719
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:37,041
understand,

720
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:37,191
uh,

721
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:37,461
the,

722
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:38,810
the pattern of exposure,

723
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,350
uh,

724
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,720
how the compound might
behave inside the human body.

725
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,341
Uh,

726
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:42,861
then she said,

727
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:46,490
Al are the most potent con cancer causing
and our food supply as a substance

728
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,410
sprayed on apples to keep
them on the trees longer.

729
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,911
Uh,

730
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:52,070
and what we're talking about is a cancer
causing agent used on food that EPA

731
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,380
knows is going to cause cancer
for thousands of children,

732
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,011
uh,

733
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:55,970
over their lifetime.

734
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,120
These are our,

735
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,470
uh,

736
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,720
statements a of,

737
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,630
of certainty,

738
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,111
uh,

739
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:00,441
that,

740
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:00,650
uh,

741
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,610
caused widespread fear in the population.

742
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,340
Senator Joe Lieberman spoke to me,

743
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,730
uh,

744
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:07,880
uh,

745
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,840
during this situation and he said he
walked immediately after watching 60

746
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,460
minutes over to his refrigerator,

747
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,510
he took out his jar of apple juice and
dumped it down the drain and started

748
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,740
making phone calls.

749
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,400
This happened to all over the country
is millions of people who had witnessed

750
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,220
this,

751
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,260
a Jack Moore,

752
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,620
uh,

753
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,350
who you saw the acting
EPA administrator said,

754
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,330
uh,

755
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,260
that the evidence,

756
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:30,830
yes,

757
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,010
uh,

758
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,360
that he relied upon was suitable for a
decision to say that Al r and D was a

759
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:36,194
carcinogen.

760
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,230
And the media reaction
was really quite striking.

761
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:39,980
Uh,

762
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,440
all of the major media
outlets pick this story up.

763
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,821
Newsweek,

764
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:44,654
et Cetera,

765
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,670
Donahue on the Donahue show.

766
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:46,950
Uh,

767
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,511
he said,

768
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:48,141
don't look now,

769
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:49,490
but we're poisoning our kids.

770
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,180
Uh,

771
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,180
the consumer reaction was really quite
a rapid and a devastating for the apple

772
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:56,474
industry.

773
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,120
A apple product sales
dropped 30% in a month,

774
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,530
uh,

775
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,870
particularly on apple juice school
boards in New York and Virginia and

776
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:05,840
California stop serving apples
in their lunch programs.

777
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:06,500
Uh,

778
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,870
growers claimed losses of
$250 million and engaged,

779
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,290
uh,

780
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,070
they engage in a lawsuit against both
60 minutes as well as the natural

781
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,210
resources defense council.

782
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,530
Uh,

783
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,600
within a matter of six months.

784
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,371
The economic,

785
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:21,510
uh,

786
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,890
uh,

787
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,890
concerns were so high that the industry
itself was begging EPA to please

788
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,630
regulate and prohibit
the use of this chemical.

789
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,820
Now that's really quite striking.

790
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,220
So that you've got a really,

791
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:34,400
a,

792
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,160
kind of a very different type
of regulatory theory here.

793
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:37,731
Uh,

794
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:39,170
what is regulation doing?

795
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:39,670
Uh,

796
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,450
it's really providing a
sense of legitimacy to
manufacturers of different kinds

797
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:49,230
of products so that if you know
that a chemical or product didn't,

798
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,180
it could be a food,

799
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,110
it could be a car,

800
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:51,740
uh,

801
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,600
if you know that it's been reviewed by,

802
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,220
by a regulatory agency,

803
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,640
uh,

804
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,640
that act of regulation
a really constitutes
certification of that products,

805
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,920
a utility and also its
safety in the marketplace.

806
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,510
So the fact that the,

807
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:05,810
uh,

808
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,081
uh,

809
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:06,291
the,

810
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:10,790
the growers and the grocery stores and
even Uniroyal asked Epa to move quickly,

811
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,250
uh,

812
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,650
so that the economic damage,

813
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:12,980
uh,

814
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,830
would be limited and consumer
confidence could be restored,

815
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,640
particularly because this product
was not used on all apple products.

816
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,250
So it really is a form
of symbolic politics,

817
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:23,540
which I think is quite striking.

818
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,680
Uh,

819
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,191
so that,

820
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:25,520
uh,

821
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,690
regardless of whether or not the
regulations are health protective,

822
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,170
uh,

823
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,160
they create a sense of legitimacy of
products and services in the marketplace.

824
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,170
So that in one sense,

825
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,430
uh,

826
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,520
are our corporations
need these regulations,

827
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:40,971
uh,

828
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:41,481
so that,

829
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:41,571
uh,

830
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:42,050
they,

831
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,510
they,

832
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:42,870
uh,

833
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,790
create consumer confidence.

834
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,580
So the Washington apple growers,

835
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,460
there are 4,700 of them claimed that
while there was no evidence linking Al

836
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:54,330
already human cancer and the
animal evidence was insufficient,

837
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,050
uh,

838
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,710
and they called this a,

839
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:57,630
uh,

840
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,680
product disparagement,

841
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,090
trade libel case.

842
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,700
Uh,

843
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,920
and in this situation,

844
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,720
the growers face the burden of proof.

845
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,340
So they needed to prove that the
statements were made knowingly,

846
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:08,950
uh,

847
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,870
and to be false,

848
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,560
the statements were deliberately
made to induce monetary damage.

849
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,660
And this is a form of trade libel law,

850
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:19,500
defamation.

851
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,370
Uh,

852
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,270
so there are,

853
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,440
there are several forms of,

854
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,300
of uh,

855
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,660
uh,

856
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,960
libel slander and sedition libel.

857
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,170
A,

858
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,620
the definition is defamation
through print materials.

859
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,570
Slander is oral defamation,

860
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,140
ah,

861
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,250
in the English common law,

862
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:32,731
tradition,

863
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:34,230
libel and private enterprise,

864
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,950
I generally found
favorably to a plaintiffs.

865
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,030
And sedition you'll recall
is any political criticism
that tended to diminish

866
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:44,340
respect for government
laws and public officials.

867
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,990
Common law definition of libel,

868
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,891
I was decided,

869
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:50,250
uh,

870
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:50,640
uh,

871
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:50,910
by,

872
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,021
uh,

873
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:54,000
a famous court case in 1933.

874
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,470
It covers all written communications
that tend to expose one to public hatred,

875
00:27:58,471 --> 00:27:59,910
Shame Co Obloquy,

876
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,750
uh,

877
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,583
cartoon Lee,

878
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:01,890
uh,

879
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,940
Odm contempt,

880
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,110
ridicule aversion,

881
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,250
ostracism,

882
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,020
degradation or disgrace,

883
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,850
and to induce and evil opinion,

884
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,401
uh,

885
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:12,390
of one in the minds of right
thinking persons into the pride,

886
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:15,630
one of their confidence and
friendly intercourse in society.

887
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:17,821
Well,

888
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,654
in this case,

889
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,630
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,

890
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,823
uh,

891
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,783
found,

892
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,001
uh,

893
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,820
on the absence of human studies at the
fact that there have been no studies

894
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:30,270
conducted specifically on the cancer
risks to children from diminish side.

895
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,840
One of the arguments on the part of the
industry that does nothing to disprove

896
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:37,230
the conclusion that of children consume
more of a carcinogenic substance than do

897
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:37,980
adults.

898
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,110
They are at higher risk
for contracting cancer.

899
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,730
So what's interesting about this comment
by the appellate court is that they're

900
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:48,030
not looking for proof that this
chemical caused cancer in children.

901
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,400
They're looking for elevated cancer risk.

902
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,770
And on the falsity of the statements,

903
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,933
uh,

904
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,061
uh,

905
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:57,020
product disparagement,

906
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:59,830
plaintiff has the burden
of proving the falsity.

907
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:00,480
Uh,

908
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,110
and this statement refers
to individuals not to the,

909
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,280
any overall message.

910
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,640
And if a jury were given the task of
interpreting the uncertain Eva a message,

911
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,120
uh,

912
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,760
it raises the specter of a
chilling effect on speech.

913
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,283
So,

914
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,273
uh,

915
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,970
think about,

916
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,090
uh,

917
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,500
the relationship between,

918
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,200
uh,

919
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,620
uh,

920
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,030
uh,

921
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,230
this type of a court case and the
freedom of the individual to express

922
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:25,280
themselves or express their opinion about
the dangers of different products or,

923
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,540
or human behaviors.

924
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,610
Uh,

925
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,640
so this case was decided by the night
circuit fundamentally on a First

926
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:32,340
Amendment,

927
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,150
a choice referring back to a,

928
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:38,540
a famous New York Times
versus Sullivan case in 1964.

929
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,400
We're Sullivan who was
a police in Alabama,

930
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:42,911
uh,

931
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:46,390
brought a libel action against four
African American clergy and the New York

932
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:47,180
Times.

933
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,350
Uh,

934
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,890
the times had published an
advertisement back in 1960,

935
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:51,370
uh,

936
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,840
in supportive of a civil
rights activism among students,

937
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,460
uh,

938
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,850
a struggle for the right to vote,

939
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,180
a legal defense of Martin Luther King
against a perjury charge and charges of

940
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:05,410
repressive police misconduct,

941
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,910
including false statements.

942
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,880
And the trial judge had instructed the
jury that the advertisement was liable,

943
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,930
liable is that a legal injury was implied
that falsity and malice or presumed.

944
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,900
And the punitive damages
should be awarded.

945
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,910
So that in this case,

946
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,270
the Supreme Court found that
constitutionally deficient.

947
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,110
It was constitutionally deficient for
failure to safeguard freedom of speech.

948
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:33,280
And the press are required by the first
and the 14th amendment and debate on

949
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:34,810
public issues should be uninhibited,

950
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:35,351
robust,

951
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:36,184
wide open,

952
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,780
and that it may well include vehement,

953
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,990
caustic and sharp attacks on
government and public officials

954
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,260
with respect to actual malice.

955
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,520
Because in order to,

956
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:48,070
to find a disparagement,

957
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,060
uh,

958
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,890
or liability in this situation,

959
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,153
uh,

960
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,580
there's a need to
demonstrate actual malice.

961
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,000
The constitutional guarantees require
a federal rule that prohibits,

962
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,980
prohibits a public official
from recovering damages
for defamatory false hood

963
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,640
relating to his official conduct unless
he proves that the statement was made

964
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:07,660
with actual malice.

965
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,770
What's malice?

966
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,791
Well,

967
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:10,980
it's with knowledge that,

968
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:11,350
uh,

969
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,670
the claim was false when it was made or
with reckless disregard of whether it

970
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:16,240
was false,

971
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,073
false,

972
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,590
and the burden of demonstrating
the falsity a rests on the planet.

973
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,973
Now

974
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,980
this seems to give the media a fairly
wide berth and the kinds of claims that

975
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:30,814
they can make

976
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,300
in the wake of this case,

977
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,763
uh,

978
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,100
many states passed what
are thought of now and,

979
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:38,501
and,

980
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:38,710
uh,

981
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,480
labeled as Veggie libel laws.

982
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,590
So that rather than
placing the burden on a,

983
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,523
uh,

984
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,010
a plaintiff to demonstrate,

985
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:48,550
uh,

986
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:48,821
uh,

987
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:49,960
the falsity of the statement,

988
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,361
uh,

989
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:54,130
they placed the burden on the individual
that makes the claim of significant

990
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:55,150
risk or hazard.

991
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,750
So there are many states that
have adopted the statutory change.

992
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,530
And what this means is that it
opens the way for slap suits.

993
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,070
Uh,

994
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,090
what does a slap suit?

995
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,910
It basically is a suit
that intimidates people,

996
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,270
uh,

997
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,860
from making claims about,

998
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,680
uh,

999
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:12,900
uh,

1000
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,230
the,

1001
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,040
the quality of the environment or causes
of its loss or a subsequent health

1002
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:18,874
damages.

1003
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,920
So,

1004
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,091
uh,

1005
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:23,050
among these 20 or so states
that have adopted these laws,

1006
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,801
for example,

1007
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:27,580
now I will not give a lecture a
where I'm making a claim of risk,

1008
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:28,360
uh,

1009
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,810
so that what might be thought of as a
chilling effect on free speech in a way.

1010
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,960
So if I'm,

1011
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,210
uh,

1012
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,880
uh,

1013
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,211
say,

1014
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:34,360
uh,

1015
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,830
being taped on a radio show,

1016
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,770
that radio show is broadcast in a,

1017
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:38,604
in a,

1018
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,560
a state where,

1019
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,440
where one of these
veggie libel laws exist,

1020
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,430
that would place the burden on
me to demonstrate the proof,

1021
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,000
uh,

1022
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,320
that my claim is,

1023
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,303
is uh,

1024
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,240
uh,

1025
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,130
backed up by high quality science,

1026
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:52,820
uh,

1027
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,140
that will pull me into court.

1028
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,810
It will cost me thousands of dollars,

1029
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,310
hundreds of thousands of dollars even,

1030
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:58,890
uh,

1031
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,330
to,

1032
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,430
to uh,

1033
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,970
defend myself.

1034
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,860
So that the influence of,

1035
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:04,460
of this,

1036
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,221
this form of,

1037
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:06,054
of law,

1038
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,410
uh,

1039
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,490
is really quite striking.

1040
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,410
What also is interesting about this,

1041
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,940
this evolution of state laws that,

1042
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,861
that a reverse,

1043
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:17,861
the burden of proof is that clearly
it's been found by the Supreme Court is

1044
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:18,950
being,

1045
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,101
uh,

1046
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:20,960
an unconstitutional shift in the burden.

1047
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,550
Yet none of these state laws have been
taken up to the Supreme Court for,

1048
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,870
for consideration.

1049
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:27,910
So think,

1050
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,880
think about that.

1051
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,280
Uh,

1052
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,660
these laws had been in place
now for well over a decade and,

1053
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,250
uh,

1054
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,083
uh,

1055
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,080
all environmental groups,

1056
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,471
uh,

1057
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:40,460
all public health interest groups
understand the nature of these laws and

1058
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:42,050
they're all very self conscious.

1059
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,760
About the nature of the
claims that they make.

1060
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,760
Now I want to show you this.

1061
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,390
Uh,

1062
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,290
Oprah Winfrey,

1063
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:48,910
ah,

1064
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,920
had a Ho had hosted a
show on mad cow disease.

1065
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,360
Mad cow disease is a,

1066
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:53,721
a,

1067
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:58,721
an illness that is caused by a prion and
believe to be associated with beef that

1068
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:02,240
are fed other cattle parts,

1069
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:02,661
uh,

1070
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:03,171
in their,

1071
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:03,651
in their,

1072
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:04,400
uh,

1073
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,270
cattle meal.

1074
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,740
So Winfrey hosted Howard Lyman,

1075
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,520
uh,

1076
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,380
who described the process of,

1077
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:17,620
of a slaughter houses and a beef rendering
and how the parts were ground up,

1078
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:18,561
uh,

1079
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,011
and then,

1080
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:19,130
uh,

1081
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,930
put into animal feed and fed
back in the United States to a,

1082
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,590
to cattle that were sold for food.

1083
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,250
Uh,

1084
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,390
and this was the,

1085
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,261
the,

1086
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:27,470
uh,

1087
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,370
mechanism that,

1088
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:28,880
uh,

1089
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,240
uh,

1090
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,650
he and others believed had had caused
the outbreak of mad cow disease in Great

1091
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,010
Britain.

1092
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,530
Now there are laws that
prevent that from happening,

1093
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,790
but at this point in time,

1094
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:38,900
this represents another,

1095
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,490
a rather interesting case on,

1096
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,010
on a product disparagement

1097
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,930
cannot locate.

1098
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,110
Give me one second here.

1099
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,990
I've lost my Internet connection.

1100
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,060
So we're on hold for a moment.

1101
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,893
Sign back

1102
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:50,230
online

1103
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,533
within

1104
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,373
10 years.

1105
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,433
And she said,

1106
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,040
what about a hundred thousand
cars a year or two in the morning?

1107
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,720
We run the block,

1108
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,943
he come back,

1109
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,520
we will move,

1110
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,430
kills your belt.

1111
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,940
Possible raccoons Frisch
from up off the street,

1112
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,150
granted him up then back of house and
then we can the city of Los Angeles,

1113
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:08,161
200 tons of peps or chemicals that were
used to kill that 200 tons a month for

1114
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:10,771
ground up,

1115
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:15,771
terminated a few better back for this
type of corporate partners and sausage,

1116
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,300
I think knew it to that gut.

1117
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,970
She turns around and watches the guy
from the national cattleman's beef

1118
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:25,220
association of sense.

1119
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,621
Doctor,

1120
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:27,920
what work are we feeding?

1121
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:29,550
Empowers to cows?

1122
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,550
And that the city said,

1123
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:32,940
well,

1124
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,773
you know,

1125
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,900
I'll listen to the month of that going on.

1126
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,710
I believe in about 95%
of the cattle in fact,

1127
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,350
and feed blood to be being a
remains above the ground level.

1128
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,330
And the next day,

1129
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,780
uh,

1130
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,220
awkward smile them,

1131
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,420
gets the soup,

1132
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,300
offer a service that just stops me.

1133
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,930
I will never him eager worker.

1134
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,390
Now she couldn't say,

1135
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,780
she didn't say that.

1136
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,970
Millions of yours,

1137
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,120
you shouldn't meet him.

1138
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,450
She just said that soft Nicole,

1139
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,550
I will never get the burger.

1140
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,280
Now I know what I want to know about show.

1141
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:20,920
The 13 states had a thing called
the fruit of the spirit of the law.

1142
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,740
The point of [inaudible] say something
that you felt to be false about a

1143
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:29,580
perishable commodity.

1144
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,440
Say anything.

1145
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,890
I thought to be false.

1146
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,280
Aye Recruit.

1147
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,151
Well,

1148
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,881
we we're taking,

1149
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:41,714
we refill.

1150
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,410
Took about two hours.

1151
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,303
When we got it done,

1152
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,083
I said,

1153
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,070
give me 10 minutes.

1154
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,960
I'll just came

1155
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,670
to me and said,

1156
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,890
so I went about my business
a couple of weeks later.

1157
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,860
Got a call.

1158
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,340
He said,

1159
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,040
you realize you're being sued,

1160
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,020
Oprah Winfrey,

1161
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,850
but it moved with Texas
capital bank and they said,

1162
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,684
no,

1163
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,801
I agree.

1164
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:17,810
Sit In my library inventory.

1165
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,390
Buy Vegetarian cookbooks.

1166
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,720
I knew those settlement,

1167
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,420
one of those 53 and cookbook just bad.

1168
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,300
I went back and said,

1169
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:26,590
I can't talk to you right now.

1170
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:28,320
I'm going to put in a call the Oprah.

1171
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,540
I called over to the left
a message and I said,

1172
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,660
if we lose this soup,

1173
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,260
I throw it in my bed and cook the books.

1174
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,710
You got to put up the money.

1175
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,033
Well,

1176
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,910
we ended up getting sued in Emerald,

1177
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,753
Texas.

1178
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,450
I don't know how many of you
ever been to Amarillo infections.

1179
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,120
It's not the end of the world.

1180
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,650
Clearly visible.

1181
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,380
You're going to give the world,

1182
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,680
take the hose and we're rural Texas.

1183
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,740
The water who said employer and rural
Texas happens to be the slaughter facility

1184
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,900
killing bumper stickers all over town
on sending me the only bad cut on the

1185
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,401
Texas.

1186
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,234
His name.

1187
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,060
I knew we were in trouble and
I don't want you to solve them.

1188
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,320
We need a change of venue,

1189
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,060
the way the world,

1190
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:26,910
but if we could win,

1191
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:34,630
so we file with the judge where it
change the basically when you walk in,

1192
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,184
because the devil,

1193
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,420
72 year old lady up tuffle knackered.

1194
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,933
We asked for,

1195
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,940
we've been used to picks up the hammer,

1196
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,793
slaps it down,

1197
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,600
says emotions and I bring
it to the jury pool.

1198
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,470
They're going 140 people and
you never saw so many hats.

1199
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,390
Boots in the boat will
hopes and all your life.

1200
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,460
I said to my lawyer,

1201
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,440
we may need to file an appeal because
there's a world of look in the window

1202
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,260
here.

1203
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,930
[inaudible] was a big head call.

1204
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:08,290
Drew's absolutely steeped
in the cattle culture.

1205
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,890
What lawyer you put 78 he said the call
calling you to the spanner tomorrow.

1206
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,111
He said,

1207
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:25,111
the first question [inaudible]

1208
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,551
I said,

1209
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,540
I could have left.

1210
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,250
You said you damn well better.

1211
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,130
We'll lose who

1212
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,000
the point of some turning is.

1213
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:43,001
Looking at the new laughing and giggling
and he says Kevin Hart to say this

1214
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:51,810
but determinative [inaudible] apologize
for something that is saving my life.

1215
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,510
Never again.

1216
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,481
Kyle did.

1217
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:02,420
They ever asked me about Turner,

1218
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,350
but they asked me every question that
you can have that I want on the sale of

1219
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:10,880
the owner looks at me and he says,

1220
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,140
anybody ever called you responsible?

1221
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:16,490
I said,

1222
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,323
yes.

1223
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,600
My lawyer was sitting over there going,

1224
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,180
no,

1225
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,490
no,

1226
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,323
no.

1227
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,050
The plaintiff's attorney,

1228
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,500
he thinks he's keeping
the Gordon uses home.

1229
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,410
I said mine majority is
over there and been there,

1230
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,250
done that.

1231
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,900
We were in that courtroom for six weeks.

1232
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,030
At the end of the six weeks that jury
found the Oprah Harpo production of myself

1233
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,380
not allowable

1234
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,800
plane is when other the trinity.

1235
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,810
They couldn't imagine that during that
home room cause fine out with toddlers

1236
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,430
appeal with the Fifth
Circuit Court of thing.

1237
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,740
We spent a year in the Fifth Circuit Court
of Appeals and at the end of the year

1238
00:43:09,741 --> 00:43:12,200
they came down with a group of us pill.

1239
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:17,201
The sooner the overall
production of myself or not
allowable and then they wrote

1240
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,330
an opinion of it said every
fanged on the land and set up.

1241
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:27,860
The show was truthful
and it is not actionable.

1242
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,570
The California couldn't stand up that as

1243
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,730
the war or retail.

1244
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:40,210
It was the knowledge that account is
what the shape court file Souvik as oil

1245
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,590
production and myself and seek
court and God are you at in Texas?

1246
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,900
I was with a woman from
the city of course,

1247
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:51,920
but the federal court,

1248
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,040
they people back,

1249
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,240
we said six years,

1250
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,950
hundreds of thousands of dollars on mine.

1251
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,900
Ranomi definitive to tell the truth

1252
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,940
at the end of secures is doing the
fucking threw up the case with prejudice,

1253
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,880
the jury front of the
complainants who not.

1254
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:16,370
And we filed the case that

1255
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,460
sent you the little
pictures of a little bit of,

1256
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,353
again,

1257
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,520
we're standing.

1258
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,643
Tell them.

1259
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,543
Okay.

1260
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,870
So the core of this problem is the way
that these state veggie libel law shift

1261
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:49,740
the burden of proof.

1262
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,700
So under federal law,

1263
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,190
it's really clear that uh,

1264
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,620
the cattleman's association was under the,

1265
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,820
the burden of proof to demonstrate the
statement was knowingly false and deliver

1266
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,280
with malice with the intent to harm.

1267
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,440
But under state law,

1268
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,070
uh,

1269
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:12,480
Oprah's burden was to demonstrate that
the statement is true with reasonable

1270
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:13,314
certainty.

1271
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,970
So I'll leave you with
one thought on this.

1272
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:18,841
And,

1273
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:18,960
uh,

1274
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,410
the importance of fashioning
law in a way that would protect,

1275
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,250
uh,

1276
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,140
free speech and open access to knowledge
of risk and opinions on the part of

1277
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:28,974
experts.

1278
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,700
A Justice Powell in 1974
on truth and free speech,

1279
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,350
there's no such thing as a false idea.

1280
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:37,110
No matter how pernicious
and opinion may seem,

1281
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,550
we depend on it's correction.

1282
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:39,840
Uh,

1283
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,120
not on the conscience
of judges and juries,

1284
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:43,950
but on the competition of other ideas.

1285
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,230
So that's it for today.

1286
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:46,980
Have a great weekend.
