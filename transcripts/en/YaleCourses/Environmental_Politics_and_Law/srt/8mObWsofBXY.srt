1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay. Everyone first, thank you for
coming out on such a blustery day.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,760
If you've not picked up your exam
from your teaching fellow, uh,

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,900
you can do that after class today.
And we're switching gears.

4
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:20,901
We're moving from a questions about how
to manage chemicals in the environment

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,720
to questions about how to affect
conservation and also especially how to

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,850
allocate and manage land use,
uh,

7
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,730
and various natural resources
associated with landscapes.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,150
And today I'm gonna use an example,
uh,

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,140
a history of a conservation
effort in New York state, uh,

10
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:44,880
known as the Adirondack Park
that has a conservation, uh, uh,

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,240
history that now spans almost 130 years,

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,030
one of the oldest parks in the nation.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,370
And it contains many terrific examples
of a variety of different strategies to

14
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,240
conserve resources and
to protect the land. Now,

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,400
no matter where you are in the world,

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,710
then if you're interested
in managing land use, uh,

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,690
and managing ecosystems
or biological resources,

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,380
there a variety of questions that
I'd encourage you ask. You know,

19
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:16,830
one is first to become
familiar with property rights.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,350
How are they defined? Who has
rights to which types of resources?

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,210
And in this case,

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,070
it'll become clear that it's important
for you to think about property not as a

23
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,130
thing. Uh, but as a set
of social relationships,

24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,360
a property is often defined in law
as a bundle, a bundle of rights. Uh,

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,540
but if I have a right that's
defined and protected by law, uh,

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,900
than others have an obligation.

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,340
So you can't really think about rights
in the absence of consideration of

28
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:51,240
obligations.
And if you violate your obligation,

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,030
the concept behind a property right
is that the state or some level of

30
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:01,050
government will have
the capacity to monitor,

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,670
to discover the defect,
uh, to enforce sanctions.

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,780
Uh, so the second question that, uh,

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,860
you need to consider is what
is the appropriate level
of government to institute

34
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:18,090
protective policy? Uh, should local
governments have this ability?

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,330
Often they don't because they have
other obligations and their financial

36
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,170
background is,

37
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:26,010
is quite slight in comparison to state
governments or the federal government.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,660
So thinking about the particular
nature of a problem, you know,

39
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:34,380
whether it crosses especially
political boundaries,

40
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,020
so many watersheds is an example.

41
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:39,930
Cross political boundaries
across town boundaries.

42
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,150
They call it cross state boundaries.
Uh, many water bodies, uh, uh,

43
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,540
provide the boundary between political
jurisdictions as well as nation states.

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,320
So thinking about the appropriate level
of government to the kind of problem

45
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:55,110
you're interested in managing
is a really important task.

46
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,050
How about participation
in decision making?

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,700
As you think about
conservation strategies,

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,470
what should be the role of the public
in participating in the type of strategy

49
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:10,270
that chosen? And you might think of, you
might think of a track of land that, uh,

50
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,540
everybody feels is very special.
Uh,

51
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,510
perhaps because it has
endangered species per cap,

52
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,780
perhaps because of its open space
character, perhaps its wildness,

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,590
uh, you might think of a
variety of different strategies
to protect that if it's

54
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,120
currently in private ownership.

55
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,480
And one of those would be land acquisition
by on the part of the government.

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,460
So many national parks, for example,
particularly in the eastern United States,

57
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,100
had been created through the
process of land acquisition.

58
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,250
And in some instances the
exercise of eminent domain.

59
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,240
And we'll talk about eminent domain where
the government uses its authority to a

60
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:47,560
cry, acquire a property
for public purposes. Uh,

61
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,490
virtually by taking it away from,
uh, the private owner. Uh, but,

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,960
but providing compensation

63
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,510
intensity regulation
regulation is another strategy.

64
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,060
So you might simply adopt rules
that govern density of allowable new

65
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:08,080
development, uh, or the type of new
development, whether it's residential,

66
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,830
commercial, agricultural, industrial, uh,

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,190
and this is the origin of the idea
of zoning land use, segregation,

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,330
a land use, density control, and often
associated subdivision regulations,

69
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:21,100
which are very specific in detail,

70
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,910
how development has to
proceed including lots sizes,

71
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,970
a shoreline access requirements,

72
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,810
a variety of different restrictions are
associated with subdivision regulations.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,570
How about the legitimacy of public value?

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,020
If you create a really tough set of
land use regulations and the property

75
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:44,320
owners, uh, do not believe in
the legitimacy of the regulation,

76
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,020
it guarantees that you're
going to have compliance.

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
And noncompliance means that you're
going to have extensive surveillance and

78
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,450
monitoring costs and enforcement costs.

79
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,500
So believing in the legitimacy
of the public value is important.

80
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,820
Often an educational process has to take
place in order for people to understand

81
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,270
why regulations are occurring.
And in many cases,

82
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,990
they're developed and
adopted to prevent damage.

83
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,400
The damage that might be induced by
one property owner on an adjacent,

84
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:16,930
an adjacent public, a private
owner. So the idea of uh, uh,

85
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,390
deciding that you want to build
a casino on your property,

86
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,240
your neighbors might object to
that or perhaps a, a, a nightclub,

87
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,910
a so that there are variety of
different land uses that, that uh,

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,350
threaten other land
owners in the vicinity.

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,420
Property value often rises
following a conservation efforts.

90
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:38,410
So the establishment of a park is, is
very commonly followed by adjacent land.

91
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,030
Value's increasing quite dramatically.

92
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:43,420
And I'll provide you with a couple of
examples of that. Density restrictions,

93
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,490
land use, segregation, aesthetics.

94
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,730
Increasingly over the past half century
we've seen zoning ordinances being used

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,010
for the purpose of controlling aesthetics.

96
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,850
So aesthetics might be
managed by specifying density
guidelines requiring larger

97
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:04,940
and larger low lot sizes. So in parts of
the California coastal area, for example,

98
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,140
there are zoning ordinances that demand
a hundred acres before a new housemate

99
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,670
constructed a, this is to preserve
the open space character of the area.

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,600
So thinking about how you
define a desirable a or an
ideal aesthetic that would

101
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,060
be your objective is a
pretty difficult thing to do.

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,100
The forest service started pioneering
research into, to the question of,

103
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,850
of what, uh, types of
landscapes to people prefer.

104
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,930
And they were doing this because they
were getting increasingly, uh, uh,

105
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,400
taken to court because of the perceived
aesthetic damage associated with

106
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,660
clearcuts, particularly clear
cuts that were visible, uh,

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,130
because of timber leases they'd allocated,

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,250
but they would be visible from
a nearby wilderness areas.

109
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,210
So they decided that they would
establish a, a variety of,

110
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,500
of social experiments where they would
test people's preferences for different

111
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:02,501
kinds of landscapes ranging from the wild
to the fully domesticated agricultural

112
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,370
to a intense urban centers.
Uh,

113
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,640
you might be interested in the
results and following new regulation.

114
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,580
When does the government have the
obligation to compensate? So supposing a,

115
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:18,860
I'm a private landowner and I have 50
acres of land and you develop a new zoning

116
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:23,861
ordinance that tells me that I have to
have a 25 acres before I can build a new

117
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:28,820
house. So that tells me I basically
have two building lots. Well,

118
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:31,700
I thought that I would have a,
prior to that regulation,

119
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,030
perhaps 50 building lots that
might be one acre in size.

120
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,550
So my expectation has been suddenly
changed by the passage of law,

121
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,830
uh, and my property value
would significantly diminish.
So under what situations,

122
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,250
uh,

123
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,250
does the government need to compensate
the private landowner for regulatory

124
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:55,970
activity? Not, I'd like to drop you
down onto the case of the Adirondacks.

125
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:59,120
But first I'd like you to think about
the distribution of public land in the

126
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,954
United States.

127
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,520
So out of several hundred million acres
of land that are currently under the

128
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,790
jurisdiction of the National Park
Service or the forest service,

129
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,610
or the bureau of land management
or the bureau of reclamation,

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,150
the majority of these lands are
located in the western United States,

131
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,830
particularly in the
mountain narrowed region.

132
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,860
If you look in the eastern
part of the United States,

133
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,130
you can't see this too clearly because
of the light that's on up here.

134
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,250
I don't know if it's possible
to diminish that at all.

135
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,810
But as you move toward a
northern New England, uh,

136
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,660
you might be able to make out a patch
of landscape right up in this area.

137
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,370
And that's the Adirondack park.

138
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,680
It's one of the largest intact forests
that we've got in the eastern United

139
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,860
States, actually one of the largest
intact forest that we've got, uh, uh,

140
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:47,180
in the lower 48 states.
And it also is adjacent to Vermont,

141
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,480
which is adjacent to New Hampshire and
Maine. And, and together these are,

142
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:55,010
are clustered and form what is now
thought of as the northern forests in the

143
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,960
eastern eastern part of the
country. And the Adirondacks, uh,

144
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,880
within this zone has the longest history
of protection, but there are the green,

145
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,610
there are the green mountains, and there's
the green mountain national forest,

146
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,190
and there are the white mountains
in adjacent New Hampshire, uh,

147
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,890
that spill over into, into Maine.
So there's really quite a, uh,

148
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,980
an unusual track of land, uh, that,
uh, uh, has a, a long and, and,

149
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:20,240
uh, curious conservation
history. Again, a, a,

150
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,110
a bit of a closer look at the Adirondacks.

151
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,270
As you look out across this landscape.
Uh,

152
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,870
you might think of it as wild
and natural, uh, but in reality,

153
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,050
it's the location of intense conflicts
over a competing interest groups about

154
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,590
how they might best gain
access to public lands. Uh,

155
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,310
this is the Adirondack forest preserve,
a protected since the 1880s.

156
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,680
Uh, if you look back at the history
of conservation effort in the nation,

157
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,240
like Yosemite was deeded to
California and 1864, Yellowstone,

158
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,710
Yellowstone national park was created in
1872 and the Adirondack forest reserve

159
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:03,440
was created in 1885. It was transformed
into a park a few years later. Um,

160
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,570
and an and a 1895,
uh,

161
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,780
the New York state legislature passed a
constitutional amendment so that a lands

162
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,860
that are designated as
forest reserve lands and now
called forest preserve lands,

163
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,510
they are forever protected by the
Constitution of New York state. So that,

164
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:25,860
that means that two successive,
uh, legislatures need to, to, uh,

165
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,810
enact a statute that would allow them
to be transferred out of that category.

166
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,310
So this is a very rigorous standard that
is, is, is hard to change. And by the way,

167
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:39,300
there are different kinds of laws that
might be applied such as the executive

168
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:44,290
order on, uh, by, uh, William
Clinton that the creative,
the largest, uh, track of, of,

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,330
uh, wilderness, uh, by,
by relying on, uh, uh,

170
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,760
federally owned,
uh,

171
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,790
but non wilderness lands up in
Alaska just before he left office.

172
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,380
So you could use a federal executive
order to accomplish wilderness designation

173
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,410
or the, the, uh, forest service or,

174
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,530
or the park service or the
bureau of land management.

175
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,600
They could also administratively designate
tracks of land as being wilderness

176
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,700
that, uh, under or under
their jurisdiction.

177
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,120
So that in terms of the gold standard
of offering the greatest amount of

178
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,060
protection,
uh,

179
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,970
you would want a designation that would
be very difficult to change in New York

180
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,240
state. And the legislature, I
think, got it right back in the,

181
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,410
and the 1890s when they created
the forest and jumping ahead, uh,

182
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,300
the wilderness statute in the United
States wasn't adopted until 1864.

183
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,930
And then, uh, in 18th, or
excuse me, in 1968, uh,

184
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:42,900
the Adirondack national park was proposed
by a variety of individuals in New

185
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,733
York state.

186
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,980
And this upset people in the Adirondacks
quite a bit because they were worried

187
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:48,330
about losing control.

188
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,350
There were a Lulu or
concerned about losing their
authority and their ability to

189
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:57,520
affect a policy within their,
within their park, within the,

190
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,700
within the state. Uh, and
this prompted, uh, uh,

191
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,730
the legislature to move ahead by 1971
and create the Adirondack park agency.

192
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,403
Excuse me.

193
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,623
Okay.

194
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,700
Then by 18 or 1973,

195
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,080
the Adirondack park agency land use
planning and regulation went into effect.

196
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,630
And this really will be the
topic of the discussion today.

197
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,040
Thinking about the forces
that a lay behind the, uh,

198
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:32,360
the development of the statute
might, uh, consider the Erie Canal.

199
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,710
A Uri canal runs from the
eastern side of New York, uh,

200
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,680
all the way to the western edge. And, uh,

201
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,270
when the timber resources in the
park, uh, were poorly managed, uh,

202
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,700
when they, the tops of trees were
left on the, on the ground, uh,

203
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,250
and they dry it out, they would
burn in forest fires. And the,

204
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:56,900
in the 1860s, seventies, and eighties,
we're really common response to these,

205
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,030
uh, mismanaged a forest plans,
uh, drying out. So what happens,

206
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,640
what a track of forest, uh, uh, Burns,

207
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:08,900
it basically loses its flood
storage capacity. Uh, doesn't, uh,

208
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,470
the organic matter in the
soil often is, is uh, uh,

209
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:13,961
released,

210
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:18,860
it breaks down so that water running
off the landscape commonly floods.

211
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,640
So you get a burst into the rivers and
through the Erie Canal and then you get

212
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:26,330
drought. So that, uh, if, if,
uh, New York state w was, uh,

213
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,210
going to ensure that commerce
could move westward, uh,

214
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:33,350
it had to ensure a more sustainable
form of forest management in the park.

215
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,180
I also think about what was happening
in the middle of the 19th century. Uh,

216
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,250
there were several movements
in literature and, and art, uh,

217
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,430
and also in a college either are quite
curious and they were colliding in a way

218
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,620
that a really provided a impetus for the
creation of parks and protected areas.

219
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,640
And one strain of thought, uh,
known as transcendentalism, uh,

220
00:13:56,641 --> 00:14:01,641
that you can discover in the writings
of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Shelley

221
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,830
Keats, uh, William Wordsworth,
Emerson, Whitman and throw a,

222
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,170
and particularly Emerson's
essay on nature, uh,

223
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,260
cause people to think very differently
about nature and what it was and its

224
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:17,970
importance to the human condition.
Uh, so that s a a r excuse me,

225
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:21,450
that a nature to, to Emerson, uh, uh,

226
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,550
was an organism is a symbol of the mind.
It was a moral educator,

227
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,940
a source of spiritual truth and
a resource for the imagination.

228
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,740
Now, at the same time, George
Perkins Marsh was writing, uh,

229
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,670
and he produced a book
called men in nature, talking
about the destruction that,

230
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:42,810
uh, uh, the destruction of forests and
how that might lead to the decline of

231
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:46,050
civilizations. Quite curious.
Uh, the writings in the,

232
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,320
in the latter part of the 19th century.
The Pre saged, uh, the, the, uh,

233
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,390
loss of diversity, uh, as
well as climate change, uh,

234
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,090
that we're now experiencing.

235
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,720
So he wrote back in 1864 a
condition of impoverished,

236
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,670
impoverished productiveness
of shattered surface, uh,

237
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:06,350
of climatic access has to
threaten deprivation, barbarism,

238
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:10,910
and even even extinction of species.
So nearly a century and a half ago,

239
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,620
uh, a scientist, uh,

240
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:16,940
was predicting climate change associated
the way with the way that we were

241
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:20,440
mismanaging resources and
landscape. Also, the targets,

242
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:24,860
the transcendentalists include Christian
views are they challenged the human

243
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:29,220
role, uh, to be one of
dominating nature, uh, the,

244
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,720
the Christian view that we should be
fruitful and multiply and replenish the

245
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:37,370
earth and subdue it. Uh,
and that Christianity denies
souls to nonhuman species.

246
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,570
These were new and very interesting
thoughts to people. This is captured in a,

247
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:41,961
in a,

248
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:46,961
a work produced by Roderick Nash
Wilderness in the American mind that's

249
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,980
published by Yale Press,
uh,

250
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,760
that I commend to you if you're interested
in and following the way that these,

251
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,910
uh, ideas collided. Now at the same time,

252
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,310
there were many artists that
were painting landscapes,

253
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,620
both in the western part of the
nation as well as in the east,

254
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,450
including Thomas Cole and Albert Beers
tot a Winslow homer in Frederick Church,

255
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,560
and they all painted in the Adirondacks.
So think about the fact that, uh,

256
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,650
people were reading the transcendentalists
literature at the same time that,

257
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,230
uh, these art shows we're traveling
around, not just the United States,

258
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,460
but traveling around the world, giving
people a very different impression of,

259
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,860
of what it was like in the more
remote parts of the United States.

260
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,030
So a Winslow homer has painted more
on the Adirondacks and the others.

261
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,340
So I just thought I'd show you
his work on two guides, uh,

262
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,340
the hunter, uh, and the fishermen, uh,

263
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,010
basically celebrating the
experience of being in the outdoors.

264
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm going to fast forward on Youtube,
the, the middle part of the 19th,

265
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,080
or excuse me, the 20th century.
Uh, when you recall that,

266
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:54,520
I argued that the interstate highway
system was built, uh, you know,

267
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,210
largely in response to concerns about
the Cold War. Uh, but this network, uh,

268
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,920
eventually ringed the Adirondack park
and it made it accessible by the early

269
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:07,190
1960s to more than 10 million million,
excuse me,

270
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,110
million people within a day's drive.

271
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,910
So access is really a critical
determinant of property value.

272
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,520
And also the rate of development

273
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,810
by the 1960s in the 60s,
in 1970s, uh, increasing,

274
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,190
uh, uh, leisurely time, increasing
demand for recreational opportunities,

275
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,820
I'll lead to increasing property
values within the Adirondacks.

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,960
People were looking for second homes.
Uh, the development industry was booming,

277
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:38,020
not just here, but also, uh,

278
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,050
in the vicinity of Bar Harbor in
Maine and the vicinity of, uh,

279
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,330
of Grand Teton and, and, uh, uh,
Jackson, Wyoming, uh, also in, in, uh,

280
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,590
uh, the Sierras so that, uh,

281
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,570
the population in the United
States wanted access to,

282
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,220
to a remote recreational opportunities.
There was a real interest in, in wildness,

283
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,020
in nature, uh, particularly, uh,
in a, in the concept of wilderness.

284
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,000
And quite, uh, quite honestly, I'm
surprised that your generation,

285
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,450
I don't see the same interest in wildness
or wilderness that, uh, was, was, uh,

286
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,210
very, uh, very prominent in people's
concerns about conservation. Uh,

287
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:18,350
back in the 1970s so that, uh, uh,

288
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,030
many inlet than the
legislature in New York, uh,

289
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:24,350
became concerned about development
being financed, uh, with, uh,

290
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,470
international capital in the park,
rapid cutting of the forest,

291
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,580
rapid development,

292
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:33,150
particularly along shorelines and
rapid increases in property value

293
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,840
in some communities, uh, communities that
had populations of only 300 people, uh,

294
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,510
new new projects were proposed,
uh,

295
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:47,200
up to 10,000 new units
in size. Uh, if you, uh,

296
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,540
then extrapolate that a one new housing
unit might house on average two to three

297
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,750
people, uh, this, uh,

298
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,410
could multiply the population of a
community by 10 or, or even a 20 times.

299
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,660
So what would that mean
for that community?

300
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:04,320
What would it mean in terms of it's a
need to invest in institutional support

301
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:08,610
for the community. And by that, what do I
mean? Well, how about a road development,

302
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,880
highway development, school
systems, fire, police,

303
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,350
so that the economic per pressure was
being brought to bear on these communities

304
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,260
there already where the most
impoverished in New York state,

305
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,060
that band of forest that I pointed out
to you in northern New England is a

306
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,240
demographically quite interesting.
It's,

307
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,910
it's grown to be bi modal in terms of
income distribution in a dominated more

308
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:31,410
heavily by the poorest.
Uh,

309
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,570
but also there are increasing numbers of
private property owners who own second

310
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:40,420
homes, but they don't
vote. They don't vote, uh,

311
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,050
in the Adirondacks and many of them don't
vote in New York state. Uh, so that,

312
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,060
that uh, this, this by
Moodle distribution, uh,

313
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,750
creates a very interesting
political dynamic, uh,

314
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,790
attention between those that
have always lived there,

315
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,110
that are poor as opposed to those that
have the capacity to buy the new houses,

316
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,790
uh, and bring their conservation
values, uh, to the Adirondacks.

317
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,160
So this statute was really
unusual. And, uh, the,

318
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:09,510
the preamble to the statute
includes this language.

319
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,990
Local governments in the Adirondack park
find it increasingly difficult to cope

320
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:16,920
with the unrelenting pressures
for development being
brought to bear on the area

321
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,390
and to exercise their discretionary
powers to create an effective land use and

322
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:24,840
development control framework.
Now,

323
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:28,440
the mission statement of this
law is really quite complex.

324
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,240
The basic purpose of this article is
to ensure optimum overall conservation

325
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,340
protection, preservation, development,
and use of the sea unique scenic,

326
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,220
aesthetic, wildlife,
recreational, open space,

327
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:45,630
historic ecological and natural
resources of the Adirondack Park.

328
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,730
So within mission statement,
you should, uh, you know,

329
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:51,190
immediately see a number
of potential conflicts.

330
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,590
How can you at once maximize conservation
at the same time you're maximizing

331
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:58,600
development in use.
Actually,

332
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:02,350
it's interesting if you drive into a
national forest to see a sign beside the,

333
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,140
the, uh, the edge of the road when you
enter all national forest and that, uh,

334
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,800
the sign will say, land of many
uses a land of many uses. Well,

335
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:16,550
how do you reconcile multiple
uses within one track of, of, uh,

336
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,510
uh, land managed by a public agency? Well,

337
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,200
it's difficult at best and that's
largely part of the story today.

338
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,060
Innovative requirements in this statute,
a domain at an ecological analysis.

339
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,900
So what is the resiliency of
different ecological zones,

340
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,670
a different ecosystems, uh, how much
development can they sustain? Uh,

341
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,970
and is there a logic behind
a allocating a density,

342
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,810
a requirement to a different
types of ecosystems?

343
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,550
How about density regulations
and the clustering concept? Uh,

344
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,490
this statute relied on the idea that you
should concentrate new development, uh,

345
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:56,550
in close proximity to village centers
so that you don't overstress, uh,

346
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,870
the local governments need to develop
new roads to maintain those roads, uh,

347
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,900
and also require new power lines,
new sewage lines, new water lines.

348
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,220
So the idea that a cluster development
build on existing, uh, uh, centers of,

349
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,610
of the population is
really quite interesting.

350
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,750
And this was to protect the open space
character as well as the ecological

351
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:21,010
characteristics, uh, of the
surrounding landscape. It wasn't,

352
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,180
it wasn't devo designed really
to a, uh, conserve energy. Uh,

353
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:29,980
but if I were going to
challenge you to design a today,

354
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,110
a land use regulatory scheme,

355
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,950
that would be the most
conserving of energy resources,

356
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,190
it probably would follow this model and
it would follow the model because if you

357
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,960
have people living closer
together, uh, uh, you,

358
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,870
you were clearly not going to use
as much fuel moving around, uh,

359
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,920
uh, between shopping and recreation
and school and other, other activities.

360
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,560
So if you increase the density or excuse
me, increase the density restriction,

361
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:00,420
you, you, uh, increase the, uh,

362
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,050
amount of land area required before a
new house might be developed between the

363
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,190
village centers, uh, then that would
discourage development in those areas.

364
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,370
And in the case of the park,
uh, in the, inside the centers,

365
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,800
there's no density restriction at all.

366
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,510
So it's an encouragement basically to
build up, uh, between the village centers.

367
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,070
Uh,
in the more remote areas,

368
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,430
there's a requirement that you have 42
acres before a new house can be built.

369
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:27,910
42 acres is a lot of land.
42 acres. In Connecticut,

370
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,300
most Connecticut is zoned on
average one acre per new unit.

371
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,200
So 42 units might be placed on that does,
um,

372
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,690
but only one could be placed on that area.
Within the Adirondacks.

373
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,960
It also required setback requirements,
set back requirements, uh,

374
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,820
from especially water bodies,
uh, streams and lakeshores. Uh,

375
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,810
and this,
uh,

376
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,810
wild to urban continuum continuum was
designed really with an aesthetic purpose

377
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,850
to try to protect the park,
like character of the area. Uh,

378
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,070
it also had a provision that was
really new back in the 1970s, uh,

379
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,340
to offer specific protection
for agricultural lands. Uh,

380
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,880
so that agricultural
lands were thought of, uh,

381
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,790
not the way that we would think of them
today is providing an opportunity for a

382
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,700
locally grown produce that
would be more energy efficient,

383
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,410
but they were designed predominantly to
protect the open space character of the

384
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:20,780
park vista preservation.

385
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:25,000
So that individual vistas were
identified actually. Yeah. That,

386
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,640
that's kind of an interesting sidelight
story about how that occurred. You know,

387
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:29,910
one might think that,
uh,

388
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,970
when there really might not be a legally
defensible means of going out and

389
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:39,590
identifying what the most beautiful
areas are, uh, in an area this large.

390
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,700
Uh, so the Adirondacks is a, is a
roughly 6 million acres in size.

391
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,390
It's larger than Yosemite Yellowstone
and glacier national parks put together.

392
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,390
Uh, so that a wandering around and
trying to figure out where the, the, uh,

393
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,130
the ideal vistas are located,
who was a challenge that the,

394
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:59,390
the park agency had to confront. They were
required to do that by statute. Uh, the,

395
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:02,180
uh, the reality of how
they did it, uh, is that a,

396
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:05,540
an engineer and a survey or got into
a pickup truck with a case of beer,

397
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,320
a and drove around for a weekend looking
for what they thought were pretty

398
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,580
landscapes. Uh, they put pins
in a map and a Lo and behold,

399
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:15,860
these pin holes in the map,
uh,

400
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,890
translated into a legally binding
regulations that prevented development of

401
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,450
different forms in the
vicinity of the scenic vista.

402
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,090
A wetlands and wild and
scenic and recreational rivers
were also designated. A,

403
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,480
the definition of a wetland is actually
quite interesting and quite difficult.

404
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,670
Uh, today is, uh, as I was
coming into, uh, uh, to give
a lecture, I noticed that, uh,

405
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:45,800
areas, uh, that normally look dry,
uh, had standing water in them. Uh,

406
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:50,240
and, uh, so that low lying areas,
uh, can be, uh, quite deceptive.

407
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,110
Uh, if you're, if you're not there
during extreme rain events, uh,

408
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,040
so that a wetland designation gave the
Adirondack Park Agency jurisdiction to

409
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:02,330
deny development people were not allowed
to build in wetlands period. Uh, now,

410
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:07,220
most states have wetlands laws as well.
Uh, not just, uh, in the Adirondacks.

411
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,590
Uh, most states do not have wild scenic
and recreational river statutes, uh,

412
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,800
that provide the a, an overlay on top
of the Adirondack Park Agency statute.

413
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,080
Uh, finally, uh,

414
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:23,081
the provision that a stirred terrific
controversy was that the zoning authority

415
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:28,190
that previously held was held by local
governments was overtaken by the state

416
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:29,024
government.

417
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,020
So not only would you have private
property owners that would be highly

418
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:38,021
resistant to this new set of very
complicated regulations that they viewed

419
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:41,690
actually took away their private property
rights and diminish their property

420
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:46,670
value. Uh, but they also, uh,
had local governments that, uh,

421
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,820
uh, felt that they were being pushed
out of the picture, that they,

422
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,060
their zoning responsibility that they'd
had for a hundred more than a hundred

423
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:55,900
years,
that that was taken away from him.

424
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,190
So that the statute's set
up class eight projects,

425
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:01,920
which were large development projects
that might have more of a regional

426
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:06,320
influence. And those were reviewed by
the state in class beat projects, uh,

427
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,770
were reviewed by local governments,

428
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:11,850
but only if the local government's adopted
the state standards to apply to those

429
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:16,840
projects. So if you were given
the responsibility to, to, uh, uh,

430
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,600
develop, uh, an ecologically grounded
approach to land use regulation,

431
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,650
what would you do?

432
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,700
We probably would go off and conduct an
inventory of what resources are there in

433
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:32,730
the, in the park. You look for
aquifers, uh, you'd map them out,

434
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,260
you'd map out surface waters and you'd
map out a setback distances from those

435
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:40,500
surface waters to try to be
sure to protect water quality.

436
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,710
You take a look at surficial geology,
uh,

437
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,060
particularly areas that had shallow
soils are soils that had Claybon.

438
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:52,320
Ethan at our annex is rather famous
for its clay. Uh, which means that a,

439
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:57,180
you have a clay impervious surface that
is often only a one or two feet beneath

440
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:59,220
the, uh, the top of landscape.

441
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,480
That means that if you're going to put
in a septic system and a septic system

442
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,860
basically means that human sewage from
a facility or a house goes down into a

443
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:10,610
pipe, it goes into a holding tank, uh,

444
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,570
solid settle out and then fluid drains
off and it leeches out through pipes that

445
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:19,110
have holes in the bottom of them, uh,
and then down through a bed of sand.

446
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,530
But if there is a clay area
that lies beneath the sand,

447
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,140
that means that the sewage is
going to stay close to the surface.

448
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,290
It's not going to dissipate,
it's not going to break down.

449
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,270
And it means that bacterial contamination
of a surface water supplies is much

450
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:37,650
more probable. Genital soils
characteristics were also mapped.

451
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,130
A elevation was mapped. And I'll tell
you more about that in just a second,

452
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,380
as well as land use. Where
are the residential areas? Uh,

453
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,990
so that the idea of clustering development
in close proximity to where existing

454
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:52,740
development, uh, was, was a critical,
uh, way of thinking about this.

455
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,543
Now,

456
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,100
our land cover also was considered to
whether or not to track of land was

457
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:03,240
forested, whether or not it was heath
land I, whether or not it was wetland. Uh,

458
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,830
so that the biological resources we're
also mapped on top of where did the state

459
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:12,720
lands lie? So there are 107 towns
and villages in the Adirondack Park.

460
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,040
So 107,
uh,

461
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,690
different local governments that were
upset with the state of New York for

462
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:22,590
taking their authority away, but they all
had to go through this mapping process.

463
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,281
Uh,

464
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:27,960
so those of you that are familiar with
geographic information systems know that

465
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:30,210
this process now goes on electronically.

466
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,430
So soils and vegetation and land
use and property ownership patterns,

467
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,340
they're, they're all piled on top
of one another electronically.

468
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,840
So you can zoom in or you could change
the layers that you're looking at. Uh,

469
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,240
instantly.
In this case,

470
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:47,680
they drew these maps out by hand
and that actually led to some pretty

471
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,920
interesting problems. Uh, when, uh,

472
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,350
private land owners would come to
the government and say, you know,

473
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:56,110
I'm not certain what zone I'm in,
I appear to be on a boundary.

474
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,430
And it turned out that, uh, by
drawing a line on a map, uh, that, uh,

475
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,420
is really small and
scale, that the, uh, the,

476
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:09,421
the width of the line itself often was
a hundred yards wide and a hundred yards

477
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:13,060
may or may not include all
the property of an individual.

478
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,300
So which section would they lie within
the 42 acre zone or perhaps the a 3.2

479
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,380
acre zone and made a huge difference in
the eventual saleability and property

480
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:27,500
value, uh, of the area. And
also proximity to roads. Uh,

481
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,720
I mean if you think about an area you'd
also want to know that we're the new

482
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,380
road network was he'd what you would
think very carefully about how you would

483
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:38,980
allocate density based upon access to,
to roadways.

484
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,870
So all of this information was put
together, uh, to develop, uh, this map,

485
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,530
which is a legal instrument. The idea
that a map might be a legal instrument.

486
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:50,500
It's kind of an interesting
thought. Uh, so that, uh,

487
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,950
in order for someone to know what their
rights are, their property rights are,

488
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,530
they would have to pinpoint
themselves on this map.

489
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,420
And each color is associated
with a certain density allowance.

490
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,800
So if you are located in the green,
that means that a,

491
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,390
you need 42 acres in order
to develop a new house.

492
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,270
If you're located in the
Yellow, oh, that's eight acres.

493
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,870
If you're located in the red,
then you only need one acre.

494
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,960
And if you're located in the village
centers, it's designated as Brown.

495
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,310
You have no density requirement.
It is all and at all, by the way,

496
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,740
you've heard about cap and trade.
Well,

497
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:28,540
the cap and trade idea can be applied
very well to a situation like this, uh,

498
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,830
so that you might allow trading rights
under certain circumstances, uh,

499
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:37,100
within a designated boundary, perhaps
within a community. So that a,

500
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:39,400
the idea of transferable
development rights, uh,

501
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,010
it's something that we'll
talk about, uh, next week.

502
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,870
So these are the different zoning, uh, uh,

503
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,460
limits that have been established
by law and have governed.

504
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:51,550
The Adirondack Park Agency
is implementation of this
plan for quite a while.

505
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,610
How does this play out as you're
looking at a landscape? Uh, well,

506
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:58,540
here's a little community.
It's a community of, of
King Valley, uh, that, uh,

507
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,460
is just at the foot of
the high peaks region,

508
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:02,770
the highest mountains in New York state.
And,

509
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,340
and this is a community
of about 800 people.

510
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,210
And here's the village center
with no density requirements.

511
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,600
And as you move away from the
village center, you find that a,

512
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,350
you're required to have
larger and larger lots, uh,

513
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,210
before you can build a new structure
until you reach a, the public lands, uh,

514
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,420
which,
uh,

515
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:27,220
begin in this case up on these hillsides
leading up into the high peaks so that

516
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:32,140
you can think about this as a kind
of a set of concentric circles.

517
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,420
Uh, it's much more complicated than just
concentric circles, but a development,

518
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:41,060
a ranging from the urban center on
one hand to wilderness areas that are

519
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:45,950
designated on the other hand so that
the public lands have their own set of

520
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:47,360
regulations under this statute,

521
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,940
the village of Lake placid where
the Olympic Games was held,

522
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:53,840
provides a good example of this where you
see the Brown and the center, uh, is, uh,

523
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,630
the area where there are no density
requirements. And then the lands that, uh,

524
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,710
a border, the federal wilderness
areas designated by this blue, uh,

525
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,110
they have the higher, uh,
higher restrictions, the
requirement for larger acreages.

526
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,450
So we're a battlegrounds. Where would
you imagine you would get the most, uh,

527
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,360
litigation? Where would you, uh,
find that the greatest amount of, of,

528
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,850
uh, private conflict, uh,
over these, these regulations?

529
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,840
Well, one clearly would
be, uh, areas with views,

530
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,710
so areas that have a high
elevations or areas that,

531
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,140
that are adjacent to water bodies.

532
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,560
So if you were going to
map out property values,

533
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,160
you would find that areas that had the
best views that had the highest elevation

534
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:41,660
and that were adjacent to either rivers
or lakes or ponds would have the highest

535
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,300
property values.
So you can be predictive about this,

536
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,140
about where you're going to receive
your, your greatest amount of, of, uh,

537
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,010
conflict and resistance to new regulation.
When property values are highest, uh,

538
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,270
you'll find people are most
anxious to, uh, to develop. Uh,

539
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,880
the rate of development occurs more
rapidly along roadways along the lakes and

540
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:05,220
rivers. And, uh, uh, the, uh,

541
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,140
costs of developing in the mountainous
areas at higher elevation are more

542
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:13,310
prohibitive to developers.
So shoreline such as, uh, uh,

543
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:18,380
this example on the lake
shores are, are, uh, extremely,

544
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:21,290
uh, uh, desirable from the
perspective of a developer,

545
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,970
a multi million dollar boat houses
that had been constructed also,

546
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:32,030
uh, hotels and, and, uh,
uh, large camps on islands.

547
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,320
There are more than a thousand islands
on a Adirondack lakes and ponds. Uh,

548
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:39,260
here's, uh, here's one of them
in, in Lake George as an example,

549
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,540
a lake George provides the water
supply for its town. Uh, so that,

550
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,860
uh, the, the water is, it's treated
with chlorine like new haven's water is,

551
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,670
it's filtered in a very
rough way through sand, uh,

552
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,950
but it's not filtered
by a activated carbon,

553
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:59,070
which could remove a variety of different
kinds of organic pollutants, uh,

554
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,500
that might be in the water supply.
Uh, so in this situation, if, if, uh,

555
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:08,090
this facility, I had a, uh,
its own a leaching field,

556
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,140
you'd be worried about it because most
of the islands in the Adirondacks are,

557
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,140
are basically mountains of bedrock that
have very shallow soils on them that

558
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:19,230
have very low capacity to absorb
a human sewage. So that a,

559
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:23,090
there is a considerable conflict
between the developers interest to build

560
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:26,440
adjacent to water bodies and the concern
of these communities to protect their,

561
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:27,410
their water supplies.

562
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,870
Another good example over
a prime development land
from the perspective of, of,

563
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,920
of, uh, the investor would be
a scenic vistas such as this.

564
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,410
This is one of the 40 odd scenic
vistas is that, that, uh, uh,

565
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,330
had specific development restrictions,
uh,

566
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:47,160
so that it sits on the,
uh,

567
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,120
just adjacent to mountain van Hoven Berg
and overlooks the Adirondack high peaks

568
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,580
and a developer,

569
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,810
a Mcdonald's corporation decided that
this was a site that they wanted to put a

570
00:35:55,811 --> 00:36:00,420
Mcdonald's up for. Uh, when they, uh, when
we're preparing for the Olympic Games,

571
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,310
they didn't want to go next
to Wendy's or, uh, to, uh,

572
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,840
build their golden arch next
to, uh, uh, Burger King. Uh,

573
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:12,210
and there was a strip already built in
lake placid, uh, just nearby. Uh, but, uh,

574
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,910
their vision of, of, of what
might look best in this area.

575
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:19,590
It was something like this. Well,
the restrictions in the map,

576
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:24,220
the fact that a, the surveyor
and uh, and, uh, the, uh, uh,

577
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,440
other park agency employee had to
put a pin in this area, gave the,

578
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,090
the state of New York the authority to
deny a permit to, to this developer, uh,

579
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:35,430
simply based on aesthetic grounds.
Uh,

580
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:39,420
the developer eventually did construct
Mcdonald's next to the Wendy's and burger

581
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:41,280
kings on the strip and lake placid.

582
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,300
Here's another example of a
developer developer that proposed a,

583
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:49,830
a several hundred unit condominium
complex on the edge of lake placid. Uh,

584
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,240
Lake Placid Lake Lake George also
provides a water from the lake to its

585
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,400
community as their drinking water source.

586
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,490
And they're very sensitive
about different threats to it,

587
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:03,750
whether or not it's a motorboat, uh,
develop a motorboat, uh, use, uh,

588
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:06,600
or whether or not it's a new
development on the lake shore.

589
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,160
This is a very large and a beautiful
lake and the water quality is

590
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:13,080
extraordinarily high.
Uh,

591
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:16,110
so here you see that a part of
this complex is a golf course,

592
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,850
but they wanted to build
hundreds of additional
condominium units. And, uh, the,

593
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,580
the argument that a developer
will make, there's often, uh,

594
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,190
when I called technologically optimistic,
you know,

595
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:30,440
we can build this without causing
any a decline in water quality. Uh,

596
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,870
within the lake. We will have the state
of the art sewage treatment system.

597
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,470
We will be sure that no
sewage reaches the lake. Uh,

598
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:41,190
we will also construct our buildings,
which they wanted on the edge of the lake,

599
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,150
uh,
in a way that would not cause sediment to,

600
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,540
to a flow into the lake so that there
would be no diminished, uh, water clarity.

601
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,740
The water clarity issue is often a
very significant point of debate. Uh,

602
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,950
with respect to new
development and Lake Tahoe,

603
00:37:55,951 --> 00:38:00,951
it's been extremely important because
the clarity of Lake Tahoe over those that

604
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:04,310
have you been, have been there
is, is exceptionally high. Uh,

605
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,900
they measure this by a Secchi
disk reading, which is a,

606
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:10,860
just a disc that they dropped down into
the water and you can see that disc in

607
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:15,540
Lake Tahoe, uh, at about 50 feet in
depth, which is really pretty remarkable.

608
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,750
But gradually over several decades,
uh,

609
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,050
the visibility declined and it was
because of development on the lake shores.

610
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,040
It was because of sedimentation and
also a runoff from adjacent, uh,

611
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,140
agricultural uses or, uh, uh,

612
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,990
say a runoff from streets and roads and
parking lots that were building up in,

613
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:37,640
inside the watershed so that most
communities that have lakes of,

614
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:41,930
of extremely high quality had this
concern. And it, it justifies their, uh,

615
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,140
adopting tougher zoning
regulations. In this case, uh,

616
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,410
when I worked in the Adirondacks,

617
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,760
I happen to be responsible for the state
of New York's review of, of the project.

618
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,060
And remember very distinctly, uh,
the, the initial proposal and, uh,

619
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,990
uh, my response, a requesting
additional information, uh, that, uh,

620
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:05,860
was about a 50 page letter that,
uh, I and, and colleagues wrote,

621
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,993
uh, that, uh,

622
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,120
we felt we needed in order to understand
the environmental impacts of this

623
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:14,460
development on the lake. Well, the
developer decided that, uh, uh,

624
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,680
they would scale the development back
quite substantially. They wanted a marina,

625
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:22,370
for example, uh, that would be suitable
for at least a hundred motor boats. Uh,

626
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,280
but the villagers and lake
placid didn't want motor boats.

627
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,880
Motor motors on boats are notoriously
inefficient, meaning that, uh,

628
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,830
much of the fuel, uh, he's
burned. But, uh, you know, uh, uh,

629
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,620
there is a proportion
at that point in time,

630
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:42,940
it was between 10 and 12% for the
standard engines that were being used on a

631
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:46,720
motor boats is simply shunted
into the water. So that, uh, uh,

632
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,470
slicks a are common around Marina's,
uh, that really are our, uh,

633
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,230
evidence of, of their
inefficiency. So gradually, a,

634
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,960
the proposal was whittled back from
several hundred units to, uh, uh,

635
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:00,520
several dozen units.
Uh,

636
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:05,020
the developer agreed not to build the
marina need agreed also to put the,

637
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:07,520
the buildings back further from the water,
uh,

638
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,250
to protect it from a
sedimentation, uh, and uh,

639
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:16,290
protect the water clarity and the total
amount of impervious surface allowed,

640
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:21,430
uh, uh, uh, uh, was, was also
a restricted, so the number of,

641
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:26,270
of uh, uh, parking spaces
for example, or the size of,

642
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,330
of,
of the track of land that they owned,

643
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,180
a that could actually be
covered by the pervious surface.

644
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,390
So these are all regulatory tools and
strategies that could be used to protect

645
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,770
this area. In addition, uh,

646
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,820
a darker color for the buildings was
required in building height was restricted

647
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,070
and this was to protect
the character of the area.

648
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,850
If you were looking at this site, uh,
from, uh, the middle of Lake placid,

649
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:51,960
looking back at mountain peaks
and looking at, at, uh, the,

650
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,040
the public lands that live back here.

651
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,790
It's a very natural looking landscape
and that was something that was, uh,

652
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,960
protected by the statute.
Uh, so that, uh, the,

653
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:04,900
the Adirondack Park Agency had
the authority to say, no, sorry.

654
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:08,340
You got to make sure that your
building is dark in color. Uh,

655
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,850
and that it's not higher than,
than x stories. So that, uh,

656
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,330
what's really driving, uh, the, uh, uh,

657
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,200
concern about this is his
underlying, uh, instincts,

658
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:25,201
underlying ideologies about a
appropriate uses of land and appropriate

659
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:27,460
definitions of private property rights,

660
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,830
a libertarian instinct as
opposed to an authoritarian
instinct. So the, the, uh, uh,

661
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,630
longtime residents to the Adirondacks,
uh,

662
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:40,100
would march down the street
with the American flag and,
and, uh, argue that, uh,

663
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,953
their freedom,

664
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,110
that their liberty was being violated
by this communist organization that has

665
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:47,630
taken away their property
rights and not compensated them.

666
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,910
So the centralization of authority has
been the primary mechanism of affecting

667
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,890
conservation policy in the United States.

668
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,320
Taking the private property rights or
assuming a authority to control public

669
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:05,090
lands, uh, is a form of, of a
concentration of authority. Uh,

670
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,980
also the ideology of a
utilitarianism that these resources,

671
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,690
resources are there for
human benefit in human use.

672
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,690
And we ought to be allowed to,
to gain access to them.

673
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,020
We got to be able to cut down the
timber on a forest preserve land.

674
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:23,340
We got to be able to, to
a ride our snowmobiles a
across these trails that, uh,

675
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,020
the preservationists instincts,
they're concerned about the noise,

676
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:31,480
about the air pollution. Uh, they're
concerned about a dense populations in,

677
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:34,850
in a wild areas that,
uh, that was, uh, uh,

678
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,720
something that was less important
than freedom of access, uh, and, uh,

679
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,450
the right of the people to
make use of the land. So,

680
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,940
uh, some of the towns, uh,

681
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:50,610
already had a high
percentage of ownership, uh,

682
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,250
in state lands and this created a very
different kind of problem. So you know,

683
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:55,750
that,
uh,

684
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,750
towns get the majority of their income
from property taxes that get some state

685
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:06,230
subsidies for, for a variety of purposes,
including schools. But, uh, also, uh,

686
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,240
for, for transportation, uh, and
sometimes for a medical facilities.

687
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,740
Uh, but, uh, uh, a town
such as this town, uh, uh,

688
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,670
has the majority of its land
in public ownership already,

689
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:23,750
which means that it has a highly
restricted private tax base, uh,

690
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:28,640
so that the state of New York
pays payments in lieu of taxes.

691
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,721
Uh, but, uh,

692
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:34,040
these really are not comparable to the
kind of income that could be generated if

693
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:38,480
development were unregulated, if they
were allowed to build a more rapidly. Uh,

694
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,930
another example of a
conservation strategy, uh,

695
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,810
is demonstrated by this
case in the town of keen.

696
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:50,220
There is a long strip of land that's
privately owned by the US Sable Club that

697
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:55,940
extends back, uh, perhaps a six miles
in length and maybe a half, a mile wide.

698
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,320
Uh, and if I should have a photo here
that would show you that the, the sides,

699
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,170
uh,
of this lake go these lakes,

700
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,060
I'll go up quite dramatically
into the mountain side.

701
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,450
It's owned by a private club.
Uh,

702
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,420
and the private club decided that
they were going to self restrict their

703
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:12,830
development rights,
uh,

704
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:16,400
but that they were going to sell those
development rights to the state of New

705
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:16,730
York.

706
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,150
So the state of New York did not take
over complete ownership with the land.

707
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,330
But remember I said the property
rights might be thought of as a bundle.

708
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,650
They sold off the developable rights
to the landscape while maintaining the

709
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:31,140
underlying fee ownership, uh, so that, uh,

710
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:35,490
they were able to do this in a way that
reduced their tax burden. The tax burden,

711
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,590
uh, to this community, uh, was
substantial given the, uh, uh,

712
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,640
hundreds of acres of lands that they
own, a so that they were anxious to, uh,

713
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,800
go to the town and, and say,
look, you know, our property
value has been diminished.

714
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:50,700
We've given up our development rights, uh,
so that, uh, our taxpayers should, should,

715
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:51,750
uh,
be lowered.

716
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,380
There are a variety of different instances
where the Nature Conservancy, uh,

717
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,190
throughout the United States
is affected the strategy, uh,

718
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,670
and it's less expensive than the state
going in and buying up all rights to the

719
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:05,280
land. Uh, and it does
offer this benefit, uh,

720
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,970
for those that feel like they do not want
to see the area developed any further.

721
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,240
So, uh, in, in this debate
is in many debates, uh,

722
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:19,110
who are the key actors? Who
are the stakeholders that
are, that are common? Well,

723
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,930
there are interesting tensions between
conservationists and environmentalist, uh,

724
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,710
particularly in respect to the
intensity of use of public lands.

725
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,850
So that in the Adirondacks for example,
you,

726
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,420
you would have the Adirondack 40 sixers
that pride themselves in having climbed

727
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:40,200
all 46 peaks in excess of
4,000 feet in elevation.

728
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,680
And then you'd have the
environmentalist's, uh,

729
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,820
and they were often at odds
about what the right way to, uh,

730
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,900
manage public lands ought to be the
recreational user groups as there are

731
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,730
surrounding all public
lands in the United States.

732
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,950
And these might vary from cross country
skiers, uh, to, uh, snowmobilers,

733
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,840
uh, to downhill skiers, to timber
companies, to oil companies, uh,

734
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:07,590
to those that feel like they're a values
associated with those public lands that

735
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:12,360
they want access to, that they can make
a profit from a, there are tourists,

736
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,010
uh, corporations as well that always
surround these tracks of land. Uh, uh,

737
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:21,610
outfitters in the western part of the
United States, a horse pack, uh, uh,

738
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,250
uh, trip offers, uh, and, uh, uh,
another good example might be, uh,

739
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,470
uh, what happens with the tour boats
and the cruise ships up in Alaska.

740
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,560
Uh, they're also, uh, as I mentioned
earlier, a, they're commonly, uh,

741
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:41,640
serious conflicts between permanent
residents that are more anxious to see

742
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:44,700
additional development of the park and
the seasonal residents that are trying to

743
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,160
basically keep it as
undeveloped as possible.

744
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,100
And there are tensions among
government agencies. Uh,

745
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,940
the agency that existed before the
Adirondack Park Agency was the state's

746
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:57,700
department of Environmental Conservation
and it had authority before the,

747
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,800
the 1973 act to administer
private public lands.

748
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:07,190
So if you suddenly give that authority
and policy making responsibility to a

749
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:08,280
different organization,

750
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:12,720
you're going to have terrific resentment
on the part of the agency that formerly

751
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:14,070
had that, uh, authority,

752
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,330
just like local governments were
resentful about the state assumption of

753
00:47:18,331 --> 00:47:23,020
authority. And then you have need of
American claims as well that, that, uh,

754
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,360
uh, uh, caused conflict in, in management,

755
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,100
both private and public lands and
led to litigation in the park. Uh,

756
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,650
what we're a time today and I'll pick
up a on public land issues and also

757
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:38,580
property rights questions with respect
to the fifth amendment on Thursday.

758
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,150
Thank you.
