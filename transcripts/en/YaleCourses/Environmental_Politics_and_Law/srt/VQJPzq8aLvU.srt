1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,180
So I want to continue talking today
about a land use and this special problem

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:09,060
that we face in managing
land use and development,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,660
uh,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,710
in the coastal zone.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,670
Uh,

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,660
why the coastal zone?

7
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:12,871
Well,

8
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,120
for several really important reasons,

9
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,210
one is that it's under
enormous development pressure.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,821
People,

11
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:19,290
uh,

12
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,123
uh,

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,690
often want to live in urban areas.

14
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:21,801
They,

15
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:25,320
they often want to live
in coastal environments,

16
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,700
but also the coastal zone is
experiencing a increased risk,

17
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,250
uh,

18
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,770
of damage from storms,

19
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,270
sea level rise,

20
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,450
and increased pollution that's
also associated with density.

21
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,580
So I want to talk today about the variety
of strategies that might be used to

22
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:42,540
control development,

23
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,080
uh,

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,980
in the coastal zone.

25
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:44,911
So,

26
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,270
uh,

27
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,601
this,

28
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,080
uh,

29
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,970
I thought I'd start out
with a little cartoon.

30
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:48,421
Good News.

31
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,770
At the current rate of global warming,

32
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,070
we should be able to just
swim over there and eat them.

33
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,330
And under five years,

34
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,270
so within the world,

35
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,440
640 650 million people
live in the coastal zone,

36
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,370
uh,

37
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:02,701
that,

38
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,170
uh,

39
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,400
uh,

40
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,770
are at some risk of,

41
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,870
of a property loss or,

42
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:09,300
or an injury from intense storms.

43
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,290
And the 10 countries with the largest
number of people living in vulnerable,

44
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,560
low elevation coastal zones include China,

45
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,370
India,

46
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,001
Bangladesh,

47
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,571
Vietnam,

48
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,111
Indonesia,

49
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,944
Japan,

50
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,520
Egypt,

51
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,290
the U S Thailand in the Philippines.

52
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,160
So that the,

53
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,900
the overwhelming majority of people that
live in the coastal zone in the world,

54
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,590
uh,

55
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,910
do not have the capacity to,

56
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,800
to manage,

57
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,520
uh,

58
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,870
the hazards that they face.

59
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,621
And,

60
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,454
uh,

61
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,060
uh,

62
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,430
the variety of,

63
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:37,751
of,

64
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:37,920
uh,

65
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,980
legal and economic strategies
that might be used to,

66
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,800
to,

67
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,450
uh,

68
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,920
prevent serious damages.

69
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,960
The subject of the lecture.

70
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,010
So the growth of cities in the coastal
zone a is a significant issue to pay

71
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,424
attention to,

72
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,240
so that on average coastal cities are
growing 20% faster than any other cities

73
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,074
in the world.

74
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,351
Uh,

75
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:02,790
and they have 10 to 15% higher densities
and other cities and other 20 mega

76
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,541
cities in the world.

77
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,020
15,

78
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,030
15 of them are in coastal areas.

79
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,030
Now within the U s we have a,

80
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,230
a statute called the
coastal zone management act.

81
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,930
And the act is administered by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric

82
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,280
Administration,

83
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,470
uh,

84
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,040
and it provides for management
of the nation's coastal zones,

85
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,120
uh,

86
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
as well as the resources found there.

87
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:23,881
Uh,

88
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,680
and it includes the
Great Lakes as well as,

89
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:25,861
uh,

90
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:26,191
the,

91
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,090
the sea coast.

92
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,710
And it is designed to balance economic
development and promote economic

93
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:35,430
development at the same time that it
promotes economic costs or environmental

94
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,264
conservation.

95
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,900
So it has a tension built into the
mission statement of the statute.

96
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,070
Now,

97
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,640
there was great debate within the Nixon
administration about the structure of

98
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,451
the statute and,

99
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,520
and what kind of teeth
would be put into it.

100
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,051
Uh,

101
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,600
should the federal government get
involved in the regulation of land use?

102
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,410
Uh,

103
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,041
the way that,

104
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:53,281
uh,

105
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,210
the state of New York got involved in the
regulation of private land use and the

106
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,044
Adirondacks.

107
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,741
Uh,

108
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,010
and the,

109
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:00,131
uh,

110
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,550
there were forces inside the,

111
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:02,980
the Nixon administration,

112
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,840
a Republican administration,

113
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,683
you recall,

114
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,001
that,

115
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:07,480
uh,

116
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,300
argued quite extensively that we
needed to protect land areas in the,

117
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,810
in the coastal zone and that,

118
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,320
uh,

119
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,800
uh,

120
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,660
the cost of the nation in terms of,

121
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,220
of bearing liability and responsibility
for rebuilding damaged areas,

122
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,850
uh,

123
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,080
was growing and,

124
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:23,300
uh,

125
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,300
it was going to be a potentially
overwhelming so that the
overall objectives are

126
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:32,020
conflicting and include
the phrase preserve,

127
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,860
protect,

128
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,490
develop,

129
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,480
and where possible to restore or enhance
the resources of the nation's coastal

130
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,314
zone.

131
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
We also have a,

132
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,810
uh,

133
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,950
a coincidental,

134
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,390
a statute that's created the
national flood insurance program.

135
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,140
Uh,

136
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,630
but that program is now
essentially bankrupt.

137
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,410
Uh,

138
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,140
so the,

139
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,340
the federal flood insurance program
faces major financial difficulties.

140
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,483
Um,

141
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:55,990
uh,

142
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,880
particularly as the Gulf coast recovers,

143
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,470
it's essentially bankrupt.

144
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,830
The Federal Emergency Management Agency
officials asked to mate that Hurricane

145
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,350
Katrina and Rita together would result
in flood insurance claims of about $23

146
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:10,870
billion.

147
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,021
Well,

148
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,110
it turns out that then when
you total up the cost of,

149
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:14,500
of,

150
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,080
uh,

151
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,340
uh,

152
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,540
emergency response,

153
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,530
uh,

154
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,120
property a restoration,

155
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,870
uh,

156
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,261
the,

157
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:20,560
uh,

158
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,950
the,

159
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,200
uh,

160
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,820
health care requirements
associated with these two storms.

161
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,360
Uh,

162
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,890
it's not $23 billion.

163
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,870
It's in the hundreds
of billions of dollars,

164
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,230
uh,

165
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,120
that the u s government expended.

166
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,993
So,

167
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,850
should coastal property be
ensured by the public sector?

168
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,230
Uh,

169
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,961
what kinds of,

170
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,201
uh,

171
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,790
alternatives might there be?

172
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,601
And,

173
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:40,721
uh,

174
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,390
the Federal Flood Insurance
Program has encouraged people,

175
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,530
uh,

176
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,590
to build in the coastal areas that are
at risk and it offers them a subsidized,

177
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,430
a low rate of insurance.

178
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:51,870
Uh,

179
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,620
so that in the event of storm damage,

180
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,640
property damage,

181
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,690
flooding,

182
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:55,871
uh,

183
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,310
the,

184
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,681
the,

185
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,514
uh,

186
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,150
uh,

187
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,130
government steps in and basically,

188
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,370
uh,

189
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,010
provides low cost insurance
so people rebuild.

190
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,490
So what are the variety of management
strategies that you might use the,

191
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:06,550
uh,

192
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,200
the different kinds of legal instruments?

193
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:08,831
Well,

194
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:11,140
there are certain questions
that you might address,

195
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,651
you know,

196
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,310
how should we go about protecting
open lands in the coastal area?

197
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,911
Uh,

198
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:16,721
should they be public?

199
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:17,650
Should they be private?

200
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,430
Uh,

201
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,560
should we employ land use regulation?

202
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,010
Uh,

203
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,840
should it be managed by a local
government says it traditionally has been

204
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,100
through much of the 20th century,

205
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,610
a state governments a or should
the federal government step in?

206
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,800
And I'll give you a couple
of examples over the next,

207
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,350
uh,

208
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,270
uh,

209
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,040
45 minutes that will show you how the
federal government has stepped in and

210
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,330
applied eminent domain,

211
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:40,780
uh,

212
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,230
to purchase up open areas and resources
that the government thought were

213
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,370
particularly valuable,

214
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,010
uh,

215
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,000
not just because of their
ecological characteristics,

216
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,460
uh,

217
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,110
but also because they provide
recreational opportunities,

218
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,650
particularly in vicinity of
these population centers.

219
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,500
So insurance,

220
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:58,850
uh,

221
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,340
whether or not the insurance
programs should be,

222
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,450
uh,

223
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:02,870
uh,

224
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,703
continued,

225
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,161
uh,

226
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,140
whether or not the
subsidy should be removed.

227
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:06,591
Uh,

228
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,730
this is an open question.

229
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,980
How about transferable development rights?

230
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,870
I'll speak about this in a few moments,

231
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,171
but,

232
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:12,620
uh,

233
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,620
the idea behind transferable
development rights is that you have a,

234
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,161
a,

235
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:16,994
uh,

236
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,600
uh,

237
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
source zone,

238
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,551
uh,

239
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:21,260
so that if a zone is set up,

240
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,490
a zoning scheme has set up,

241
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,210
uh,

242
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,220
and one area is more restricted,

243
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,070
uh,

244
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,420
uh,

245
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,930
to,

246
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,291
to,

247
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:27,470
uh,

248
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,030
limit development than another area.

249
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,460
Uh,

250
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,460
the restricted area might have some sort
of a scheme where they could transfer a

251
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,360
credit,

252
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,550
uh,

253
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,383
to develop,

254
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:36,681
uh,

255
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,460
to another area or a receiving zones.

256
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:40,940
So you might think about it as having a,

257
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,370
a sending zone and a in a receiving zone,

258
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,001
uh,

259
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,950
and so that if you are restricted,

260
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:48,990
you can't build on your property because
you're lying within a flood plain,

261
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,790
you're lying,

262
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,340
uh,

263
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,690
say adjacent to a wetland
or a next to the shoreline,

264
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,410
uh,

265
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,120
then you don't lose your property value.

266
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,730
So that this idea of
transferable development rights,

267
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,210
uh,

268
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,680
does an end run around,

269
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:00,990
uh,

270
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,281
the,

271
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,180
the question about,

272
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,390
uh,

273
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,230
compensation,

274
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:03,981
uh,

275
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:04,521
so that,

276
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:04,940
uh,

277
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,870
it avoids the,

278
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:06,171
the,

279
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:06,291
uh,

280
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:06,860
the,

281
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,070
the possibility of,

282
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:09,140
of litigation,

283
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,620
uh,

284
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,960
based upon the Fifth
Amendment that we described.

285
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,700
I went through on Tuesday.

286
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:14,890
So,

287
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,200
uh,

288
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,861
thinking about,

289
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,191
uh,

290
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:16,451
you see,

291
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:20,180
I've repeated insurance
twice here thinking about
the idea of easements so that

292
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:23,390
the government could go into an area and
buy up some of the development rights,

293
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,691
but,

294
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:23,810
uh,

295
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,643
not all of it.

296
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,410
So,

297
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:25,911
so,

298
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:26,380
uh,

299
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,180
uh,

300
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,510
the,

301
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,640
uh,

302
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:27,960
the,

303
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,060
the complete bundle of rights might
be broken up into bits and pieces.

304
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,010
You could also imagine a statute that a
would employ a variety of different tax

305
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,873
schemes.

306
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,940
They might be property tax related so
that property taxes could be elevated in

307
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:44,091
areas that,

308
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:44,270
uh,

309
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,860
are especially valuable,

310
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,581
uh,

311
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:51,260
and they might be lower in areas that are
further away from the coast outside of

312
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:51,331
the,

313
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,280
the hazard zone.

314
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:52,911
Uh,

315
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,280
and you might think also
about income tax credits.

316
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,731
I mean,

317
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,210
what if you receive an income tax
credit when you purchase property,

318
00:07:59,450 --> 00:07:59,661
uh,

319
00:07:59,661 --> 00:07:59,961
that,

320
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:00,140
uh,

321
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,820
was in a low risk area or in an
area that had lower resource values?

322
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,260
Uh,

323
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,971
and also the,

324
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:09,500
the idea of payment
for ecosystem services.

325
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,240
Now w w what would that mean?

326
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,710
What our ecosystem services?

327
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,430
Well,

328
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,270
I mean the coastal coastal
zone in its natural condition,

329
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,930
uh,

330
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,760
plays many different valuable roles.

331
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,460
And I'll show you some photos in a,

332
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:21,661
in a,

333
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:24,950
in a moment that demonstrate
the flood storage capacity.

334
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,400
Uh,

335
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,390
but also the biological diversity is
often a higher and in coastal areas.

336
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,710
And,

337
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,940
uh,

338
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,551
also,

339
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:31,880
uh,

340
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,410
recreational opportunities.

341
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,251
Uh,

342
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,150
marine fisheries,

343
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,600
the commercial value of coastal
zone is extremely important.

344
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,320
Uh,

345
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,900
nearly 75% of,

346
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,560
of marine fisheries are,

347
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,190
uh,

348
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,761
are,

349
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:43,881
uh,

350
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:44,181
that are,

351
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,080
are commercially,

352
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:45,430
uh,

353
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,680
uh,

354
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,400
caught,

355
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,910
uh,

356
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,910
spend some portion of their life in a
coastal estuaries in a wetlands areas.

357
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,151
Uh,

358
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:53,411
and,

359
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:55,100
and many of the coastlines,

360
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,410
uh,

361
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,310
of the United States,

362
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,090
they're,

363
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,570
they're,

364
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,260
uh,

365
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,780
ringed by thin bands of sand,

366
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,200
uh,

367
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,330
that are known as barrier islands.

368
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,140
And these barriers basically act to,

369
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:06,420
uh,

370
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,253
to protect,

371
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:07,800
uh,

372
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,060
the inland areas,

373
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,840
uh,

374
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,440
from,

375
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,811
from,

376
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:10,901
uh,

377
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,150
intense storm damage.

378
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,081
So that,

379
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:13,500
uh,

380
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,770
uh,

381
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,491
thinking about,

382
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:14,970
uh,

383
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,990
the variety of,

384
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:16,350
uh,

385
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,950
uh,

386
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,220
protective services and recreational
and commercial opportunities,

387
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:20,940
uh,

388
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,900
in addition to the property
value opportunities that
most local governments are

389
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:25,734
looking at.

390
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,041
A,

391
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,120
and why would that be?

392
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,170
While local governments get their
primary source of tax revenue,

393
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:31,890
uh,

394
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,420
to,

395
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,540
uh,

396
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,050
offer all of their services,

397
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,500
uh,

398
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,460
predominantly,

399
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,970
uh,

400
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,760
based upon the valuation of property.

401
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,340
So as development increases in any town,

402
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,720
in any municipality,

403
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,211
uh,

404
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:47,370
it offers increased opportunity for a
local or municipal government to secure

405
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,300
additional taxes.

406
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,180
So payments for ecosystem services.

407
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:51,680
Now,

408
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,280
what might that be?

409
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,300
Well,

410
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,133
supposing,

411
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,160
uh,

412
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,750
you have,

413
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:56,940
uh,

414
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,780
someone who,

415
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,231
who,

416
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:58,500
uh,

417
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,180
wants to develop in a,

418
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:01,230
in a wetland area,

419
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,041
uh,

420
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:07,041
and you have created a regulation or a
statute that offers specific protection

421
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,140
of wetlands and wetlands are,

422
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,730
are protected in the United States
under the clean water act if they're a

423
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:17,730
adjacent to a navigable waterway.

424
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,331
Uh,

425
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:22,680
but many states have also adopted their
own protective a wetland statutes and

426
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,590
make many local governments
have also filed suit.

427
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,480
So these areas that,

428
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:27,661
uh,

429
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,250
are seasonally wet,

430
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,430
uh,

431
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,440
or marshy or parts of estuaries,

432
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,400
they get special legal
attention in the United States.

433
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,670
So now imagine that a,

434
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,240
you decided that you wanted to,

435
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:39,690
uh,

436
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,800
curtail any future development
in a wetland or in,

437
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:42,980
uh,

438
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,610
an endangered species habitat,

439
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,650
uh,

440
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,060
and or in a,

441
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:47,170
uh,

442
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,003
in a flood zone.

443
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,163
Well,

444
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,183
basically,

445
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,440
uh,

446
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,200
if somebody wanted to develop there,

447
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:52,620
uh,

448
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,270
you might give them a credit,

449
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,500
uh,

450
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,740
so that they could do that.

451
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,220
Uh,

452
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,371
they,

453
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:57,960
they may have to pay extra.

454
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,480
Uh,

455
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,540
and that money could go into a bank,

456
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
a basically an ecosystem service bank,

457
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,060
and they're now banks that have been
created in the United States and in

458
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:10,590
different parts of the
world where developers are
developing in sensitive areas

459
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,520
that are allowed to do that,

460
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,980
but they have to pay into this bank.

461
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,060
And then that money is used to,

462
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,550
to,

463
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:17,671
uh,

464
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:18,504
restore,

465
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,390
uh,

466
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:19,651
uh,

467
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,090
resources that have been degraded,

468
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,480
uh,

469
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,860
perhaps in the same watershed,

470
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,600
perhaps in the same municipality,

471
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,440
uh,

472
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,000
or the,

473
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:27,390
uh,

474
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,720
uh,

475
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,300
funds might be used to purchase land,

476
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,990
uh,

477
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,410
to,

478
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,243
to uh,

479
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,460
uh,

480
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,630
offer greater protection.

481
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,300
And the trade is a rarely conducted on a,

482
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,111
on an acre,

483
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,540
per acre or hectare per hectare basis.

484
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,080
Uh,

485
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,900
normally,

486
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,340
uh,

487
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,250
you require the developer
to pay for protection,

488
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,820
uh,

489
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
at some multiple of the,

490
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,540
the scale of the original development.

491
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,320
So it might be a,

492
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:55,000
a one for three or a one for four acre
trade developer gets to develop one acre,

493
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,990
but then he's literally financing
the protection of another area.

494
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,830
So this,

495
00:11:59,830 --> 00:11:59,981
uh,

496
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:04,930
this form of a credit creation
and a purchase and banking,

497
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,150
it's becoming much more
common around the world.

498
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,010
And if you think about,

499
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:09,844
uh,

500
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,300
uh,

501
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,020
the similarity to this between the cap
and trade idea that we discussed when we

502
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,530
were talking about the clean air act
and the sulfur dioxide provisions,

503
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,410
remember that,

504
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,640
uh,

505
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,540
in the north,

506
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,070
uh,

507
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,620
in the Ohio valley and up through
the northeastern United States,

508
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,490
you had,

509
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:24,830
uh,

510
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,200
this cap put on CO2 emission
allowances for all the power plants.

511
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,243
So,

512
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,770
and that allowed a,

513
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,350
uh,

514
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,540
uh,

515
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,810
a trading scheme to evolve so that,

516
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:35,110
uh,

517
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,441
the,

518
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:36,274
the,

519
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,223
uh,

520
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,430
as the ceiling for total allowable,

521
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,900
so to diminished,

522
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,270
uh,

523
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,900
it made the,

524
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,310
uh,

525
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,950
uh,

526
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,270
uh,

527
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,200
allowances,

528
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,900
a much more valuable so that those that,

529
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:47,170
uh,

530
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:47,650
could,

531
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,071
could,

532
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:48,904
uh,

533
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,781
those that,

534
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:50,200
uh,

535
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,381
uh,

536
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:52,590
admitted the lowest levels of Sot,

537
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,440
uh,

538
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,041
received,

539
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,190
uh,

540
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,190
credits that they could then
sell to those industries,

541
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,640
uh,

542
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,840
that wanted to keep polluting.

543
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,340
They didn't want to
invest in the technology,

544
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,450
perhaps a scrubber.

545
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,710
So this idea is,

546
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:03,040
is,

547
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,311
is,

548
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:03,600
uh,

549
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:03,850
you know,

550
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,240
very similar to what's being
discussed with respect to,

551
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,900
to a carbon trading,

552
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,350
but,

553
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,640
but also it has great similarity to
these other concepts about ecosystem

554
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:13,450
services.

555
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:13,991
So that a,

556
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:18,220
it's the underlying requirement is that
there has to be some sort of a legal

557
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,054
threshold,

558
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,451
uh,

559
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:22,360
that's easily identifiable
and some sort of a trading,

560
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,500
a formula that is set up in
order for these to be functional.

561
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,290
So here's a suite of,

562
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,890
of different kinds of,

563
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,280
uh,

564
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,030
management,

565
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,241
uh,

566
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,074
alternatives.

567
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,710
Now as you think about the vulnerability,

568
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,011
uh,

569
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:36,790
of,

570
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,760
of a property and life in,

571
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:39,594
in the coastal zone,

572
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,350
I want you to be thinking about it.

573
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:41,770
Uh,

574
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,603
ecologically.

575
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,020
I want you to think about,

576
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,410
uh,

577
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:44,621
you know,

578
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:45,610
what principles,

579
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:45,741
uh,

580
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,080
of ecology or our understanding of,

581
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:51,730
of ecosystems and how they're structured
and function and how they change over

582
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:52,340
time.

583
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,010
What principles should you have in mind
as you're thinking about selection among

584
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:57,970
these different strategies?

585
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,410
And I think that one of the intellectual
pioneers of this idea of tying the

586
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:03,580
science of ecology,

587
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,180
uh,

588
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,370
with law that would,

589
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,080
would somehow control
the way that we use land.

590
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:08,531
Uh,

591
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,120
it was pioneered by Ian Mcharg,

592
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,290
a relatively famous landscape architect
at the University of Pennsylvania,

593
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,120
and a,

594
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,990
the individual that,

595
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:17,230
uh,

596
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,781
really I,

597
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,990
I give credit to for inspiring me to,

598
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:20,071
uh,

599
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,910
to do what I do with my life.

600
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:22,770
Uh,

601
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:22,901
no,

602
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:27,400
I want you to think carefully about a
population concentrations in the United

603
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,401
States.

604
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,400
Just swirling the,

605
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:28,990
uh,

606
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,760
quickly here.

607
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,491
Here's Boston,

608
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,330
Massachusetts,

609
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,291
Providence,

610
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,124
Rhode Island,

611
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,203
New York City.

612
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,460
Uh,

613
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:35,870
uh,

614
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,390
this is a San Francisco,

615
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:37,961
uh,

616
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,471
so that,

617
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:38,860
uh,

618
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,041
you know,

619
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:39,791
think about,

620
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,000
uh,

621
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,261
the,

622
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:44,110
the density of a property
and population that lives in,

623
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
in the coastal zone,

624
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,010
so that,

625
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,150
uh,

626
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,030
if you calculate the proportion
of the u s population,

627
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,550
uh,

628
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:49,810
that,

629
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,950
that lives in coastal,

630
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,620
it's now over 50% of the US population
that lives in these shaded areas.

631
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,260
And the areas of most rapid growth,

632
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,050
uh,

633
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,190
include the northeastern part of the u
s particularly southern New Hampshire

634
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:05,630
and,

635
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:05,991
and,

636
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:06,400
uh,

637
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,890
uh,

638
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,723
Cape Cod,

639
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,230
a also long island,

640
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,710
uh,

641
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,710
but parts of Maryland and a also Florida
and Florida is experiencing just a

642
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,240
continued enormous growth.

643
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,660
25% of the vacation homes in the United
States are now owned and in Florida.

644
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,390
And I'm going to pause here
and I hope that this works.

645
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,140
Uh,

646
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,410
I'm going to pause here to see if I can,

647
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:30,950
uh,

648
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,380
call up Google earth cause many of you,

649
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:33,860
uh,

650
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,371
perhaps,

651
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:34,520
uh,

652
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
have not been to Florida.

653
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,291
Uh,

654
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:36,661
but,

655
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:37,494
uh,

656
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
take you over and just a
very quick Google earth,

657
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,500
a cook's tour of the,

658
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:42,651
uh,

659
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,520
of the coastline

660
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,550
first starting out in
the Miami beach area.

661
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,380
And here as we,

662
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,340
as we zone in,

663
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,120
uh,

664
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,361
you,

665
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,370
you begin to see the
intensity of development,

666
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,580
but you also are looking
at a barrier island.

667
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,120
This is one of those thin
strands of sand in this case,

668
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:05,270
maybe a quarter to a third of a mile.

669
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,540
And with that,

670
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,010
that,

671
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,250
uh,

672
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,600
in its natural form,

673
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,280
uh,

674
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,550
it buffers,

675
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,473
it buffers a,

676
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,070
the energy from waves and storms,

677
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,400
uh,

678
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:13,910
so that,

679
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,300
that,

680
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,750
uh,

681
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,930
that energy doesn't normally affect the,

682
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,261
uh,

683
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:19,094
the Bayshore,

684
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,581
uh,

685
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,050
over over here.

686
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:21,860
So that,

687
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,141
that,

688
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:22,880
uh,

689
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,930
this barrier island wants to
migrate in a landward direction.

690
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,420
So this poses a really interesting
kind of a legal problem.

691
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:29,871
You know,

692
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:30,580
if you're managing a,

693
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:30,840
um,

694
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,210
uh,

695
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:31,390
the,

696
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,220
the development of,

697
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,630
of an Adirondack a mountain,

698
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,180
you don't have the,

699
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,900
the same,

700
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,150
uh,

701
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,020
ecological dynamic going on as you do
here because this is basically just a big

702
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:42,920
pile of sand,

703
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:43,650
uh,

704
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,110
and it's shaped by wind.

705
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:45,950
It's shaped by,

706
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,420
by waves,

707
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,381
and,

708
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:48,890
uh,

709
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,400
basically wants to literally
wants to roll over itself,

710
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:52,970
uh,

711
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,590
in a landward direction.

712
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:55,760
So if you take a look at,

713
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:56,130
uh,

714
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,480
uh,

715
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,250
say a Cape Hatteras or,

716
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,720
or asset Teague island,

717
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:01,250
or some of the other national parks,

718
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:01,670
uh,

719
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,760
that had been established
on these barrier islands,

720
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,131
uh,

721
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:09,020
you'll actually see them
migrating in a landward direction,

722
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,591
often the,

723
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:13,790
at a rate of maybe a two to
four to five feet per year,

724
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,260
depending upon storm intensity.

725
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,630
So in,

726
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:16,881
in a,

727
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,200
in a natural condition,

728
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,723
you would see,

729
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,061
uh,

730
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,190
in the bay you'd see,

731
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:22,560
uh,

732
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,720
a wetlands and it would be a very active,

733
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,610
uh,

734
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,890
nursery for a variety of
commercial marine species,

735
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:28,760
as I mentioned earlier.

736
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,421
But,

737
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:29,541
uh,

738
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:29,871
as you,

739
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:34,040
as you zone in which you can see here
is that the property values and in urban

740
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,370
areas had just gone so high that the
intensity of development is really quite

741
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,484
remarkable.

742
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,810
So that Miami Beach,

743
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,141
of course,

744
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,570
you have the hotels right on the beach,

745
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,231
uh,

746
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:45,681
with the,

747
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:45,801
uh,

748
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,060
the Cabanas on the beach.

749
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,980
And as you,

750
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,070
you move further north,

751
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:50,641
you see that,

752
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:51,210
uh,

753
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,571
uh,

754
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,750
the sandy area was transformed
into a golf course.

755
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,351
And,

756
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:55,501
uh,

757
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:56,430
over here,

758
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,681
uh,

759
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,230
in the sunset islands area,

760
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:58,710
uh,

761
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,610
just think about,

762
00:17:59,630 --> 00:17:59,691
uh,

763
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:00,481
what this used to be.

764
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,860
This used to be a salt marsh.

765
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,441
Uh,

766
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:07,440
and the salt marsh was
basically transformed by
dredging up the wetland areas,

767
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,340
the estuary,

768
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,720
and piling up that a soil and bringing
in concrete and other materials,

769
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,320
uh,

770
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,430
to create,

771
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,210
uh,

772
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,340
these remarkable little communities.

773
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,001
So,

774
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:18,600
uh,

775
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,550
people were able to drive
to these communities and,

776
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:21,000
uh,

777
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,211
uh,

778
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:25,860
also park their boats there so that
each one of these artificial islands has

779
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:26,611
created a,

780
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:26,851
you know,

781
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,820
roughly 75 to a hundred different lots,

782
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,240
uh,

783
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,230
at an average price
selling price in the 1970s,

784
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:34,561
80s,

785
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:35,490
and 90s and 90s,

786
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,061
uh,

787
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:36,894
that was,

788
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,530
uh,

789
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,363
approaching a,

790
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:38,810
uh,

791
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,960
$1 million.

792
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,850
So just to buy the property alone,

793
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,993
uh,

794
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,760
regardless of the cost of building a
wood would cost $1 million so that,

795
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:48,410
uh,

796
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,243
uh,

797
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,103
developers,

798
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,450
we're given the license to basically do
what they wanted on the barrier island.

799
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,230
Uh,

800
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,560
and if you look further north
along the Florida coastline,

801
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:58,921
uh,

802
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:03,360
you see that the majority of Florida's
coastline has these barrier islands on

803
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:03,900
it.

804
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,300
So I was going to take you on a,

805
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,240
a flight over this.

806
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:12,210
I don't know if any of you have played
with a flight simulator on Google,

807
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:12,640
but,

808
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,230
uh,

809
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,130
I decided against doing that
in the lecture because I
end up spending more time

810
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:19,230
underwater with a plane
and then on the surface,

811
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,040
uh,

812
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,570
but here you can see the,

813
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,081
the,

814
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:22,171
uh,

815
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:22,981
the barriers,

816
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:23,230
uh,

817
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,491
you know,

818
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:24,990
variable in intensity,

819
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,310
but Miami Beach,

820
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,050
uh,

821
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,510
uh,

822
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,380
is probably the,

823
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,930
the most intensely
developed barrier island,

824
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,381
uh,

825
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:33,480
in the u s if not the world.

826
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,590
So I'll pause back out of this
and head back to the lecture.

827
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,641
And also the,

828
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:42,180
uh,

829
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,590
the development in California,

830
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,310
uh,

831
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,730
in the southern part of the
state is some of the most rapid,

832
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:47,911
uh,

833
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:48,180
that,

834
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,013
that we've seen,

835
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,660
although the recent housing crisis has,

836
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,070
has a slowed that.

837
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,440
Now I want you to think also,

838
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,690
uh,

839
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,100
a bit about a technological
solutions because a,

840
00:19:59,101 --> 00:19:59,341
there,

841
00:19:59,341 --> 00:19:59,911
there are many,

842
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,440
many engineering solutions to,

843
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,180
to protect against a loss of life
and following a very intense storm,

844
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:06,660
uh,

845
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,020
where tens of thousands of people lost
their life in Great Britain and also the

846
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:10,830
Netherlands.

847
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,070
Uh,

848
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,570
back in the early 1950s,

849
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,280
a project was initiated,

850
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,460
uh,

851
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,750
called the Delta works.

852
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,700
And the Delta works basically
built a seawalls and dykes,

853
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,241
uh,

854
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:21,571
that,

855
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:21,970
uh,

856
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,201
uh,

857
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,960
those in the Netherlands
are quite famous for and,

858
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:25,110
uh,

859
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,010
they're very effective.

860
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,880
So here's the,

861
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,560
the largest seawall in the world,

862
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,041
uh,

863
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,371
that,

864
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:29,670
uh,

865
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,780
so that it's triggered,

866
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,250
it closes automatically,

867
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:32,791
uh,

868
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,180
when,

869
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,920
when the sea level rises up,

870
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,630
uh,

871
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,170
a certain number of feet.

872
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,880
And here's the other themes barrier
designed to protect a London against

873
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,720
flooding from,

874
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,670
from a severe storms as well.

875
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,930
So there are a variety of,

876
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:49,510
of different technological solutions
that are extraordinarily expensive,

877
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,080
uh,

878
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,520
but given the property value,

879
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,031
uh,

880
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:52,361
that,

881
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:52,481
uh,

882
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,490
exists and is at risk in the coastal zone,

883
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,800
these are likely to be in our future in,

884
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,100
in,

885
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,270
uh,

886
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,140
in us,

887
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:58,850
uh,

888
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,683
urban areas.

889
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,490
Uh,

890
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,010
and think for a moment
about the hurricane Katrina.

891
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,700
Again,

892
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:03,881
uh,

893
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:04,071
the,

894
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:04,270
the,

895
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,880
the low bound projection
of the cost is roughly,

896
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,480
uh,

897
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,820
cost of loss to the public.

898
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,380
$200 billion.

899
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,500
The high bound is closer to
a half of a trillion dollars.

900
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,310
Uh,

901
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,480
and part of the,

902
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:16,841
the,

903
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:16,931
uh,

904
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:21,931
the loss was associated with the
failure of the US Corps of Engineers to,

905
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,500
uh,

906
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,760
uh,

907
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,610
make a decision that would
raise the level of the dike,

908
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,150
uh,

909
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,720
that would be protective for can't
afford category five hurricane.

910
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,960
They decided when they
were choosing among,

911
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,380
uh,

912
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,891
different,

913
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:36,310
uh,

914
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,610
uh,

915
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,310
structural design alternatives,

916
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,670
they decided that they would build the
sea wall that would be protective only

917
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,220
for a category three to four storm.

918
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:45,610
Uh,

919
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,660
the reason being that they
had the authority to make
that decision by balancing

920
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:51,160
costs versus benefits.

921
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,650
So they reduced everything
to cost versus benefit.

922
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,280
And they basically concluded
that the probability of of a,

923
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,750
a category five,

924
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:02,020
the worst case scenario
was exceptionally low.

925
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,500
Here's an example of that dyke,

926
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:08,830
a breaking through and the school
bus on the bottom being flooded over.

927
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,470
Now a different approach,

928
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,880
a different approach to this rather than
using a high tech solutions that are

929
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:16,720
really expensive,

930
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,220
uh,

931
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,580
was,

932
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,690
was being pursued by the u s
back in the 1960s and seventies,

933
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,840
a legal strategy that evolved in Congress,

934
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,500
uh,

935
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,000
to create a variety of new
national parks that were then,

936
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,370
uh,

937
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:31,870
uh,

938
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,340
called national seashores.

939
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,130
So,

940
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,390
uh,

941
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,500
Cape Cod for example,

942
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:37,960
was one of the first
national seashores after,

943
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:39,130
after Cape Hatteras.

944
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,210
And so that you can imagine that
there are these private lands,

945
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,841
uh,

946
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,610
and the government was
trying to figure out,

947
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,001
well,

948
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,060
how can we effect,

949
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,891
in fact,

950
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:52,000
when we create a new national park in
an area of private land or an area that

951
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,310
may be private land or county lands,

952
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:55,210
state lands.

953
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,420
So there isn't really a complex
mixture of different public and private

954
00:22:58,421 --> 00:22:59,260
ownership pattern.

955
00:22:59,630 --> 00:22:59,890
Uh,

956
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,340
but,

957
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,671
but,

958
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:00,910
uh,

959
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,743
no,

960
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,440
no federal presence prior to 1961 to 63.

961
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,460
So the park service was given
the authority by Congress.

962
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,000
This is a John F.

963
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,020
Kennedy,

964
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,300
uh,

965
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,750
who,

966
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,460
who assigned this statute,

967
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,200
um,

968
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,460
and,

969
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,770
uh,

970
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,480
and his family being famous for their,

971
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:16,991
their home.

972
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:17,191
And,

973
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:17,560
uh,

974
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,330
Hyannis on Cape Cod,

975
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,450
very families,

976
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,530
very protective of,

977
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,790
of land use and development on Cape Cod.

978
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,750
Uh,

979
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,080
and,

980
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,471
and,

981
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,040
uh,

982
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,370
uh,

983
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,490
conservation groups have long thought
that this was an area worthy of,

984
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,780
of federal protection.

985
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,310
So that the park service,

986
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,550
uh,

987
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,360
was given the money and the authority
by Congress to go in and buy up the land

988
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:37,550
on,

989
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,210
on Cape Cod are a part
of the land on Cape Cod.

990
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,030
And they decided to do that
in a very interesting way.

991
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,970
They decided to exclude areas
such as the village centers,

992
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,750
uh,

993
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,310
and whereas they would buy up the,

994
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:49,541
the,

995
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,570
the coastal areas,

996
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,021
uh,

997
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:51,831
that offered a,

998
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,410
the most,

999
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:52,760
uh,

1000
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,060
uh,

1001
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,350
recreational opportunity.

1002
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,460
But interestingly,

1003
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:59,540
they also had the highest property value
so that they were in a sense the most

1004
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,374
controversial,

1005
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:00,890
uh,

1006
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,390
so recreational opportunity,

1007
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,240
uh,

1008
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,580
the maintaining the,

1009
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:04,851
the,

1010
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,180
uh,

1011
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,190
possibility of public access to the beach,

1012
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,210
which in New England,

1013
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,690
in the eastern part of the u
s is extremely difficult to,

1014
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,570
to get to.

1015
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,750
So if you try to get to the
beach and coastal communities,

1016
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,350
uh,

1017
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,430
here in Connecticut,

1018
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,150
you often have a hard time getting there
because you've got house after House

1019
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:20,984
after house,

1020
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,440
uh,

1021
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,090
and you've got fences put up.

1022
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,630
So that even though the state of
Connecticut has adopted its own law that

1023
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,830
demands public access,

1024
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,240
this is no way close to the,

1025
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,160
the ethic and culture of public
access that evolved in California,

1026
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,880
uh,

1027
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,691
as well as in,

1028
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:39,910
in Oregon and in parts of Washington so
that different parts of the country have

1029
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,750
these different cultural
predispositions to allow public access.

1030
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,560
So,

1031
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:45,861
you know,

1032
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:46,161
one,

1033
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:49,310
one way to think about this
problem is to think about,

1034
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:49,521
you know,

1035
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,240
which,

1036
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,451
uh,

1037
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:53,510
which private lands does the
park service really want to own?

1038
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,290
Uh,

1039
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,320
do they really want to buy up somebody's
house or they want to buy up a

1040
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,160
commercial,

1041
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,360
a shopping center,

1042
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,730
or do they want airports in,

1043
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:03,170
inside the park or outside of the parks?

1044
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:06,980
Are there many difficult decisions
that have to be made if you decide that

1045
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:10,820
you're going to use the power of
eminent domain to go in and create a new

1046
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,100
national seashore or a new national park.

1047
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,670
So this was all occurring by the way,

1048
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:20,210
in an era when climate change concern,

1049
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:20,690
uh,

1050
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,330
was pretty much nonexistent
back in the 1960s.

1051
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,590
But it actually was quite farsighted in,

1052
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,031
in,

1053
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:29,240
uh,

1054
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,541
as a,

1055
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,590
as a legal strategy that we might learn
lessons from today about how we could

1056
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:35,720
manage other areas in the u s that,

1057
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:35,980
uh,

1058
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,271
are,

1059
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,760
are relatively undeveloped.

1060
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,320
And if you look also at the ecological
characteristics of the coastline here,

1061
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:42,680
uh,

1062
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,840
you can see the same kind of barrier spit,

1063
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:45,320
uh,

1064
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,520
but in the natural form,

1065
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:46,911
uh,

1066
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:47,220
that,

1067
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,870
uh,

1068
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,201
that,

1069
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:48,500
uh,

1070
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,460
existed down in Miami at
Miami beach before that was,

1071
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:52,761
was,

1072
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,320
uh,

1073
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,450
uh,

1074
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,560
intensively developed.

1075
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,633
Obviously the,

1076
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,890
the density is much,

1077
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,140
much lower here than Miami beach,

1078
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,340
but it gives you a sense of,

1079
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,174
of what,

1080
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,571
uh,

1081
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:06,620
an ecosystem like this would look
like in a relatively undisturbed form.

1082
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,521
So that the,

1083
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:12,521
the national seashore now extends
all the way to the tip of Cape Cod.

1084
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,400
Uh,

1085
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,510
up to Provincetown includes about six
communities with the most intensively

1086
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,700
developed areas excluded from it.

1087
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,953
Now the,

1088
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,690
the Cape Cod formula for land protection,

1089
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,081
uh,

1090
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:25,170
was curious because it,

1091
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:25,960
it,

1092
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,200
it gave the government the power to use
eminent domain to go in and take private

1093
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,034
property.

1094
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,320
An eminent domain means that they would
be compensated for their value loss.

1095
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,910
And it's kind of curious because many
property owners realize that a boy,

1096
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:41,490
you know,

1097
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,150
[inaudible] now that people understood
that the park service was buying up

1098
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:45,984
private lands,

1099
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,400
uh,

1100
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,630
property values were
going through the roof.

1101
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,530
So,

1102
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:49,741
you know,

1103
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,050
whenever anybody wants to preserve land,

1104
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:52,651
uh,

1105
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:54,660
and they have to buy
up a number of parcels,

1106
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,430
then it really pays the,

1107
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:56,720
uh,

1108
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:56,950
uh,

1109
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,500
the last to hold out because property
value is going to be a highest.

1110
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,880
And also these rates,

1111
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,420
property value increase were
occurring at about 50% per year.

1112
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,980
So many,

1113
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,740
many people took the park
service to court and said,

1114
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,251
no,

1115
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:12,450
we're not going to give you our land.

1116
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,860
Even though compensation
was being offered a,

1117
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,960
so what they did was they were playing
a game watching property values increase

1118
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,291
knowing that,

1119
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:22,520
uh,

1120
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:22,891
the,

1121
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,350
the,

1122
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,530
uh,

1123
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,530
market value that they would be provided
for the property would be decided once

1124
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:29,760
the court,

1125
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,090
uh,

1126
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,470
had made its final decision.

1127
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,341
So eight,

1128
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:33,930
10 years later if they could draw the,

1129
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:34,530
the,

1130
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,360
the litigation out over a decade,

1131
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:36,751
uh,

1132
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:40,920
when you have a 50% increase per year
that caused the park service great

1133
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:41,754
anxiety,

1134
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,240
uh,

1135
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,930
and made them,

1136
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,770
uh,

1137
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,440
increased their offer to settle.

1138
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,750
But it was a much more expensive venture.

1139
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,170
Uh,

1140
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,660
that took a lot more time to accomplish.

1141
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,810
The Nature Conservancy is used
a similar kind of strategy,

1142
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,710
but rather than going into an area
such as the Virginia coastal reserve,

1143
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,470
uh,

1144
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,490
rather going into the area in and telling
people we're going to create a new,

1145
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:04,470
a nature conservancy preserve here.

1146
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,281
Instead,

1147
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:05,951
they set up a,

1148
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:06,810
a variety,

1149
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,020
a large number of,

1150
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:08,380
of,

1151
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,550
uh,

1152
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,200
separate dummy corporations,

1153
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,650
uh,

1154
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:10,981
that,

1155
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:11,340
uh,

1156
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,240
went in and purchased the
tracks independently so that
nobody really had a sense

1157
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:19,080
that there was one group coming in
and they were basically creating this

1158
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:19,770
collective.

1159
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,100
And that whole strategy
was designed to prevent,

1160
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:23,400
uh,

1161
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,760
uh,

1162
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,720
people from delaying from holding
out and trying to secure the benefit,

1163
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:27,900
uh,

1164
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,380
that,

1165
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:28,681
that,

1166
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:28,891
uh,

1167
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:30,570
the increased property value over time,

1168
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,213
uh,

1169
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,353
would provide.

1170
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,250
So thinking also about,

1171
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,401
uh,

1172
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,010
the,

1173
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,510
the,

1174
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,930
the dynamics of this environment and
why it's different than an upland area,

1175
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,200
a say in central New York
or Central Connecticut.

1176
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:43,950
Uh,

1177
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,390
the energy that,

1178
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:45,750
uh,

1179
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,030
uh,

1180
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,390
is,

1181
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,070
is pushing against a,

1182
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,520
uh,

1183
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,650
a barrier such as,

1184
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:49,790
uh,

1185
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,041
as,

1186
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:50,370
uh,

1187
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,200
Miami beach or acid Teague island.

1188
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,080
It's coming predominantly
from two sources.

1189
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,550
One is wind and one is waves.

1190
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:56,971
Actually,

1191
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:58,470
the sand shifts around more,

1192
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:58,830
uh,

1193
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,830
in response to wind because a
prevailing winds pushed the sand up and,

1194
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:04,531
and,

1195
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:05,010
uh,

1196
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,221
uh,

1197
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:05,441
the,

1198
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:07,950
the central stabilizing
force of a barrier island,

1199
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,550
uh,

1200
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,600
is nothing more than,

1201
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,600
than a blade of grass and a on Cape Cod.

1202
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,310
As just one example.

1203
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:14,950
Um,

1204
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,890
the kind of seagrass grass that they have,

1205
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,330
uh,

1206
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,450
mark the Dune grass they
have that often grows up,

1207
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,080
uh,

1208
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,640
maybe a meter in height,

1209
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,930
but it also sends roots down about a
meter in height so that it can withstand a

1210
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,910
lot of overwashed by storm waves.

1211
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,331
Uh,

1212
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:31,051
at the same time,

1213
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,770
that plays a function of building up
these dunes because it just reduces,

1214
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,240
uh,

1215
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,540
the,

1216
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,850
the wind velocity in the vicinity of the,

1217
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:38,230
of the,

1218
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,800
of the grass blades down to a level,

1219
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,460
I think I'm recalling it at
17 miles an hour on Cape Cod.

1220
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,270
So the,

1221
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,880
the grains of sand are blowing across,

1222
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,620
uh,

1223
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,790
the beach and they hit the,

1224
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,840
the sea grass and they settle the Dune.

1225
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,621
The Dune,

1226
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:54,454
uh,

1227
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:54,911
then,

1228
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:55,360
uh,

1229
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,440
builds itself up,

1230
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,890
uh,

1231
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,060
under natural conditions,

1232
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:58,810
uh,

1233
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,670
under conditions where
people are trampling,

1234
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,050
trampling the sea grass or,

1235
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:06,030
or off road vehicles are trampling
the seagrass or developers or are,

1236
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,850
uh,

1237
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,060
uh,

1238
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,250
building on building on the dunes.

1239
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,580
You have a much more rapid rate of
Dune laws and increased instability.

1240
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,161
Uh,

1241
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,050
this house is no longer in place.

1242
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,450
This house has fallen in to,

1243
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:19,770
uh,

1244
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,230
uh,

1245
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,040
uh,

1246
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,730
falling over the cliff in response to
a storm that kept chipping away at the

1247
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:25,171
base of,

1248
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:25,610
of,

1249
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,111
of this,

1250
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:26,260
uh,

1251
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,340
large dude and many barrier islands
also have a phenomena where they have a

1252
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:31,570
freshwater lens,

1253
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,021
uh,

1254
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:37,021
of groundwater that sits on
top of the underlying seawater,

1255
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:37,531
which is,

1256
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:41,680
is denser so that most people on
barrier islands as well as on Cape Cod,

1257
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,900
get their water supply from this,

1258
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,763
uh,

1259
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,400
uh,

1260
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,731
this,

1261
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:46,310
uh,

1262
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,510
uh,

1263
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,440
groundwater lens and that is
extremely vulnerable to contamination.

1264
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,100
Uh,

1265
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,060
and why would that be?

1266
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,490
Because it's just basically a,

1267
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:54,790
a huge sand pile.

1268
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,300
So anything that is deposited on the
surface can easily migrate beneath the

1269
00:30:58,301 --> 00:30:59,134
surface.

1270
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,340
So in,

1271
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:00,721
in,

1272
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:01,000
uh,

1273
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,541
Cape Cod,

1274
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,700
they've now done a storm
vulnerability analysis,

1275
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:07,990
which they've done throughout the United
States and tried to figure out what the

1276
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,760
best response might be.

1277
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,931
In some areas,

1278
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,090
they,

1279
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,250
the park service tried to use riprap,

1280
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:13,780
uh,

1281
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,390
which are a big blocks of
stone that they put against,

1282
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:16,810
uh,

1283
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,290
uh,

1284
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:17,651
the,

1285
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:18,130
uh,

1286
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:18,963
uh,

1287
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,440
the edge between the,

1288
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:20,641
the,

1289
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:22,240
the beach and the sand dunes.

1290
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,520
And they found that that
was not a good idea because,

1291
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,510
uh,

1292
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,720
uh,

1293
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,200
hurricanes and doe northeasters could
pick up those stones and basically,

1294
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:29,900
uh,

1295
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,190
uh,

1296
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,390
chew right through the,

1297
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:31,481
uh,

1298
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:34,690
the barrier island using
the stones that pushes the,

1299
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:34,841
uh,

1300
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:37,360
the way he's pushed the
stones right through the sand.

1301
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,900
So many people have started
building their houses on stilts,

1302
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:41,381
uh,

1303
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:41,890
or,

1304
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,220
uh,

1305
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,240
refitting stilts,

1306
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:43,600
uh,

1307
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:43,870
and,

1308
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,231
and,

1309
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:44,411
uh,

1310
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:46,090
the underlying infrastructure,

1311
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,583
uh,

1312
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,011
that,

1313
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:48,750
uh,

1314
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,550
uh,

1315
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:54,360
would be more survivable and
many don't also understand that,

1316
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:54,520
uh,

1317
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,920
during periods of intense storms,

1318
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:57,340
uh,

1319
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,550
that these barrier
islands want to basically,

1320
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,000
uh,

1321
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,210
be cut into segments so that,

1322
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:03,420
uh,

1323
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,880
uh,

1324
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,930
they get overwashed.

1325
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,381
Uh,

1326
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,270
and then as the base behind them fill up,

1327
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:07,610
uh,

1328
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,580
the tide goes down and the water shoots
out of the bay and cuts across a,

1329
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:15,010
here's a good example
of a house on Cape Cod,

1330
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,630
a that was built on a barrier.

1331
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,870
And the,

1332
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:18,020
uh,

1333
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,853
the individual,

1334
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,301
uh,

1335
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:22,570
when he found that his house was
floating in the middle of the bay,

1336
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,380
he,

1337
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,741
he,

1338
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,040
uh,

1339
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,730
got his boat out and he went out and
he'd put a chain through his door and his

1340
00:32:27,731 --> 00:32:28,510
window,

1341
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:28,811
uh,

1342
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:31,830
and dragged the house
back to the shoreline,

1343
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,470
uh,

1344
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,170
hired a crane operator to
come in and pick the house up,

1345
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:40,160
put it on a track tractor trailer and
drag it back out and put it back exactly

1346
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:41,270
where it was on the beach,

1347
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:41,900
uh,

1348
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,830
in the u s federal government through
the flood insurance program paid for the

1349
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:46,664
entire cost.

1350
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,630
So here's another good example of the,

1351
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:55,650
the dynamic character of a barrier where
the sands are literally blowing through

1352
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,610
an oak forest up on Cape Cod.

1353
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,571
So that,

1354
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:00,080
uh,

1355
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,290
uh,

1356
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,120
naturally,

1357
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,250
uh,

1358
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,420
unnatural condition,

1359
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,381
uh,

1360
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,000
is,

1361
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,290
is,

1362
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,800
is a rare condition for a barrier.

1363
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,431
And the,

1364
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:07,731
uh,

1365
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:08,900
the estuary that it,

1366
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,350
that it harbors in the United States now
because of the intensity of development

1367
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:14,360
and the incentive that people have had to,

1368
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,110
to try to make money by investing
in property in this era.

1369
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,910
Fire island national seashore,

1370
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:20,391
by the way,

1371
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:23,420
is only about 35 miles
to the south of us here.

1372
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:23,820
Uh,

1373
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,430
and it's a pretty good example of portions
of it are good example of a barrier

1374
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:29,000
island.

1375
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,380
And in 1963,

1376
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,870
two years after the Cape Cod
national seashore was created,

1377
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,230
the Fire Island national seashore
and wilderness area was created.

1378
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,810
So I bet you didn't know that
you are within 35 miles of,

1379
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,340
uh,

1380
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,770
a will federally
designated wilderness area.

1381
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,510
Now,

1382
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,040
if you live in a coastal area,

1383
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,770
one way of securing your own protection,

1384
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,221
uh,

1385
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:51,650
is to try to capture the sediment,

1386
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:53,360
the sand that's moving
along the coastline.

1387
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,493
So people,

1388
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,580
you can imagine that,

1389
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:56,060
uh,

1390
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,241
uh,

1391
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,200
this coastline was,

1392
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,820
was straight and a,

1393
00:33:58,821 --> 00:33:59,780
you imagine that a,

1394
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:01,790
the first property owner
in this case decided,

1395
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,820
you know,

1396
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,950
my beach is eroding.

1397
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,650
I'm going to supposing that
this was the area that he,

1398
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:07,161
he was,

1399
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:07,580
uh,

1400
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,300
uh,

1401
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,540
uh,

1402
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,980
particularly concerned about,

1403
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,370
uh,

1404
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,210
my beach is eroding.

1405
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:15,350
I'm going to build a jetty that will
actually capture that sand as it's being

1406
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,880
pushed along the shoreline,

1407
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,983
which he did.

1408
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,560
Well,

1409
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,210
if you're going to
capture sand in one area,

1410
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:21,440
you're going to create a deficit.

1411
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,340
And then the next area,

1412
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,061
uh,

1413
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,970
so that,

1414
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:25,010
that is the phenomena,

1415
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:25,311
this,

1416
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,160
this accretion and deficits,

1417
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,641
uh,

1418
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:31,250
effect of building a jetty
explains why you have everybody.

1419
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,840
Uh,

1420
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,350
basically doing the same thing.

1421
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,071
And,

1422
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:34,730
uh,

1423
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,500
I was flying over the
Connecticut shoreline,

1424
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,730
uh,

1425
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,030
last weekend and,

1426
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:39,864
uh,

1427
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,200
you can see these jetties a side by side.

1428
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,650
Uh,

1429
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:42,981
uh,

1430
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,570
all along the new haven,

1431
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:45,261
the Milford,

1432
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:45,680
uh,

1433
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,420
east haven Brantford shoreline.

1434
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:47,631
Very,

1435
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:48,800
very interesting phenomenon,

1436
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,870
but very expensive to maintain,

1437
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,731
to build in,

1438
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:52,564
to maintain.

1439
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,960
And here's another example of,

1440
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:54,741
of how to,

1441
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:55,040
uh,

1442
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,880
capture sand.

1443
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,511
Let's see.

1444
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,970
A Massachusetts Beach
buggers associations,

1445
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,100
beach buggy association that a,

1446
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,250
uh,

1447
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,230
is planning sprigs of sea grass,

1448
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,400
uh,

1449
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,260
in an effort to uh,

1450
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,220
to rebuild the Dune.

1451
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,480
And it actually works,

1452
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,010
uh,

1453
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,200
by,

1454
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,790
by planning these springs of grass,

1455
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,481
they can,

1456
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:11,870
uh,

1457
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,730
cause uh,

1458
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
a dune system to be become restored,

1459
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,220
uh,

1460
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,750
within a matter of a couple of years.

1461
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,641
So the,

1462
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:18,821
the,

1463
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:21,980
the Cape Cod formula or was
also applied to fire island.

1464
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,970
And uh,

1465
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,590
one key element of this legal strategy
was that if governments at the local

1466
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,710
level did not adopt the zoning
restrictions at the park service,

1467
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,530
wanted for those more
developed communities,

1468
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,860
then the federal government had the
authority to use domain to go in and just

1469
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:39,990
take over the land.

1470
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,870
So it was a,

1471
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,630
a carrot and the stick idea.

1472
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,613
In a way.

1473
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,090
If the local government did not
adopt the standards to protect the,

1474
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:50,880
the ecological values of
these barrier islands,

1475
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,760
then the federal government would
go in and use eminent domain.

1476
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,170
Interesting kind of combination as far I
don't looking down fire island parts of

1477
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:01,860
it or rather intensely
developed a quarter acre houses,

1478
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,960
sometimes 10th of an acre houses.

1479
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,711
And a,

1480
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,210
the underlying aquifer,

1481
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:07,044
in this case a,

1482
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,100
was polluted,

1483
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:13,310
requiring them to drill much deeper wells
and to provide a Cuban community water

1484
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,484
supply.

1485
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,750
I'm gonna Scoot ahead here.

1486
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,040
Another example.

1487
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,040
Here's an example,

1488
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,350
uh,

1489
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,600
of a bunch of fairly expensive houses,

1490
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,081
uh,

1491
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,700
sitting on the shore of fire island.

1492
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,320
And because these are
extremely vulnerable to,

1493
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:30,741
to,

1494
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:31,200
uh,

1495
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,033
storms,

1496
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,230
uh,

1497
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,640
it's very common for this first
row sitting right on the beach,

1498
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,121
uh,

1499
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:36,960
to be wiped out,

1500
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,830
to be flooded out.

1501
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,220
Uh,

1502
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,690
which is kind of interesting because it,

1503
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,703
it causes a,

1504
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,910
uh,

1505
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,880
an instant,

1506
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,410
a shift in property value on a barrier
when the first line gets wiped out.

1507
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,244
So here's a,

1508
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,040
another shot of a,

1509
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,150
an area nearby when you can see,

1510
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:51,491
uh,

1511
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:51,811
the,

1512
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:56,811
the former house posed locations
marked out by these boundaries,

1513
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,070
uh,

1514
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,920
so that all of a sudden
these become short and,

1515
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:01,210
uh,

1516
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:01,640
uh,

1517
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,311
a crew,

1518
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:04,650
a terrific increase in property value.

1519
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,410
Uh,

1520
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,130
another example of a
property rights mixed here,

1521
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:08,530
uh,

1522
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,530
on fire island is the point of woods
association where the land is owned by a

1523
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,070
collective of corporation,

1524
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,050
a that then leases out the right to,

1525
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,960
to take over one of the
houses in the community.

1526
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,470
Uh,

1527
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,210
for a specific period of time.

1528
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
It could be 50 years,

1529
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:26,790
it might be 75 years,

1530
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,330
and these lease rights are often
passed on down among family members.

1531
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,880
So this has been an effective strategy on,

1532
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,140
uh,

1533
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,400
in this case to protect the common space,

1534
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:36,600
the open land in,

1535
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:37,434
in the middle,

1536
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,671
by the way,

1537
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:43,430
you see also an example here of basically
creating a seawall on the base side,

1538
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:43,921
uh,

1539
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:44,221
that,

1540
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:44,341
uh,

1541
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:47,370
would offer protection for the
houses that were built here.

1542
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,720
But to do that,

1543
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,170
they basically had to dredge out
the material here and dump it on,

1544
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:52,870
on,

1545
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,470
uh,

1546
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,070
uh,

1547
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,220
other marshland in order to create this,

1548
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,701
this,

1549
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:57,180
um,

1550
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,013
developable,

1551
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,220
developable property.

1552
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,390
Uh,

1553
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,890
another example on fire island,

1554
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,530
if you look at the little
dot up there at the end,

1555
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,970
the fire island lighthouse,

1556
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,290
it was funny guy.

1557
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,400
I flew right over this,

1558
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:08,521
you know,

1559
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:09,340
the other day,

1560
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,620
uh,

1561
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,790
the firing of the lighthouse is a,

1562
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,040
was built right on the end of this spit.

1563
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,010
And you can see back in 1834,

1564
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,490
uh,

1565
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,840
that it was close to the end,

1566
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:19,261
uh,

1567
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,760
by a 1909,

1568
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,350
uh,

1569
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:21,551
the,

1570
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:22,710
the spit at extended,

1571
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,100
uh,

1572
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,510
several hundred yards.

1573
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,990
Uh,

1574
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,880
and today,

1575
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,450
uh,

1576
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:27,990
the,

1577
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,060
the spit is almost a four,

1578
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,140
four and a half miles,

1579
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,530
uh,

1580
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,220
beyond the,

1581
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,053
the lighthouse.

1582
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,480
So that not only do these barrier
islands wanna roll toward the mainland,

1583
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,380
but they also want to extend themselves
in the same direction of the,

1584
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:41,681
the,

1585
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:42,410
uh,

1586
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:42,780
the,

1587
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,060
uh,

1588
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,020
prevailing flow,

1589
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,420
the prevailing currents.

1590
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,370
Another couple of examples
of pre and post storm,

1591
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,151
uh,

1592
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:52,540
and,

1593
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,373
and uh,

1594
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:53,650
uh,

1595
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,070
this was a hurricane Rita and uh,

1596
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,670
some of these were taken
down on the Texas coast line.

1597
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,930
The Padre Island area.

1598
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,790
Padre island is an interesting,

1599
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,450
uh,

1600
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,940
additional example of a national seashore,

1601
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:07,430
uh,

1602
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,991
so that,

1603
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:08,320
uh,

1604
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,030
keep your eye in this case,

1605
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,421
uh,

1606
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,290
on the structure,

1607
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,090
which is right about there.

1608
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,760
So this is pre storm.

1609
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,231
Uh,

1610
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,440
and this is post storm.

1611
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,700
Another example of high rise buildings.

1612
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,743
Uh,

1613
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,741
and again,

1614
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:28,940
think about this high rise building
sitting on top of a big sand pile,

1615
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:29,780
uh,

1616
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,530
structurally rather unstable pre storm,

1617
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,050
uh,

1618
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,883
and post storm.

1619
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,280
And in this case you can
see in the background,

1620
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,640
uh,

1621
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,770
there's almost no damage
to the properties that are,

1622
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,340
are,

1623
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,931
are on the,

1624
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:43,350
uh,

1625
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,000
uh,

1626
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,560
Bay side of the barrier.

1627
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,800
Another example pre-storm

1628
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,890
and post storm

1629
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,860
pre-storm and poster.

1630
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,870
This case is interesting.

1631
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,440
Uh,

1632
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,790
here's a shorefront owner,

1633
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,870
uh,

1634
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,050
who was surprised to find
that he was now a corner lot.

1635
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,750
So this is a terrific
example of the way that a,

1636
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,830
a barrier can get overwashed.

1637
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,791
And then the,

1638
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:16,911
uh,

1639
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:18,860
the title flux causes the,

1640
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:18,981
uh,

1641
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:21,800
the water inside the channel
just to saw back and forth.

1642
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,720
And this occurred interestingly on,

1643
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,170
uh,

1644
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,480
uh,

1645
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,650
Nassa beach in Chatham and Cape Cod.

1646
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,090
Uh,

1647
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,611
so that,

1648
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:28,731
uh,

1649
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:29,470
one of these,

1650
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,890
a little inlets,

1651
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,580
uh,

1652
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,580
was created by a storm on northeastern
and the sawing action of the tides and

1653
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:38,024
the currents,

1654
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:38,281
uh,

1655
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:43,281
an additional storms caused the inlet to
expand to be more than a mile in width.

1656
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,730
And the,

1657
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:49,730
the bay front that a lay behind
it suddenly became ocean front.

1658
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:50,721
Uh,

1659
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:51,330
and the,

1660
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,460
the new ocean front owners,

1661
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:53,870
uh,

1662
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,870
were really upset because they now
faced increasing risk of storm damage.

1663
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,740
So they went to,

1664
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:00,881
uh,

1665
00:41:00,881 --> 00:41:01,111
the,

1666
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:05,060
the state of Massachusetts and they
also went to the corps of Engineers and

1667
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:05,660
said,

1668
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,871
you know,

1669
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:08,840
you've got to step in and you've
got to offer us protection.

1670
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,051
Uh,

1671
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:09,201
is,

1672
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:09,481
were,

1673
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:11,900
were too vulnerable or
properties vulnerable to loss.

1674
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,531
And,

1675
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:12,711
uh,

1676
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:15,800
it caused now that they
were no longer a bay front,

1677
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:16,760
but they were ocean front,

1678
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,150
uh,

1679
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,400
their,

1680
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,781
their,

1681
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:17,940
uh,

1682
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,900
shorefront was eroding away and
their property was being threatened.

1683
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,510
And the corps of Engineers and
the state of Massachusetts,

1684
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,260
uh,

1685
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,640
said,

1686
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:24,851
you know what,

1687
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:25,684
we're sorry.

1688
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,533
This is a,

1689
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,890
is a natural process,

1690
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,490
uh,

1691
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:28,731
uh,

1692
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:29,031
that,

1693
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:29,241
uh,

1694
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:32,990
we're not going to step in to intervene
so that the u s government has stopped

1695
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,130
these seawalls and stop building
these jetties to capture sand,

1696
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:37,790
uh,

1697
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,121
to,

1698
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:38,211
uh,

1699
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,560
to protect private ownerships.

1700
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,513
Very interesting,

1701
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,030
uh,

1702
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,190
outcome that has attracted
a lot of litigation,

1703
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,570
uh,

1704
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,390
pre-storm in poster form.

1705
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,660
So I'm going to have to shoot ahead here.

1706
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,510
Let me close by just saying that the,

1707
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:53,730
the,

1708
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,810
the central questions
that one would ask about,

1709
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:59,420
the best way to manage
property and the coastal zone,

1710
00:41:59,690 --> 00:41:59,990
uh,

1711
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,920
include these,

1712
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,310
uh,

1713
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,180
should the land be held in public
ownership or private ownership?

1714
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:05,900
Uh,

1715
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,733
if you,

1716
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,320
if the land is currently
in private ownership,

1717
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,020
how should it be taken
into public ownership?

1718
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,860
Uh,

1719
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,370
should,

1720
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:13,680
uh,

1721
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,540
should the land be,

1722
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:14,830
uh,

1723
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,290
uh,

1724
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,123
regulated,

1725
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:16,700
uh,

1726
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,270
that's a much cheaper solution than
going up and going in and buying up the

1727
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,104
land.

1728
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,000
I using the power of eminent domain,

1729
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,550
uh,

1730
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,640
or purchasing the land
from a willing seller.

1731
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,090
Uh,

1732
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,430
how should we structure
our insurance programs?

1733
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,150
Uh,

1734
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,830
how are we going to manage the tension
that exists between the high property

1735
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,060
value in the coastal zone?

1736
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,730
A that provides the fuel to
developers to want to go in and,

1737
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:43,040
and develop a intensively the
creates this public liability.

1738
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,660
Uh,

1739
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,493
what is the,

1740
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:45,930
uh,

1741
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,520
uh,

1742
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,271
requirement,

1743
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:47,540
uh,

1744
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:47,960
to,

1745
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,321
to,

1746
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:48,680
uh,

1747
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,880
provide compensation,

1748
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,661
uh,

1749
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:54,410
when a regulation is being used
to protect one public good?

1750
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:58,400
Are many public goods access
to recreational opportunities?

1751
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,030
Uh,

1752
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,511
the,

1753
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,960
the important nursery characteristic
for commercial fisheries,

1754
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,300
the ecological value of,

1755
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:05,540
uh,

1756
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:05,751
of,

1757
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:06,050
uh,

1758
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,150
an estuary to store flood waters.

1759
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:08,721
Uh,

1760
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:09,231
so that,

1761
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:09,790
uh,

1762
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,100
uh,

1763
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,480
if an estuary is filled up,

1764
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:14,630
then it just means the floodwaters are
going to move someplace else so that

1765
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:17,840
there are clear benefits associated with
regulating development in the coastal

1766
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:18,674
zone.

1767
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,870
So that if you set those regulations up,

1768
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,760
should you also have to
compensate the private land owner,

1769
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:24,410
uh,

1770
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:24,770
uh,

1771
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,121
to,

1772
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:25,954
uh,

1773
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,400
uh,

1774
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:26,830
if,

1775
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,740
if he claims or she claims that are
their property value has been diminished.

1776
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,341
Uh,

1777
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:31,821
so that,

1778
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:31,941
uh,

1779
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:36,770
these are the kind of conflicting and
competing values that exist in the coastal

1780
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:37,604
zone.

1781
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:38,601
Okay.

1782
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:39,381
That's it for today.

1783
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:40,220
Have a great weekend.

1784
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,030
Enjoy the weather.
