1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,030
We're going to talk today about
managing technological dangers.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,040
And in this case history on a nuclear
weapons is really a good one because it,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,021
it,

4
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:12,210
uh,

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,210
provides insight into a whole array of
technological hazards and dangers that,

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,151
that,

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:18,480
uh,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,660
we'll pick up in,

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,170
in different cases as we
move through the term.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,400
Uh,

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:23,981
this one is,

12
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:27,360
is quite distinctive and it'll give
us a chance to explore a number of

13
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,194
questions,

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:28,620
uh,

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,520
in this lecture,

16
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,851
uh,

17
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,940
particularly about different
strategies like how you might,

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,730
how you might decide to,

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,130
to manage dangers in,

20
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:38,040
in different ways.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,800
One typical approach are that was used
in this history was the reliance on

22
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,670
expertise.

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,350
Uh,

24
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,770
so technical experts,

25
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,100
uh,

26
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,050
had the responsibility not just to,

27
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,770
to,

28
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,150
to,

29
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,790
uh,

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,030
uh,

31
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,780
design,

32
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:51,961
uh,

33
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:52,860
the new weapons,

34
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,671
uh,

35
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,510
to think about,

36
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:54,690
uh,

37
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,180
the other kind of public
interest applications,

38
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,490
especially nuclear energy in the 1950s.

39
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,360
Uh,

40
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,681
but,

41
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,100
but also to worry about,

42
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,380
uh,

43
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,010
what,

44
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,590
what would happen to the,

45
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,100
the bombs and the material
once it was exploded.

46
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,240
So the idea that you would concentrate
expertise in an organization such as the

47
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,720
Atomic Energy Commission at the same time,

48
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:19,080
that you would give them complete
authority over the technology.

49
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,160
So that a,

50
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,090
the statute that was passed
in 1946 the created the AEC,

51
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,930
I was really remarkable in that
that had concentrated authority,

52
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,790
it concentrated knowledge.

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,340
It gave the AEC,

54
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,680
uh,

55
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,030
the intellectual property rights so
that no corporation was allowed to

56
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,740
understand or work on the technology
unless they had reached a,

57
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,060
received a specific security clearances.

58
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,170
So this overlap of unlimited resources,

59
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,790
unlimited expertise,

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,430
and complete authority
is really remarkable.

61
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,510
I can't imagine a concentration
of more power in a,

62
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,770
in one organization.

63
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,970
Another critical approach to a managing
technological hazards is the control of

64
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,200
experimentation.

65
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,540
So how would you try it out?

66
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,350
And there are many products
in the marketplace,

67
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,270
many chemicals,

68
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,810
uh,

69
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,650
many other kinds of technologies
for a burning fuels,

70
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,484
coal,

71
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,390
uh,

72
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,770
gasoline that are released in the
markets without adequate testing.

73
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,060
So here's one,

74
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,540
uh,

75
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,540
that was released at grand scale and the
public really had no understanding of,

76
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,980
of what the government was doing
because of the classified nature of,

77
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:31,740
of the,

78
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:31,891
uh,

79
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:32,790
of the projects.

80
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,600
Uh,

81
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
so,

82
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,680
uh,

83
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,680
they amassed expertise in the form of
academic experts to try to figure out not

84
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,500
only what the destructive power of
the different weapons would be a,

85
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,940
but also what happened to them.

86
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,670
Public Education is another approach.

87
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,001
Uh,

88
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,820
and we'll see in a film
clip in a few moments.

89
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,420
Uh,

90
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,730
if our audio and video work correctly,

91
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,950
we'll see the atomic energy commission,

92
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,450
public service announcements,

93
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:57,900
uh,

94
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,530
designed to and,

95
00:02:59,531 --> 00:02:59,891
and,

96
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,310
uh,

97
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,630
and build public support.

98
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,720
So,

99
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,370
uh,

100
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,203
obviously the,

101
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,291
uh,

102
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,300
the public was well aware that that,

103
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:07,451
uh,

104
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,430
these nuclear explosions were going on.

105
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:09,881
I mean,

106
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:13,210
walking to the top of casinos
and hotels in Las Vegas,

107
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,720
uh,

108
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,280
at night to watch them explode.

109
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:15,491
I mean,

110
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,840
the public was well aware of this,

111
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,410
uh,

112
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,810
but they understood well
the destructive power,

113
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,200
uh,

114
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,030
but they didn't really
know what to make of,

115
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,450
of,

116
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:22,690
uh,

117
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,920
what the danger might be.

118
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,180
The danger to,

119
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:25,680
uh,

120
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,230
uh,

121
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,570
uh,

122
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,251
the environment.

123
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:27,431
The,

124
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,211
the danger to,

125
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,160
to human health of,

126
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,700
of the remnants of the explosions.

127
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:31,691
Uh,

128
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,660
another approach would be to
limit the potency of a technology.

129
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,910
So to try it on a really small scale.

130
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,590
And what's curious about this was that
the arms race that grew between the

131
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,980
Soviets and the US s,

132
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,550
uh,

133
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,710
caused the development,

134
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,990
the rapid development
of bigger and bigger,

135
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,290
uh,

136
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,380
weapons greater and
greater explosive power.

137
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,790
Uh,

138
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,301
so that,

139
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:52,481
uh,

140
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,380
rather than,

141
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,860
uh,

142
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,620
trying to move from a system,

143
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,010
uh,

144
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,900
which we'll see in a couple of weeks,

145
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,441
uh,

146
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:04,441
with pesticides or pharmaceuticals is
another good example where the attempt,

147
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:04,670
uh,

148
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,160
on the,

149
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,280
on the part of corporations
is to ever more design,

150
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,391
uh,

151
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,560
technologies or,

152
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,670
or drugs or,

153
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:13,760
or biocides that,

154
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,460
that pose less and less risk,

155
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,980
but are still effective
in getting the job done,

156
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,270
minimize environmental
release and exposure.

157
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:22,661
Uh,

158
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:22,981
the,

159
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:23,250
the,

160
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,520
the increased potency moving from the,

161
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:25,961
the,

162
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:26,370
uh,

163
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:26,740
uh,

164
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,180
first atom bombs to the
hydrogen bombs in the mid 1950s,

165
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:31,780
uh,

166
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,190
was the opposite direction.

167
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,240
Uh,

168
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,751
so that,

169
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:34,900
uh,

170
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,600
more and more materials were
being released to the atmosphere,

171
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,141
uh,

172
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,450
as testing expanded.

173
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,810
Uh,

174
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,050
another notion that grew
in this history was the,

175
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:44,710
the idea of susceptibility,

176
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,880
special vulnerability that different
people would be exposed to these chemicals

177
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:53,410
in different ways because of their
behavior or because of their specific

178
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,250
physiology.

179
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,060
Uh,

180
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,571
so that,

181
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:55,781
you know,

182
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,720
chemicals move differently
in children or in,

183
00:04:58,721 --> 00:04:59,000
uh,

184
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,290
uh,

185
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,400
fetuses and they do and,

186
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,191
and you or,

187
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:01,960
or in me,

188
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,651
so that,

189
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,030
uh,

190
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,370
uh,

191
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,090
basic,

192
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,540
uh,

193
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,820
patterns of growth and development,

194
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,000
uh,

195
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,050
determine this and also
compensating those that are harmed.

196
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,890
Uh,

197
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,210
so that with vaccines,

198
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,670
h one n one vaccine is
a good example of that.

199
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,250
Uh,

200
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,970
vaccines always affect
some people adversely.

201
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,621
Uh,

202
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,910
and if people are seriously damaged,

203
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:23,830
if their health loss is substantial,

204
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,370
uh,

205
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,700
we have laws that are in
place to offer compensation.

206
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,540
Uh,

207
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,160
if the adverse effect can be
tied tightly to the exposure.

208
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,180
So that,

209
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,271
uh,

210
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:34,511
we'll,

211
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,570
we'll look in a few moments here or
closer to the end of the lecture at

212
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,310
different compensation strategies,

213
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,000
recognizing that there would be people
that would be intensely exposed,

214
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,180
particularly those that were involved in,

215
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,551
in,

216
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:45,870
uh,

217
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,300
uh,

218
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,300
producing the technology or in other
occupations that led them to experience

219
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,194
greater risk.

220
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,920
So the atomic energy act of 1946
really created this authority.

221
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,690
It's a remarkable piece of legislation.

222
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,910
And uh,

223
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,140
there,

224
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,370
there are very few other pieces
of law that I can point to,

225
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:04,820
uh,

226
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,121
that,

227
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:05,330
uh,

228
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,810
would,

229
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,110
would give such power to an organization.

230
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,800
So it created a five member
atomic energy commission,

231
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,431
uh,

232
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:13,780
that,

233
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,030
uh,

234
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,700
was assigned the responsibility
to manage the technology.

235
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,360
And this gradually evolved
into the Department of Energy,

236
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,350
which we have today.

237
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,610
So I'm going to try to show you
a couple of film clips here.

238
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,340
Hopefully this will,

239
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,543
uh,

240
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,740
pick up on the effects
of radiation and fallout.

241
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,470
So let the capsule can be retrieved.

242
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,800
But after exposure and the radiation,

243
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,810
the Ledger Dev organization may do its
damage or there to your work or cool one

244
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,930
that may physically I'm directly destroy
tissue or eventually they call it all

245
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,980
the top guy to cut those
which concern us principally.

246
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:26,580
They have life period ranging from
several years who follows the beers.

247
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,610
No harm unless they are taking into our
body with food or drinking water or in

248
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:33,510
the air we breathe.

249
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,460
Let us consider the results of a
powerful thermonuclear explosion and the

250
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,980
Pacific proving grounds in the Marshall
Islands 11 degrees north of the equator.

251
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,080
That huge cloud source up punches through
the Tropo pause and find any spreads

252
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,110
and stabilizes as high as 70 or 80,000
feet entirely within the stratosphere.

253
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,513
Late.

254
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,190
Yeah.

255
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,230
This brings us to the most.

256
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,980
Why didn't they discuss
sufficient product?

257
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,581
Strong Cim,

258
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,010
90 chemically similar to the soil,

259
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:02,960
calcium with which it becomes mixed.

260
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,920
The start you have 90 follows calcium
through its regular cycled into our

261
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,750
platform and into the bowl.

262
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,470
Meat and milk of our plant,

263
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,333
getting hammered,

264
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,040
reading our own bodies.

265
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,470
This function I like.

266
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:17,360
Calcium tends to be
concentrated in our phone,

267
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,150
particularly those of children
who are building new bone.

268
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,050
You're ready.

269
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,301
Hey,

270
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,340
from the structure of the night,

271
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:26,420
he has extremely short range in the body
so it causes no genetic breadth to the

272
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,770
reproductive cells,

273
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,160
the bone marrow,

274
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,420
and in the form of either leukemia or bone

275
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,580
Fisher that it would be a
tragic thing for those injured.

276
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,970
No matter how small or number,

277
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,530
whether it be physically,

278
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,800
very few categories can be justified.

279
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,030
Your personal value outside
of the scope of this report,

280
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,060
each citizen must make heads or her own.

281
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,290
You will maintain that
there is no actual prep.

282
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,590
It's a free world at all.

283
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,431
Certainly not.

284
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:04,470
That could justify either testing,

285
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,663
nuclear armament,

286
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,480
the officer's viewpoint.

287
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,800
Hold that Paul,

288
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,230
that's been absolutely necessary for
protection against common responsibility

289
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,770
and a threat and this
view all off category.

290
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,883
When we see it

291
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,280
and the service you can mind

292
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,970
in a war,

293
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,803
which is not,

294
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,000
I know John of your Paul,

295
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,560
you're kind of promoter stars.

296
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,570
What's remarkable about his comments
was he demonstrated by the late 1950s at

297
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:43,571
the AEC had really strong knowledge of
not just what the effects of the bombs

298
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:44,001
might be,

299
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,820
but also what the health
implications might be.

300
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,830
So they'd worked out the science,

301
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,290
they worked out the science actually in,

302
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,110
in a more sophisticated way than we
have for the majority of chemicals that

303
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:58,250
we've classified as toxic or
hazardous under the clean air act,

304
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,840
the safe drinking water act,

305
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,960
the toxic substance control act today.

306
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,540
So it's really pretty remarkable that,

307
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:04,910
uh,

308
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,730
this concentration of expertise
and authority and resources,

309
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,270
uh,

310
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,980
produced a quality of knowledge that a
is really pretty unusual in 20th century

311
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:13,820
environmental history.

312
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,140
Now,

313
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,840
the,

314
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,673
the,

315
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,210
uh,

316
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,220
experts wondered where
they should experiment,

317
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,710
should they experiment
in the United States?

318
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:24,050
Should they experiment in
other parts of the world?

319
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,800
And they decided that they
would concentrate most of their,

320
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,630
they're a hydrogen bomb explosions in
the Pacific in the Marshall Islands.

321
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,990
And one of the atolls in the
Pacific is Bikini Island,

322
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:36,620
uh,

323
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,390
which is a very small area.

324
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,300
And I'm going to spend a few
moments talking about this.

325
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,010
These atolls basically are,

326
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,120
are volcanic,

327
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,540
uh,

328
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,810
so that the rim of the volcano was
sitting on the surface of the ocean.

329
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,530
Uh,

330
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,820
and what you see here is
really a rim of coral and sand.

331
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,300
And several hundred Bikinians were asked
by the federal government back in 1945

332
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,200
if they would move from the island,

333
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,320
if they would give up their
homeland in order to provide a,

334
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,520
a location or a territory
for the explosions,

335
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,320
recognizing that the Marshall Islands are,

336
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,880
are a hundred,

337
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,671
excuse me,

338
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,780
thousands of square miles
of open ocean with a very,

339
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,010
very small population.

340
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,590
There.

341
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,280
There are very few places on
earth where you could find such a,

342
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:19,551
uh,

343
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:22,430
an area where the population
population density was so low.

344
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,181
Again,

345
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,080
they were worried about,

346
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,390
uh,

347
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,770
uh,

348
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,720
not really understanding
what would happen to the,

349
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:27,770
the materials,

350
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,250
uh,

351
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,810
and what the exposures might be.

352
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,310
So the idea was to move the islanders
away from the center of the low or the

353
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,070
explosions to save for islands.

354
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,220
So eventually the Bikinians
decided that they would,

355
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,153
uh,

356
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,380
move from the homeland,

357
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:42,980
uh,

358
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,600
to surrounding islands and the government
first place them on an island known as

359
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:48,434
Ron [inaudible],

360
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,401
Ron Zurich,

361
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:49,930
uh,

362
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,271
uh,

363
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:51,470
was not as fertile.

364
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:51,921
Uh,

365
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,530
you can't see this very carefully,

366
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:53,831
but,

367
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:53,951
uh,

368
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,350
if you go on Google Earth,

369
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,461
you'll see the,

370
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:57,821
the,

371
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,270
uh,

372
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,751
amount of,

373
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:58,960
uh,

374
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,710
the,

375
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,270
uh,

376
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,790
a land that is covered by
vegetation is extremely small,

377
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,360
so that they tried to grow crops here
and they found that the soils were very

378
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,194
infertile.

379
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,651
Basically,

380
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,530
they were just sand and beneath
the sand was volcanic material,

381
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,221
uh,

382
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:16,480
so very nutrient poor soils and
that really would not support them.

383
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,071
And,

384
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:17,200
uh,

385
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,490
they planted coconut trees,

386
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,780
but the coconut trees were,

387
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,890
were killed by,

388
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,060
by a fires.

389
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,520
They were then moved to quash Milan,

390
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,060
uh,

391
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,350
within about six months.

392
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,510
And Kwajalein is a,

393
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:28,570
another atole,

394
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,350
uh,

395
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,061
basically a,

396
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:30,661
a ring of,

397
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:31,660
of coral reefs.

398
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,170
Uh,

399
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,670
but it's also a military base.

400
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:34,990
And they were forced into a,

401
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,710
uh,

402
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,020
a,

403
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,750
a tent encampment for,

404
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,820
for a period of about
three or four months.

405
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,850
And they protested that they had
no place to grow their own food,

406
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,180
that they had no fishing boats and they
couldn't maintain the lifestyle that

407
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,140
they had had before.

408
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,323
Gradually,

409
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,240
they were moved,

410
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,560
uh,

411
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
within actually about 12 months,

412
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,730
they were moved to the island of Kiwi,

413
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,940
a Kiwi.

414
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,300
Uh,

415
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,410
I could not find any,

416
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:57,790
any photograph of Kiwi,

417
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,570
uh,

418
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:58,901
but,

419
00:12:58,901 --> 00:12:59,020
uh,

420
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,661
Keely was,

421
00:12:59,661 --> 00:12:59,950
uh,

422
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,510
an island that was not our,

423
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:03,130
is an island that w is not,

424
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,580
uh,

425
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,420
a on a toll a instead it,

426
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:07,870
uh,

427
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,950
it has no lagoon,

428
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:09,600
uh,

429
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,110
and it's open.

430
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,391
Uh,

431
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:11,710
it's,

432
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,960
it faces the open ocean on all sides,

433
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,441
uh,

434
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:16,360
which meant that they
had no lagoon deficient,

435
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,171
uh,

436
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,750
so that they had a very poor land,

437
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,470
again,

438
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,980
land that a w would not support
the development of crops.

439
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,930
And gradually over a period of,

440
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,710
uh,

441
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,550
several years,

442
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,170
the population began to starve.

443
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,800
The military eventually brought them a
fishing boats that were large enough so

444
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,240
that they could continue their,

445
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,010
their fishing activities.

446
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,641
Uh,

447
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:43,390
but they lived a miserable life
through the 1950s and early 1960s.

448
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,890
Uh,

449
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,720
what was going on on Bikini in their
absence was a series of experiments and a

450
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,950
one was quite curious.

451
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,440
It,

452
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,030
uh,

453
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,030
I was one of the first attempts to blow
up a weapons both above ground and below

454
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:58,774
the ocean,

455
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,950
and they decided to test the
resilience of the naval fleet,

456
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,570
uh,

457
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,540
two different,

458
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,500
uh,

459
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,670
to different intensities of,

460
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,400
of what other,

461
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,070
of different sizes of the weapons.

462
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,820
So they amassed this group of ships
that you can see in the upper right,

463
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,810
uh,

464
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,330
and within the center of it,

465
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,520
a,

466
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,810
they detonated a bomb,

467
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,141
uh,

468
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:22,141
wondering what would happen to the
navy if the Soviets dropped a bomb,

469
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:26,350
say at Pearl Harbor or a if they
found a fleet of US ships at sea.

470
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,393
Hello.

471
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,743
Yeah.

472
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,671
Remarkably,

473
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:54,840
the atomic energy commission,

474
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:59,841
also a hired film crews and
outfit them and led suits,

475
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,541
uh,

476
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,460
so that they would fly in the vicinity,

477
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,140
that those films were taken by,

478
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,741
by,

479
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:04,970
uh,

480
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,270
a cruise that we're sitting inside
aircraft that were flying around the,

481
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:09,361
uh,

482
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:10,290
the mushroom cloud.

483
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,110
But they also flew directly
into the mushroom cloud.

484
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,530
And before they had a,

485
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,170
offered them the possibility of,

486
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,531
of,

487
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:17,130
uh,

488
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:17,551
uh,

489
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:17,821
the,

490
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:20,190
the lead suits to offer
protection from the radiation.

491
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,810
Uh,

492
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,111
the,

493
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:22,231
uh,

494
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,530
the pilots and the crews came back and
they experienced such a high level of

495
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:26,490
radiation that the,

496
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:26,850
uh,

497
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,570
uh,

498
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,120
the expert's became quite worried
about their long term health.

499
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,320
I saw the gradually,

500
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:31,561
the,

501
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:31,651
uh,

502
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:34,770
the shielding grew as
they flew in and around.

503
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:35,730
So a single aircraft,

504
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:36,241
for example,

505
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:40,440
would be outfitted with up to 70 different
cameras so they could figure out what

506
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,300
the pattern of radiation emission was.

507
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:42,781
Uh,

508
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:43,170
and,

509
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:43,381
uh,

510
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:43,951
what the,

511
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:44,281
the,

512
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:44,700
uh,

513
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:44,911
uh,

514
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:47,820
effect would be as the
cloud would dissipate,

515
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,400
uh,

516
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,871
uh,

517
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:50,760
in the direction of the prevailing winds.

518
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,691
Now,

519
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,600
among the 23 different bombs
that were dropped on this island,

520
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,220
uh,

521
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,760
Bravo in 1954 was perhaps
one of the most remarkable,

522
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,880
the first hydrogen bomb that
had been developed in the world,

523
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:03,330
uh,

524
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:03,691
that had,

525
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:04,021
uh,

526
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:08,100
an explosive force a nearly a
thousand times that a force,

527
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:08,490
uh,

528
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,430
the bomb that was dropped
on Hiroshima so that the,

529
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:11,751
they,

530
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:14,250
they really did not understand
what the effect might be.

531
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:14,731
Uh,

532
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:15,151
what the,

533
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:15,361
the,

534
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:16,194
the distance,

535
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,431
uh,

536
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:18,600
of damage would be away from ground zero.

537
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,120
So this was called a the big one.

538
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,051
And by the way,

539
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:23,340
these clips are coming from a,

540
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:23,850
a,

541
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,121
a,

542
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:27,660
a film that I'll put on reserve if you'd
like to see the entire film called the

543
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:28,740
atomic bomb movie.

544
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,370
Call me,

545
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,020
get him his food.

546
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:43,021
At 1954 castle largest
device ever testing students,

547
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,180
Robin was the hydrogen ball using some
of the thermal nuclear fuel confirming

548
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:58,641
the designs of Edward Teller and Stan
paving the way to producing aircraft

549
00:17:59,281 --> 00:17:59,881
deliverable.

550
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:01,950
How did these bombs and more effective,

551
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,893
those

552
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,953
15

553
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,743
minutes

554
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,613
float

555
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,570
release launch one of these?

556
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,443
Yeah.

557
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,403
Yes sir.

558
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,961
So it's a prize.

559
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,880
The president is surprise the experts.

560
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,360
It created destruction over,

561
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,750
uh,

562
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,750
an area that was completely unexpected
when they finally interpreted the

563
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:08,520
radiation readings from ships and
different monitoring facilities that they

564
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:09,354
established.

565
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,150
They produced this map.

566
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,790
And this is a contour map in a way,

567
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,790
uh,

568
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,190
in a contour map that the,

569
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:16,430
uh,

570
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,240
different,

571
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,630
uh,

572
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,570
ellipses a would represent
different elevations.

573
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,231
Uh,

574
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:25,910
so think about this as
representing different
intensities of radiation that one

575
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,740
would experience had they been in,

576
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,280
in a proximity to the
site of the explosion.

577
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,200
First of all,

578
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,470
uh,

579
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,040
the explosion itself created a,

580
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,690
uh,

581
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,970
a crater in the atoll.

582
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,830
It was a mile and a half wide,

583
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,640
uh,

584
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,460
in one direction and a mile
wide in another direction.

585
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:44,571
Uh,

586
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:48,170
but this graph or chart
was more disturbing,

587
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,590
uh,

588
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,320
especially to those that
had security clearances.

589
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,150
And we're responsible for funding,

590
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:53,820
uh,

591
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,520
in the Senate in the house because it
demonstrated that the lethal zone is

592
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:01,040
represented by the area
that's crosshatched.

593
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,790
This area spans a distance of about 170
miles in length by about 70 miles in

594
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:09,614
width.

595
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,490
So if this were a perfect
circle and it landed on,

596
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:16,850
say,

597
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,530
a downtown in the mall in Washington DC,

598
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,230
it would would've wiped out all of
the buildings within a 12 mile radius.

599
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,920
Within a matter of several years.

600
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,790
The Russians,

601
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,600
uh,

602
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,310
developed a bomb that they first
found was too big in order to,

603
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,510
to lift off the ground.

604
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,090
And eventually they worried that a,

605
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,410
the aircraft that would,

606
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,220
would release it wouldn't be able to get
far enough away so that it wouldn't be

607
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:44,054
destroyed.

608
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,840
Uh,

609
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,990
and gradually they overcame
those technical difficulties.

610
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,440
And a Tsar Bomba was the largest bomb
ever exploded in northern Russia,

611
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,780
uh,

612
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,450
in the 20th century.

613
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,111
Uh,

614
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:00,140
and it had a destructive force that,

615
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:00,321
uh,

616
00:23:00,321 --> 00:23:01,160
was lethal,

617
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,701
uh,

618
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:04,250
over a distance of some 500 miles.

619
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,660
A 1500 square miles would
be completely devastated.

620
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,230
So the bikini explosion would have
taken an area from New Jersey,

621
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,170
uh,

622
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,990
to the other side of
Boston and leveled it.

623
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,010
Uh,

624
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,810
and an area that roughly would have gone
from just south of Albany down to long

625
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:24,644
island sound,

626
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,390
uh,

627
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,050
would have destroyed all structures.

628
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,050
It would have made the area uninhabitable.

629
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,571
Uh,

630
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:32,570
it would have radiated the soil
so that no crops could grow.

631
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,351
Uh,

632
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:33,741
any,

633
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:37,370
any other vegetation that Mike Rowe
would have absorbed the radionuclides.

634
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,361
So the,

635
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:38,511
uh,

636
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:40,850
the trees could not be
used for building material.

637
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:44,750
They couldn't be used for firewood
because it would simply release the

638
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,140
radioactivity back into
the atmosphere we're in,

639
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,080
into the environment.

640
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,720
This understanding of the
enormous destructive force
of a single weapon really

641
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:58,721
transformed the impression of the experts
about the implications of what they

642
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:00,644
were doing.

643
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,510
And they were extremely worried that
the public would understand the scale of

644
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,344
the damage that,

645
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,221
that,

646
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:07,340
uh,

647
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,690
the single weapon could face.

648
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,441
By the way,

649
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:10,880
how many nuclear weapons?

650
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,600
Uh,

651
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,100
we're in existence by the
late 1980s and early 1990s,

652
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,810
roughly 70,000,

653
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:18,650
70,000.

654
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:23,210
That ranged from bombs with this scale
to those that would be deliverable,

655
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,430
uh,

656
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,390
via a suitcase or a
from an artillery shell.

657
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,910
So an enormous diversity of weapons,

658
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,960
an enormous,

659
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,230
uh,

660
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,810
destructive capacity
that was being a math,

661
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:36,050
it was simply being built up in
the stockpiles around the world.

662
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,350
So what was,

663
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,070
uh,

664
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,960
the result of this understanding?

665
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,143
Uh,

666
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,990
more classification of information,

667
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,430
more secrecy,

668
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,030
uh,

669
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,280
more worry about how to tell a story,

670
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:49,790
uh,

671
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,620
to develop a narrative advantage,

672
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,250
uh,

673
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,581
to,

674
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:56,210
to be able to persuade the public
that continued testing was important.

675
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,021
And,

676
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:57,261
uh,

677
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:57,621
that,

678
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,454
uh,

679
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,000
uh,

680
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,840
in order to,

681
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,501
to,

682
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:00,960
uh,

683
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,400
uh,

684
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,890
prevent the Soviets from believing that,

685
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,251
that,

686
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:04,461
uh,

687
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,050
they could survive a first strike,

688
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,651
uh,

689
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:06,951
that,

690
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:07,070
uh,

691
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,670
we would build more weapons and,

692
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:09,710
and bigger weapons.

693
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,410
Now what about the island itself?

694
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,730
What about the environmental
implications of 23 different tests on a,

695
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,080
on a,

696
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,913
on,

697
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,500
uh,

698
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,210
south Pacific or a Pacific,

699
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,650
a toll such as this?

700
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,491
Well,

701
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:24,410
you saw what happened
to the coconut trees.

702
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,670
All of the,

703
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,400
all of the frauds were blown off at all.

704
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,530
The coconuts were blown
off at all the bark,

705
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,510
the exterior bark,

706
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,540
uh,

707
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,680
was burned off of it.

708
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,161
Well,

709
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:35,270
the government decided that,

710
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:35,511
well,

711
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,021
we'll just,

712
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:36,170
uh,

713
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,310
we'll just go back and we'll,

714
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,750
we'll cut all those trees,

715
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,500
uh,

716
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,041
and we'll,

717
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:40,910
we'll plant new ones.

718
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:43,910
So they planted 50,000 new
coconut trees on the island.

719
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,690
Uh,

720
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,530
they then said,

721
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:45,771
well,

722
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:46,011
you know,

723
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,450
we know that the soils are,

724
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,210
are,

725
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,530
uh,

726
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,180
still highly radioactive.

727
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,751
Uh,

728
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:50,961
we'll,

729
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:54,470
we'll go in and we'll scrape all those
soils off and we'll bring in soil from

730
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,620
other islands so that they will
have the potential once again to,

731
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:58,730
to grow new crops.

732
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,440
So they're thinking about,

733
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,430
well,

734
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,831
uh,

735
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:02,540
in the,

736
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,230
uh,

737
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,010
in the film clip you saw a few minutes
ago now you saw the atomic energy

738
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,540
commission officials saying that they
understood what the key roots of exposure

739
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:14,270
might be and those were by air,

740
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,050
uh,

741
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:15,920
via food,

742
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,730
uh,

743
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,580
and via drinking water
or by dermal uptake,

744
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,820
uh,

745
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,653
through the skin.

746
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,111
Now,

747
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,970
those are the four routes of exposure,

748
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,420
uh,

749
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,930
that we would think about today
if we were wondering about the,

750
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,411
the,

751
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:27,620
uh,

752
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,690
risk or the hazards of any technology.

753
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,340
What's the root of exposure?

754
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,271
Is it by air?

755
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,200
Is it by food?

756
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,034
Is it by,

757
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,520
uh,

758
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,353
inhalation?

759
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,860
Is it by dermal uptake?

760
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,160
A,

761
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,420
these are all ways that a,

762
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:39,950
that chemicals can get in your body.

763
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,950
So understanding their
persistence in vegetation,

764
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,440
there a pattern of accumulation
and different kinds of foods.

765
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,340
Uh,

766
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,950
did the compounds make their
way into drinking water?

767
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,551
Uh,

768
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,301
and what would it be?

769
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,830
There will be their persistence.

770
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,720
What would be their ecological pathways?

771
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,160
How would they move
through the environment?

772
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,940
Uh,

773
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,420
and what,

774
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,860
what would the long term threat?

775
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,190
Uh,

776
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,023
B.

777
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,330
So here's a unexampled,

778
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,570
uh,

779
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,880
after planning 50,000 coconut trees,

780
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,580
they found no hint that there would
be a problem with the coconuts,

781
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,570
the vegetables,

782
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,590
and the water.

783
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,230
This was his late as early 1978.

784
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,870
So they faced this problem.

785
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,150
How do we persuade the public that
this dangerous technology was worth

786
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:27,984
developing?

787
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,411
Uh,

788
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:28,801
that it,

789
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:28,981
uh,

790
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,010
it made sense to continue the
funding and continue the testing,

791
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,210
uh,

792
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,200
based on the argument that we have to
understand how we might be able to survive

793
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,130
a nuclear attack.

794
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,701
Uh,

795
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:41,580
but also that the Russians
need to understand,

796
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,061
uh,

797
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:42,361
that,

798
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:42,511
uh,

799
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,690
they could not possibly
initiate a nuclear attack,

800
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,080
uh,

801
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,370
without committing suicide.

802
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,300
So they developed a variety of
different public service announcements.

803
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,720
I'm going to show you one of those
now that's entitled Common Sense.

804
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,670
This is a u s air force film.

805
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,600
Uh,

806
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,460
and this is Marilyn Monroe who was,

807
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,080
you probably know a film star at that,

808
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,160
during that period of time.

809
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,460
So message there was the
technology is manageable.

810
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,200
Use common sense,

811
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,760
uh,

812
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,810
avoid exposure.

813
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,160
And what would this mean?

814
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,780
What would this mean to,

815
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:29,060
uh,

816
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,820
to,

817
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,550
uh,

818
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,070
hundreds of millions of people
in the United States at the time,

819
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,410
or to the government's responsibility
to educate them so that they would know

820
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:39,244
what to do?

821
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,300
Well,

822
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,310
you tsar and,

823
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:42,641
uh,

824
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:43,840
the Bravo test,

825
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,500
uh,

826
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,620
basically told them that the
cities were enormously vulnerable.

827
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,650
So what happened during
the Eisenhower era?

828
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,041
One of the,

829
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:51,450
the,

830
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,120
uh,

831
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,710
first thing that was done,

832
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,130
uh,

833
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,130
following this was the investment of tens
of billions of dollars in the national

834
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:01,330
highway program.

835
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,040
So the argument was,

836
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:03,161
well,

837
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,380
we really need to be able to
move troops around the city,

838
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:09,700
but they were really concerned about
developing the capacity to evacuate.

839
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,230
Uh,

840
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,890
is there,

841
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,630
is there the possibility that we could,

842
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,020
uh,

843
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,790
protect against dangerous exposures,

844
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,400
which are most of concern,

845
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,031
uh,

846
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:19,361
their,

847
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:19,751
their,

848
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,020
uh,

849
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,853
highest,

850
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,490
uh,

851
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,360
in closest proximity in
space and time to the,

852
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:25,481
uh,

853
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:26,530
the side of the blast.

854
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,210
So if we could warn people,

855
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:28,750
uh,

856
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,800
via sirens,

857
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,540
by a radio announcements,

858
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,320
if we could tell people what they need
to do in the event that we detected an

859
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:36,010
attack,

860
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,843
that would help them.

861
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,570
Uh,

862
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,650
so not only did they,

863
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:38,801
uh,

864
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:43,801
they build a hundreds of thousands of
miles of highways in the United States and

865
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:46,000
the hope that evacuations might work,

866
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,451
uh,

867
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:49,570
but they also developed evacuation drills.

868
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,090
And I don't have a shot of duck and cover,

869
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,650
but to ask your parents
about duck and cover a,

870
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,400
they'd probably remember being told that,

871
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:57,910
uh,

872
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,420
uh,

873
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,000
an emergency drill was going
to be held in the school.

874
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,870
All the children are now required to get
down on their hands and knees and duck

875
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,060
underneath their desks
and cover their head.

876
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,081
And in fact,

877
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:09,590
there's a cute little song that I,

878
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:09,850
uh,

879
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,790
almost developed the courage to sing
to you called the duck and cover,

880
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,190
but I'm going to resist doing that.

881
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,520
The idea that a ducking and covering
beneath your school dusk would offer you,

882
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,040
uh,

883
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,890
uh,

884
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,910
sufficient protection against exposure,

885
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,320
uh,

886
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,700
and the damage of a
collapsing buildings is,

887
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,120
uh,

888
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,451
quite,

889
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,290
quite ridiculous.

890
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,300
But it was part of their approach.

891
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,890
It was part of their
persuasive strategy to,

892
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,910
to convince the public that
they could take precautions,

893
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,920
they could get themselves into the subway,

894
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,180
or they could build the,

895
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:40,241
uh,

896
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:43,870
the fallout shelters and store it with
food and water and offer themselves

897
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:47,740
protection until the bulk of the
radiation had had blown away.

898
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,641
Well,

899
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:48,821
you know,

900
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,520
we've had quite a bit of experience
with evacuation drills and,

901
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,220
uh,

902
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,230
a couple,

903
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,011
uh,

904
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:54,461
that you,

905
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:54,971
you may,

906
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:55,804
uh,

907
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,500
uh,

908
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,500
recall would include a hurricane Katrina
Hurricane Katrina found people sitting

909
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:04,090
on the highway stalled trying to leave,

910
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,420
leave,

911
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,220
uh,

912
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,053
uh,

913
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,420
southern Louisiana and
a parts of Texas and,

914
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,690
and also other parts of the Gulf coast,

915
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,250
uh,

916
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:14,831
so that,

917
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:14,921
uh,

918
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:16,510
moving people out of a city,

919
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,910
even despite having an
interstate highway system,

920
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:19,540
was much,

921
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,480
much more difficult than
anyone could possibly imagine.

922
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,261
And,

923
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:23,441
uh,

924
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,520
these are a bit out of order,

925
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:26,230
but I wanted to come
back and show you this.

926
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,981
A notice.

927
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,540
Back in 2005,

928
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,670
the Connecticut State police
ordered an evacuation of the state.

929
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,020
Uh,

930
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,700
there was no stated purpose,

931
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,120
uh,

932
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,560
but this aired on the radio
and it was out on the Internet.

933
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,550
Uh,

934
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,090
an evacuation of the
cities was called for a,

935
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,060
and it was an error.

936
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,280
It was an electronic signal
that had been tripped.

937
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:46,941
Uh,

938
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:51,650
and what was the public's response to
the evacuation request and the warning?

939
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,053
Nothing.

940
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,040
They didn't even receive one phone call,

941
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,550
a so that the public is quite
actually resistant to a rings of,

942
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:01,534
of the alarm.

943
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,970
So although the Bikinians were promised
that only one or two tests would be

944
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:10,730
conducted on their island back in 1945,

945
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,630
uh,

946
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,630
more nuclear energy was released on
this one site than at any other site in,

947
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:17,534
in history.

948
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,231
Uh,

949
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:20,660
so that the cumulative
force of bombs had exploded.

950
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:25,580
There was nearly four times the energy
released over almost a thousand tests

951
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:27,260
conducted at the Nevada test site.

952
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,131
Uh,

953
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:28,970
so this was,

954
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,260
uh,

955
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,800
uh,

956
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,770
labeled the most contaminated
site in the world.

957
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,090
And at the same time,

958
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,540
President Johnson was feeling great
pressure to clean up the island and uh,

959
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,061
to,

960
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:41,460
uh,

961
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:41,750
uh,

962
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,870
basically remove the
radioactive sands and soils,

963
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,530
uh,

964
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:45,951
to,

965
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:46,101
uh,

966
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,490
restore the vegetation to,

967
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,040
uh,

968
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,430
try to figure out whether or
not a fisheries might be viable,

969
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:52,810
uh,

970
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,550
so that the population
could return to the island.

971
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,510
So one decade after the bombing ceased,

972
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,440
uh,

973
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,120
President Johnson gave the okay for the
Bikinians to return to their homeland.

974
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,500
Now,

975
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,720
during the next decade,

976
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,590
uh,

977
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,180
scientists continued to work,

978
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,510
particularly at the Brookhaven
national laboratory on Long Island,

979
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,360
uh,

980
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,750
and reported back to the House and Senate.

981
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,820
And here's an example that
the house appropriations
committee heard reports from

982
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:27,821
these scientists in 1973 that the CCM
[inaudible] concentrations were 10 times

983
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:31,100
higher than the 1970 levels.

984
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,740
CCM is measured in their urine.

985
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,783
It's an easy,

986
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,711
an easy radio,

987
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:36,830
new quad to detect.

988
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,950
And it was attributed to the foods
that were grown on the island.

989
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,430
So during the period when
they were restoring the soils
and they were trying to,

990
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,080
to figure out which crops they could grow,

991
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,940
there were often importing food,

992
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,280
but as they grew more and
more food on the island,

993
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,430
they found that the,

994
00:34:50,431 --> 00:34:52,940
the plants that they had had chosen,

995
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,050
we're drawing the radionuclides from the
soils and from the underground waters.

996
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,310
So they decided,

997
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,670
oh,

998
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:58,851
well,

999
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:00,260
perhaps our surveillance,

1000
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:00,441
uh,

1001
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:01,790
was not sufficient enough.

1002
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,040
Our sampling strategy didn't pick up the
fact that the underlying aquifers were

1003
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,630
contaminated or that the soil
concentrations were higher than were,

1004
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:10,940
were originally estimated.

1005
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,321
And they found that,

1006
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:12,570
uh,

1007
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,120
they had scraped the top soil off,

1008
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:15,590
but they've not gone deeply enough.

1009
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:19,190
And that some of the plants were
drawing water up from a distance that,

1010
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,001
that,

1011
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:20,460
uh,

1012
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:20,660
uh,

1013
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,291
included,

1014
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:21,740
uh,

1015
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,260
uh,

1016
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,760
uh,

1017
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,491
sands and,

1018
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:23,841
and,

1019
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:24,021
uh,

1020
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,710
organic matter that had absorbed
significant concentrations.

1021
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,690
So that by 1978,

1022
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:29,960
uh,

1023
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,660
the body burdens succeeded
the maximum permissible level,

1024
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,220
uh,

1025
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,210
according to,

1026
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,961
uh,

1027
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:36,680
the,

1028
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,670
the National Institute of Health,

1029
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,300
they took the islanders off the island
again and they were returned to the

1030
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,230
island of Keely,

1031
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:43,911
the one that,

1032
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:44,130
uh,

1033
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:44,963
has no,

1034
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,360
uh,

1035
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,690
coral reefs surrounding that,

1036
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,770
that there was open to open to pounding,

1037
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,431
pounding,

1038
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,264
surf.

1039
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,030
So they were allowed to stay there for,

1040
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,640
for a,

1041
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:56,820
a year.

1042
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,150
There were conflicting interpretations
of the evidence that was available.

1043
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:00,910
And you find,

1044
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,860
we'll find this again and again through
the 20th century with respect to air

1045
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:05,694
quality,

1046
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,050
uh,

1047
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,530
arguments over how much,

1048
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,190
uh,

1049
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,380
inhalation of an air pollutant is okay.

1050
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,900
Or how much of a drinking
water contaminant is okay,

1051
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:15,450
or how much of a pesticide
residue in food is okay.

1052
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,200
Uh,

1053
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,150
you find that often the government or the,

1054
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:20,580
uh,

1055
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,250
the purveyor of the dangerous
technology will make an argument.

1056
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:23,761
Well,

1057
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:24,361
you know what,

1058
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:24,540
uh,

1059
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,841
let's,

1060
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:25,980
let's average the risk.

1061
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:26,820
Uh,

1062
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,290
so the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
reduced its radiation dose estimate of the

1063
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:36,291
inhabitants by averaging the
exposure to the population.

1064
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,371
Uh,

1065
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:43,371
so Rosalee Bartelle from the nuclear
regulatory commission protested to this

1066
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,671
arguing.

1067
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:47,700
This is like telling one
smoking member of family,

1068
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:51,630
his or her risk of lung cancer is lowered
if the other nonsmoking members of the

1069
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:52,560
family are included.

1070
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,030
And an average risk is given,

1071
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,210
it's scientifically ridiculous
as an approach to public health.

1072
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,880
So this idea of,

1073
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:02,340
of averaging risk across people when
you have some people that would be more

1074
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:03,210
exposed than others,

1075
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:03,720
uh,

1076
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,780
some people would have a diet that
might be high and coconut milk.

1077
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,530
Uh,

1078
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,010
and during periods of drought throughout
the Marshall Islands in the Pacific,

1079
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,540
it's pretty well known that a,

1080
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,840
the islanders stayed hydrated by
drinking more and more coconut milk.

1081
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,010
Coconut milk happens to be
loaded with saturated fats.

1082
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,880
And so how the saturated fats were very
effective and binding on to some of the

1083
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:24,780
radionuclides.

1084
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,830
And that explained why the drought was
correlated with an increase in the body

1085
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,630
concentration of some of the compounds.

1086
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,910
So the idea of averaging that across the
entire population across space and time

1087
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,290
made no sense.

1088
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,030
By 1999,

1089
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,790
the government accounting office
is what it used to be called,

1090
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,211
by the way,

1091
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:46,350
that's now the government accountability
office if you ever are searching for

1092
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:46,440
it.

1093
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,390
And it's a great site to look at for
critical evaluations of government to

1094
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,400
activities and particularly with respect
to environmental and health problems

1095
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,220
associated with dangerous technologies.

1096
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,050
That's government accountability office.

1097
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:01,860
Uh,

1098
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,430
they argued for restricted access and uh,

1099
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,001
that,

1100
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:06,241
uh,

1101
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,670
if the return or the former residents,

1102
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,511
uh,

1103
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,130
occurred that it would expose them to,

1104
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,550
to,

1105
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:11,860
uh,

1106
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,150
uh,

1107
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,960
dangerous levels of radiation despite
the fact that they'd spent $100 million

1108
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,190
trying to restore the site.

1109
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,531
By 1980,

1110
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,230
the Department of Energy,

1111
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:21,900
uh,

1112
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,290
concluded that the Bikinians
could return to a new island,

1113
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,840
which is one location
and the Bikini Atoll,

1114
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,200
uh,

1115
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,440
that received the,

1116
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:30,960
the least amount of radiation,

1117
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,230
but only if only if they ate no more than
50% of locally grown food and spent no

1118
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:40,720
more than 10% of their
time on Bikini Island.

1119
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,040
So this idea that they could adjust
their behavior in a way that would reduce

1120
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,110
their exposure is a very interesting one.

1121
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,440
One of the islanders.

1122
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:50,890
Uh,

1123
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,650
Pero Joel in 1989 reflected on the second,

1124
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,160
uh,

1125
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,300
exodus from the island,

1126
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,140
uh,

1127
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,290
saying finally the Americans and the
scientists came back a few years later

1128
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,550
saying that we had to leave again.

1129
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,110
They said we'd ingested too much poison
and that it wasn't safe to live on

1130
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,040
bikini anymore.

1131
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,920
And we didn't care at this point
because we'd already started to get that

1132
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:10,600
hopeless feeling again though,

1133
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,970
because we all wanted to stay on Bikini.

1134
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,390
We did explore all possibilities and
an attempt to find a way out of this

1135
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,224
problem.

1136
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,041
We kept thinking,

1137
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,530
the Americans first told us
it was safe to live here.

1138
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,220
Then they changed their minds
and some rules for us to follow.

1139
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,760
Now they're telling us to
leave and should we go.

1140
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,560
So they were constantly,

1141
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,070
uh,

1142
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,770
being manipulated by a estimates of,

1143
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,190
of,

1144
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,401
uh,

1145
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:35,290
what was risky and what was safe.

1146
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,161
Uh,

1147
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:37,120
and gradually,

1148
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:37,401
uh,

1149
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:40,930
this became the site of extended
epidemiological studies of,

1150
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:41,441
of the,

1151
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:42,274
the health,

1152
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,640
uh,

1153
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,190
very carefully correlated
with measurements of,

1154
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,791
of,

1155
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:46,050
uh,

1156
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,080
new Clyde's in their body.

1157
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,480
The quality of this science
is really extraordinary.

1158
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,010
Uh,

1159
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,471
again,

1160
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,050
it's exemplary in in the 20th century.

1161
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,150
And they found that thyroid disease on
the islands that experienced the greatest

1162
00:39:58,151 --> 00:39:58,890
fallout,

1163
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:59,350
uh,

1164
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,580
was excessive.

1165
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,370
More than a third of all the
residents have thyroid disease.

1166
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:03,541
On,

1167
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:04,400
on Roger Lab,

1168
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,980
Ron's lab was an island,

1169
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,490
uh,

1170
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,900
that following the Bravo test
that a thermonuclear explosion,

1171
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:11,800
the hydrogen bomb.

1172
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:12,490
Uh,

1173
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,420
they hadn't expected that the
ash would reach Ron Jalop.

1174
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:15,940
Uh,

1175
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,370
but the ash fell out of
the sky like it was snow.

1176
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,340
And the children were described
as running along the beach,

1177
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,070
picking up the snow and
throwing it over their heads,

1178
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,491
uh,

1179
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:26,500
eating it and rubbing it into their skin.

1180
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,480
And it didn't take long before they,

1181
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:28,940
uh,

1182
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,230
uh,

1183
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,290
realized that something was terribly awry.

1184
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:32,421
And,

1185
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:32,831
and,

1186
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:33,310
uh,

1187
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:33,470
uh,

1188
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,810
their skin started to burn,

1189
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,390
uh,

1190
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:35,970
the,

1191
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,760
they became a nausea and vomited
because of their radiation poisoning,

1192
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,290
then they lost their hair.

1193
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,341
So that,

1194
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:42,521
uh,

1195
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:42,770
the,

1196
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:47,770
the combination of exposure to
strontium that lodges in the bone to,

1197
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,030
to,

1198
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,391
uh,

1199
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:49,880
the,

1200
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,060
uh,

1201
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:55,060
iodine one 31 that lodges in the fibroid
eventually led to this fibroid disease.

1202
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,370
So what are the remedies?

1203
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,920
What are the remedies for
populations such as this?

1204
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,641
Uh,

1205
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:01,090
well,

1206
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,200
and we'll come back to this,

1207
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,753
uh,

1208
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,530
when we get back together on Thursday,

1209
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,150
but litigation is one,

1210
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,780
uh,

1211
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,610
litigation is a really,

1212
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,360
uh,

1213
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,060
difficult,

1214
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,190
uh,

1215
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,810
approach because of the amount
of time it normally takes.

1216
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,090
A but also the amount of
funding that it would take,

1217
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:16,620
uh,

1218
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,560
in litigation,

1219
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:17,920
uh,

1220
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,753
that would be,

1221
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,500
uh,

1222
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,020
brought against the United States
government would be fought intensively.

1223
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,071
So that a,

1224
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,710
it's not uncommon for
litigation to span of pattern,

1225
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,821
a period of time,

1226
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:28,780
including a decade,

1227
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,910
a financial compensation,

1228
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,480
financial compensation to a,

1229
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,290
those that can demonstrate that
they end their property taken away,

1230
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,240
that they had their livelihoods
taken away or that they lost their,

1231
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:42,350
their health financial support.

1232
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,980
So the building of schools or
hospitals or roadways or ah,

1233
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
job training or that's another
possible form of support or community

1234
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:52,034
development,

1235
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,870
medical monitoring and medical treatment,

1236
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,080
and also the landscape land
restoration costs such as,

1237
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:57,620
uh,

1238
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,120
uh,

1239
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,290
uh,

1240
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,300
those that occurred,

1241
00:41:59,480 --> 00:41:59,721
uh,

1242
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:01,130
when they removed the soils,

1243
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,760
uh,

1244
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,930
when they brought in the trees that
cost the government $100 million.

1245
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,330
So,

1246
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:07,860
uh,

1247
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,740
I'll close with this slide that,

1248
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:10,300
uh,

1249
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,540
uh,

1250
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:15,440
a $20 million resettlement trust fund for
the people of Bikini was authorized by

1251
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:16,274
Congress,

1252
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:16,821
uh,

1253
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:20,210
and it was later supplemented
with an additional $90 million.

1254
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,330
And these were used for the
construction and resettlement,

1255
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,010
uh,

1256
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:29,010
of the Bikinians to live on Kili
island and another atole a nearby,

1257
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,811
uh,

1258
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:30,171
and,

1259
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:30,700
uh,

1260
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,301
uh,

1261
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:36,301
a fiscal year budget now ranges between
about 7 million and $10 million.

1262
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,150
It's going into this community,

1263
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:38,781
uh,

1264
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:41,480
that originally was only
several hundred people in size.

1265
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,600
So we'll come back to
this a again on Thursday.

1266
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:45,711
And then,

1267
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:46,131
once again,

1268
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,540
my apologies for being late today.
