Speaker 1:          00:02          Today, I want to talk about the relationship between risk and law. And I want to do this in the context of the history of agriculture and regulating pesticides during the 20th century. And also I want to have you considered the idea of, of risk. And I'm a reminded, uh, as I think about this of Tsla, it's line only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. So many believe that environmentalists are in the business of trying to absolutely minimize risk as opposed to balance, uh, the threat of loss or danger or against other opportunities. And others argue that without risk in life things will be pretty boring.

Speaker 1:          00:53          It's traveling through Europe. Last summer on a lecture tour and I saw this village sitting on the top of a cliff and I wondered to myself about the village and I wondered how they chose to build so close to the edge and what kind of thinking was in their minds. And I could imagine that this used to be an a number of fields where they graze cattle and sheep and they probably worried about losing cattle. And sheep across the cliff. Then as it grew into a little village, I can imagine them worried about their children playing near the edge. So much of environmental law is about thinking about the buffer zone or the safety factor that you would want to use to offer sufficient, sufficient protection against significant damage.

Speaker 1:          01:45          So the idea of risk and understanding risk is really a fundamental aspect of human logic and instinct. Within law, it tends to become defined as probability of loss. Probability of damage, uh, might be an endangered species. It might be, uh, air quality. It could be human health, and it's often expressed in both quantitative and qualitative terms. So particularly over the past 30 years, the field of quantitative risk assessment has grown in importance, uh, to try to understand what happens to chemicals or to species, uh, what kinds of pathways they travel, uh, what, what kinds of problems might occur from a chemical release and chemical movement. And increasingly, uh, it's more sophisticated mathematically and more difficult to understand the different sources of uncertainty that are embedded in these estimates of risk. You may have heard of, of the idea of a unacceptable risk level for cancer or some or some other undesirable outcome as being one in a million or the government used that standard on many occasions, a one in a million excess risk.

Speaker 1:          03:03          Well, to put that into perspective, you might think about the h one n one infection. So what was the actual morbidity rate, uh, over the past year? Uh, for h one n one? Well, it turns out that you would first think about the number of people in the United States know, say roughly 300 million people and you'd want to know what the incidence rate was and the illness and those. Now I was looking at them last night on the Centers for Disease Control and prevention website. Their estimate is that between 30 and 45 or 50 million people, uh, uh, carried the virus and had some adverse effect from it. And then I was looking at the statistics for mortality and between 15 and 20,000 people, uh, might be, uh, how are or were killed by the illness. Why the uncertainty associated with the estimate? Well, uh, it's a, it's an illness that, uh, uh, can harvest, so to speak in epidemiological terms, uh, the more susceptible those that have serious background illnesses.

Speaker 1:          04:13          So the expression of risk for morbidity, which means illness would be roughly let's say a 30 million out of a 300 million, uh, which is really quite striking. You know, there are few illnesses that uh, uh, have that have that rate. So, you know, roughly a one in 10 risk. And I mentioned when I started this, a brief aside, uh, that a one in a million risk is often thought of as acceptable. The distinction between environmental risks, uh, that are not biologically based or or generated by pathogens like h one n one and chemical risks is often that a, there was a clear causal relationship between exposure and an understanding of the source of the illness and also what might be done to manage it more effectively, such as the vaccine. By the way, the vaccine that was produced and distributed this year, it was really pretty remarkable, was extremely effective.

Speaker 1:          05:12          And the, the incidents rate was projected to be far higher than it actually turned out. So this concern over quantitative risk assessment, trying to understand who's most vulnerable, who is going to, uh, uh, basically sustain the, the, the most serious effects this preoccupies, uh, the environmental protection agency, the food and Drug Administration, when they're thinking about allowing a new drug to be added to the marketplace. Uh, and really the decision is all about balancing, uh, trying to think through what the quality of the evidence evidence is and should the danger's be balanced against the benefits. And this standard for balancing has shifted dramatically over the 20th century. So that, uh, the lecture of the day really, we'll trace the evolution of law, uh, and demonstrate how it's shifted from 1906 to the present. And I want you to think about how it really reflects changing science, uh, as well as changing human values so that as the science gets a stronger, we understand the relationship between an exposure and an adverse outcome.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Uh, and oftentimes the government will intervene by setting a new law or a new regulation. So the back in 1906, uh, the food drug and or the, uh, um, uh, jump ahead here, but pure food and drug act of 1906 was passed after Upton Sinclair published the jungle. The describe the filthy slaughtering conditions in, in Chicago. The two or food and drug act was passed in 1906 as well. And at four bayed foreign in Interstate Commerce, adulterated or fraudulently labeled, uh, food and drugs. So products could now be sees and condemned and offending persons could be fine or jail, uh, and fresh, canned or frozen food shipped in interstate commerce. It must be pure and wholesome. That was the new standard back in 1906. So basically the idea of adulteration, uh, and the idea of fraudulent labeling became important. So the very first attempts to try to control a risk in society, uh, related to food and agriculture, a really concentrated on the idea of labeling a, the idea of, of making sure that the product inside the package was what it claimed to be.

Speaker 1:          07:36          On that it had an effectiveness that, uh, was also claimed. And then it wasn't a excessively dangerous. They really worried about farmers buying, uh, pesticides, I suppose at pesticides. And then basically, uh, uh, having the container filled with sugar or flour. Uh, how would they know the difference? Uh, there were many cases of, of fraudulent manufacturing practices early in the, in the 20th century before this law was put into, into place. Another critical statute that built on this was the insecticide act of 1910. Uh, that similarly PR prohibited, uh, uh, fraudulently labeled pesticides, uh, and set standards for purity. Uh, so the idea of ingredient labeling was added to the insecticide act and it was designed to protect farmers from dangerous and impotent pesticides. You jump forward, you find that the federal food, drug and cosmetic act of 1938 is important. And it became the, uh, it can't, became the home for pesticide regulation for, for many years, uh, until, uh, uh, Epa took over that responsibility in 1970.

Speaker 1:          08:42          And the food and Drug Administration was authorized to set in 1938, uh, limits for Chemicals and food. So the recognition that if you sprayed a field of corn and a, you harvested the corn, uh, and then you, you sold it in the supermarket, that it might still carry residues. This was beginning to be well recognized back in the 1930s. The criteria used to set the tolerances, uh, was really quite interesting. At that time. It wasn't a health based criteria, wasn't an environmentally based criterion. It was how much residue and should be allowed to, to uh, uh, remain on the food product if the chemical is sprayed in the field and a dose that's effective to get the job done. In other words, to kill the pest. So that's kind of interesting. So it was really a standard that was set to make sure that the residues would not cause the food to be pulled out of the marketplace because they were adulterated.

Speaker 1:          09:42          So they were really designed to protect the farmer and the economic value of the crop rather than the health of the population or the environmental quality. The Miller amendment of 1954 required tolerances for all pesticides if they might remain as food residues. And then the Delaney amendment in 1958 became infamous because it set a zero risk standard, uh, a tolerance for carcinogens in food. So the, the exact language is that if a, a pesticide or other food additive is carcinogenic in laboratory animals or in humans, and it was the first time in law that, uh, using evidence from laboratory animals was considered to be sufficient in order to ban the use of a chemical, then it could not be used in a way that would cause the residue to be present in the food supply. Now you can imagine that these chemicals were applied to too many different crops.

Speaker 1:          10:43          And, uh, I mentioned to you that that Ddt, uh, in my last lecture was applied so heavily to so many different foods, uh, 300 different food crops had tolerances by the mid 1950s. But the government's ability to detect these chemicals is really important to this story. So if you use insensitive detection technology and other words supposing that you're, you're a chemical detection equipment is only capable of finding residues at the, uh, uh, part per 100,000, level 10 to the minus fifth, uh, or even part per million level, and the chemical is there, but it's there at the high part per billion level, uh, the chemical test is going to come back negative. It's going to come back as a non-detect. So gradually you see this, uh, a very interesting evolution in the concept of purity, in what constitutes a safe and pure environment that's very much driven by the sensitivity of the detection equipment.

Speaker 1:          11:44          So during the century, as the, as the detection equipment became more and more sensitive, now for some dioxins, we can detect those down to the part per quadrillion level. In many chemicals are present and food of the a part per trillion level. It's got people thinking about, well, what does that mean? What's that mean to, to, to uh, uh, their potential to influence human health. So back in the forties and 50s, the detection technology was really quite limited. And also the sampling was quite limited so that there really weren't sampling that many foods. And you can imagine that the, the scale of the problem this prince presents today given the international character of our food supply. And I asked this question with respect to several commodities. Uh, first I started with apples and wondered how many times the government tested apples for, for pesticides. And then I looked at a bananas and for bananas for a chemical that was, uh, when I looked about eight years ago, one of the most heavily used insecticides on bananas.

Speaker 1:          12:42          Uh, you know, grown in the tropics. The government was looking at, uh, uh, about a 15 to 18 samples of bananas a for this compound. Uh, when, uh, I then was able to calculate that several trillion individual bananas had been imported into the nation during that year. So, you know, one needs to think about, uh, uh, what standards are in place in different parts of the world, uh, where that food is likely to go, uh, keeping records of imports, statistics, and then think about what kind of a sampling design would be necessary in order to find these residues, uh, in a way that, uh, might eventually lead to health protection. So the Delaney amendment that was really quite striking. It was, uh, adopted, uh, really, uh, uh, with great support in Congress in part because of the u s fascination with cancer and also cancer management.

Speaker 1:          13:37          So this grew in part because of the nuclear weapons testing euro. Uh, but it is curious that, uh, within the European nations, the regulatory approach to environmental quality has not been as concerned with cancer. It's been more concerned with a neurological decline and also reproductive health. Uh, so race is really interesting questions about why the preoccupation in the United States with cancer. So the first seriously health protective statute, uh, that, uh, we can find an environment of law. It has to do with food and it has to do with pesticides. And it's contained in this Delaney amendment. By the way, this amendment applies to all food additives in the food additive could be in a defined, also as a coloring agent, like the salmon calling I spoke of. It could be defined as a packaging material migrant. Uh, it could be a flavoring agent as well.

Speaker 1:          14:25          Uh, so that the standard is very clear. If it induces cancer in animals or in humans, uh, then it is not allowed. Curiously, there's a clause within the statute that applies only to pesticides, uh, that are defined as food additives if they concentrate. And you remember the story I told you the other day about, uh, taking a, a grape and extracting all the water out of it, or taking a, uh, corn and extracting the oil out of it and having to be thoughtful about what that really might mean for, for chemical residues. So if you, if you are concerned about oil extraction, uh, you need to think about lipophilicity. So if you've got a chemical such as a chlorinated carbon that is likely to bind onto, to fats of, of one form or another, extracting the oil out will likely also concentrate the chemical residue. So if you look in the code of federal regulations, it's very curious.

Speaker 1:          15:21          You can go over to the law library and pull out the code of federal regulations on pesticides. It's actually a good, it'd be a good assignment for a teaching fellows to, to, uh, disseminate a go look at the code of federal regulations for pesticide residues in food. And you'll see a 40 CFR, uh, one 35, and you go to the appendix and the appendix is several hundred pages long of individual pesticide food combinations. So I was quite struck by this, uh, uh, several years ago and I added all of these up and it turns out that there are about 10,000 different pesticide food combinations. And if you look carefully at these combinations, uh, that set limits for Ben, the Millon Bananas or, or, uh, say chlorpyrifos and, and, uh, uh, apples or DDT and milk, uh, that standard is still in place. By the way, it's kind of interesting, even though DDT was banned, as I said the other day and in the 1970s, but if you look carefully, you'll see that you get a different residue limit allowed for fresh corn or a fresh apples or fresh soybeans than you do for the process product. And it's basically because of this concentration factor. So water extraction, you know, making raisins out of grapes, making wine out of grapes or making oils out of, uh, different kinds of grains can have this effect.

Speaker 1:          16:44          The Federal Insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act in 1947 was the, uh, central, uh, statute that was, was passed and it really set the stage for the u s department of Agriculture's authority to issue licenses or registrations. So, and as I mentioned earlier, the idea of registering a pesticide or allowing it to be used for a certain crop, uh, this, these registrations were given out one after another, after another, a decade after decade. So that by 1960 there were 50,000 different pesticide registrations, uh, that had been issued. And by 1970, there were nearly 70,000 pesticide registrations. And registration has given for a specific chemical use and it may be also assigned for a specific package. So the, you may have chemical x, uh, and that has one registration and then it may be sold also with chemical why or chemical y and Z. And they would have different registrations assigned to them and they might have different registrations assigned for different kinds of uses.

Speaker 1:          17:48          So that these are not just used on, on food commodities. Uh, where else might they be used? Well, you know, think about it, uh, many of many of the buildings at Yale or sprayed by pesticides indoors, uh, so that type of use often had to have a separate registration sprayed in subway, sprayed in vehicles, added to materials such as plastics that are components of cars or that, uh, uh, uh, are components of urethanes for example, that coat the wood here. So that plastics, uh, have carried biocides into our environment in a whole set of ways. And the government had to keep track of where these chemicals were going and had to license each of these distinctive uses. So the, the fifth Pfiffer of 1947, I was important because it defined these chemicals as economic poisons a implying yes, they're poisonous, uh, but they also carry an economic benefit so that, uh, we need to look at this and, uh, using a utilitarian balancing standard. Uh, so that risk benefit balancing became the phrase, uh, that, that guided us department, the Department of Agriculture to crank out these, these registrations.

Speaker 1:          19:02          It also extended the right regulations, not just to insecticides, but two herbicides and rodenticides. And right now in terms of volume of chemical released in the world, you find that herbicides are the most heavily, uh, type of pesticide. So there are pesticides or insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides designed to kill a rats or mice, ah, Sliema sides that are applied to kill slime and algae on the side of nuclear power plant cooling, cooling towers. Uh, there are nearly a hundred different chemicals. Uh, any swimmers in the, in the room? Well, probably a few are former swimmers. Uh, well there they're nearly a hundred different pesticides that have been registered for use in swimming pools, uh, to kill a variety of viruses, bacteria, uh, as well as, as molds and other pathogens. And if you think about that, uh, uh, carefully and you think about the relative risk that is associated with using those chemicals as opposed to not using them, it's probably a really good choice given the illnesses that could, could live in that environment.

Speaker 1:          20:08          So that this statute, uh, was, was the first to really break down these different categories of biocides and really assigned different regulatory responsibility nor authority was given to the Department of Agriculture. However, to remove hazardous chemicals from the marketplace so that they always found that the benefits outweighed the risk. There are no instances that I can point to a that the Department of Agriculture, uh, either abandoned chemical or found that the risk was too serious. They may have adjusted the allowable use rates or, or the type type of environment it could be released to or the type of crop, uh, but, uh, no product bans. And think about this. The government gave the Congress, gave the Department of Agriculture the Authority to manage this program, to implement the program. Now is that a good idea? What's the Department of Agriculture is basic role? Well, it's really to promote economic production of a variety of different agricultural commodities and they really also do not have and have not had much expertise in environmental science to know what happened to the chemicals once they were released or two to think carefully about the health effects.

Speaker 1:          21:21          Uh, so the medical expertise it within the Department of Agriculture, uh, throughout their period of jurisdiction, which ended in 1970 when the environmental protection agency was formed, uh, was a period when they really had very little expertise in environmental science or in medical science, which is really fundamental to the way that we're thinking about regulating pesticides today. The fifth for amendments in 1964 came after Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, uh, raised the alarm and caused, uh, the population to be quite upset about pesticide residues, particularly their effect on wildlife, uh, but also growing recognition that, that these chemicals could build in the human body and also the food and Drug Administration's admission, uh, that, that, uh, they had found pesticides in human breast milk as early as 1952. The public wasn't a warned about this. Uh, and basically if you find a chemical, regardless of what it is, you find it in a another species of mammals, breast milk, you can presume that it's likely to get into human breast milk as well.

Speaker 1:          22:31          So Rachel Carson silent spring turned out to be a real watershed, not just legally for pesticides because it really increased the sense of susceptibility to biocides or the economic poisons. Uh, but it really met with quite a bit of resistance in Congress. Uh, again, this was the end of the nuclear weapons testing, uh, in the, in the atmosphere. And it was also a period of great unrest in the United States. The, the, the origin of the civil rights movement, uh, maybe a trace to this period, the civil rights act of 1964 a recall that also we were, we're getting more deeply embedded in the war in Vietnam at that point in time. And Environmental Ism was, uh, growing up, uh, uh, creeping up on the agenda. Uh, but it was really quite an interesting period. Congress Hower was preoccupied, uh, other than making some minor revisions to the statute that included adding these words, caution, warning and hazard depending upon the relative toxicity.

Speaker 1:          23:33          This didn't really help very much because of public confusion about what those phrases meant. And the Department of Agriculture Secretary, I was given the authority finally to remove pesticides from the market, uh, based upon a finding of imminent hazard to the public. Now EPA was created in 1970 a and it was given the responsibility to manage pesticides and it was consolidated from other agencies, some 15 or 16 different sub units of different agencies were pulled together to create, to create EPA back in 1970, including the department of Agriculture that had formerly had the pesticide, uh, management responsibility. So you can imagine, you know, an entire, uh, uh, sub bureaucracies picking up and moving their materials to EPA and a, the stories from some of the early administrators about how they did this and what the effect was, or a really quite striking. Uh, they described that, uh, the Department of Agriculture had kept files on individual chemicals.

Speaker 1:          24:33          They were completely disorganized. I'll often just handwritten, uh, often with no environmental science data, often no testing of, of chemical presence in, in a different commodities that it had been a license license to be used on. And, uh, some chemicals had no data at all. So Epa was in this situation of becoming immediately responsible for 70,000 different pesticide registrations. Uh, the public was quite concerned about these residues getting into their bodies and into the environment and the wildlife effects. Uh, so they felt a lot of heat and increasingly environmental laws had these, uh, citizen's suit provisions. So Epa was getting sued in the early 1970s and they got sued on, on a, a variety of compounds such as DDT and Aldrin, the Dieldrin. And they were forced to go back and look at the data that they had available. And they found that they really had very little data to justify many of these registrations, but the law was set up that forced them to look at at a this problem chemical at a time.

Speaker 1:          25:36          So if you've got 70,000 different chemicals and the law requires that you look at them one at a time and you've got a staff that doesn't have the basic data in place, this basically put the regulatory process in deep freeze. So how would you manage that if you are responsible? Well, Congress thought about this and they allocated more and more money to the Environmental Protection Agency and EPA became much more aggressive and started banning chemicals. They ban DDT first and then Aldrin and then Dieldrin haptic floor, and then Cordain. All of these were the coronated hydrocarbons. The fifth for amendments in 1975 gave the secretary of Agriculture Authority to be notified a pending cancellations, uh, which meant that he was given a voice, uh, to oppose cancellations. Uh, but, uh, the environmental protection agency, he really became the, the stewards for, for, uh, a human health and environmental quality so that the secretary of ag agriculture, his voice was diminishing in the 1970s.

Speaker 1:          26:38          Uh, Congress also recognize that boy, you know, EPA is not making much progress on this sea of chemicals, so they better do something about it. They mandated that each chemical had to be reviewed within a nine year deadline. Well, EPA was not able to accomplish that. So the 70s and the eighties and nineties are all great examples, uh, of what I call the rule of 20, uh, that each chemical, uh, might get some attention every 20 years. But what does that mean? You can think about the fact that a new chemicals are being added to the marketplace. A new registrations are being issued. Uh, the data aren't lousy and a EPA is taking 20 years to review a single chemical. Uh, that doesn't make sense. The science is evolving at a, at a lightening pace on where the chemicals are in the environment, uh, or what the health effects are or what the effects on different species are.

Speaker 1:          27:29          And Epa is like this, uh, ship is a frozen, it's, it's icebound, uh, unable to move with the speed that, that it really need me to, to, well, this was recognized by the National Academy of Sciences in to two publications that I had a chance to work on a one regulating pesticides and food. Uh, that really critique the Delaney paradox. And, uh, a bunch of us thought that, uh, the zero risk standard is it had been interpreted by the food and Drug Administration. A really did not make much sense. A FDA had had interpreted zero risk to mean a little bit of risk. So a de minimis is the phrase that, uh, uh, it used. And De minimis means a trivial amount of risk and they define that generally as a one in a million risk threshold. So that, uh, this was a, a, a curious experience for me because it was my first, uh, uh, exploration of the human diet and its variability.

Speaker 1:          28:28          So I started pouring through food intake surveys, uh, which is the reason that I asked a section on Monday night to keep track of just one day of your own diet. You know, think about that. Uh, uh, what foods do you eat as a way of thinking about how patterns in your diet might lead to predictable patterns of, of your exposure to residues that had been allowed by government. So in this case, uh, we were looking only at that subset of chemicals, uh, that, uh, had some evidence of carcinogenicity so that these chemicals induce cancer in animals or we're known to induce cancer cancer in humans. And when we were thinking particularly about how cancer risk might add up across the chemicals, so a hundred different chemicals, uh, that are, are, are cancer inducing and laboratory experiments, how would you deal with that issue of risk additives?

Speaker 1:          29:18          It would, would it be possible that, uh, uh, there may be a negative effect on risk if you had to chemical exposures at the same time? Well, scientists have found some cases where that actually occurred where a lower risk chemical is able to bind onto a site in a cell and prevent a higher risk chemical from doing the same thing. In other cases, there's a synergistic relationship so that, uh, the, the, the risk is not just additive, uh, but if you're exposed to chemical a and then chemical B, Oh, you've got a higher risk of, of getting cancer. So working with a bunch of specialists and cancer as well as specialists in and residue chemistry and exposure, uh, analysis. We came up with, uh, uh, uh, not to, uh, complimentary picture of the way that EPA had regulated carcinogens in the food and recommended also that, uh, they pay much more attention to the individual diet, uh, that the Diet, uh, was the, uh, likely to be the key root of exposure to a variety of different chemicals.

Speaker 1:          30:22          The second book flowed from the first by the National Academy of Sciences called Pesticides in the diets of infants and children. And at this focused on of finding inside the red book, uh, the finding that there's a lot of variability out there in the diets that, uh, people eat, that that is quite predictable. So if you're Italian, you're likely to eat more tomato products. Uh, if you're Latino, you're likely to eat more corn products. Uh, if you are, uh, uh, an African African American from the southern part of the United States, uh, people generally eat more greens. Uh, if you are living in California, you're going to eat more fresh produce than you would if you live in the northeast. Uh, it's a, it's cost does not go up the way that it does in the northeast. So diet vary by season. I had varied by region of the country. Uh, it varies by age.

Speaker 1:          31:12          Uh, and it also varies quite a bit by ethnicity. So if you don't understand these differences and dietary patterns, you really don't have much hope of, of understanding the variability in the chemical matrix that these individual diets might convey into your body. So it also presents a really kind of an interesting idea that you could use cropping patterns is a way of predicting which chemicals make their way into certain environments. So if, if, uh, you were looking at the effect of corn on environmental quality in the United States corn production, you'd want to know where is it planted predominantly in the Midwestern part of the u s uh, Ground Zero is, is, uh, uh, pretty much, uh, Iowa through Ohio and Pennsylvania. And, uh, if, if you map out the pattern of chemical use, you'll see that, uh, herbicides are applied much more intensely, uh, in this area than in other parts of the nation.

Speaker 1:          32:06          Uh, and that explains why herbicide residues are detectable in the water supplies of a nearly 30 million people in the United States and also in, in a human tissues. So that this understanding of dietary diversity turned out to be extremely important, uh, because it had been completely neglected by environmental law and the diversity in patterns of exposure in environmental law is something that, um, uh, I became curious about and wondered about whether or not you'd find the same thing relative to a drinking water. Would you find the same issue relative to air quality? Uh, are there pockets of high exposure out there in the population that could be predictable, that would make environmental law and regulation able to focus in a way that was more effective? And the answer is yes. Uh, so as we look across cases over the next, uh, next couple of a weeks, we'll see the same pattern emerging that once you understand variability in the, in the Diet, in other words, once you focus in and you, you look for, uh, you know, pockets of a high exposure, high a consumption of corn or hike consumption of a certain cluster of foods, or you look at a certain populations such as athletes, uh, that have a higher respiration rate, then then nonathletes to, uh, that, uh, that because of that higher respiration rate, they're going to absorb more, more chemicals that are present in the, in the air.

Speaker 1:          33:31          So, uh, across a whole array of different kinds of environmental problems that are managed by law, there's basically, uh, there had been a neglect of this issue of variability. So how do you take a body of law such as the body that I just described to you for a, these chemicals and transform it to be more sensitive, uh, to the reality of these patterns of chemical use and exposure. So what I'm painting here is a picture of what I think of is fractured a science and fractured law so that the legal authority from pesticides is now broken into three different bureaus, the environmental protection agency that is responsible for tolerance setting, but also toxicity testing. The Food and drug administration is responsible for detecting residues in the food supply. And the Department of Agriculture is responsible for the enforcement of these statutes in meat and poultry and also for the assessment of economic benefits associated with producing the nation's food supply.

Speaker 1:          34:27          So you've got these different agencies with different legal mandates and they tend not to talk to one another. So that the a in Great Britain, they've created a new food safety organization that, uh, is really quite a distinctive as a model. They had the same fractured pattern of bureaucratic control and Great Britain. And, uh, they decided that that, uh, they would consolidate, that they'd centralize the authority in one group. And it's, it's very curious because by doing that, uh, it is allowed conservative administrations, uh, to slow down regulation and to become less environmentally protective, uh, much more quickly than if the authority is, is diffused among different agencies. So this is a very interesting kind of a problem. The primary authority for tolerance setting was taken away from the Department of Agriculture, just like the authority for regulating nuclear power was taken away from the Atomic Energy Commission. So the nuclear regulatory commission was created. So you don't, you don't want the producer and the protector of the public interest to be sitting inside the same organization. That's really the key principle

Speaker 2:          35:37          for those

Speaker 1:          35:38          of you that I haven't stunned to death, uh, enough with this lecture so far. Uh, if you want to know more about pesticide science and history in law, I published this book, uh, about 10 years ago and this really details the, the description of how we discovered that kids were more exposed to many different pesticides and adults, uh, that, uh, uh, uh, was eventually adopted into the Food Crop Quality Protection Act passed in 1996. So this law was designed to, to deal with this problem of, of risk being not equally distributed in society and it included a new general safety standard. It did away with the risk benefit balancing standard and it said, okay, instead, uh, uh, EPA must make its choices based upon the phrase reasonable certainty of no harm. It's kind of interesting. If you were, if you were given the assignment to, to uh, uh, include a decision standard in a statute that was health protective, uh, what would you choose?

Speaker 1:          36:38          Would you choose a balancing standard? Probably not a, would you choose the Delaney clause model, which is a zero risk standard? You might, uh, would you choose a standard such as this reasonable certainty of no harm? While you can imagine that this is hammered out politically, uh, in, in Congress with great interest on the part of chemical companies and also, uh, uh, food manufacturers to try to understand what its implications might be for them, it also requires a finding of safety. This had not been part of the law until 1996. So we pay must now find that uh, uh, chemicals are safe for children. This is really quite new and striking. Uh, and it requires a 10 fold additional safety factor to account for uncertainty and the data that they have as they set their limits so that this idea of a buffer zone, if you think the risk is x, then you have to allow x over what, uh, in order to set your standard for exposure.

Speaker 1:          37:36          While is it, uh, do you want a 10 fold safety factor? Uh, do you want to a hundred fold a thousand fold? Well, the tradition had been to use a hundred fold safety factor. So if you think that this is what it is, you account for your, your absence of knowledge or your ignorance by dividing the allowable level by a hundred. And in this case, Congress said, that's not good enough. You have to divide it by an additional 10 to account for the uncertainty about the distributional patterns and also the issue of, of some groups being more susceptible to these chemicals than, than others.

Speaker 1:          38:09          It also required that the agency for the first time, uh, needed to consider how people might be exposed to the same chemical, uh, not just from, from a food, uh, or, uh, different crops, uh, but food, drinking water, uh, and other kinds of environments. So the same chemical might be sprayed on the fruits and vegetables and it might get into dairy cattle, uh, but it also might be sprayed in your apartment building or also might be a used as an algaecide in a, in a swimming pool. Uh, so that, uh, formerly EPA had just kind of given up licenses as USDA had to these different allowable uses and not thought about the fact that to somebody is a basically walk through their daily life. Uh, it could be exposed to the same chemical across, across these environmental compartments, so to speak. So the idea of aggregate risk is new and it's an attempt to think about the complexity of the way that these compounds can move through a environments.

Speaker 1:          39:06          The idea of cumulative risk is also knew, uh, the government had to consider the idea that, uh, you know, a group of chemicals might act the same way in the human body and the risk might be at least additive if not a synergistic. So for the first time in 1996, EPA had to review all of his tolerances to, to think about this issue of cumulative risk. And the pace of review was also sped up so that all chemicals that, uh, had, had licensed had to be reviewed by 2006, uh, that was accomplished. You know, we're quite remarkably, uh, but, uh, the, uh, the critique I could give you a of the quality of the review is, is a different matter. Uh, and finally, uh, Congress directed the agency not to give equal attention to every pesticide, but to come through or to develop some sort of a strategy to, to concentrate and focus on chemicals that it thought a would be the most risky.

Speaker 1:          39:58          So how would you do that? How would you define the most risky chemicals while you try to find those that had the highest a dose response rate? In other words, they seem like they were the most potent, are the most toxic, but you also probably want to concentrate on chemicals that were persistent chemicals that got into different environmental compartments or chemicals that were used in, in, uh, food or, or environments that people freak. Frequent foods that people eat a lot of, or environments that, uh, uh, we're, we're highly frequented such as schools or, or, uh, uh, such as, uh, uh, occupational settings or, or, or homes. Uh, so that the idea of strategic attention to the most toxic chemicals is an important concept. So, uh, what's happened here, as you think back across history, you've got kind of a sequence of changing regulatory priorities. And you might ask yourself, well, why is that?

Speaker 1:          40:53          So the first attempt backed in, in 2019 Oh six, was to protect the economy of farmers against fraudulent labeling. Uh, then the obligation, uh, became to protect food and a crap uses. So set limits for levels of revenue in different kinds of foods. Uh, then wildlife, wildlife remedies became extremely important as people worry about, uh, how chemicals were causing decline in species that, uh, were really, uh, much loved in the United States, particularly large raptors, a bald eagles, uh, the national symbol or the Golden Eagle, uh, the Peregrine Falcon ospreys that, uh, now you can see coming back along the shoreline here in Connecticut. If you take the train from new haven up to Boston, for example, and look out over the salt marshes, you'll see these polls, uh, sitting in the middle of the salt marshes with Osprey's ospreys came very close to extinction because of the chemical DDT that was building up and it's, it's body and causing its egg shells to thin.

Speaker 1:          41:53          Uh, so it's reproductive success declined. Soil contamination became important, uh, as instances where chemical had been used in the field one year and had persisted in that field. Uh, another tenant farmer comes along the next year and plants a different crop. That crop is not permitted to have that chemical used on it, but it absorbed the chemical up through, uh, its roots, uh, and becomes adulterated. So that failure to think about soil contamination was causing some foods to become adulterated in ways that were not predictable and drinking water contamination has come late to the attention of the environmental protection agency. Why would that be? You know, if you think about water as one of the most consumed foods in the human diet, why wouldn't the government have paid more attention to water? Also, think about indoor environments. Uh, I've come to believe that all of the attention given to food, uh, is really probably misplaced a relative to exposures that occur in indoor environments so that in many situations today people can be in rooms, uh, when they are sprayed by a licensed applicator.

Speaker 1:          42:59          So they exposures that occur after that, uh, often are far, far higher than the exposures that come from food borne residues. The idea that the susceptible need, need attention. This is new and environmental law has of 1996 and new areas that deserve additional attention that, that, uh, I think are extremely important is the use of these chemicals as they're impregnated into a variety of consumer products. So, you know, if you're, if you're hiking long distances, you may want a pesticide impregnated into the fabric that you buy if you don't have an opportunity to, to wash your clothes. Uh, but what, what does that mean? Uh, there are whole new array of products in the marketplace now that carry these residues, uh, for obvious functions such as is durability, keeping them from degrading pesticides are added to paints, for example, to keep the bacteria in paint from breaking it down and shipping and causing you to have to, uh, to, uh, you know, repaint in, in a short period of time so that the functional side of these chemicals used in consumer products is pretty well understood.

Speaker 1:          44:06          Uh, but the longterm implications for environmental quality and human health, really or not. So the underlying problems here include the human inability to sense chemical risk. You know, we basically don't know where these chemicals are in our environment because we can't see them. We can't taste them. Uh, we can't feel them. We have to, we have to imply where they are, uh, by, uh, by proxy a thinking about, Gee, you know, I live near, I'm living on a track of land and I've got a, well, and this used to be a farmland. Maybe I had a test my drinking water, uh, or I'm living next to a field that is plant that is planted with a crop that's routinely sprayed by a plane that flies over. Maybe the drift is, is getting into my, uh, into my environment. So that thinking about where these things are in the environment really demands a certain level of background literacy and knowledge, uh, that often is not present.

Speaker 1:          45:02          The underlying problem of lack of sensitivity to, to susceptibility is really important. Uh, who's susceptible? Well, the, the very youngest are, uh, remember that all of these concentrations are measured how they're expressed per unit of your body weight. So when in life, uh, does a human had the lowest body weight in utero first trimester. So if the concentration in the mom is the same, uh, moving across the placenta as the concentration in the fetus and you get to an exposure estimate by taking that concentration and dividing it by body weight and the mom's body weight might be 160 pounds and the fetus is body weight might be a quarter of a pound. I'm sorry. Sorry Laura. About this, you get the idea. The same concentration in the environment affects the fetus much more than it would, uh, the average adult. So this has really transformed the way that a government regulators have begun to think about chemical management.

Speaker 1:          46:07          We've had poor monitoring of chemical release. Uh, we have thought much more about chemical persistence and environmental fate having learned from strontium 90 and the DDT story. Uh, and we've under misunderstood variability in human exposure. Still, we're not putting monitors on individual people, although increasingly the government is, is uh, uh, monitoring human tissue, taking blood and urine, uh, and hair samples to try to figure out, you know, what the, what the Matrix or chemicals might be that, that an individual is exposed to. So looking not just by a sampling in the marketplace, uh, but looking at this pattern by taking human tissue samples, this is a whole new wave that's giving people the opportunity literally to go to a doctor and say, I want to be measured for this entire array of chemicals. So it may cost you a couple thousand dollars to go through that process. But increasingly people are doing this, trying to make some sense out of the way that they feel their medical condition and a environmental quality, single chemical exposure is still the focus of government.

Speaker 1:          47:15          No company wants it's chemical to be compared to another company. When, uh, when, uh, uh, they're making a regulatory choice, uh, toxicity testing is incomplete and a variety of areas, uh, especially, uh, relative to the immune system. And, you know, the rise in allergies that a, we're experiencing a severe allergies. Uh, more people are walking around with Epi pens today because of, of, uh, uh, worries about anaphylaxis than ever before. Something is happening to the human immune system. It's not clear why, but many of the chemicals that are released such as some pesticides, uh, do influence the human immune system. That's one example of an area of human health that has been neglected by, by the government. Uh, also the Endocrin, uh, affects are, are quite, uh, uh, misunderstood the, the, uh, uh, behavior of these chemicals as human hormones that we'll speak about a bit next week.

Speaker 1:          48:08          Uh, also failure of labeling as a management strategy. Labeling is still the dominant approach that EPA takes to try to inform the public, to educate the public how they might be able to use these economic poisons a in a safe way. But you need to think about whether or not that's really a potentially effective way of controlling these kinds of risks. And we're also misunderstanding, uh, trends in human illness. Uh, W for example, uh, we had no asthma registry in Connecticut until I'm not 2003, so we couldn't figure out whether or not, uh, uh, people that lived in areas that had higher levels of air pollution, uh, were more likely to have asthma. So the absence of surveillance of health conditions, uh, makes it impossible to correlate these exposures to health outcomes. And finally, a variance and human capacity to manage risk. There's a real environmental justice here that needs to be paid attention to, that there are many members of society that do not have the capacity, uh, to get the education necessary to self manage risk. Uh, so that, uh, some people, uh, simply are more reliant on government standard setting than, than other people are. So these are all underlying problems of law. Uh, and all of them are pretty well exemplified by this history of pesticide, uh, uh, uh, management. Okay. That's it for today. And, uh, we'll come back on Tuesday, have a great weekend.
