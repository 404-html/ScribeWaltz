Speaker 1:          00:01          All right, everybody, let's start in.

Speaker 1:          00:06          So the midterms are graded for those of you that are not doing the paper and uh, you'll receive them back on Thursday in class. Uh, and uh, people for the most part did quite well. So it's a good news. Today I want to talk about tobacco and the legal paradigm that surrounds tobacco because it really provides a, I think, an interesting comparison to some of the other, uh, legal regimes that we've taken a look at, uh, so far in the course, including those that surround air quality pesticides, atomic weapons testing, hazardous sites, and plastics. So how has tobacco, uh, managed and what's its history? And I've come to think about this, this a history really is a conflict of perceptions of rights and obligations, uh, particularly, uh, the right to, uh, to, uh, participate in markets. Uh, the right to, uh, speak freely, the right to advertise a as opposed to the right to be free from exposure to chemicals that are recognized to be quite hazardous. So all of these cases that we've looked at so far during the term, I really have had a raise questions about a risk and a different approaches to managing risk.

Speaker 1:          01:22          What are the different legal strategies that you might think about to, uh, to take on a hazards such as this? Well, one is taxes. Uh, we'll take a look at tax policy and, and to how tax policy creates a dependency relationship, uh, between an industry and governments, particularly, particularly at times like this of a budgetary stress. We'll take a look also at a place based restrictions, uh, so preventing the sale of, of certain hazardous commodities in certain kinds of environments so that, uh, uh, no, we can no longer purchase tobacco products and vending machines in the United States. Instead, they have to be purchased a over the counter, uh, by someone who would check identification, a sales restrictions of different sorts, uh, advertising restrictions, a fair warning requirements on, on tobacco products. Uh, also compensation. Uh, how are we going to manage compensation for those that claim that they've been harmed by the products?

Speaker 1:          02:23          How are we going to subsidize the industry? Uh, you probably know that, uh, uh, many different commodities, agricultural commodities received a rather high subsidies. So, uh, what, what has been the, uh, the relative history of tobacco subsidies compared to, to other commodities? Uh, how about, uh, regulating the chemical content of tobacco, uh, flavoring agents, coloring agents, uh, the shape of tobacco? How about a tobacco products designed, uh, to, uh, uh, soothe? Or how about the regulation of nicotine itself? Uh, known to be, how about the ban on all tobacco products? Uh, has anybody thought about doing that at any scale? Uh, well, many governments have, have chosen to ban use of tobacco, tobacco products inside buildings. So public buildings commonly, uh, uh, now restrict the use of tobacco products. Uh, also how about socializing the industry? An idea that a Kessler came up with a, at the end of his book.

Speaker 1:          03:30          So what's the scale of this issue in terms of economics? Uh, about $50 billion today in consumer spending, while in about 15 million people in the United States smoke approximately 600 billion billion cigarettes each year. Uh, the overwhelming majority of those, uh, cigarettes by the way, are, are a lit and smoked indoors so that this is very much a, an indoor air quality issue, uh, about 4 billion cigars or smoked also for 40 million pounds of tobacco or burned indoors every year. How about tobacco related illnesses? He's very little debate about this compared to the other types of problems that we've looked at that are managed by environmental law, including pesticides, including air pollutants and drinking water contaminants managed by the safe drinking water act or chemicals that are migrating from hazardous waste sites or the quality of the scientific evidence about the effect of tobacco and human health is really the gold standard. It's similar in quality to, uh, our understanding of the role that radiation plays in inducing cancer. Uh, there are also about 470,000 different suppliers, wholesalers and retailers that are highly dependent upon this industry. So this is a recipe for a enormous conflict, uh, in Washington about how to use the different strategies that I just went over.

Speaker 1:          04:55          All, Huh. So the way that the laws have evolved in the U s was laid out, I think fairly well and Kessler's book. Uh, but the, the, uh, strategies that the government has relied on, now I have included hazard warnings, predominantly a control over advertising claims and, uh, the use of specific media outlets, uh, age restrictions. So that a, within United States right now, the, the, uh, uh, use of tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products is restricted to those that are 18 years and older. Although there are some states in some counties that, uh, uh, now demand that you need to be 19 years old, for example, in Nassau County and Suffolk County in New York, a demand that you'd be 19 years old. Well, if you look around the world too, there's quite a bit of variability in some of the, the, uh, poor nations of the world. All you need to be 10 years old. I in France, you need to be 16 years old. Uh, in Japan you need to be 20 years old. So the idea of age based a restriction is, is really quite variable across different jurisdictional boundaries. Uh, restricting access, uh, making certain that a, you can't just walk up to a machine and put your, your, uh, uh, now seven or $8 into it to, uh, to get your, your pack of cigarettes out, the removal of subsidies, uh, but not prohibition. So the Congress considered a variety of strategies, but they always backed off of prohibition.

Speaker 1:          06:18          How about industry strategies to maintain their share of the marketplace? What have they done? Well, one of the first things that they did was to focus the issue. Could focus government's attention on labeling. And as with the pesticide labeling and labeling of pharmaceuticals and food products, uh, labeling is a, is a problematic form of conveying a sense of risk. Uh, this is especially different, uh, than, than pesticides or, or, uh, some drugs, uh, in that, uh, the, the product itself is addictive. It's addictive. Uh, predominantly because of, of the nicotine content, uh, they industry also fought, uh, to confuse the evidentiary base on health effects. So just like a nuclear weapons and just like pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Uh, the knowledge about the danger grew from the industry research itself. So the American Tobacco Ends Institute, uh, for example, uh, might be thought of similarly to the atomic energy commission or to the pesticide companies that conducted their own analyses of data so that they became the source of data to demonstrate the absence of, have a clear understanding about, uh, adverse health effects.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Also in advertising. You know, they, they really took a very bold moves and I'll go through a variety of different advertising strategies today with you, uh, to, uh, associate tobacco use with the ideas of freedom, uh, values of nature. Uh, also sociability and sexuality. So the imagery is very important. It's extremely important and also quite persuasive, uh, to the very young, they focused on the costs of regulations, uh, not the costs of health care. And it's quite interesting to think about, uh, uh, the sea change that occurred as a result of, of litigation in Florida against tobacco companies that resulted in a settlement so that, uh, uh, many attorneys general in the United States banded together. Uh, and, uh, we're able to reach a settlement for approximately $250 billion to be paid out by the tobacco companies to different states here by year. A study at Yale, uh, just a couple of years ago demonstrated by the way that the money that came into Connecticut did not go into educational funds, uh, that, uh, educational programs to prevent tobacco use or to, to, uh, uh, uh, increase the, uh, the, the rate of, of, uh, quitting of tobacco use, uh, instead it was diverted into a variety of other state needs.

Speaker 1:          08:50          So the, uh, this balancing of, of costs of regulation, uh, as opposed to the benefits of the product has been central in their, in their logic. Also, the idea of preemption, uh, just as pesticides are preempted a so that they can't be, they can't be regulated differently. The labeling can't vary from state to state. Uh, so that, uh, the tobacco companies went to the federal government and were successful and I'm preempting state and local regulation, uh, regarding both labeling and tort litigation. So preemption basically prevents this patchwork quilt of regulations from, from, uh, uh, uh, being imposed on the industry. If you look at the variability of taxation by state, it's also quite, uh, quite curious. So that in the state of Rhode Island, uh, the, uh, tax state tax is about $2 and 46 cents per pack. Uh, whereas the state of Kentucky, you was down to 3 cents per packer and this is several years ago.

Speaker 1:          09:49          So states have the authority to set taxes at different levels, uh, to give you a sense of the magnitude of importance to a state's budget. Uh, the, uh, sales tax represents if a California increase the sales tax by only 50 cents a, it would raise nearly a half a billion dollars per year if New York or increase their taxes by about 50 cents a, they would increase their income, their revenue by about a third of $1 billion per year. So that states have become quite highly reliant upon the sales taxes as a, uh, important for hormone of income. How about, uh, some of the statistics about smoking prevalence in education. So, as I said at the beginning of the lecture, about 50 million people out of a little, over a few, over a 300 million people in the United States smoke. Uh, but what about, uh, uh, their level of education? And what you see is that, that, uh, uh, current smokers, uh, the, uh, uh, tend to decline as a percentage, uh, with education less than high school.

Speaker 1:          10:52          Uh, you see here, uh, the current smoker smoking rate is much higher than it is a, for those that have university education, so that those who understand the health effects are less likely to adopt, uh, uh, tobacco use and they're more likely to consider quitting. So to give you a sense, also, the magnitude of, of tax revenue across some of the larger states. Uh, the, the u s income is now over a well over $10 billion per year, uh, that, uh, states enjoy. Uh, tobacco also has been a target for a subsidy removal. So compared to corn as an example, uh, corn and joys about a one and a half, $1 billion, uh, uh, subsidy or did and 19 and 2004, or as tobacco subsidies are, uh, less than a billion dollars. Today, advertising is a very important component of the cigarette companies budgets, uh, so that they are spending today close to 20 a $22 billion on advertising and promotional expenses.

Speaker 1:          12:00          Uh, and this amount of, to about $53 for every person in the United States. Uh, this is a 22% increase over over previous years. So what you find is as, as the market goes down, as he adoption rate among the young go down or they will vary there, they're targeting, uh, of, of advertising, uh, by, uh, by gender, by a ethnic group, uh, as well as by age. So that expenditures for advertising have increased in response to increasing regulation in these declining, uh, adoption rates. Targeting children through advertising is a, a, an important thing to consider. And, and, uh, kind of curiously, children played an important role in and the evolution of, uh, prohibited policy with respect to nuclear weapons. Uh, they played an important role in the control of led. They played a really important role in the adoption of the tougher a particulate matter standards, uh, for pesticide, uh, restrictions.

Speaker 1:          12:56          So that Ms. Case, a recognition that children are especially susceptible to, to, uh, persuasion by advertising, uh, has similarly led to two recent, uh, uh, more restrictive legislation. So Joe Camel provides a, a, a pretty interesting example. This a series ran between a 1988 and 1997 and about 3000 new smokers less than 18 years. Uh, we're, we're picked up, uh, per day and about a third of these people, if they persist in their habit, I will die of tobacco related illness. The, uh, appeals, uh, uh, are, are well known to everybody. Uh, here you see Joe Camel, uh, uh, with a, uh, a woman, a cracked of woman in the background. Uh, the images a tough, uh, the image a is one of a fighter pilot. Uh, and there he is smoking his cigarette. The idea of this series was, was modeled after a television show called Miami Vice, uh, really modeled after James Bond and Don Johnson, uh, in one study showed that nearly a third of all, all three year olds a match the character to the cigarette brand.

Speaker 1:          14:08          And amongst six year Joe camel was his fee as a familiar as Mickey mouse. So, uh, within a matter of three years, Joe increased camels market share from one to 33%. And in a less than 18 year old range, a sales increased during that three year period by $500 million per year. And this is believe now to be one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history. I think about, uh, the, the imagery as well. So, uh, here on the left hand slide you see a woman having a presumably just reached a mountain peak and, uh, uh, then reached into your pocket for a lucky strike. Uh, the Marlboro man, also the image of masculinity, a horse having just roped the steer, uh, and also, uh, uh, a key symbol for the corporation. Looking back in history, you can see also the appeal to women, particularly as a weight control strategy.

Speaker 1:          15:05          So to keep a slender figure, no one can die, can deny. It's a why as to reach for a lucky, uh, and also the appeal to, uh, uh, keeping mom on a, on a steady course. So, uh, here you have a child in the add, uh, before you scold me, mom, maybe you better light up a Marlboro a and g Mama. You sure enjoy your Marlboro. So things are, things seem happier in the family. So somebody is cranky, uh, uh, associate, uh, uh, the use of tobacco, uh, with a mood swing, a physicians were enlisted to support advertising as well. Uh, so here you see some ads from the 1930s and 1940s. Uh, it's, it's actually interesting that you can go back through, uh, uh, the, these old volumes of life magazine or a national geographic or time magazine over in, in Sterling Library. And take a look at the patterns in advertising over time. So a 20,000, 679 physicians say luckies are less irritating. It's toasted. More doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette. Dennis to also were part of the advertising game. And anybody that, uh, uh, has smoked or no smokers know that cigarettes generally steam teeth, especially those without filters. So the idea that putting a filter on the end of the tobacco could remove the a, the dangerous product. It could remove the, uh, the, the discoloring agents in the, in the compound. Uh, uh, that's an interesting idea. Santa Claus even got into the act for awhile while, so a guard against throat scratch.

Speaker 1:          16:36          Uh, there's also a long history about a reliance on gender and women have been extensively targeted. A women, I tend to have lower adoption rates than men. Men do a buy four or 5% in the United States. Uh, and the, uh, the dominant marketing strategy has been one to, uh, uh, on themes of both social desirability, uh, and independence. Uh, and these are normally conveyed by thin, attractive and athletic, uh, models. Uh, this history goes back quite a ways and you see it in different parts of the world as well. Uh, so that, uh, uh, the highest estimates for cigarette smoking among women tend to be in, in the, uh, southern and tobacco growing states, such as Kentucky, uh, where it's about 28.1%, whereas nationally only 18% of women a smell.

Speaker 1:          17:27          Also, you can, uh, recognize certain patterns of reliance of different brands on different types of imagery. So whereas Marlboro concentrated on, uh, uh, kind of a machismo image of masculinity, I, Virginia slims instead concentrated their efforts on women, always slim women, uh, always tough women. Uh, you know, uh, yeah, I got a tattoo and no, you can't see it. So the image of sexuality and also strength not dominated their imagery on the tobacco companies also tried to influence cultural acceptance of tobacco products by encouraging actors to smoke on stage, encouraging producers, uh, providing subsidies. So that tobacco use was noted. And about 75% of all movies that will reviewed several years ago, in 43% of the movies showed scenes in which tobacco use could be interpreted as attractive a with qualities described by teenagers as sexy, exciting, powerful, cool, sophisticated, rebellious, and celebrity. Celebratory. And 25% of the movies included some of the anti tobacco statements.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Uh, top build actors lit up in 59% of all movies reviewed another, uh, example of Virginia Slims Advertising, riding a motorcycle, uh, the idea that you would, uh, take on risks, uh, not only writing them, so motorcycle, uh, but also riding without a helmet. So that, uh, the, the idea that, that, uh, uh, you're tough, uh, you're, you're attractive, you're slim. Uh, these are all images that, uh, uh, are very strategically designed to encourage adoption rates in different parts of the world. You find a different ethnic groups being targeted using a variety of different strategies. So a Virginia slims also tried to create the idea that that independence and cultural pride are linked to tobacco use. Uh, so that, uh, there's a terrific amount of variability. Also the promotion of different kinds of events. Uh, when I was a kid and we'd go to rock concerts, uh, people would commonly be there with, uh, uh, these big trays, a haul over their shoulders, uh, with sample size tobacco packages, four or five, uh, uh, cigarettes and a carton.

Speaker 1:          19:42          And they were given out freely and some bars, the promotional activities, uh, uh, also, uh, freely distributed tobacco products. In this case, you, you a, you probably recognize that or knew that, uh, different kinds of races and athletic events were sponsored by different groups. Virginia slims, for example, was, was quite active in promoting tennis tournaments. Uh, the, the Virginia Slims and invitation was an example of that. A NASCAR racing was, uh, promoted by a lucky strike, the moral borrow 500, uh, as another stock car race. My Dad, when he was in World War II, uh, he would, uh, he will, uh, after he came back, he always told stories about his, uh, uh, k ration kit so that they were given a k rations, which often included spam. Uh, but, uh, also peanuts and, and, uh, uh, chocolate bars. And he would tell about always having the cigarette pack a freely available to all of the Gis.

Speaker 1:          20:41          What a brilliant advertising technique. Uh, recognizing the addictive power of tobacco, how few cigarettes it really takes to, to, uh, cause a physical addiction, uh, and putting them into every k ration, uh, virtually ensuring that you would have a high addiction rate, uh, for among the Gis. Uh, once the millions of soldiers came back to the u s today, if you look on the Internet, you'll find a variety of different advertising schemes in different parts of the world. Uh, Rjr stir the census campaign is, is a good example. And some of them include a product auctions and encourage you to become a member so that they can advertise and provide you with the information about different kinds of, of, of discounts on products as well as to promote their products. Now, different countries to have taken different approaches to labeling. And, uh, you know, that I'm not a great fan of labeling as a way of conveying knowledge about risk.

Speaker 1:          21:37          And I don't think that it really, uh, often helps a consumer to understand the, uh, uh, the true benefits as opposed to the, uh, the adverse effects associated with products. But the Canadians have taken a tougher stance than we have in the United States. No. In the US, you know that we have these little boxes on the sides of the packets or sometimes on the backs of the packets. Uh, that may say, warning, this product is known to cause cancer where this product is dangerous to your health or this product to it causes emphysema or exacerbates asthma. So that, uh, there are a variety of different signal phrases that are required to be cycled through on the sides of tobacco products. Uh, Canada has a system where that whereby they demand that the front of the package, uh, include photographs of, of a health loss. So here's an example of what a heart looks like after it's had an attack.

Speaker 1:          22:29          Uh, the darker area, for example, in, in this photo, uh, another, uh, example cigarettes cause lung cancer. So someone on a heart lung machine on lying in a hospital, uh, cigarettes hurt babies. Uh, so that doesn't appeal to a protection of the unborn, uh, and, uh, of children getting people to think more carefully about what they're doing to their young. And something that might wake up, uh, teenagers, uh, tobacco use to can make you input. It can make you impotent. Uh, that's news to many people. Uh, there are also prevalence rates that varied by ethnicity. Uh, so that American Indians and Alaska natives, for example, uh, have, uh, adoption and prevalence rates are far higher than, than we haven't in other ethnic minorities. Uh, and also, uh, uh, Asians have one of the lowest adoption and addiction rates in the nation. Most smokers begin his teens.

Speaker 1:          23:25          And, uh, this is, uh, quite interesting to me. Uh, when I saw this, a David Kessler showed this slide to me, I'm going to show a series of slides that he provided a, uh, when he used to lecture in this course. And you see that, uh, uh, the adoption rates begin at a very young age, uh, so that the up to 12 13% occur, uh, beneath the age of 12, uh, beneath the age of 15. You see, you know, roughly a 25, 50, maybe about 50%, uh, of the age of, uh, uh, adoption. So that uh, the target, uh, of, of a youth has become a very important aspect of advertising campaigns among the tobacco companies. In fact, a RJ Reynolds in 1984, uh, stated, uh, that young smokers had been the critical factor in the growth and decline of every major brand and company over the last 50 years. So if you can addict a single individual who is 50 years old, uh, you will have a much lower rate of return than you would if you could addict to a 15 year old.

Speaker 1:          24:34          Another a comment by on Rj Reynolds executive. Realistically, if our company is to survive and prosper over the long term, we must get our share of the youth market and speaking again, the executives says evidence is now available to indicate that 14 to 18 year old group a is an increasing segment of the smoking population. Rj Rm as soon establishes a successful new brand in this market. If our position in the industry has to be maintained over the long run, if we were to attract a nonsmoker or pre smoker, there is nothing in this type of product that he would currently understand or desire. Instead, we somehow must convince him with wholly irrational reasons that he should try smoking. Very interesting idea. So here you have a product, uh, that, uh, you know, would be a disgusting to too many people that had never tried it. I remember when I smoked my first cigarette, I just coughed and spluttered my eyes watered a hated the taste and I hated the smell that I carried around.

Speaker 1:          25:36          And, and, uh, uh, so that, uh, this is, well, this was, were recognized by the industry that they needed to create a other factors that would encourage people to, to adopt the, how about the, uh, the legal framework that, that, uh, this sits within? Well, the surgeon general's report that was released in 1964 was the first, uh, thorough and, and, uh, uh, comprehensive indictment of the effect of tobacco products on human health, uh, concluding that, uh, it did, uh, induce lung disease. So the Federal Trade Commission, uh, at that time began to regulate advertising and it concluded that a cigarette ad advertising was deceptive, uh, that advertisers had a responsibility to warn the public about the health hazards of smoking and that the Federal Trade Commission, uh, then proposed labeling the amount of tar and nicotine and include a statement such as caution, cigarette smoking is dangerous to health. It may cause death from cancer or other diseases.

Speaker 1:          26:39          The idea of preemption, uh, originated with respect to tobacco products back in 1965. Uh, and, uh, it prohibited the Federal Trade Commission and states and local governments from acquiring any other label on cigarette packages in any warnings to cigarette advertising at least until 1969. There's also the federal communications commission that plays an important role here, uh, particularly the fairness doctrine. Uh, so by 1967 more money was spent on television, uh, tobacco advertising than for any other product. Uh, and in 1966, a citizen John Vans Hoff wrote to CBS TV in New York and requested that some other responsible spokesperson be given a chance, uh, to present contrasting views. On the issue of the benefits and advisability of smoking. And the FCC responded and required a significant amount of time to rebut tobacco advertising. Uh, concluding that we hold to the fairness doctrine is applicable to such advertisement. The fairness doctrine has its origin in 1949 in a rule that required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, uh, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters.

Speaker 1:          27:58          In 1969, the public health cigarette smoking act was adopted and it demanded a cautionary label oh, with a key change in the phrase, uh, so that the surgeon general has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health, not may be dangerous to your health. It also required a blackout, a cigarette commercials. Uh, as of January in 1971 on television and radio stations estimated a loss of about $220 million in revenue. So we're a recall that I argued that, uh, this, this industry, uh, creates a very large revenue base for states. Uh, it also created a terrific revenue base in terms of advertising for the communications industry. What this means is that the industry support was quite varied and quite wide and diverse. Uh, that, uh, uh, the tobacco industry, uh, was, had the capacity to go to Congress and, uh, uh, find allies that would not be immediately intuitive.

Speaker 1:          29:01          So about seven and a half percent of their total advertising revenue, uh, had been associated with the tobacco industry at the time. So, uh, warnings, advertising and age restrictions, uh, between 1965 and 2008 became the key targets of Congress when they enacted six different statutes that they required that all packaging, uh, have labels on it. They required that, uh, uh, the advertisement of tobacco products through an electronic communication medium would be prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission. We're, we're also required a, these statutes require the secretary of Health and human services to report every three years to Congress on research findings concerning tobaccos addictive property. Uh, kind of curiously, you know, to combat the, the origin of the scientific studies, uh, occurring predominantly within the industry. The National Institute of Health started funding independent studies. Uh, so that, uh, just as, as you find in the pharmaceutical industry or in, uh, the, uh, uh, pesticide industry, uh, the, the conduct of independent science really became quite important to, to, uh, uh, the government's capacity to, to a amount of challenge, to be evidence that was presented by the industry itself.

Speaker 1:          30:18          Also, these statutes, uh, made states the receipt of certain federal block grants contingent upon their prohibiting tobacco product manufacturers, uh, a manufacturer or retailer or distributor from selling these products, uh, that included not just tobacco, not just a cigarettes, but also cigars and, and, uh, chewing tobacco to individuals under the age of 18. So what are the, uh, estimated health effects from tobacco, uh, irritation as well recognized lower respiratory infections, uh, are recognized. We're recognized early reduced lung function, increased risk, uh, uh, for asthma, an exacerbation of asthma among those that, uh, had it previously. Uh, non respiratory cancers, early onset of menopause, uh, also environmental tobacco smoke, uh, can cause brain tumors and cervical cancer. That's environmental tobacco smoke. That's not a smoke that's inhaled by the, by, uh, uh, the, the, uh, the smoker. There are really three different kinds of smoke a cigarette, uh, would, would produce, one is a smoke that's inhaled through the tobacco itself as it burns.

Speaker 1:          31:29          The other would be what's called sidestream smoke. That is given off by the burning tip a of the product. And the third would be the smoke. That's exhale. So each is a different complex of compounds, uh, between three and 4,000 different chemicals. Uh, so it's really been a, a very difficult task. Understanding which of these chemicals is responsible for which of these health effects. Uh, but this is, it's a, an interesting problem. It's similar in respect to diesel emissions, which is also a complex mixed here. Uh, so that the effect of the mixed year, uh, has been the subject of study, uh, uh, as opposed to the analysis of individual components in the, uh, in the mixture. So exposure during pregnancy, a harms of fetus, uh, and synergistic effects exist with radon. Uh, the natural gas that's given off by a granitic rock, uh, that we have here in Connecticut.

Speaker 1:          32:24          Uh, and, uh, the combination is known to cause lung cancer. Uh, environmental tobacco smoke has increasingly become a target of, uh, regulation and, and, uh, its relationship to heart disease, uh, is well supported by about 13 epidemiological studies. Uh, now 14. Uh, environmental tobacco smoke is responsible for other kinds of effects, uh, that include heart disease, uh, impairment of platelet function, damage to the inside lining of arteries, uh, interference with oxygen delivery and used by cells. And it can also depress cellular respiration and enhance fatty deposits on a vessel walls that can, uh, uh, exacerbate cardiovascular and neurological illnesses. In 1997, a Harvard Study of 32,000 nurses was released and found that the relative risk of coronary heart disease, uh, among those that smoke compared to those that did not, uh, it was about two. So the two fold increase of risk of heart disease among those that smoke, uh, and they attributed a 60,000 additional deaths each year in the United States, uh, to environmental tobacco smoke.

Speaker 1:          33:38          So that, uh, it wasn't until the 19, late 1990s at these estimates, uh, of health loss associated not from smoking, uh, but being in an environment where other smoked, uh, became quite sophisticated. 20 fold increase in death from lung cancer, uh, uh, was attributed to environmental tobacco smoke has stated, uh, or, uh, in EPA in 1992 passive smoking report, uh, William Riley was the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency at that point in time. Uh, and, uh, he also was a Yale graduate and a returns to, you know, quite often. And I spoke to him about his effort inside the environmental protection agency in the early 1990s to have environmental tobacco spoke, uh, declared to be a, a dangerous substance and more heavily regulated. And, uh, he thought that that was one of the most difficult fights that he had. His administrator, uh, during the, uh, uh, early 1990s.

Speaker 1:          34:35          But chemicals found inside tobacco smoke or all chemicals that, uh, uh, you recognize as a hazardous substances. Carbon monoxide, a nicotine carcinogenic tars, a ammonia and nitrogen dioxide, vinyl chloride, cyanide, formaldehyde radionuclides, benzene, nitrosamines [inaudible] aromatic hydrocarbons. Benzo, a Piring and arsenic. All of these compounds are the target of regulation under different statutes. So it's quite remarkable that, uh, uh, we've been allowed to, to a burn cigarettes in indoor environments. So why the Y has a indoor environmental quality and this problem has escaped the attention of the environmental protection agency. It really has to do with the private property rights and the perception of, of uh, being free from government regulation, uh, inside your own home or inside your own office. But it is quite curious. The question about who should pay for tobacco related illness has prompted a much more vigorous regulatory action and really was the basis for it for David Kessler is initiative inside the Food and Drug Administration, uh, that you read about in his book.

Speaker 1:          35:44          Question of intent. So in 1994 on new law was passed, authorizing the state of Florida, the sue cigarette manufacturers to recover their medicaid funds, used to treat people that had tobacco related illnesses. So states began to recognize that their expenditures to pay for these illnesses were enormous. They were in the multiple billion dollars per year. The law was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court. Uh, and as of 1997, 41 states banded together to sue the tobacco industry to recover these medicaid costs. The state settlement, as I mentioned earlier in the lecture, is estimated to be about $250 billion. Uh, additional private litigation has also gone on in different states against different corporations. Uh, states have also kind of interestingly borrowed against their anticipated tobacco payments. Uh, and, uh, uh, many believed that states have become addicted to the, uh, the tobacco money, uh, produced as a result. So that EPA in 1990, uh, began attacking a passive smoking as being causally associated with lung cancer in adults.

Speaker 1:          36:54          Uh, and it listed, uh, environmental tobacco smoke as a group A or a known human carcinogen. Uh, you may think this is kind of a modest difference in classification, uh, but there are relatively few known human carcinogens that are recognized by the National Cancer Institute. The Centers for Disease Control, the NRA International Agency for research on cancer, uh, and the World Health Organization. Uh, so that, uh, the listing of the product is a known human carcinogen, gave the government and increased, uh, a step that they could, uh, use to increase debt and powerful lever, that lever that they could use, uh, to, to, uh, step up, uh, their encouragement to prohibit tobacco products, uh, from being used in public buildings. EPA estimated in 1992 that as many as 3000 nonsmokers die from lung cancer every year, there are different roles that the EPA has played. And, uh, if EPA has been responsible for environmental tobacco smoke or secondhand smoke, the FDA has been thought of as the target for regulation.

Speaker 1:          37:59          Uh, and, uh, that story is told, I think very, very well by David Kessler. So that, uh, FDA's question really surrounded, uh, two, two issues. One, whether or not, uh, nicotine is considered to be a drug. A, because under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, uh, FDA, uh, eventually claimed jurisdiction, uh, based upon, uh, it's, it's finding the f that nicotine was a drug, uh, and if so, uh, than it needed to receive a license, uh, from the food and Drug Administration. And the second question is, uh, uh, under the statute is a cigarette itself, uh, or a cigar, a drug delivery device for the drug. And if he asks, it should be regulated in possibly prohibited under the statute. So this question about, uh, addiction is quite interesting. So if you look at, uh, a sales way to nicotine and tar levels and smoke a pack as early as 1982, uh, you found that, um, uh, has a, uh, a percentage of the 1992 level, uh, between 82 and in 1991, uh, that, uh, you find that the nicotine levels in cigarettes increased. Uh, the tar levels went down, uh, predominantly as a product of filtration, uh, but something was going on. Uh, and what was driving this increase in nicotine?

Speaker 1:          39:24          In fact, a curiously, the amount of nicotine, uh, in light brands, uh, that emerged during the 80s, 1990s, uh, were found to be higher than in the regular brands just didn't seem to make much sense. They also realize that if you pluck the tobacco leaves higher up on the stock, that they had a higher nicotine content, uh, in some species of plants. So that, uh, that meant that the, the tobacco growers, uh, the tobacco processors had the capacity to manipulate the nicotine level based upon the location on a stock that the leak was pluck from. So the question again that faced, uh, the food and Drug Administration, uh, was, isn't it nicotine a drug a, and here's a comment from a Sir Charles Ellis, uh, from the British American Tobacco Company Research Conference in, uh, uh, 1962. It's my conviction that nicotine is a very remarkable beneficence drug, uh, that both helps the body to resist external stress and also can, as a result show a pronounced tranquilizing effect.

Speaker 2:          40:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:30          Nicotine is not only a very fine drug. Uh, he continued, but the techniques of administration by smoking has considerable psychological advantage and the builtin control against excessive absorption.

Speaker 1:          40:43          We are then in the business of selling nicotine and addictive drug. Uh, by the way, these were, these were comments made at a private and confidential con conference, uh, that, uh, were eventually disclosed by the Food and Drug Administration, uh, in his discovery process. And, uh, you can read more about that. And the role that, uh, um, uh, deep cough played, uh, in, uh, giving, uh, the food and Drug Administration in particularly Kessler Guidance and, and, uh, how to get access to some of this information that was not in the public domain. Uh, he continued. We are, or the conviction that the ultimate explanation for the perpetuated cigarette habit habit resides in the pharmacological effect of smoke upon the body and the smoker. I think of a cigarette pack as a storage container for a day. Supply of nicotine. I think of a cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of Nicotine. I think of a puff of smoke, uh, as the vehicle for nicotine smoke is beyond question, the most optimized vehicle of nicotine. So going back to these original transcripts of meetings held within the tobacco industry, I'll Kessler felt that he had discovered yesterday believe that this was a, a drug. They believe that it was addictive. Uh, and they were thinking themselves that the, the, the, the, the cigarette and, uh, uh, cigar wrappers, uh, were drug delivery devices.

Speaker 1:          42:07          In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought of as a specialized, highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry. Again, this is Charlie. Claude Teague. Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine a potent drug, a with a variety of physiological effects. They also discovered that the companies were engaged in a plant breeding, crying to genetically engineer strains of tobacco plants, uh, that would produce higher levels of nicotine, uh, particularly a strain known as the y one nicotine, uh, stream. So the percentage nicotine, uh, in, uh, uh, why one was about threefold. The content of a normal flue cured tobacco, uh, and the ammonia, uh, they found was capable of liberating free nicotine from the blend in which it was associated, and it increased the impact of satisfaction. So adding ammonia, uh, as, uh, a chemical, uh, uh, component of the tobacco product a would increase the delivery of nicotine. So I'm going to stop there. We're just about at time and we'll come back to, uh, the more recent revisions to law are particularly the statute that was adopted, uh, last June and signed by President Obama and compare that statute to the food and Drug Administration's proposed regulations when Kessler was then the FDA commissioner. Thank you.
