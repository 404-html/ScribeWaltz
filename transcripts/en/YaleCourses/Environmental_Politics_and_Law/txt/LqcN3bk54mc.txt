Speaker 1:          00:01          This is one of my favorite topics in the course, food agriculture. And, uh, I'm, I'm deeply interested in, in everybody's personal connection to food. You are what you eat, you are what you breathe, you are what you drink. Um, and we often don't have a very good understanding of what's in our food, what's in our era and what's in our water. So hopefully this will sensitize you to that problem. Uh, and also to get you to understand, hopefully, uh, the structure of us environmental law that applies to food and agriculture. And this is an interesting area of law. Uh, food like plastics, like energy. It really does not have a distinctive, a specific body of law that applies to it as opposed to air and water, uh, or pesticides. So that's kind of curious. It's a problem that cuts across many different areas, many different types of regulation, uh, and the management of food in the U s and the management of agriculture is really fractured among a number of agencies.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Great Britain recently centralized their regulatory program and a created a single agency to manage food. How, and we'll think about the wisdom of doing that and some of the strengths and weaknesses of the European and British system. So to begin, I want you to think about the percentage of the world that, uh, is used to grow crops or degrades lives, livestock. So there are 30 billion acres of land in the world and about 4 billion acres of those are in cropland. So roughly about one seventh or, or one eighth of the world is used to grow crops within the United States. It's about 400 million acres of land. It's an enormous area and it's dispersed increasingly in a more remote areas. As cities grow, I had a suburb sprawl, um, and as farmers are pushed further and further away, and this has a really interesting and important implications for environmental quality and also for human health.

Speaker 1:          02:14          So here are four crops represented in these pictures a week in the upper left, uh, corn. Uh, many of you probably are unaware that a, on a daily basis, most of us consume cotton, uh, and a, a variety of foods without recognizing it. They really know in what form oil, cotton, seed oil. It's, it's part of a many pastries. Uh, many different kinds of cereals. Uh, so many breads rely on don cotton seed oil and, and the bottom rice. These are four major grains in the world, uh, that, that uh, uh, uh, uh, take up a hundreds of millions of acres of landscape. Corn alone in the United States is almost 80 million acres that is currently planted. Increasingly in the United States, farm size is increasing, meaning that there are fewer and fewer farmers. And a surprisingly, the diversity of crops that are planted on individual farms is also going down.

Speaker 1:          03:14          So what that means is that farming is becoming more highly specialized, uh, that uh, uh, farmers are knowledgeable about fewer crops. Uh, they have less capacity to manage problems such as a past, a fun guy, a insects of different sorts because they really don't have the fundamental understanding of ecology that many farmers had to have in order to survive in a world, uh, that, uh, was not as chemically dependent as as ours is. Current industrialized agriculture could be successful on a parking lot. If you brought in soil and you brought in fertilizer and you brought in water and a artificially, uh, uh, added organic matter. Uh, so basically the more you control your environment, a using industrial technology, the more expensive it becomes a, but the less you have to worry about understanding of college. So it's curious that, uh, uh, you know, as centralization is occurred in ownership patterns, the farm's got larger. The Crop, uh, specialty diminished our dietary patterns. It followed a similar, a similar pattern. We've relied on fewer and fewer crops. So now that most people's diet is comprised of a between 30 to 40 different, uh, individual crops.

Speaker 1:          04:33          So I want to talk today about what the central problems in food and agriculture are. Uh, and these include food availability. And I think most of us understand that, uh, the, the role of government is often been perceived as one of trying to make sure that we have a productive food supply, uh, that, uh, our agriculture is as productive as it possibly could be so we could maximize our exports to other countries. Uh, so that our balance of trade would be helped. But also so we could deal with under nourished in impoverished parts of the world that did not have the capacity to grow food for whatever reason. Food prices are going up, particularly in the last decade. They've, they've taken up an increasing percentage of the average household income, meaning that people are looking to buy a lower cost foods and lower cost foods are often higher calorie foods.

Speaker 1:          05:22          They're often foods that come and bulk packages. Uh, so people are more prone to, to buy a, the, the leap the leader and a half bottles of soda than they would a individual cans. And that had, has had an influence on patterns of food consumption. As I mentioned, species dependence has gone down. We're relying on on fewer and fewer crops. Uh, we're genetically engineering those crops. More and more. A very high proportion of corn that's planted in the United States is genetically engineered. The same goes for the other major greens that we produce. Also a serious problem that we have is that a, our, our tastes are being cultivated by other organizations, particularly food processors, uh, that, uh, are, are adding ingredients that we don't really pay much attention to in terms of fat, in terms of salt, in terms of, of sugar and a variety of artificial flavors and colors that, uh, uh, they do a very careful, uh, social surveys to understand what kinds of tastes, what kinds of colors, what kinds of flavors, uh, people enjoy the most.

Speaker 1:          06:26          I use the example of the Salmo Fan. Uh, so that salmon is now colored in 30 dash 35 to 36 different shades, uh, ranging from a really deep red to a, uh, a very light coral. Uh, so they, they did a, their focus groups and, and, uh, conducted surveys and figured out that that most people like a number 33, uh, so that, uh, that type of thinking is pervading the food industry. Uh, we as buyers tend to respond. We respond by by, uh, uh, basically, uh, looking for the lower cost foods, but also those that, that, uh, uh, seem to, to provide either a taste or, or some other aesthetic appeal. We also are consuming more calories than we ever have before. Uh, we are consuming on average in the United States, about 3,900 calories per person. Uh, only 15 years ago we were consuming about 3,200 calories a and that's up from, uh, uh, perhaps, uh, uh, 27, 2,800 calories per person.

Speaker 1:          07:30          And the average shear person with the average wait, say 165 pound a male could survive extremely well on a, on a diet of about 2,400 calories per day. Now, this would vary tremendously. I know some of you are athletes. Some of you may run 10 miles a day, some of you may swim four or five miles a day. Uh, those of you that, that to exercise a great deal, we'll obviously need a, a much more, uh, a much higher caloric intake. But, uh, uh, if you combine knowledge about what's happened to our behavior in our increasingly sedentary lifestyles, uh, sitting behind computers, watching video games, the latest report came out only last week demonstrating the kids are now spending seven hours a day looking at electronic equipment of ones, one form or another. Uh, this is really quite striking. Uh, my generation, we had a, we had televisions, uh, but, uh, you know, television wasn't that big a thing when I grew up.

Speaker 1:          08:26          And, uh, we, we spent a whole lot more time outdoors. People are spending time indoors or they're not a burning up, uh, as much, uh, energy as they used to. Uh, so we're all putting on weight, water consumption, water consumption, especially in arid parts of the world. Uh, irrigation a necessary for agriculture. This is a critical problem, particularly related to climate change, uh, which, uh, uh, is causing experts to predict that, that, uh, uh, it's going to be increasingly expensive to move water into dryer, uh, environments. Meaning that it's going to be a core requirement to ship those foods from longer distances, uh, demanding higher energy. Most of us don't really have much knowledge of the energy it takes to produce a, say a, a, a bowl, a piece as opposed to a bowl of oatmeal or a, a a stake. And that's quite curious.

Speaker 1:          09:21          The amount of energy, uh, that obviously increases with distance from the source of production to the source of consumption. Uh, but we really don't pay any attention to that and we don't have any way of, of, uh, uh, measuring it. This, by the way, would be a terrific term paper if somebody still thinking about a research topic for the course. Just take one food. Uh, just take apples, figure out where apples are produced in the world, uh, figure out, uh, uh, where Yale buys it's apples and try to come up with a metric for the energy involved in moving an apple, uh, from point of production to the point of consumption. So you know, you, you could imagine a society, uh, decades into the future, uh, where you could take your iPhone and you could walk up to a grocery store shelf and you know, you could hold the, the Barcode on the food are on the side of the shelf next to your phone and you could call up information on where the food came from.

Speaker 1:          10:12          A, you could call it information on its energy. Uh, was it produced using artificial chemicals, uh, or uh, what kinds of fertilizers were used to produce it so that we could get a whole new level of understanding of, uh, energy and, uh, the environmental health of our different products, including issues such as a protein content and fat content type of fat, a amount of salt, et cetera. Right now, most of us walk through the marketplace, uh, really blind to these issues, uh, blinds to the environmental effects of, of food production, a blind to also to the energy consumption. We also have very little understanding of food processing and I want you to think about a couple of commodities that you experience on a routine basis. You take cotton, for example, that I just showed you, a picture of a cotton is a cotton seeds are put into a machine.

Speaker 1:          11:06          Uh, they are ground up. Uh, then there are, are sprayed by a solvent. The solvent extracts the oils and the oil drips down into, into vats. Uh, it gets mixed with other kinds of vegetable oils and ends it's way, uh, of winds its way into, into supermarkets. How about grapes while grapes have water extracted from them? Uh, and they are turned into raisins. Uh, uh, you can think of a variety of different foods. Corn as another example, a oil is extracted from corn. How is it done? It's done using a solvent. But what happens to the solvent? Where does it go? Or there residues of the solvent in corn oil. And the answer is often yes, the residents do, uh, uh, persist. They do get into, into the food supply. Uh, but we have very little understanding of what happens to food when it leaves the farm on its way to, uh, to our dinner table.

Speaker 1:          11:56          Food packaging is a topic that we'll take on a, in a few weeks. Uh, particularly with respect to plastics and the absence of our understanding, the, the origin of the plastic or the content of the plastic, the energy that it takes to produce the plastic is really quite striking. Uh, all of the plastic waste that surrounds most of the meats that are produced and available in grocery stores is thrown away. And there's almost no hope that any of that plastic is ever recycled. It's simply discarded and it's burned. Uh, and many of the plastics contain chemicals that you really don't want to breathe, or if they're buried in landfills, they will leach. They will break down gradually and they will leach into soils and underlying water supplies. Uh, and as I mentioned in an earlier lecture in every landfill, uh, among the 300,000 that exists in the nation, you can find these residues of plastic in the soil and the underlying what groundwater supply.

Speaker 1:          12:49          So the key environmental and health problems associated with our methods of food production, uh, include pesticides. Uh, and I'll talk a bit about pesticides today and the structure of pesticide law. Uh, there are now some 25,000 pesticides, uh, that are, are, uh, packaged in different ways and sold in different combinations. In the United States alone in the world marketplace, there are 75,000 different pesticide products that had been registered by different nations. How about fertilizers? When some parts of the world human waste is used as fertilizers, animal waste is used, but also there are a fossil fuel based fertilizers that are, are, are very common. So increasingly we find fertilizer, uh, being used as farmers, uh, continually plant and replant the same field. They don't let let it lie fallow. They don't plant crops that can fix nitrogen into the soil. Uh, so that, uh, they have to, they have to add an order to officially coloring agents.

Speaker 1:          13:52          Most of you probably do not pay too much attention to coloring agents in your food. But there's a very interesting history of coloring agents and different nations have different laws and some, some of these agents are natural, others are artificial. Uh, but, uh, uh, that, that would be another great paper topic. Just take a, take a, a look carefully at what we know about different kinds of chemicals that are used to color foods, flavors, a, also artificial flavors and natural flavors. Uh, what do you know about them? They do not have to be labeled under federal food law. Uh, so natural flavors is a, uh, a, an umbrella category. Uh, artificial flavors also is, and uh, uh, this is a huge industry. If you decided you wanted to produce, say a, a, a new concoction, maybe it would be a coconut flavored, uh, apple sauce will, you could basically get a, uh, some sort of pureed fruit, uh, of different sorts.

Speaker 1:          14:51          Maybe pair, maybe apple, maybe peaches. You can ground it out and grind the popup and uh, by processing it, you'd likely lose all the flavor. So you'd have to figure out how to put the flavor back into it. Well, you could do that really easily. I encourage you to go online and take a look at the, uh, international flavors and fragrances institute. Uh, and it will give you a list of firms, chemical companies all over the world. That will will allow you to say, yes, I want to make, make a, a, a coconut lime apple sauce or a, uh, uh, a root beer flavored chewing gum. Uh, they will give you the, uh, the, uh, chemical company's name, and they will provide you with the, the essence is necessary, uh, to create the product. Also, you may not know, but a fragrances are commonly used in food because fragrances will trigger the same, uh, nerve response, uh, in your mouth and in your mind that the flavors will trigger.

Speaker 1:          15:43          So to create a sense that you're eating, say, root beer flavored oatmeal, uh, they could simply use a, a, a drop of, of a fragrance to give you that impression. So packaging materials processing affects a contamination of air, water, and food on genetic modification. These are all critical, highly debated topics, uh, around the world, given the fact that many nations have different standards. Whereas the marketplace, the global marketplace clearly is, is uh, uh, moving commodities at a, at a lightening pace, across national boundaries, creating serious legal problems, uh, for firms that to have to understand, uh, the, the difficulty, the difficult, uh, uh, a problem of, of having different regulations in different countries and there are deeper, deeper problems here associated with the food supply. And they include a really a fractured legal and regulatory responsibility. And I'll, I'll talk more about that in a few moments.

Speaker 1:          16:44          A private science, the fact that the majority of science that underlies a understanding the, the, uh, environmental effects, the health effects, uh, the energy consumption required in order to produce and move food, uh, the, the energy required to a, to deal with the waste that the science is being conducted in the private sector. It's often not available to the public sector. So trade secrecy laws is quite important in this case. Uh, and that it often prevents you from understanding in detail what you'd really need to know in order to take control over your own diet. Worker safety is another deeper problem that we don't pay much attention to. If you look at, uh, the, uh, the farm, the farm worker poisoning data becomes apparent that, uh, uh, workers are often, uh, not well-protected. They're often, uh, uh, uh, not monitored. They often do not have, uh, uh, insurance and, uh, uh, health care, uh, so that, uh, it's a neglected population.

Speaker 1:          17:45          Migrant workers traditionally have been exploited in a, almost every nation in the world. But even in our, our country where we think we have highly sophisticated law, uh, workers really are not protected nearly the same as you or I would be, so that there are different standards for allowable risk, uh, for workers than there are four. For a Uri say, uh, from purchasing food in, in the marketplace. Uh, different contamination limits. Uh, another deeper problem is the narrative advantage of the producers. If you look at the scale of the advertising industry and their, their methods of advertising and this wall. So it would be a great topic for a paper on what are their, what are their tonic dominant test strategies? Uh, how do they make claims of a product benefit, uh, either that it is natural, that it is helpful, how far can they go and what laws restrict what they can claim.

Speaker 1:          18:39          What about their requirements to, uh, disclose risks that are known to be associated with, with their foods. So it's, it's interesting that the organic food industry evolved basically, uh, growing from a strategy that, that, uh, uh, proclaims that a certain class of chemicals is not present in the food supply. So synthetic organic pesticides are not allowed to be used, uh, in organic foods. Now that doesn't mean that those that are producing nonorganic foods have to label what synthetic organic chemicals are in their food. So you can think about different legal strategies that might be employed in order to provide the consumer with knowledge that would be really necessary to understand what they're reading. Uh, public subsidies also a are a worthy topic for somebody interested in trying to transform the, the, uh, international food system. So, uh, if you, uh, look at the subsidies carefully, and you can do this now because there was a group in Washington called the environmental working group that put together a terrific website.

Speaker 1:          19:48          Uh, so you can go to the website and you can find your home state and your county or your town and you can figure out which farmers are getting which subsidies. Uh, and what you'll see is that that, uh, industrialized a commodities such as corn and wheat and cotton, uh, they're receiving the bulk of the subsidies in the nation as opposed to the organic farmers or farmers that are beyond organic, uh, who basically receive no subsidy. So that, uh, you know, government funds could be used to, to innovate, to, to really transform, uh, the structure of, of agriculture in the nation. Uh, but, uh, uh, this is not likely in the near future a land values, uh, how to land values play into the pattern of farming and agriculture that, that we currently see. Well, you know, what I suggested earlier in the talk was that, uh, you know, as urban areas and suburban areas, a sprawl out into undeveloped lands are they commonly will cause property values in lands that are nearby to increase the commercial value there.

Speaker 1:          20:53          They're a residential value or their industrial value, uh, may shoot up quite quickly as a, as a city expands. So that a, the value of the, of the land, uh, from the, uh, and in terms of its productivity for different crops often can't compete with this rising, uh, uh, property value. Uh, so that, that the farmer sells out. Also the agricultural land, uh, it's flat generally. Uh, it, it also is, is, uh, uh, not forested. And what this means is that a, it's really easy to develop. So you can imagine the, uh, the problem of, of developing in a forested area. Uh, it's much more expensive for land development. So you find the rate of transformation of farmland, uh, from, from, uh, uh, especially in the rural parts of the u s, uh, that, uh, are in the target zone for urban expansion. Uh, these lands are being shifted into, into residential and commercial use at a very rapid rate.

Speaker 1:          21:54          So, uh, the fundamental problem that I think we face right now is, is one of intelligence. And I don't mean to imply that a, it's an absence of capacity to understand these things. It's, it's an absence of producing the knowledge and making it publicly accessible to consumers in a way that a really could empower you to, to react in the marketplace in a way that would send messages back to corporations. Uh, messages that I think really are often much more powerful and, uh, often more listened to than messages sent by regulators. So I'd like you to think about corn and ethanol for just a moment. And, uh, the, the increasing subsidy for the production of ethanol, uh, that, uh, you know, will oxygenate fuels and a is, is a required by a different levels of government, including the environmental protection agency as a way of improving air quality. Uh, but, uh, what is increasingly apparent is that, uh, uh, the ethanol in subsidy has caused, uh, uh, corn prices to rise quite dramatically. Uh, because more of the farmers are putting these ethanol production plants on their property and they're not shutting the corn into the food supply. Now, there also was an, uh, an over abundance of enthusiasm among the farmers to produce the ethanol. So the ethanol market, uh, started to collapse. Uh, and, uh, this is, uh, this is hurt the farmers throughout the United States.

Speaker 1:          23:32          Think now about the one area, uh, and, uh, the area of chemical application, uh, particularly pesticides. Uh, this is an interesting area in that, uh, it, it, it demands that you think about a real variety of laws. Uh, the Federal Food Drug and cosmetic act on the top here, the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and the Food Quality Protection Act. These are the dominant statutes in the United States that apply to a pesticide, uh, control, uh, but other laws as well, uh, are necessary to understand and have some, some control over, uh, pesticides including the safe drinking water act. And other words, one would need to worry about the application of billions of pounds of pesticides in the United States every year. Uh, because the pesticides the often don't just go away. Uh, they, they often will move down through soils and into groundwater supplies. Uh, so, uh, we'll talk a bit later in the, in the week about, uh, the, the problem with managing, uh, drinking water quality by the way, uh, the government, uh, uh, in its food intake surveys, uh, concludes that the number one food that everybody eats in the United States is water.

Speaker 1:          24:45          Water is classified as a food under the food, drug and cosmetic act. Uh, so that, uh, worrying about a water contamination is a really important issue and understanding the way that a chemical release into the atmosphere as well as into a, on to plants in, into the landscape, uh, that that could contaminate drinking water even if it goes through a filtration plant, uh, that, uh, often is the case for many urban areas. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, uh, that we talked a bit about last week and Super Fund. Uh, most of these sites have pesticides within them and they are classified as hazardous sites in part because of the pesticides that are there. But pesticides were in the, uh, recites in the circle of sites on VA case. Uh, predominantly, uh, chemicals that are persistent were, were applied back in the 30s, forties, and 50s. The toxic substance control act does deal with pesticides.

Speaker 1:          25:42          The Hazardous Material Transportation Act does as well. National Environmental Policy Act that a, we talked about last week, endangered species act if you have a, an endangered species, uh, that, uh, and it's habitat has been defined. It's a normally illegal to apply pesticides, uh, in that, in that Habitat, uh, the Wilderness Act would prevent pesticides from being applied within its boundaries. Uh, and the manufacturer of pesticides often produces a airborne resumes that are regulated under the Clean Air Act. Uh, and also the release via pipes from those plants, uh, uh, is regulated under the clean water act. Uh, but as well, uh, you can imagine the problem of spraying chemicals year after year and a landscape, uh, and then, uh, you have, uh, rainstorms coming in the spring. Give you a good example of that. Atrazine, which is an herbicide, it's a pre emergent herbicides. So they plant the corn, but before the corn sprouts, they'll spray the landscape, the atrazine often in the spring.

Speaker 1:          26:46          Uh, so always in the spring, actually in particularly in the Midwest, uh, after the spring rains come, you can measure as it spikes in atrazine, in the Mississippi River and most of the mid Western rivers and these rivers in the Midwest provide water supplies for tens of millions of people. Uh, and the filtration of the plants will not take it out. So both the clean water act and the safe drinking water act come into play in that case. And the Occupational Safety and Health Act also is designed to protect a worker safety. Uh, but as I said earlier, it often sets standards that are far above standards that are, are set for a non worker environments. So it's a very complicated body of law. But for this reason, pesticides becomes a good, a good window to, to understand law. Uh, one way to think about this is that it's driven by two, two things really.

Speaker 1:          27:40          One is that pesticides are intentionally toxic substances. They're not, they're not like, say, just some new chemical that somebody designs a, you know, for, uh, to, to be added to a, to plastic to make it stronger. Uh, that wasn't designed, uh, to, uh, to kill a different species. It was designed to provide some functionality, but pesticides is a group of chemicals, uh, were specifically designed to injure either a plant, uh, an insect, a, some other species. In fact, some of the nerve gases that were designed to during World War II and, and, uh, uh, in the 1920s by Great Britain and Germany, Nazi Germany, they were designed specifically to harm humans. And many of these nerve gases have been diluted down, uh, for agricultural purposes. Uh, so that, uh, all species have been targets, uh, for the development of this class of biocides. It's number one, they're intentionally toxic substances.

Speaker 1:          28:37          And number two, to get their effect, they've got to be released to the environment in, in great quantities. So you release a chemical or the environment, uh, the atomic weapons testing history tells us you better understand something about where it goes. And pesticide history is replete with examples where people paid too little attention. Now I want to, I want to step back and take you into the earlier part of the century and I want you to think about a, a, a very serious problem, uh, at that point in time and a problem that persistent and that's malaria. Malaria is a, an illness that's transmitted by a parasite. Uh, it's, uh, the Anopheles mosquito and a, all of its, all of its variance, uh, had the capacity to take the parasite up from the blood of an infected animal or an uninfected human. So if a, if you had malaria and an inset came and landed on you, uh, the monopolies mosquito would first spit a little bit of an anticoagulant through its proboscis into your, into your body to, uh, uh, help you bleed a little bit, uh, and then it will suck your blood, uh, into its stomach cavity.

Speaker 1:          29:53          Uh, and with that blood, it would pull in malaria parasites that are in your body than perhaps a, I didn't have assume I didn't have malaria. That mosquito flew over and landed on me. Uh, it would bite me and, uh, when it would insert it's anticoagulant, uh, in its saliva in me, they would transmit parasites into my body. And that's the way that this illness is transmitted from person to person. The parasite, uh, uh, has the capacity to live for nine to 11 days inside the body of a mosquito and the sea, kind of an interesting issue that, that, uh, the encephalitis virus last from 10 to 25 days. And, uh, thank God the Aids virus, uh, lasts only one to two days, so that the, the longevity of, of different viruses or bacteria or parasites inside different in insects, uh, affects the rate of transmission.

Speaker 1:          30:45          So I want you to, to also understand the scale of this problem in the world. And today there are about between 300 and 500 million people, uh, that are clinically disabled by malaria, meaning that they want, they're walking around with this parasite in their bodies that is sapping them of energy, that is giving them periodic fevers, uh, that makes them more susceptible to other kinds of illnesses. Uh, and 40% of the world's population live in areas that, that are at risk, meaning that the mosquitoes in that area are capable of transmitting the parasite. And you've got a large population percentage that, uh, uh, uh, also is carrying the parasite and their bodies. The, the core of the problem for malaria in the world is, is really, uh, in tropical regions and, and, uh, particularly in Africa where 90% of the incidents and mortality a exist. And, uh, the, the estimate right now by the World Health Organization is that roughly one to one and a half million people die every year from malaria.

Speaker 1:          31:41          And the estimate over the 20th century is about a hundred million people have died from this illness. It's quite striking that many people have not understood the scale of this problem. So it's also clear if you read much military history that a malaria was a very serious problem in all wars. So that if you go back to at the time of, uh, uh, Napoleon, or if you look at the, the, uh, uh, history of world war one or World War II, as, as us or other countries moved into tropical parts of the world, a more casualties commonly occurred, more lost days, uh, among, among a gis occurred due to malaria than it did to the direct effects of casualties. There are also susceptible populations, kids in endemic areas. Uh, uh, although in epidemics all age groups are affected, uh, refugees and migrant populations and those living in tents such those that are, are, uh, fighting and in the armed conflict, it's all related to heightened exposure being, being out in, in an environment where, uh, you're, you're exposing yourself to being bitten by infected insects.

Speaker 1:          32:53          So you could also imagine that those, that, that work in mines or those that work in forestry and tropical parts of the world or, or agricultural workers, they are also more at risk. People that spend a timeout to outdoors in the tropics in endemic areas are more at risk, as are those with reduced immunity who has reduced immunity while pregnant women. Pregnant women are extremely susceptible to a very serious illness from, from pregnancy and also miscarriages. Uh, also the, the very young young children, those that are already had their immune system compromised or in parts of, of, uh, uh, the poorest parts of the world. Uh, you often have the background high incidents of acute respiratory infections or diarrheal diseases that reduces a strength and immunity and makes one more susceptible to to this illness. Well, one of the ways of controlling malaria included pesticides.

Speaker 1:          33:49          Uh, and here's an example of a worker in 1939 and an outbreak in natal Brazil when a mosquito actually hitchhiked from Africa on a mail boat and an athlete Gambi a mosquito, uh, not, not, uh, uh, indigenous to, to Brazil. And so they finally figured out that it hitchhiked on this mail freighter, uh, was able to, to, uh, uh, are, are a number of them did. And they were able to establish a, uh, uh, a fairly large and robust population that it occurred during a rainy season when they had exactly the right pool of water standing on, on the areas. Uh, some mosquitoes actually are interesting and that they prefer a streams or rivers that are, are moving really quickly is habitat. Others like very Stillwater, others like shallow water, uh, so that, uh, there are hundreds and hundreds of different species of mosquitoes capable of transmitting, uh, these, these illnesses such as malaria or dengue fever, yellow fever.

Speaker 1:          34:50          So that understanding the ecology here is really important. Uh, one way of dealing with the problem and not understanding the ecology is basically to simply spray broad areas and landscape with pesticides, which is what they did in this case. Uh, when US troops invaded a islands in the Pacific, in the, in the war against Japan, uh, in the mid 1940s, the incidents among a US gis was often 3000 per thousand per year as it was reported, meaning that everybody on the island had on average, uh, malaria at least three times so that the casualty rates here caused them to have to move troops in and out of the island much more rapidly than they normally would have. The development of the chlorine industry, uh, is a very important part of this story because chlorine is a key component of many pesticides that were developed in the 1940s, uh, including DDT.

Speaker 1:          35:50          A chlorinated hydrocarbons, uh, include, uh, Alderman Dieldrin have to Clore chlordane, uh, chemicals. Uh, curiously the became the target of the environmental protection agency as soon as it was formed in the 1970s. And why is that? Well, because all of the properties that made strontium 90 a dangerous compound, it persisted. It moved widely through the environment. It will contaminate virtually every compartment, uh, and it would build up in food chains, marine food chains, as well as, as a, uh, an ecosystems, uh, in terrestrial ecosystems. It would get in people's bodies and it will be transmitted via breastmilk across generations. So the search was on, uh, during this explosion in the chemical industry in the 1940s, uh, for a variety of new chemicals that would replace the older metals like Paris Green. Uh, in the previous shot here, this gentleman is mixing Paris Green, which is arsenic. He's mixing it by hand and he's just basically just throwing it out across a stream so that the, the heavy metals used earlier in the century were replaced by the chlorinated hydrocarbons.

Speaker 1:          37:03          And gradually they figured out that a DDT in particular was exceptionally effective at controlling the Paris, the insects that would transmit the parasite, uh, that, uh, uh, is malaria that causes malaria. Uh, so this was first tried a, as refugees moved through Europe during World War II. And here's an example of taking basically a variant on a bicycle pump and taking a hose. And, and uh, the drill that was followed was a, there was one shot down the back of the neck. There was one shot, uh, down, uh, the, the, the waistband and then up into the lower part of the shirt, front and back, and then up both of the pant legs. So that tens of thousands of people were lined up in Rome, walking through these stations as people that were, were sanitation workers, then, uh, would basically man these pumps in spray people. This, this attempt, uh, brought the typhus epidemic, uh, that is transmitted by, by fleas to a close, uh, extremely rapidly within a matter of a couple of weeks when it was anticipated to, to go on for, for months, if not years.

Speaker 1:          38:09          Another example of a child at the time being sprayed. So gradually, uh, they recognize the DDT would kill so many different species, uh, that it was sprayed across marsh lands and landscapes and they realized a, at the end of World War II that they should also release it for agricultural purposes. So by 1950, a DDT was being marketed as a, uh, an effective way to control pests that would threatened just about every crop. You could imagine more than 300 different crops. Uh, critical components of us agriculture, uh, were recommended to be, to be treated by, by this single chemical. So Ddt is good for me. Uh, there's a little jingle that went along with this that kids would sing. There was no understanding of, of its bioaccumulation capacity. Uh, even though they understood that they only had to spray it once in an area, uh, and whereas other compounds, they would have to kind of come back and keep on spraying.

Speaker 1:          39:04          So, uh, I'll tell that story in just a moment. But, uh, uh, here's another example of Jones beach in New York, uh, where the, the county, uh, public health department is driving down the beach. Uh, and, uh, uh, the sign that is on the side of the struck this truck, you can't read it, I'm sure, but it's telling it, it says DDT powerful insecticide, harmless to humans. Very little understanding of what they were doing. A kids were running down, people eating their hamburgers. A trucks would come by, kids would be sitting at picnic tables, the picnic table, all the food, and, and, uh, the kids included would be sprayed very little understanding of kind of the basic ecology of this compound. So it persists in the soil. It was later discovered 10 to 35 years and in the atmosphere, uh, for three years. And that, just as an aside, uh, they decided that they were going to just test the air just by chance.

Speaker 1:          40:00          Somebody said, well, you know, this is a ridiculous thing to do. Uh, but, uh, 30 meters off the ocean on a freighter, a halfway between San Francisco and Tokyo, uh, they took air measurements and found that a DDT was present in the air in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and that there was a latitudinal gradient gradient. So that as you approach the equator, you would have a higher concentration of Ddt, uh, then if you moved away. And why was that? Well, it's because of the increased number of pests that you get closer to the equator and tropical parts of the world. Uh, led those nations to springboard EDT, uh, both for sanitation, public health purposes, but also for crop protection purposes was also found in human tissues. Uh, and it probably is still detectable in your tissue. And in fact, I was looking at the food and Drug Administration's a records on pesticide residues in the food supply.

Speaker 1:          40:51          It's kind of striking and that, uh, uh, even today, DDT is, is one of the most detected chemicals in the u s food supply, particularly in milk products, uh, at very, very low levels. But it's a good indicator of the longterm persistence of this compound and why we need to pay attention to that. Also, uh, like strontium, it was detected in breast milk, uh, meaning that, uh, if, if you were breastfed, uh, your mom probably had a higher concentration, uh, then, uh, uh, you do. But, uh, any body burden that you've got is coming from, uh, probably, uh, just a stores from your, your mom because it's compound binds to body fat. It's Lipophilic as opposed to hydrophylic. Uh, and, and, uh, uh, that's the, uh, that's the way that a, you'd be exposed. Your grandmother probably hadn't residues far higher than, uh, than your mother.

Speaker 1:          41:42          But this kind of transgenerational effect is, is quite curious. In 1971, uh, the effort to regulate it was, was really pioneered by Vermont of Vermont, passed a law banning DDT use and the state. And they had formerly been spraying it on their force to control for Gypsy Moss, uh, that, that was followed in Wisconsin in 1970 by a black man in New York in 1971 by a band. And finally, I'm actually the British also, uh, decided that, uh, uh, this was not a problem that uh, uh, the, the support for agriculture and the control of public health was so important that it should be continued to be used. Whereas the Soviet found that, uh, it was worthy of a band that came out strongly in favor of a band. Finally, in 1972, I remember EPA was created in 1969. Uh, it actually physically came into being in 1970 [inaudible] 1972, uh, William Ruckelshaus, who was the former administrator of the environmental protection agency, decided that they should move ahead because of the effects on wildlife, uh, but also the, the, uh, cancer threat to humans, uh, he felt was sinking it significant enough to justify its regulation.

Speaker 1:          42:59          And I know you can't read this, but, uh, uh, there's an interesting phrase and this is on the, uh, uh, in the New York Times, uh, that, uh, effective December 31st, 1972, uh, in the meantime, he explained growers and cotton, peanuts, soybeans, uh, the three crops that account for almost the total domestic use of DDT, uh, will get instructions in the handling of a substitute pesticide methyl parathyroid on the substitute is, uh, can't really read, Oh, is nontoxic. Uh, but unlike DDT, uh, it degrades quickly, so they're trading off a persistent chemical, uh, uh, for one that degrades quite quickly, not really understanding what the longterm effect might be. Curiously, uh, the company that manufactured the companies that manufactured DDT, uh, said to themselves, well, you know, is there a way that we could modify the chemical structure of the compound a and s sell something that would be a minor variant?

Speaker 1:          43:56          Uh, and they produced a compound known as known as Dika fall. Uh, that was the only a little bit different. And, uh, low and behold, uh, in all the parts of the country, uh, where Dika fall was sprayed, they found similar effects in wildlife, particularly among a large raptors. Uh, so in the, in the south west were an in the south that were cotton is grown. They found it being, they found Daggerfall building up just the way DDT had a, so it was Lipophilic, it was bioaccumulative and, and, uh, uh, basically, uh, became equally worrisome to the environmental protection agency. So they banned DDT and 82 and [inaudible] 72, uh, they got around to recognizing that, uh, uh, not only was Dika fall, uh, having the same effects, but it also is contaminated by DDT at a level of about 15%. Uh, and that they needed to get that chemical out of the food plies in and out of the, uh, uh, environment as well.

Speaker 1:          44:52          So it took until 1986 for them to actually, uh, uh, move ahead with a regulation and then to work its way out of production took until the early 1990s. So this is the band that wasn't a band, the band that took effect in [inaudible] 72 that really was not effective until the early 1990s. Now, if you then jump ahead, fast forward to 1999, uh, you'll see that EPA is getting around to studying methyl [inaudible] on the recommended substitute by William Ruckelshaus. In 1972, uh, he decided, oh, well, in 1999, uh, EPA decided this chemical is more dangerous than we thought. In fact, [inaudible] is responsible for more farm worker deaths and poisoning than any other chemical in history. Uh, not only is it a far more acutely toxic than DDT, but, uh, it, uh, also persisted longer than they believed. So one of the, uh, uh, concerns that we have today is, you know, what are we going to do with respect to the persistence of malaria, uh, but also it's likely migration into parts of the world, uh, where it had been well controlled.

Speaker 1:          46:01          And if you look at, uh, where malaria, uh, exists now, you'll see that, that, uh, uh, malaria is a problem predominantly in the tropical parts of the world, also the poorest parts of the world. Uh, and you'll see that, uh, it's the expected range of malaria, of, of the different species of mosquitoes that carry it. Uh, it's widening. It's, it's widening right now in response to, to a changing climatic conditions so that the habitat is becoming more favorable for disease transmission. Now, the World Health Organization, uh, recognize this and they called together a group of people that, uh, were expert in pesticides. And I worked on pesticides for maybe, uh, uh, 15 years and worked with a group of about seven other people, uh, some from African nations to try to understand how to manage malaria, particularly in Africa, who had gone along with the bands of EPA.

Speaker 1:          46:51          And most other high income nations in the world, uh, and had phased it out. It did not recommend the use of DDT in any part of the world as of the mid 1970s, but they want it to reconsider this because it was so inexpensive and it was so, it was so effective. Uh, in part because it was so persistent, they realized that if it was sprayed both indoors and outdoors, it would cause the insects to evolve resistance strains, uh, that would be harder and harder for them to manage. Uh, in fact, many mosquitoes have developed a resistance to, to, uh, a DVT so that they sprayed it on a wall inside a house. Uh, the Anopheles mosquito would land on the wall, but it could sense it, it through its feet, uh, and it would take off and that's it. So it's a new behavioral response that prevented it from absorbing a lethal dose.

Speaker 1:          47:40          So gradually the World Health Organization, uh, became concerned about increasing incidents of malaria, uh, particularly in Africa, uh, and convene this group to try to figure out whether or not it made sense, uh, to, to get behind a DDT and, and to, to, uh, uh, use it again and the next most effective pesticide cost four times the level of DDT. Uh, so this was a problem and, uh, the, the aid agencies were not willing to pay this increased expense, so that, that, uh, uh, who, uh, finally in 2006, uh, gave DDT a clean bill of health, so to speak, even though this group of experts, uh, that, uh, uh, convened in, in 2004, uh, this group found that, well, you know, using DDT is really not a good idea. You should use a less toxic chemical and one that has less persistent, uh, that would be equally effective. Uh, even though it costs more. So it's a matter of finding the money in order to pay for the chemical that would protect human health, uh, and, uh, uh, environmental quality at the same time. It would deal with the malaria problem. So, uh, I'm at time and I'm going to stop there and we'll come back on Thursday and take a closer look at the variety of laws that applied to food safety in the nation. Thank you.
