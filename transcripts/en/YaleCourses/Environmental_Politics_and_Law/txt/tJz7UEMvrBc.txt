Speaker 1:          00:01          Today, I want to continue talking about a tobacco because tobacco law is a paradigm for many other problems that, uh, uh, we discussed, uh, but also, um, demonstrates a difficulties of managing the relationship, uh, between, uh, freedom of choice and, and, uh, uh, freedom of speech as well as a managing certain kinds of hazards in the environment. And I want it to go to a, refresh your memory about this idea that, that uh, this industry evolved with a clear recognition that, uh, the product that they were selling was not aesthetically appealing on its own. Uh, so the idea that you would have to create a cultural preference for the product is really intriguing. It, uh, think about a, if you are a corporate leader and you were trying to figure out how to invest your, your finances to increase your sales, increase, your profitability will, you'd wonder about, uh, you know, what forms of advertising you could use a, you'd think carefully about the way that you would characterize hazards as opposed to product benefits.

Speaker 1:          01:01          And you probably would think very heavily, very carefully about the way that, uh, you would conduct your own research. And I wanted to reemphasize a couple of points here. And one is the, uh, the way that the advertising had been targeted, particularly to those that, uh, were most vulnerable to adopting a cigarette products, tobacco products, uh, in the early teens, uh, really between the ages of 12 and 50, 15 years of age. Uh, and I also wanted to bring to your attention a one target of advertising, but I didn't discuss the other day. Uh, which is interesting. Uh, there is an overlap obviously between the intensity of physical activity among the young, uh, uh, so that, uh, the youngest are most physically active. Uh, and those that participate in sports, uh, became figures that promoted tobacco use in a variety of different media. Uh, there was a concentration, not just a to target women and ethnic groups, uh, but also exceptional athletes in a variety of different sports.

Speaker 1:          02:02          So claims that they don't get your wind as an example appeared in popular mechanics, uh, uh, more than half a century ago. I also did not talk about other kinds of tobacco products. And, uh, it was curious because I had, uh, a class, uh, several years ago with, uh, perhaps, uh, four or five, uh, baseball team players. And I got to understand that a chewing tobacco is not uncommon at all among boys baseball players. Uh, and there's very little understanding about, uh, uh, the chemical content or the relative risk of tobacco products, uh, cigarettes as opposed to smoking tobacco. Uh, so just to provide a, uh, a quick back background set of statistics of the National Cancer Institute, uh, has a site that reviews the presence of 28 different carcinogens in smokeless tobacco. Uh, in one dose of, of smokeless tobacco, depending upon the size that you pull out of the camp, uh, has three to four times the nicotine level, so that those that are chewing tobacco absorb far more nicotine and it can be measured in at higher concentrations in the blood.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Then if you have a cigarette, and it's now used by almost 8 million people in the United States, it's also recognized to increase risk of, of, uh, oral cancer, uh, that, uh, can cause bone degeneration and a different other illnesses, uh, of the, of the nasal pharyngeal cavity. Uh, I also did not talk much about specific advertising targeted to young kids, uh, but the idea that the big league chew chewing gum, for example, uh, would, uh, uh, allow a kid to think that they were behaving like a major leaguer, uh, by, by, uh, uh, chewing bubblegum, uh, the way that, uh, the major leaguers chew tobacco and also the, uh, uh, the sale of cigarettes and candy form, uh, to children. These are still marketed, uh, uh, in the United States today. One other fact that I didn't discuss is the idea of freedom of choice relative to children growing up in families that smoked.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Um, I grew up in a family that smoked, uh, and just have vivid memories of being in the backseat of a car, uh, filled with smoke, uh, or a sitting around the kitchen table. Uh, we're, we're parents smoked and many mid, perhaps some of you had that have had that same experience. Uh, the estimate today is about 25% of kids between the ages of three and 11 grew up with one smoker in the household. So thinking about, uh, the, the freedom of choice argument on the part of the industry, uh, relative to this population poses some particular problems. And I left you the other day talking about the efforts on the part of the industry, uh, to understand nicotine and a, the human response to nicotine. And I want you to think about this a little bit more carefully. So, uh, this general counsel to Brown and Williamson back in 1963 so, uh, almost a 50 years ago, uh, claimed.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Well, we are then in the business of selling nicotine and addictive drug beyond nicotine. By the way, there are many other hazardous chemicals in tobacco smoke. And I'm not going to spend any more time on this than to, uh, uh, uh, let you know that that dozens of compounds are really a very well recognized and they are, are the targets of a variety of different types of, of environmental laws. So, uh, these chemicals are, are, uh, tightly restricted under the safe drinking water act, the clean air act, uh, hazardous air pollutant, uh, uh, regulations. So that, uh, the idea that they would escape regulatory attention in a tobacco product where the dose would be so much higher than you would get if you were exposed to outdoor air or too low levels in, in drinking water. It's really a very interesting thought. Now, David Kessler, who wrote question of intent, uh, when he, he spoke in this lecture, uh, knew of my interest in and, uh, the research I was then doing on pesticides and he pointed me to an expert in Switzerland who had pulled together information on pesticides, used to produce tobacco.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Uh, so nobody had ever looked at the number of chemicals that were allowed for use or what happened to them more than tobacco itself burned. Uh, so it turned out that, uh, uh, there are about 101 different pesticides used on tobacco. Uh, and when they are burned, some concentrations, uh, make their way into indoor air. Uh, but others transform, uh, so that the mixture of known carcinogens that are not pesticides, uh, with, uh, these pesticide metabolites or combustion byproducts, uh, is really quite a, uh, quite a remarkable mixture of, of, of substances. Now, another idea that Kessler had, uh, that I've taken up in a variety of different, uh, uh, research projects has been to explore patents as a way of understanding what a corporation knew about a product a and when they knew it and how they're advertising matched up with their background knowledge of benefit as opposed to risk.

Speaker 1:          07:02          So if you look at, uh, some of these patent examples, uh, that, uh, uh, the food and Drug Administration was able to conduct research on, uh, you find that back as early as the 1960s and through the 70s, eighties, in 1990s. Uh, the companies we're conducting intensive research, uh, on nicotine content. Uh, so take a look at the, if you take a look at the first patent description, I'd increase nicotine content and the tobacco smoke by use of a nicotine ion exchange placed in the filter. What placed in the filter? I thought filters were supposed to take out particles or, or dangerous chemicals. Uh, so they're thinking that they might even add the nicotine to the filter. Uh, the second increased nicotine content and the smoke of a tobacco product by adding nicotine to carbon black in the filter, the next add tobacco extract containing nicotine to the filter of cigarettes.

Speaker 1:          07:57          The next one create a device to deliver increased nicotine by applying nicotine solutions to the filter. And finally on the sheet method of producing a rapper for a smoking rod, uh, a cigarette which has a screen printed on it, uh, among other things, they physiologically active agent such as nicotine. So thinking about adding ink to the paper, uh, thinking about adding, uh, uh, liquids and vapors to a, to the filters, uh, as well as the example that I described the other day, increasing the ammonia content, uh, in the, in the tobacco. That would free up more nicotine. So all of an idea to manipulate the dose that the individual would get per per cigarette. Uh, the, the list goes on, uh, and, uh, uh, the idea of, of, uh, um, putting other additives in, uh, that, uh, would make high nicotine content, uh, less harsh because nicotine can can be very irritating to the, uh, the throat and the nose, and also lowering the ratio of particulate matter of nicotine and smoke using internal heat sinks and special nicotine containing absorbance. Uh, so the cigarette product itself, uh, many have the idea that it's simply tobacco. It's not at all. It's a very interesting combination of different technologies are all designed to, to manipulate the chemical mixture that the smoker receives. And as this research was going on, this slide that I showed you the other the other day, uh, kind of reinforces that this knowledge was being incorporated in a manner that allowed them to figure out how to increase the nicotine content in cigarettes during the same period.

Speaker 1:          09:42          There was an interesting article that was published in 1998 in the British American are, uh, by uh, uh, uh, uh, a researcher in the Tobacco Control Journal. Uh, and it references a memo that it was quoted in that journal. Uh, we are searching explicitly, uh, for a socially acceptable addictive product involving a pattern of repeated consumption. A product which is likely to involve repeated handling. The essential constituent is most likely to be nicotine or a direct substitute for it. So this is all just to say that, uh, as these debates were going on inside Congress, uh, over whether or not nicotine is an addictive drug. There is a, a, a video that I'll put up on the website for you that shows all of the de facto executives in major corporate executives appearing before Congress. And, uh, we were one congressmen asked them, Henry Waxman from California, uh, uh, gentlemen, uh, is tobacco, uh, or is nicotine addictive, uh, and each one of them went down the row. No, it is not addictive. Uh, and this was well after this research had been published. Plan. Well after, uh, excuse me. Well after this memorandum was, was written, so that a central debate, uh, in the management of the technology has been over the management of nicotine.

Speaker 2:          11:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Oh, by the late 1990s, major medical organizations around the world had concluded that nicotine is addictive, including the US surgeon general, the World Health Organization, et Cetera. So that, uh, this eventually prompted Kessler once he had all of this information derived from patents, but also derived from, from a National Institute of Health, uh, independently conducted research in recognizing that, uh, uh, there was much research that had gone on in these companies that was not disclosed to the food and Drug Administration. They develop their proposal. This proposal is pretty well laid out and the question of intent, uh, and it included a ban on cartoon graphics, uh, particularly with an eye to the Joe camel ad that I showed you a few days ago. A text is allowed in the, in the advertising banning brand names on hats, tee shirts, and other products. Uh, they targeted event sponsorship, uh, requiring corporate, uh, names, uh, but not product names, eliminating vending machines, free samples, and mirror mail order.

Speaker 1:          12:09          Uh, and eliminating self service in stores and suspending licenses to sell to those who, uh, did not, uh, uh, restrict sales to minors. So the history of this Fda rule is I think very interesting and, uh, uh, will lead to what I think of as, as one of the more important success stories, uh, in the late 20th century that a swirl around these, these, uh, environmental health cases, the FDA rule proposed in August of, uh, 1996 by President Clinton, uh, at Kessler's urging, uh, was announced by the food and Drug Administration. The tobacco industry, uh, within a matter of a couple of months, filed a lawsuit against the FDA rule arguing that the food and Drug Administration had no authority over tobacco products under the food, drug and cosmetic act. Uh, basically that, uh, tobacco products were not a drug, uh, that, uh, uh, that, uh, the cigarettes or the ship cigars, uh, we're not a drug delivery device.

Speaker 1:          13:09          Uh, and they also argued that FDA's rules, uh, on marketing restrictions violated the first amendment. So we had the right to make claims about our product and to sell it. Uh, the major plaintiff's in the, in the case included a these corporations. Uh, and as a side show, which is a bit interesting, back in 1997, John Mccain introduced the Universal Tobacco Settlement Act. Uh, and, uh, uh, it passed the revised, uh, the Senate passed a revised version of the Mccain Bill, uh, that included many, uh, elements of the FDA rule. So, uh, rather than, uh, the government agency, the food and Drug Administration, just adopting these regulations, uh, without going specifically to Congress. Uh, the, the, uh, uh, McCain strategy was, well, let's try to push this through Congress and see how far we can get. But it was defeated in the Senate. Uh, just about a year later, the U S court of Appeals ruled in a two to one vote that eight FDA had no authority to regulate tobacco products in 1999.

Speaker 1:          14:14          Uh, because it ruled that the FDA had no authority. Uh, the force circuit did not rule on whether or not FDA is rule mark rules. Uh, our marketing restrictions, uh, violated the first amendment and just as background. But I, because we haven't spent much time on the overall structure of the judicial system, uh, there are 94 federal district courts in the u s there are 10 regional appellate courts. And then obviously one supreme court would want justice and eight associates. Now, in part because of recognition of the medical costs associated with treating people that tobacco related illnesses, uh, attorneys general from more than 40 states got together and, uh, uh, launched a lawsuit and eventually it was settled. It was called the master settlement agreement with the tobacco industry. And, uh, as you may or may not know, most lawsuits, uh, don't make their way to a trial or to a jury.

Speaker 1:          15:14          Most are settled. And in this case, in 1998, uh, the attorneys general from 46 states signed this agreement with four of the biggest companies, tobacco companies in the nation, and it prohibited tobacco advertising, uh, that targeted kids younger than 18 years of age. So, you know, once again, that isn't kind of an interesting story, uh, that a kid's play an important role in the history of the product regulation. So what we're a key elements of this ingredient, or excuse me, of this settlement. Well, first, that, uh, uh, tobacco companies could not use cartoon characters. Uh, the tobacco companies could not target a youth and advertising or promotion. Uh, tobacco companies could not sponsor concerts or other events, uh, with significant youth audiences and tobacco brand names, uh, cannot be advertised at stadiums and arenas. So here you see three different institutional arenas, basically, uh, considering the same issues.

Speaker 1:          16:15          Uh, you see, uh, the food and Drug Administration attempting to regulate, uh, by, by, uh, you know, uh, adopting regulations and, uh, you find, uh, the, uh, attorneys, attorneys general, uh, using litigation as a way of forcing settlement, uh, so that you get the companies themselves to agree that they're not going to do these things. That's a very different approach than, than having Fda tell them that they can't do those things. And then you have the Mccain initiative in Congress. So, you know, the, the curious thing about this, uh, is that, uh, uh, you can think about a variety of different institutional targets for legal reform. Uh, should you target a, the federal government? Should you target, uh, uh, a federal regulatory agency trying to get them to adopt new regulations or should you use the judicial system? Uh, so that in this case, uh, all three, uh, institutional venues were being exercised.

Speaker 1:          17:11          I also wanted to pose a, another, uh, problem to you. And that is that a, like other types of environmental problems, there are certain groups in society that are at special risk. And in this case, uh, the Americans for disabilities or the American, uh, Americans with disabilities act, uh, uh, was used to authorize, uh, or, uh, uh, limit, excuse me, to eliminate or, uh, uh, uh, uh, limit environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace and requires an employer, employer make a reasonable accommodation to the known disabilities, have an employee who requests the accommodation so that, uh, workers, uh, use the Americans with disabilities act effectively to clear up the air within workplaces. Uh, another settlement proved interesting and occupational question as well. Uh, the airline flight attendants were concerned about their intense exposure to tobacco smoke. And you're probably too young to remember flying, uh, when cigarette smoking was allowed in aircraft.

Speaker 1:          18:15          Uh, but the distinction between the smoking and the no smoking zone was simply a row number. So a row number 23 a might and, and a forward might allow smoking and ruin number 24 and back. That would not, uh, so you could very easily be sitting next to somebody smoking. Uh, and the air inside the cabin, uh, is, is a controlled by the pilot who decides on what the refresh rate will be. It's called bleed air that comes off of the engines and circulates back through the aircraft so that a, at high altitudes, the temperature is really low so that it means that they have to expend more fuel the more they recycle or refresh the quality of the air from the outside, uh, to heat it back up to a comfortable cabin temperature. So there's a tendency not to refresh that air. It's an interesting case at to couple months ago about an airliner, uh, that, uh, had a fuel leak, uh, that, uh, had seeped into that bleed air and passengers claimed that they were, were, uh, quite ill once they landed, including many of the flight attendants.

Speaker 1:          19:17          So let's take a look at the food and Drug Administration, a case versus Brown and Williamson. Uh, and the Supreme Court ruling on March of 2000, uh, that, uh, was issued in the five to four decision. This was interesting because it basically concluded that a existing law does not provide FDA with authority over tobacco or tobacco marketing. Uh, they claim that the FDA consistently stated before 1995 that it lacked jurisdiction over tobacco. So the, and the shift in, in the administrator of the food and drug administration, they were arguing was the only reason that they were taking this issue on. And the congress had enacted several tobacco specific statutes, uh, that fully demonstrated that, uh, uh, they had not intended, uh, that these regulations proposed by the food and Drug Administration be adopted. Uh, so congress considered and rejected many bills that would have given the agency to have authority.

Speaker 1:          20:12          So the argument, uh, that, that, uh, the Supreme Court bought a was that, you know, this was a matter that should have been dealt with in Congress specifically. Uh, but Congress chose not to deal with it. So what if you look more carefully at it? Well, what if you asked the question, well, should it be considered to be a drug under the food, Drug and cosmetic act? Uh, and, uh, you know, you might, uh, uh, read the statement by an RJ Reynolds executive. Uh, in a sense the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized, highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry. Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects and say, case closed. Now the evidence is clear. They even believe that, uh, they believe themselves that a tobacco products, uh, should be classified or, or are a type of duct drug.

Speaker 1:          21:02          Well, the decision as the Supreme Court interpreted it. And don't forget that this is a five to four decision, which is interesting because the, the descending opinions or something that you probably have not read, but you, I commend to you the, uh, the opinion of Steven Brier, which I think is perhaps the, the most, uh, uh, cogent, uh, so that, uh, the definition of a drug turned out to be a dependent and turn about, uh, whether or not there was an identifiable benefit. So I'm going to quote various provisions in the act require the agency to determine that at least for some consumers, the products therapeutic benefits outweigh the risks of illness or serious injury. This the FDA cannot do because tobacco, tobacco products are unsafe for obtaining any therapeutic benefit. The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco products within the FT CAS food, Drug and Cosmetic Act regulatory scheme.

Speaker 1:          21:56          If they cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose, uh, and yet they cannot be banned. They simply do not fit. They do not fit the legal scheme that Congress had intended. And Sandra Day O'connor wrote this opinion. The agency has amply demonstrated the tobacco use, particularly among children and adolescents, uh, poses perhaps a single most significant threat to public health in the United States. Yet we believe that Congress has clearly precluded FDA from asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. Now, many people heard about this decision and they assume that the Supreme Court, uh, was off their rocker, that, that, uh, they, they really, uh, we're, we're, uh, uh, concluding something that, uh, was not morally defensible. Um, but I think, you know, that their job is not to conclude what is morally appropriate or morally defensible. Their job is to determine whether or not a, uh, uh, an agency action in this case, uh, complied with the intent and letter of the law. Uh, so that, uh, it's, it's important too to recognize that these are debates about the nature and the language, the very specific language and definitions contained in the statutes, uh, that, uh, provide the authorizing language to the administrative agencies such as the food and Drug Administration.

Speaker 1:          23:10          So that, uh, continuing with his opinion, Congress's foreclosed a ban on such products. Choosing instead to create a distinct regulatory scheme focusing on the labeling and advertising and cigarettes and smokeless tobacco compared to pesticides where they created a scheme that now stands that the agency, in that case, the environmental protection agency has to make a formal finding of reasonable certainty of no harm. Not In this case, not in this case at all. So that, uh, the focus on labeling and advertising rather than on risk assessment or risk minimization, uh, is a very different approach to managing a product or a technology and the marketplace. So it's express policy is to protect commerce and the national economy a while informing consumers about any adverse health effects. Now, one might argue as well. Well, how did the tobacco industry get away with this legal regime? How were they so successful in escaping regulation?

Speaker 1:          24:08          It's almost the ideal situation. Uh, so that, uh, they, they have the sense of being regulated, uh, because of the advertising controls. Uh, but they have virtual freedom to manipulate the chemical composition of their products. Uh, so that, uh, you know, if I were a tobacco executive, I would think that legal regime is, it's pretty good. And I would, uh, definitely defend against any change in the legal regime that would increase the authority of the food and Drug Administration on the part of Congress. So justice briars descent on, on FDA's authority is interesting. So according to the FDA, only 2.5% of smokers successfully stopped smoking each year, even though 70% say they want to quit and 34% actually make an attempt to do so. The fact that only a handful of those who try to quit smoking actually succeed illustrates a certain reality. The reality that the nicotine in cigarettes creates a powerful physiological addiction flowing from a chemically induced changes in the brain.

Speaker 1:          25:05          The FDA found that the makers of cigarettes and 10 these a physical effects, hence nicotine is a drug. The cigarette that delivers the nicotine to the body is a device and the FTC A's language read in light of its basic purpose permits the food and Drug Administration to assert the disease preventing jurisdiction that the agency now claims. So the issue seemed like it was over, uh, until the Obama administration came into power. And all of these provisions, uh, that had been in the proposed regulations on the part of the Food and Drug Administration, uh, made their way into bills that were introduced to the house and the Senate, uh, that eventually became the family smoking prevention and Tobacco Control Act, uh, in June of 2009. So this bill, uh, adopted by Congress, amends the Food Drug and cosmetic act to grant the food and Drug Administration Authority to regulate the advertising, marketing and manufacturing of tobacco products.

Speaker 1:          26:07          What does it do? Well, it restricts tobacco marketing, marketing and sales to youth and bands, all outdoor advertising within a thousand feet of schools. Uh, it bands a free giveaways, uh, of, uh, any non tobacco items with a purchase of a tobacco product, uh, advance the sponsorship of sporting events and entertainment events, uh, at limits to black and white text only advertising in publications with significant teen readership and restricts vending machines and self service displays to adult only facilities. And it continues to require retailers to verify age, uh, for all over the counter sales. By the way, I didn't mention a point that I meant to earlier. You know, we talked about preemption before and, and, uh, you know, under the different statutes that we've looked at, uh, when would the federal government preempt or prevent states from adopting different kinds of regulations? Well, preemption turns out to be an important component in this case as well.

Speaker 1:          27:05          Uh, with respect to the tobacco settlement. Now, the tobacco settlement, uh, was not, uh, it was not law that was formed by statute. Uh, it was not formed by regulation. It was formed by agreement between attorneys general of the states, uh, in the, in the tobacco companies. Uh, but the states started to enforce the provisions of that settlement, uh, that brought the questions into court. And some states such as Massachusetts in California, proposed advertising that a was distinctive, uh, and more restrictive outdoor advertising bans so that no billboards could be located within a thousand feet of a school, uh, in, in the state of Massachusetts. Uh, similar kinds of legislation in a variety of different states. So that the, the supreme court considered this a in the 2000 decision, and it basically reinforced, uh, the preemption, uh, provision, uh, that, uh, uh, was part of a variety of different statutes.

Speaker 1:          28:06          So that a, the court found that a preemption would prevent, uh, Massachusetts, California, and other states from adopting more rigorous advertising restrictions. It's just kind of an interesting point, uh, uh, how the attorney's general could, could draw the settlement issue back into court and then it would capture the supreme court's attention. So that basically you see the language being moved from the food and Drug Administration's proposed regulations, uh, into statutory language. Uh, and this was blessed by Congress. It provides FDA with authority, develop regulations that restrict advertising and promotion, uh, to the full extent permitted by a amendment to the constitution. And it requires a detailed disclosure of tobacco product ingredients for the first time so that tobacco companies have to disclose not just, uh, uh, chemicals used, uh, for, uh, the growing of tobacco. But the chemicals in, uh, in the tobacco plants themselves, whether or not they're genetically modified, uh, and what kinds of additives they placed, not just in the tobacco but in the filter as well as the paper.

Speaker 1:          29:16          It also requires FDA to change, to require changes to tobacco that, uh, would protect public health. So public health now is a, a, uh, decision making standard that has to be viewed and treated, uh, with every decision that FDA makes. Oh, and one critical aspect of, of this new statute is that FDA would be allowed, uh, is now allowed, uh, granted the authority to reduce nicotine content or the band, uh, ingredients that it believes are hazardous. Uh, but it's not allowed to require the reduction of nicotine to zero or to ban any particular class of products, say cigars or chewing, chewing tobacco as an example.

Speaker 1:          30:01          And also controlled, gives FDA the authority to, to, uh, control, uh, reduced harm products. Uh, so that, uh, uh, those descriptors such as light or mild or low on labels, uh, uh, or an advertising a will now become subject to the review of the agency. And you remember that the light products that I showed you last Tuesday had higher nicotine content and in them than, uh, the, the, uh, uh, normal products. And it requires a larger and more specific health warnings to cover the top 50% of the front and rear panels of the package. Uh, and it directs FDA to issue a rule requiring graphic warnings on labels, uh, within a year from now. So a recall, the, uh, Canadian governments, uh, tobacco labeling requirements as an example. Uh, curiously, they also transfer the costs of all regulation, uh, back to the companies so that, uh, all tobacco related food and Drug Administration costs, uh, now have to be allocated among the manufacturers of cigarettes, a cigarette, tobacco in smokeless tobacco products sold in the u s, uh, based upon their, they're a different shares of the marketplace.

Speaker 1:          31:12          So in this interim time between when, when, uh, the food and Drug Administration was found by the Supreme Court not to have authority to move forward on tobacco. And when in 2009, uh, the, the congress adopted the new statute, uh, what was happening? Well, states became very active in their own tobacco control programs. Uh, and these programs turned out to be really remarkable social experiments. Now they turned out to be quite effective. And in California, adult smoking drop from 26%, 18%, uh, in about an eight year period following a variety of educational campaigns, public service announcements, a school programs, uh, so that, uh, Massachusetts similarly found a 31% decline between 1992 in 1999, uh, in Oregon, tobacco use fell 11% in Florida in one year. Teen Smoking, uh, had, had gone down the fastest that had had since 1980. The key elements had been a mass media campaigns, uh, smoking bans and restrictions, particularly in public places and buildings as well as restaurant, uh, price increases.

Speaker 1:          32:19          They found that, uh, uh, tobacco adoption rates were extremely sensitive to tax levels. So in the states that had the most elevated taxes, you had the lowest adoption rates in states that had the, the, uh, uh, uh, highest, uh, uh, intensity of bands on a place based restrictions, restrictions and buildings. Uh, they had the highest rates of quitting a, so that a price sensitivity turned out to be, uh, a really important component of the strategy. Uh, and they also found that a different types of physician interventions, uh, nicotine patches, uh, we're more much more effective when they were combined with these other educational programs than they had early, earlier believed. So basically, uh, on another lesson here is that mass media works. Uh, and, uh, remember the 1967 fairness doctrine campaign, uh, that, uh, itself, uh, resulted in a significant decline in smoking, uh, in California.

Speaker 1:          33:16          The media campaign reduced sales of cigarettes by 232 million packs in only a two year period. Uh, and when media spending dropped from 16 million to 6 million of the program became less effective. So that education is really important and it works well. I want to step back from this case and I want you to think about, uh, how this history, uh, should be conceived a, should you be thinking about this as a success story? Uh, should you be thinking about this as a offering? Other lessons for other kinds of environmental problems. And I've got a number of students that went to Copenhagen in December and came back at kind of throwing their hands up in the air, not knowing really what happened and feeling rather disillusion with the inability of nations to, uh, decide to agree on, on what level of, uh, carbon in the atmosphere, uh, should be allowed, uh, or what the rate of, of uh, uh, use of alternative forms of energy should be.

Speaker 1:          34:19          Uh, and, and this history as well as the other histories that I've showed you that you've read about through the term. I think she'd give you some sense that legal reform is a long road, uh, demands, demands, education that demands a, a shift in values. Uh, and it demands willingness on the part of those that, uh, uh, are the, uh, the culprit, so to speak. The people that are behaving in a way that adversely affects the environment. It requires them to earn, internalize the values that are embedded in the law, otherwise it's not going to work. So I view this as as a, uh, uh, one of the, the, the, the greatest, uh, examples we've got about how science had moved out of the tobacco industry, uh, into the, uh, public sector, uh, funded by the government. A very different view of all of what was a risky and what was not a different quality of knowledge, uh, developed about the nature of the health risks.

Speaker 1:          35:14          And, uh, it eventually led the public to realize that, uh, this was a, this was a technology, this was a product, uh, that, uh, uh, demanded greater public attention. And you can think of the parallels between nuclear weapons testing. Think of the parallels between pesticides. So, you know, once again, I'm not doctor doom and gloom. I'm sure I'm showing you examples in history that I think are really remarkable stories such as the limited test ban treaty, uh, the Food Quality Protection Act, uh, in, in this case, uh, the statute that was just passed. Now, when, uh, uh, you discussed this in, in your sections this week, uh, you probably will think about the different strategies, uh, that might be applied to control tobacco. Uh, and how the freedom to choose a should best be limited. Uh, so I'm going to do my own little survey. Here are how many people here think that the control of advertising is inappropriate way to control tobacco products and associated risks? How many people feel that individuals want to have the right to choose whether or not they use tobacco products? How many people feel that tobacco products should be banned?

Speaker 1:          36:26          Well, I'd say maybe a eight to 10% of you think that tobacco products should be banned. There's remarkable consistency year to year. I've asked this question for the past decade in this class. Uh, and the number of people that believe that, uh, for example, DDT or rather a hazardous air pollutants, uh, or pesticides should be banned, is normally far higher, uh, than, than uh, uh, it is for tobacco. So explaining why that is, is really quite interesting. And I think that, uh, uh, the, the advertising schemes that I displayed to you over the past couple of lectures, uh, play some role in having shaped cultural attitudes and acceptance of this technology in ways that really is quite remarkable. Now I want you to think about the nature of the politics too. And then the last few minutes of the lecture, uh, what do you know, how, what could you say about the, uh, the forms of argument that we've seen across the different cases that we've looked at?

Speaker 1:          37:22          How were they consistent and how are they different? Well, first I'd like you to take a look at some of the key industry arguments that a, we've seen where the promoter of the, the, uh, the product, the promoter of the service, the promoter of the technology, the promoter of national security. In the case of, of, uh, the weapons testing or the, the, uh, uh, war games testing and VA case, they emphasize the benefit of the product or technology or the social demand for it as a logic for why it should be allowed to continue. Uh, they argue that evidence is insufficient to justify regulation. They play the good scientist, they develop the science in the house, uh, and then present their interpretations of it, uh, to the regulatory body in the industry or proponent would trivialize claims of hazards. Uh, and compare the hazards always to natural hazards.

Speaker 1:          38:14          Like we experience a risks from flying across the country, uh, from, uh, radiation. Uh, so the, uh, the radionuclides in our milk are relatively insignificant. So figure out ways of, of trivializing risk by using comparative metrics exposure. Uh, you find consistently that a, across these cases, that exposure is often averaged among different populations and it's all averaged over a, uh, time. It's an average to over space. It's averaged demographically in this act of averaging when you have, uh, a really, uh, of the image is really one of pockets of risk. The averaging is going to compress people's perception of the nature of and the magnitude of the risk. So paying attention to the distribution of risk is, has been very important to legal reform in all of these cases. Uh, age restrictions. Also the role of kids, the concern of society for, uh, the, the very young for the fetus, for the kids, for future generations.

Speaker 1:          39:16          Uh, this is a, an appeal on the part of consumers, uh, that, uh, uh, is often quite effective in Leeds industry to, to still find a ban on, to fight prohibition. Uh, but to accept age restrictions, to accept labeling, to accept training requirements or licensing requirements. So the strategy if you are the corporate executive is to well fight those, but to accept them instead of taking a product, a prohibition registration is a property right. They will always fight that if you take away the right to do what they did in the past, uh, that you have to compensate for them under the fifth amendment of the Constitution. So treat your registration, treat your path of freedom to sell your freedom to choose a as a property, right and demand compensation. And courts have traditionally responded favorably to these arguments. Patent Life, uh, pushed for the longest patent life that you can.

Speaker 1:          40:13          Uh, and you basically want to fight regulation until the end of your patent life, uh, which at that time the product becomes generic. It can be picked up by other corporations. You find this with pesticides, you find this with drugs. So that the industry will fight to keep the product in the marketplace till the end of that patent life, which is now a 20 year period. Uh, and you often find litigation, uh, effective in delaying prohibitions for 15 to 20 years. So it's a very effective strategy. And often if you've invested, say, uh, $100 million is one pesticide that I've worked on where $100 million was invested in this chemical, uh, to bring it to the marketplace and to study it. If you invested that amount of money, it often takes you to, uh, to, uh, uh, 75% of the patent life to start to get a return on that investment.

Speaker 1:          40:58          So the profitability for new drug, the profitability for a, a new expensive technology, expensive to bring to the marketplace and often doesn't pay off until that last five year period. So that it's a guarantee that you're going to have a legal fight, uh, strategically regulate rather than band argue that, uh, well, can I use it in a, can I use the product in this way but not that way? Uh, can I continue to sell the tobacco and cigarettes? Uh, if not cigars? Can I continue to, uh, use a pesticide, uh, outdoors if you've been an indoors? So try to maintain market share any way that you can. Uh, and if you can't, if they decide no, it's going to be banned, uh, then let us export it. Please let us export it to other nations. Uh, substitutes. Don't compare us among competitors. Uh, make sure that you focus exclusively on our product because we don't want the, uh, the, the risk, the threat, the environmental damage from our product to be thought of in an additive way with competitor's products.

Speaker 1:          42:02          Uh, another logic is a comparative risk. Well, the risk associated with our product or our behavior or our technology, uh, is really minimal compared to the risk of, uh, he know not to using the latest safety technology in a car. Uh, trying to, uh, launch a suicide prevention program, a drug control program, etc. Finally, a self study, self monitoring and self reporting. Let us do the studies and then provide you with the data. Don't set up an independent organization to do that. So let us report, uh, not only on the nature of the danger, but also on it's a distribution and a what it's cost of society might be. Now, how about the environmental and consumer groups arguments? Uh, how would they respond? Well, their response has been pretty consistent. Let's shift the burden of proof, uh, back to the private sector to demonstrate safety.

Speaker 1:          42:59          Why should the public have the burden to demonstrate danger? In all of these cases, it takes too long and you often can't demonstrate a danger. So let's have the, let's have the expense, uh, the time, uh, and uh, uh, the, the, the burden to rest on the private sector a second, they'll argue that evidence is insufficient to justify finding safety. So they will delay for the same reasons that industry would delay saying that the evidence is insufficient to justify increased regulation. But if this burden of proof is switched, uh, then the, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, the, it's basically providing a mirror image to, uh, the, uh, form a regulatory regime. Susceptibility. Think about how susceptibility varies in the population. Again, all the cases that we've looked at in the, in the course so far have involved those that are especially vulnerable, those that are especially, uh, exposed.

Speaker 1:          43:55          Uh, so look at a exposure patterns and how they vary by age class. Look at variability by ethnicity. Uh, look at, uh, differences in use patterns or behavior among different ethnic groups, uh, perhaps in different seasons, uh, perhaps in different parts of the country. So that, uh, looking at, uh, uh, variability and how that plays out and how goods and bads are distributed is really important to all the cases. Uh, think about mixtures don't just regulate single, uh, products or a single compounds, but think about regulating the entire mixture. Uh, we've seen that with the respect to diesel exhaust tobacco. Another good example, it's the mixture that's being regulated, not the individual component with the exception of nicotine, uh, aggregated exposure. So think about where you might get exposed to the same kind of a threat from a variety of different sources, from air, from water, from foods.

Speaker 1:          44:47          Think about the pace of review, make sure that, uh, if you give an agency a burden, uh, to uh, know transforma a, uh, uh, an industrial sector from, uh, being risky to being safe, uh, what's the pace of review that you're going to demand? Uh, how long are you going to give them? And remember the idea of a new technology that would change a vehicle emissions under the clean air act that requires a four year period that the industry has to retool to think about how they're going to redesign their, their, their engines to meet that new standard. So restricted use and label changes and ecological restrictions or are often, uh, uh, critical arguments of environmental and consumer use, consumer, uh, uh, uh, protection groups, uh, and environmental testing, uh, make certain that the environmental testing is independently conducted and, uh, uh, finally are the most exposed.

Speaker 1:          45:43          Also the most susceptible. Try to figure out how to adjust the legal regime if you can, to protect those that are exposed and those that are most at risk. And can you do that in a way that would allow a continued use of the technology? So it can you protect kids from tobacco, uh, in a way that would provide sufficient respect for the value that we assign to the freedom to choose. And finally, uh, opposed federal preemption of state and local, uh, local controls. So, uh, environmental groups will commonly oppose, uh, a preemption because they want a thousand regulations to bloom. They want California to have the opportunity to adopt more rigorous regulations, uh, because California's population and a consumer market share is so extraordinarily high as a percentage of the u s what happens in California is going to happen in the United States. And what happens in the United States is going to happen abroad.

Speaker 1:          46:42          So if you restrict the ability of a lower level of government to adopt these regulations, uh, then you are not going to have the innovation in, in, uh, uh, legal reform that you otherwise might. So I'll leave you with, uh, these, uh, these ideas to think about, uh, uh, and how you might conduct these comparisons and also how you might take some of these strategies to the problems that you care about. So I'm going to break here. And, uh, I think that we are all set to give the exams back. So, uh, if you could, uh, perhaps spread yourselves out across the front, so not everybody comes to the same place. Uh, that would be terrific.
