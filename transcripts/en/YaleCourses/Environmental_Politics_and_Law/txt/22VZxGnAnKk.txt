Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. Let's start in, got a fairly large agenda today

Speaker 1:          00:11          and I wanted to remind you that next week we're moving on to air quality. So check your syllabus and, uh, uh, read the material for section next week. And today I want to talk about key principles in law, uh, one being preemption and the other being defamation. And to give you a couple of case histories and I'm going to start out talking about Bates v Dow. And then I want to talk about two cases, one on product disparagement, uh, and the other one is known as the LR case. Uh, and another is a case that was brought by the Texas cattleman's association against Oprah Winfrey. And I'll show you a couple of video clips of that.

Speaker 1:          01:01          First of all, preemption has its origin in the constitution, uh, within the supremacy clause. It states this constitution and the laws of the u s shall be the supreme law of the land. And the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, so that within air quality law, within a pesticide management law, within pharmaceutical law, uh, tobacco law, uh, occupational law, uh, states are prohibited from adopting standards, certain standards, uh, that are, uh, different than the federal government. And the purpose behind this is not to create a, a, a, a patchwork quilt that, uh, is really comprised of nonuniform standards. So that a, when corporations wish to trade goods, uh, or provide services across state boundaries, they basically had the same expectations. It's often applied to situations that are risky or products that are risky. And the failure to warn is often a key question and we'll raise that in the case.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Today we respect to pesticides. Uh, Congress traditionally deferred to states to regulate threats to health and safety, uh, but since 1970, it's exercises power, uh, to preempt state or local regulation, uh, in a number of areas, particularly, uh, with respect to warning labels on pesticides. So there are a variety of theories of damage recovery. So if you imagine that, uh, uh, say, uh, someone comes to your home and, uh, uh, promises to give you a green lawn, uh, by applying fertilizers and insecticides and a, all of a sudden, you know, you notice an accurate, uh, a taste in your well water and also your, your, uh, uh, children start to feel awkward or strange. Uh, can you find out that the chemicals that were applied were neurotoxic substances? Uh, and, and what, what are your rights? Uh, basically you could argue that we have a, we have a percussion section out there in the, in the, uh, on the street throwing I think a rocks or bricks into one of these big metal barrels.

Speaker 1:          03:13          So I apologize for that. So you can imagine yourself in a situation where you conclude that federal law didn't protect you against that, uh, you feel like you've been damaged. It's going to cost you money to either drill a new well or to put in filtration equipment. And what about the health effects on your family? Uh, so there, there are a variety of theories of damage recovery and one is, uh, that, uh, the failure to warn provides a justification for seeking a recovery of damages. So, uh, remember what I argued about the, the difficulty that, uh, most people have an understanding, warning labels, uh, the, the difficulty of taking complicated scientific information and, and reducing it in a way that would make it intelligible and, and make you capable of knowing, you know, how you should behave in order to prevent risks. For example, uh, should you have, should you be responsible to know that you have sandy soils and that your well is a shallow well and it's an old well and the casing is cracked?

Speaker 1:          04:15          I mean, are you really responsible to know that a, should that information be on a warning label? Negligence is another theory for recovery. So was the, uh, the product, uh, uh, made in a negligent way or was it used in a negligent way? How about design defects? Uh, listening to good morning America today. Uh, I was intrigued by litigation that, uh, is, is growing, uh, class action suits against Toyota because of their accelerator pad catching or a brake defects. So, uh, some, some defect in production or, or design that leads to a higher level, a higher concentration of risk or hazard in subsequent damage. How about a failure to disclose incident reports? So that Dow Chemical Company was, was fine, nearly $800,000, uh, because it had been, uh, uh, reported it to Dow by a variety of, uh, uh, families that, uh, that they felt that, uh, they had, uh, medical problems that were associated with using their products and, uh, they were required under federal pesticide law to report those incidents, uh, back to the environmental protection agency.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Uh, and they did not do so within the time limit, there was a significant delay. So the failure to disclose incident reports and again, with the, the, uh, auto defects that, uh, we're, we're a witnessing and the, in the press and, and, uh, in the showrooms today, uh, the same issue applies. So when did the corporation know that the pedals stuck, uh, or that the brake system, uh, was, was, uh, not working. So the failure to, uh, to report back to, to, uh, government agencies that have regulatory responsibilities, whether it's pharmaceuticals or, or cars or, or pesticides or cosmetics or foods. Uh, these generally carry significant penalties. And because of preemption that's built into pesticide law and air quality law, et Cetera, uh, states have often denied access to courts, uh, to use these theories of recovery to, to secure compensation so that the state courts have often, uh, uh, uh, not agreed to hear the cases. Uh, this is why a Bates, the Dow is so important. Uh, Bates is a case in which a 29 peanut growers in Texas, uh, allege that Dow agrosciences, uh, had, had produced a chemical called strong arm, a strong arm. They claim damage there. Peanut plants back in the year 2000 and the plate, the pesticide label itself claim that, uh, use of strong arm as recommended in all areas where peanuts are grown.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Now when it was used in the Texas a peanut farm land where the soils exceeded a Ph of 7.2, it damaged both the peanut crop and it feel to control the weeds. So, uh, the, the activity of this chemical is mediated by the acidity of the soil. Uh, and by 2001 EPA approved a new label for the chemical, including a new warning, do not apply strong arm to soils with a Ph of 7.2 or greater. So this case was decided in 2005 a this label was in, in force, uh, for four years before the, uh, the decision date. So eventually, uh, the case wound its way up to the supreme court. And this is quite, this is quite a feat in many instances. Uh, claims that are brought in state courts, uh, do not make their way up to the supreme court, can often take decades or even a half a century before, uh, cases is believed to be appropriate for judicial review by the highest court in the country.

Speaker 1:          08:12          So they found the congress surely would have expressed its intent more clearly if it had meant to deprive injured parties of along available form of compensation. Moreover, this history emphasizes the importance of providing an incentive to manufacturers to use the utmost care and distributing inhere inherently dangerous items. In other words, the Supreme Court was looking at, uh, the, these, uh, uh, lawsuits to seek recovery is really a last resort. So it represents the failure of federal law. It represents the failure of state law or local law to offer sufficient environmental protection or protection of public health. So what's a damaged party to do? What are you going to do if you've been damaged? Well, you, you probably would consider litigation. So the Supreme Court, uh, continued. It seems likely unlikely that Congress considered a relatively obscure provision, like section one 36 VB, uh, which is a preemption clause to get pesticide manufacturers virtual immunity from certain forms of tort liability.

Speaker 1:          09:15          And we'd been pointed to no evidence that such tort suits lead led to a crazy quilt of Fifth Fra, federal pesticide law standards, or otherwise created any real hardship for manufacturers or EPA. So the argument that you would have an unequal on uneven, uh, uh, regulatory playing field among the states, uh, had no substance to it or that the manufacturers would be damaged significantly by, uh, uh, by these claims because a, they're expensive, they're time consuming, and a few people actually have the resources or capacity to bring, uh, the, the lawsuits. So central questions today really a will involve a question of freedom of speech and when is it appropriate to limit speech about, uh, environmental and health hazards, uh, intellectual property rights, you know, who should own the right to a knowledge of risk? Should it be, uh, uh, uh, should corporations be capable of holding that as a, a, a, a secret or are they out? Should they be obligated to disclose that to uh, to the public in the form of a warning label or a disclosure of an incident report?

Speaker 1:          10:27          What should the standard of proof be a and how should the falsity of a statement, uh, be judged the falsity of the statement on a label or the falsity of a statement made by a party, uh, that is challenging a corporation that they were damaged by exposure to their product. Uh, and where should the burden of proof watch or the burden of proof why with a plaintiff to prove the falsity of criticism or the defendant approve a truth of, of criticism and to, to uh, uh, explore this area of product disparagement a more fully. I want you to consider one case. Uh, this is a case of a, of a chemical known as Al are, uh, that, uh, can, you probably did not experience, uh, but, uh, uh, it was in wide use in the United States and, uh, in different parts of the world, uh, back in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Speaker 1:          11:17          And it was used on apples and it was used on apple orchards. Basically to cause a stem thickening. Uh, so it would hold the apple on the tree longer and it would keep the apple from falling down and getting bruised. So it would maintain the commercial quality and the great of the Apple. And it would also cause uniform ripening. Uniform ripening is important because you don't want part of a tree, perhaps that's facing the sunshine, uh, to have apples that are ripe. And then the, the, the, uh, all the, uh, apples that are, uh, on the north side of the tree, uh, in more shade that would remain green. So it provided economic advantage to, to orchard owners, uh, in, in a variety of ways. It's, this is a systemic compound, which is interesting. It means that it's absorbed up through the plant roots itself into the plant tissue.

Speaker 1:          12:07          So, uh, you may think that, uh, uh, some residues are only on the surface of a fruit or a vegetable, and if you peel it or if you wash it, you could get rid of it. Here's an example of, of a compound that, uh, uh, that would not be helpful for. It's not easy to detect. Uh, when this chemical was being reviewed and became a, uh, public, uh, public target, uh, for criticism of, of its manufacturer. Uh, I went up to, uh, the state of Massachusetts because the state of Massachusetts with trying to figure out if they were going to ban the compound as it was detected increasingly in foods. And I went to their laboratories, their state laboratories, and they had not even developed a detection method yet speaking to their analytic chemist. They couldn't, they didn't even know how to find this in foods.

Speaker 1:          12:54          So thinking about that, what that means is that the government approved the use of a chemical on certain crops when it knew that there was no accepted method for detecting it in a, in the food or in, in processed forms of the food, uh, or in water supplies if it, if it happened to contaminate water supplies. So that's, that's quite curious and it might give you some ideas, uh, about, uh, uh, prior requirements before introducing new technologies. So it gives, uh, uh, it has an unusual characteristic. It produces a unsymmetrical die methyl hydrazine, Udm h, which is also a space shuttle rocket fuel, but only under conditions where the chemical is heated. Now, where would a food be heated? Well, it's commonly heated when it's so when it's processed, uh, or when it's pasteurized. So, uh, when you take an apple and you grind it up and, and uh, uh, you squeeze all the juice out of it and to make apple juice, uh, it's commonly heated up for the purposes of killing bacteria and protecting human health.

Speaker 1:          14:01          Apple juice, uh, uh, at in the 1980s was also exploding into the marketplace and in part because of, of different, uh, packaging technologies. So it used to be available in large glass bottles, uh, but the, the advent of juice boxes, uh, so that the children would take, uh, these, these flavored juices to school on a routine basis and in a really small cardboard and plastic containers, it costs, caused apple juice consumption to skyrocket. So that apple juice within a matter of a decade, uh, became one of the more heavily consumed foods by young children. So it was introduced by Uniroyal in 1966, uh, and registered by the Department of Agriculture because EPA wasn't in existence until 1970 and in 1973 a, it was found to produce cancer in mice. Uh, between 1977 and 78, the National Cancer Institute, uh, uh, found that that study was credible and they, they conducted their own studies, uh, that found carcinogenic effects in animals.

Speaker 1:          15:04          You know, raising the question, how should we look at data from animal testing and what, what should we infer from that about a human health risk? Well, during conservative political administrations, we've tended as a society, not to worry too much about, uh, these, these low level cancer risks in the food supply. But remember that at this point in time, the Delaney clause in the Food Drug and cosmetic act was in place that had what was called the de Minimus risk standard built into it. So it also had the food and Drug Administration that was interpreting the de standard to allow low levels of risk in the, in the food supply. So EPA concluded eventually in 1980 that it was carcinogenic, uh, and then negotiated with Uniroyal for several years. And that produced no action. Uh, in 1985, they found that both Lr, which is the parent compound and the metabolite, the Udm h was a probable human carcinogen.

Speaker 1:          16:01          So this is the next step up in the level of concern. It's not just an animal carcinogen, probable human, uh, the next step up by the way, is known human carcinogen. Uh, and there are more than a hundred now, uh, uh, compounds that are, are characterized as known human carcinogens, such as benzene and, uh, a one three Butte, Butte of dying, which exists in diesel exhaust and, uh, other, uh, combustion, uh, situations such as in wood smoke or, or, uh, hm. Virtually anytime fossil fuel is, is, uh, uh, being combusted. And in 1985, uh, some feedback from their own scientific advisory panel, uh, raise questions about the quality of the data, can you actually calculate a cancer risk? So what is the threat, uh, and what can publicly be stated about that threat? Well, the natural resources defense council, one of our largest environmental groups, uh, conducted their own analysis of, of kids' exposure, recognizing that kids were eating a lot of apples and apple sauce and, and drinking a lot of apple juice. It was a very common, uh, uh, drink to be served to infants in, in place of, of infant formula or milk and has the EPA violated the public trust. So let me see if I can get this going.

Speaker 1:          17:20          This is a 60 minutes report that was prepared on this, uh, controversy so that the Natural Resources Defense Council, uh, brought their study to 16 minutes and ask them, would you like to release this information on your show? And, uh, the, the, uh, uh, answer was yes.

Speaker 2:          17:57          Who was most of you met him some data from this one call for more than one a year down

Speaker 2:          18:16          the EPA that the EPA is known about the cancer for 16 years. There's no question. Uh, you told me something that, I mean, it's brand new. It wouldn't get on the market because we, you one of the pesticide gets it, the license gets it. It's on the market despite what everybody might think. The burden of carrying a reasonable response basically goes onto the golf. All right, Margaret Prosecutors. What you're saying, we can't take them off because they were already on the market and they went on the market. We didn't know that. That's, that's the paradox. Is it fair to say more than there are laws on the books that are putting, all of us particularly are filled quickly, quickly while Dr. Warren Law, which requires him to balance the health risks to the public against the economic benefits to the growers, Congressman Juries of course, but why is the flu?

Speaker 2:          19:55          Because our laboratory animal not being pulled off the market. Jack, you'd like to take it off the but the manufacturer oil. It makes us capable of good, successful. Let us show. That's his job. He's with the environment I all wasting away a kid and then the benefit that he drinks so much apple juice, preschoolers race 18 times where apple, who's done his or her mother. If those apples, the cancer risk is, hi John Hathaway, he's a senior attorney for the natural resources defense council agent news. But Aka going to cause cancer children with a lot of time you chemical, which makes the design under the three our declined to be interviewed for this record or in the letter they said, [inaudible] give you that exists is negligible nonetheless, preliminary results from your own study already young high levels of cancer in the laboratory to say defendant's counsel has completed the most careful study. Yeah, it will be effective in that aside. And seven 30 what, what the level of cancer, what that means is that one. What about parents? [inaudible] one [inaudible] [inaudible] it doesn't cost. You kind of need to send his children would be, it was several hundred times. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:57          I'm sorry. This will take just one second.

Speaker 2:          23:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:11          So think about what Janet Hathaway, the senior attorney just said over a lifetime. One child that out of every 4,000 or so of our preschoolers will develop cancer from just these eight pesticides. I think about the wording. The phrasing got very carefully. This is quantitative risk assessment. It's loaded with uncertainty from many different sources. You're, you're forced to infer from animal evidence. You're forced to, to, uh, uh, understand, uh, the, the pattern of exposure, uh, how the compound might behave inside the human body. Uh, then she said, Al are the most potent con cancer causing and our food supply as a substance sprayed on apples to keep them on the trees longer. Uh, and what we're talking about is a cancer causing agent used on food that EPA knows is going to cause cancer for thousands of children, uh, over their lifetime. These are our, uh, statements a of, of certainty, uh, that, uh, caused widespread fear in the population.

Speaker 1:          24:04          Senator Joe Lieberman spoke to me, uh, uh, during this situation and he said he walked immediately after watching 60 minutes over to his refrigerator, he took out his jar of apple juice and dumped it down the drain and started making phone calls. This happened to all over the country is millions of people who had witnessed this, a Jack Moore, uh, who you saw the acting EPA administrator said, uh, that the evidence, yes, uh, that he relied upon was suitable for a decision to say that Al r and D was a carcinogen. And the media reaction was really quite striking. Uh, all of the major media outlets pick this story up. Newsweek, et Cetera, Donahue on the Donahue show. Uh, he said, don't look now, but we're poisoning our kids. Uh, the consumer reaction was really quite a rapid and a devastating for the apple industry. A apple product sales dropped 30% in a month, uh, particularly on apple juice school boards in New York and Virginia and California stop serving apples in their lunch programs.

Speaker 1:          25:06          Uh, growers claimed losses of $250 million and engaged, uh, they engage in a lawsuit against both 60 minutes as well as the natural resources defense council. Uh, within a matter of six months. The economic, uh, uh, concerns were so high that the industry itself was begging EPA to please regulate and prohibit the use of this chemical. Now that's really quite striking. So that you've got a really, a, kind of a very different type of regulatory theory here. Uh, what is regulation doing? Uh, it's really providing a sense of legitimacy to manufacturers of different kinds of products so that if you know that a chemical or product didn't, it could be a food, it could be a car, uh, if you know that it's been reviewed by, by a regulatory agency, uh, that act of regulation a really constitutes certification of that products, a utility and also its safety in the marketplace.

Speaker 1:          26:04          So the fact that the, uh, uh, the, the growers and the grocery stores and even Uniroyal asked Epa to move quickly, uh, so that the economic damage, uh, would be limited and consumer confidence could be restored, particularly because this product was not used on all apple products. So it really is a form of symbolic politics, which I think is quite striking. Uh, so that, uh, regardless of whether or not the regulations are health protective, uh, they create a sense of legitimacy of products and services in the marketplace. So that in one sense, uh, are our corporations need these regulations, uh, so that, uh, they, they, uh, create consumer confidence. So the Washington apple growers, there are 4,700 of them claimed that while there was no evidence linking Al already human cancer and the animal evidence was insufficient, uh, and they called this a, uh, product disparagement, trade libel case.

Speaker 1:          27:00          Uh, and in this situation, the growers face the burden of proof. So they needed to prove that the statements were made knowingly, uh, and to be false, the statements were deliberately made to induce monetary damage. And this is a form of trade libel law, defamation. Uh, so there are, there are several forms of, of uh, uh, libel slander and sedition libel. A, the definition is defamation through print materials. Slander is oral defamation, ah, in the English common law, tradition, libel and private enterprise, I generally found favorably to a plaintiffs. And sedition you'll recall is any political criticism that tended to diminish respect for government laws and public officials.

Speaker 1:          27:47          Common law definition of libel, I was decided, uh, uh, by, uh, a famous court case in 1933. It covers all written communications that tend to expose one to public hatred, Shame Co Obloquy, uh, cartoon Lee, uh, Odm contempt, ridicule aversion, ostracism, degradation or disgrace, and to induce and evil opinion, uh, of one in the minds of right thinking persons into the pride, one of their confidence and friendly intercourse in society. Well, in this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, uh, found, uh, on the absence of human studies at the fact that there have been no studies conducted specifically on the cancer risks to children from diminish side. One of the arguments on the part of the industry that does nothing to disprove the conclusion that of children consume more of a carcinogenic substance than do adults. They are at higher risk for contracting cancer. So what's interesting about this comment by the appellate court is that they're not looking for proof that this chemical caused cancer in children. They're looking for elevated cancer risk.

Speaker 1:          28:53          And on the falsity of the statements, uh, uh, product disparagement, plaintiff has the burden of proving the falsity. Uh, and this statement refers to individuals not to the, any overall message. And if a jury were given the task of interpreting the uncertain Eva a message, uh, it raises the specter of a chilling effect on speech. So, uh, think about, uh, the relationship between, uh, uh, uh, this type of a court case and the freedom of the individual to express themselves or express their opinion about the dangers of different products or, or human behaviors. Uh, so this case was decided by the night circuit fundamentally on a First Amendment, a choice referring back to a, a famous New York Times versus Sullivan case in 1964. We're Sullivan who was a police in Alabama, uh, brought a libel action against four African American clergy and the New York Times. Uh, the times had published an advertisement back in 1960, uh, in supportive of a civil rights activism among students, uh, a struggle for the right to vote, a legal defense of Martin Luther King against a perjury charge and charges of repressive police misconduct, including false statements.

Speaker 1:          30:07          And the trial judge had instructed the jury that the advertisement was liable, liable is that a legal injury was implied that falsity and malice or presumed. And the punitive damages should be awarded. So that in this case, the Supreme Court found that constitutionally deficient. It was constitutionally deficient for failure to safeguard freedom of speech. And the press are required by the first and the 14th amendment and debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, wide open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic and sharp attacks on government and public officials with respect to actual malice. Because in order to, to find a disparagement, uh, or liability in this situation, uh, there's a need to demonstrate actual malice. The constitutional guarantees require a federal rule that prohibits, prohibits a public official from recovering damages for defamatory false hood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice. What's malice? Well, it's with knowledge that, uh, the claim was false when it was made or with reckless disregard of whether it was false, false, and the burden of demonstrating the falsity a rests on the planet.

Speaker 1:          31:23          Now this seems to give the media a fairly wide berth and the kinds of claims that they can make in the wake of this case, uh, many states passed what are thought of now and, and, uh, labeled as Veggie libel laws. So that rather than placing the burden on a, uh, a plaintiff to demonstrate, uh, uh, the falsity of the statement, uh, they placed the burden on the individual that makes the claim of significant risk or hazard. So there are many states that have adopted the statutory change. And what this means is that it opens the way for slap suits. Uh, what does a slap suit? It basically is a suit that intimidates people, uh, from making claims about, uh, uh, the, the quality of the environment or causes of its loss or a subsequent health damages. So, uh, among these 20 or so states that have adopted these laws, for example, now I will not give a lecture a where I'm making a claim of risk, uh, so that what might be thought of as a chilling effect on free speech in a way.

Speaker 1:          32:32          So if I'm, uh, uh, say, uh, being taped on a radio show, that radio show is broadcast in a, in a, a state where, where one of these veggie libel laws exist, that would place the burden on me to demonstrate the proof, uh, that my claim is, is uh, uh, backed up by high quality science, uh, that will pull me into court. It will cost me thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars even, uh, to, to uh, defend myself. So that the influence of, of this, this form of, of law, uh, is really quite striking. What also is interesting about this, this evolution of state laws that, that a reverse, the burden of proof is that clearly it's been found by the Supreme Court is being, uh, an unconstitutional shift in the burden. Yet none of these state laws have been taken up to the Supreme Court for, for consideration. So think, think about that.

Speaker 1:          33:29          Uh, these laws had been in place now for well over a decade and, uh, uh, all environmental groups, uh, all public health interest groups understand the nature of these laws and they're all very self conscious. About the nature of the claims that they make. Now I want to show you this. Uh, Oprah Winfrey, ah, had a Ho had hosted a show on mad cow disease. Mad cow disease is a, a, an illness that is caused by a prion and believe to be associated with beef that are fed other cattle parts, uh, in their, in their, uh, cattle meal. So Winfrey hosted Howard Lyman, uh, who described the process of, of a slaughter houses and a beef rendering and how the parts were ground up, uh, and then, uh, put into animal feed and fed back in the United States to a, to cattle that were sold for food. Uh, and this was the, the, uh, mechanism that, uh, uh, he and others believed had had caused the outbreak of mad cow disease in Great Britain. Now there are laws that prevent that from happening, but at this point in time, this represents another, a rather interesting case on, on a product disparagement

Speaker 2:          38:39          Well, we we're taking, we refill. Took about two hours. When we got it done, I said, give me 10 minutes. I'll just came to me and said, so I went about my business a couple of weeks later. Got a call.

I don't know how many of you ever been to Amarillo infections. It's not the end of the world. Clearly visible.

Speaker 2:          39:56          You're going to give the world, take the hose and we're rural Texas. The water who said employer and rural Texas happens to be the slaughter facility killing bumper stickers all over town on sending me the only bad cut on the Texas. His name. I knew we were in trouble and I don't want you to solve them. We need a change of venue, the way the world, but if we could win, so we file with the judge where it change the basically when you walk in, because the devil, 72 year old lady up tuffle knackered. We asked for, we've been used to picks up the hammer, slaps it down, says emotions and I bring it to the jury pool. They're going 140 people and you never saw so many hats. Boots in the boat will hopes and all your life. I said to my lawyer, we may need to file an appeal because there's a world of look in the window here. [inaudible] was a big head call. Drew's absolutely steeped in the cattle culture. What lawyer you put 78 he said the call calling you to the spanner tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          41:19          He said, the first question [inaudible] I said, I could have left. You said you damn well better. We'll lose who the point of some turning is. Looking at the new laughing and giggling and he says Kevin Hart to say this but determinative [inaudible] apologize for something that is saving my life. Never again. Kyle did. They ever asked me about Turner, but they asked me every question that you can have that I want on the sale of the owner looks at me and he says, anybody ever called you responsible? I said, yes. My lawyer was sitting over there going, no, no, no. The plaintiff's attorney, he thinks he's keeping the Gordon uses home. I said mine majority is over there and been there, done that. We were in that courtroom for six weeks. At the end of the six weeks that jury found the Oprah Harpo production of myself not allowable plane is when other the trinity.

Speaker 2:          42:50          They couldn't imagine that during that home room cause fine out with toddlers appeal with the Fifth Circuit Court of thing. We spent a year in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and at the end of the year they came down with a group of us pill. The sooner the overall production of myself or not allowable and then they wrote an opinion of it said every fanged on the land and set up. The show was truthful and it is not actionable. The California couldn't stand up that as the war or retail. It was the knowledge that account is what the shape court file Souvik as oil production and myself and seek court and God are you at in Texas? I was with a woman from the city of course, but the federal court, they people back, we said six years, hundreds of thousands of dollars on mine. Ranomi definitive to tell the truth at the end of secures is doing the fucking threw up the case with prejudice, the jury front of the complainants who not. And we filed the case that sent you the little pictures of a little bit of, again, we're standing. Tell them.

Speaker 3:          44:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:44          So the core of this problem is the way that these state veggie libel law shift the burden of proof. So under federal law, it's really clear that uh, the cattleman's association was under the, the burden of proof to demonstrate the statement was knowingly false and deliver with malice with the intent to harm. But under state law, uh, Oprah's burden was to demonstrate that the statement is true with reasonable certainty. So I'll leave you with one thought on this. And, uh, the importance of fashioning law in a way that would protect, uh, free speech and open access to knowledge of risk and opinions on the part of experts. A Justice Powell in 1974 on truth and free speech, there's no such thing as a false idea. No matter how pernicious and opinion may seem, we depend on it's correction. Uh, not on the conscience of judges and juries, but on the competition of other ideas. So that's it for today. Have a great weekend.
