Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, let me start in. This lecture is about national security and it's about the conflict that's evolved during the 20th century between national security and environmental quality and human health. Uh, so I want to explore that because so much money in the world is spent on national security and it has the potential to, to, uh, invade individual rights to diminish personal freedom, uh, to diminish privacy. Uh, at the same time, it has a potential to concentrate power and authority among elites, political elites, a wealthy elites, a technical leads, uh, and so that it's threatening to a democratic participation and policymaking in a variety of ways. Uh, and as we move through the course, you'll find that secrecy is not just an issue, that we need to figure out how to manage better in the public sector relative to classified information. And this is the topic of today's session, but it's also a critical issue in the private sector.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Uh, the growing use of confidential business information. Uh, the Goo goo growing obscurity of product ingredients as a globalized markets cause products and services to across national borders, uh, without any clear identity about a components or potential effects. So national security and environmental quality. I want you to think about this case and other cases that we deal with as a, a problem of managing intelligence. I'm not meaning to imply that other people are not intelligence. I'm thinking about intelligent and a meaning to, uh, hopefully get you to think about the idea of a legal system that would produce a public that was literate and capable of understanding the quality of the environment around them. Uh, what's threatening and what's not, so that potentially they could, they could manage their exposure to a, to chemicals, they could manage, uh, the effect of human behavior on, on a, uh, a variety of environmental issues such as endangered species.

Speaker 1:          02:04          So the, the, the purpose for the title of my book that I'm having you read you poor things, uh, is, is, uh, the idea of thinking about the origin of knowledge. You know, where do we get the information, where do we get the data? Where do we get the knowledge? Who produces it? Uh, and what we'll see today is that a knowledge about the environmental effects of national security or produced predominantly by the Defense Department, uh, they control sites are they control the technology, uh, in weaponry and weapons delivery systems, uh, making it extremely difficult for the public to understand really what the dangers might be. Where does the knowledge flow? Is it intelligible, uh, is it understood the distinction between, is it intelligible and is it understood, is really critical? It involves a literacy, it, uh, involves educational background, uh, technical competence and who owns it?

Speaker 1:          03:00          This is really a key question for law. Uh, you can think about this in terms of it being an intellectual property, right? Question. Should the public own it? Uh, should the public be able to keep, should the government be able to keep the knowledge from the public? Uh, should the private sector be allowed to own it and should they be allowed to keep knowledge from the public? So think about it as a problem of understanding production and flow of knowledge. Uh, because environmental quality is always going to be elusive until we, we, uh, create a public that really is a far more intelligent, so to speak, uh, understanding, uh, than it currently is. So what are the purposes of secrecy? And I'm kind of fascinated by, uh, uh, the growing a classification of information in the public sector so that, uh, in in US history, never before has the government been classifying more information than it is today.

Speaker 1:          03:52          You know, at the same time, there's a very interesting, uh, uh, cultural, uh, change that we're witnessing in your generation, uh, related to Facebook. I mean, I've never seen a generation be so interested in revealing secrets or information about themselves as your generation is so disconnected and in a way between government policy and what's going on that, uh, uh, in, in social circles among younger generations. How do terror and warfare depended upon secrecy when to secrecy threaten national security? One, is secrecy necessary for national security? Uh, and how is it related to individual rights? These are key questions that I hope you'll keep in mind as we move through this lecture today. They're common scripts in environmental history, no matter whether or not you consider this case or the case of an endangered species. A case of, of uh, uh, managing water quality, managing a sustainable agriculture who knew about the problem, who knew about contaminants in this case?

Speaker 1:          04:56          When did they know, when do they inform the public and what do they do about the problem? These are critical questions and secrecy is a central component of all of them. So that the history that I want to go through today is really one that is very brief. It only spans the period between 1944 and 1963. So in this period, uh, the atomic weapons, the first atomic weapons were designed and tested. The first one at Los Alamos, New Mexico in 1945 followed by two, uh, uses of atomic weapons. The only two aggressive uses in, in a world history or one on Hiroshima and the other on Nagasaki killing hundreds of thousands of people and resulting in injuries and death and heritable Muterric stations, uh, that, uh, have, has affected generations of Japanese. Uh, so this compressed period is really quite striking. Now why in the world would we be talking about this issue?

Speaker 1:          05:59          Uh, which seems so old now. It's part of the Cold War, uh, in, in a class on a current environmental law and policy. Well, I'll tell you a bit of a story. In, uh, 2003 I was in the [inaudible] real book library and if, I don't know if you have visited the Beinecke Library, uh, but, uh, it really is a remarkable place. It's got a wonderful rich store of information, especially on the American West. Uh, but I found out just by surfing the net that they also have all of Rachel Carson's original research material. Now, Rachel Carson wrote silent spring, uh, and the sea around us and a number of other books and his rather famous in that, uh, environmental history, uh, particularly for her work trying to get the public to wake up about the dangers of pesticides, especially related to wildlife because she was a wildlife biologist working for the fish and wildlife service.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Well, it turns out that all of her original research materials, including about 120 boxes of material, are stored in the, in the basement of a key library. So going through those, as I was trying to understand the history of pesticides, uh, I found one file that was on nuclear weapons testing. Uh, and that file was incredibly dense. Uh, and as she, as she had conducted a research, by the way, it's very different than what we do today, uh, which when our research is almost all electronic, uh, she would hand copy material. There were no copy machines, uh, that she, she had access to at that point in time. Uh, and then she would write notes, little side notes, interpreting it as you went along. So going through this, I realized that, that all of her work on pesticides where she wondered what happened to them once they were released, uh, where they went, how did they make their way into the soil?

Speaker 1:          07:46          Why we'll wildlife, uh, the canaries in the, uh, in the mind, in a sense. Uh, what were the wildlife telling us about human hazards in human risk? Uh, and, and what was wrong with current law and policy, uh, that would allow that kind of release and a non accountability on the part of, of the private sector. So she learned that way of thinking, uh, that, uh, that narrative logic, uh, she learned that, uh, not by studying pesticides, by looking at the history of the Atomic Energy Commission in the 1950s and how they came to understand a radionuclides and what happened to them and the kind of threat they posed to water quality, to air quality, how they got into wildlife, how they got into human tissue. So this is a story of today. So the idea that a, the success in any of these cases is dependent upon very high quality science is a very important idea.

Speaker 1:          08:41          And remember what I said the other day, that, uh, perhaps 95% of the science, uh, in the field of environmental science is conducted in the private sector, never sees the light of day. Well, in this case, this is the, the best example of state science at an enormous scale. The Atomic Energy Commission, uh, had an unlimited budget. They had unlimited authority, uh, and they had a unlimited capacity to tell a story about a danger and, and, uh, the, the importance of pursuing a atomic weapons development in order to protect national security. So this time span just gives you the number of tests per year, uh, between 1945 or actually the number of explosions, 1945. And then 1960 to 1963, president Kennedy, uh, worked too with the Soviets to, to pass the limited test ban treaty. And since that time, uh, uh, an atmospheric testing has been severely limited, no nuclear test worldwide between 45 and in [inaudible] 96, uh, roughly about 2000, maybe about 2,400.

Speaker 1:          09:51          After 1963, the majority of tests or the number of tests actually went up, uh, but most of them went underground. So underground testing has allowed, and we'll see later on in the, and the lecture, uh, that, uh, there have been certain parts of the world that, uh, it's, it's been agreed, uh, among nations that had this nuclear capacity, uh, to avoid testing. So outerspace is now off limits. Uh, testing in the South Pacific is now off limits because it was the site of, of of many highly intense tests, uh, of, of, uh, hydrogen bonds. And also a testing in the, on the Poles is, is a restricted by international agreement. So this is a very limited period of time and many people don't understand where these tests were conducted. Some of the South Atlantic Salmon, Mississippi, uh, some in Japan, New Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, uh, the Nevada test site, Johnson island, Christmas Island, a new attack in Bikini, which are part of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. I'll be speaking more about this and show you some film clips, uh, on, uh, next Tuesday when we reconvene.

Speaker 1:          11:01          One interesting aspect of this history was the behavior of clouds. Fuchs, uh, who was a theoretical scientist working at Los Alamos on the development of the first weapon, the first atomic bomb during what is known as the Manhattan project. And he had access to top secret material, uh, a very, very highly skilled, uh, a physicist and he passed most of what he knew onto the Soviets in the late 1940s. So he was tried and convicted of espionage and Britain in the 1950s and he served nine years out of a 14 year sentence. This is fascinating to me and think about the nature of the sanction here so that the Soviets gained their understanding of, of how the U S, uh, produced nuclear weapons and gained an understanding of, of what our strategy was, uh, how we were testing it, how were we were monitoring the effects, what the intensity of the radiation was. And the man, uh, serves only nine years in prison

Speaker 1:          11:57          lesson is kind of curious. Uh, most secrets have very short lives and the more valuable they are, uh, the more limited is her life. So I think about the idea of creating a secret as creating a property, right? And so it creates a property, right? Uh, and it's value is, is a dependent on many aspects, uh, of its, of its character. And A, we'll explore that as we move through the power of explosions on the Bikini atoll in the South Pacific is something to take note of a next Tuesday. We'll come back to this story, uh, where the bikini islanders were removed from their island, uh, through negotiation and the use of eminent domain. And then the u s, uh, proceeded to a test about 25, 26 different nuclear weapons, including the, uh, the Bravo test in 1954 a that I'll show you a clip of a in which was one of the largest bombs ever exploded by the u s in the atmosphere.

Speaker 2:          12:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:00          The Atomic Energy Commission, uh, created what they called Project Gabriel, uh, evolved to be called project sunshine. Uh, that lasted between 1949 and 1961. So project, sunset sunshine, I became famous and it was the, a collection of scientists and the government, uh, uh, working with the atomic energy commission based predominantly at the University of Chicago and Columbia University, the Lamont laboratories. So scientists were given, uh, you know, virtually unlimited funds to conduct research that would help the atomic energy commission. Understand the power of their different weapons. And there's some 200 different types of, of nuclear weapons eventually that were, were designed, uh, and, uh, some, uh, uh, so large that they had to redesign aircraft in order to, to handle the weight and others so small that they could be tactically carried in a suitcase, uh, and, and, uh, be used under a field conditions that were very difficult. A different delivery mechanisms, a delivery by aircraft delivery, by missile, a delivery by a artillery, a delivery by suitcase.

Speaker 1:          14:06          So that, uh, you know, a variety of different types of bombs have different strengths. And, uh, we're, we're designed for different, uh, uh, types of warfare. So the sunshine scientist really ramped up in the early 1950s. And what's interesting is the way that they thought about environmental science, uh, they wondered what happened to the radionuclides no, where do they go when a bomb explodes? What happens? Well, you know, dust particles get blown up into the atmosphere. Uh, if you drop a bomb and shallow water, it will take, uh, uh, the material on the bottom of the water. It will take the fish. Then it will basically blow everything up and the coral up into the end of the atmosphere. Uh, it will also, uh, uh, kill any birds that, uh, are in close proximity. So test has a story about a bird's raining from the sky on fire. Uh, it will also cause a pattern of movement in the atmosphere that depends very much upon climate and wind conditions. Uh, and the power of the bomb determines how high up into the atmosphere of the particles get. So dozens and dozens of different new clients or created a that some of which had never been recognized before.

Speaker 1:          15:16          So trying to figure this out, one of the first things they did was they set up a monitoring system that makes sense if you want to figure out where something is going. He set up a monitoring system. In this case it was rather simplistic, uh, around, uh, the Nevada test site north of Las Vegas, about 65 miles. And people used to cluster on top. So the casinos and the hotels in the evening to watch the, uh, the bombs explode or get up really early in the morning to watch the bombs explode, a highly visible, given the, the clear climate. So they set up their monitors and they, they presume that a, or they'd captured the dispersal of Rec, uh, radiation. Uh, and then they began to get reports. Our reports came in from different parts of the country. Uh, some in North Dakota from people that were mining for uranium, uh, that, uh, had carried Geiger counters.

Speaker 1:          16:06          And a one minor, uh, was, was telling a story where he was eating dinner at his campfire with his guy or counter that he forgot to turn off and the Geiger counter stopped, started to spit, split out, and he, Shit, ah, boy, you know, I've got to have this thing serviced. It's, it must be out of tune. It must be a detecting something that a is not there. So he took it in to have it serviced and found out that it was, it was actually, uh, in, in great tune and didn't need to be recalibrated and went back to his site and it happened again. So he realized that, uh, gradually that something was going on in the atmosphere. It wasn't measuring anything in the mine or a in nearby rock because it, it normally in that place would be a, would be silent. He was picking up radionuclides that were raining down in North Dakota.

Speaker 1:          16:54          A Polaroid became important in the process of understanding the distribution Polaroid film company, uh, because it's film was found to be exposed when it arrived at doctor's offices and hospitals in different parts of the world. And at that point in time, they used to to, uh, put, uh, the Polaroid film, uh, the, uh, you know, eight and a half by 11 sheets into boxes and then they would pack the boxes, you know, not with the Styrofoam kernels that we use today that will never go away. Uh, but instead they used to pack it with corn husks. So gradually they, uh, uh, figured it out because they could see in some cases, uh, the image of the Corn Husk, uh, on top of the, the, uh, the film matching directly. So what was happening? Well, the radionuclides, we're intersecting a cloud. They were raining down in this case, in the Midwestern part of the United States, uh, where the box had been and the corn husks, uh, we're exposing the film because they had absorbed the radionuclides.

Speaker 1:          17:54          So they realized gradually that their donut 200 miles in diameter around Las Vegas was a completely inappropriate to capture the scale of this problem. This is a very important lesson in environmental science and environmental policy policy. It's like, uh, uh, you know, the, uh, uh, the, the analogy of the drunk leaning on a, a light post looking for his, uh, his car keys. Uh, why is he looking under the light post? That's because that's where the light is a, so that there are many, many different stories about the failure of environmental science, uh, and the ineffectiveness of environmental law that flow from this problem of misunderstanding the need for a very sensitive sampling design. In this case, the stokes test in 1957 put radionuclides into the atmosphere, but they started moving in different directions at different altitudes. Ooh, there's an interesting idea that's novel. Uh, no one thought about that before.

Speaker 1:          18:52          So here are the dashed line at the bottom is moving at 30,000 feet, whereas it just nix the southeast side of Idaho. Uh, whereas the dust at 10,000 feet shoots all the way up to Montana, then it arcs up over southern Canada, comes back over the Great Lakes, and you see that arc of the dashed line coming and breakdown across lake Champlain and the New York, Vermont border, the Massachusetts New York border, and then the Connecticut border. Well, that's pretty interesting. Uh, another test that they followed created dust clouds that, uh, again, we're driven by weather patterns. And you see in this case that a at 30,000 feet, one swirled around Texas for about a week, another one swooped all the way at 20,000 feet down into Florida and probably would have been detected in if they had rainstorms in Florida at the time of the dust dust cloud that got there, that would have been detectable.

Speaker 1:          19:45          And in the orange, orange is an orange juice and a in orange oils, uh, so that, uh, crops were being threatened and exposed and in a variety of different ways that a, we're being driven by weather patterns and we all know that even today it's hard to predict what the weather's going to be a within 36 hours in many parts of the country. So that, uh, the, the, the state of weather forecasting back at this time was quite primitive. Uh, so that basically told these scientists and, and again, I can just imagine what they were doing sitting across the table looking at each other. How are we gonna manage this? What's going to happen if the public understands this? How are we going to maintain our political support for the, the weapons testing program so that we can keep on building these weapons to contain the Soviet sorta to strike fear into their hearts following their policy of deterrence.

Speaker 1:          20:36          The bigger the bomb, the less likely we are to be attacked by a other nations that would understand that an attack would be simply suicide. Well, here is a chart which is an amalgamation of different, uh, uh, bomb blasts in the pathways that they took. A and the darkest areas are areas that received the highest doses of radiation. And, uh, these new Clyde's have half lives that vary between, uh, uh, roughly, uh, uh, three to four weeks up to a 40, 50, a hundred years. Uh, so that if you went to the, to the center of the country in, in Iowa and you took a test of the soil, you could still detect many of these radionuclides in the soil and they are transferable from soil to crops and, and up to, uh, to fruits. So that, uh, this patchiness and fallout was eventually recognized by the Atomic Energy Commission in the mid 1950s and gradually, you know, once this information was declassified in the early 1990s.

Speaker 1:          21:39          And the only reason I'm telling you this story is because most of this knowledge was eventually declassified. I couldn't be here, which is kind of an interesting thought. I couldn't be here right now telling you the story. Uh, had the declassification process not, not occurred under the Clinton administration, uh, once they realized that that the atomic energy commission that kept all this information, uh, from the public when they really had no national security logic to do so. So here is a, a, uh, a map of the United States constructed by the National Cancer Institute, uh, in the late 1990s, uh, that tick the dose estimates that they got from the soils because they could calculate back, calculate the concentrations from existing concentrations and knowing the decay rate of different new Clyde's. And they develop this map of, of expected doses. And then, uh, the, the cancer institutes started asking questions, uh, because they understood the dose response relationship for radiation.

Speaker 1:          22:31          And these new Clyde's is really pretty clear. This is not like a, you know, you have to drink, uh, 10,000 cans of Diet soda to absorb Enough Sacrum to, uh, to, to elevate your cancer risk a little bit. Uh, this is, uh, this is a science that, uh, uh, are, uh, evolved in the 1950s largely because of, of the importance to the military, uh, that understood the dose response relationship, uh, quite clearly. So, but understanding a dose response relationship ship meaning, let's see, the best way to explain dose response relationship if you, if it's not familiar to you, is to, uh, uh, especially for college students is to think about, uh, uh, a six pack of beer. So he six pack of Beer, you have one beer and you know, you might feel a little bit of it. Uh, you have two beers, two beers within 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          23:22          I know you'd never do that. Uh, you have three beers within 20 minutes. Uh, you have six beers within a an hour. Uh, so that, uh, the, the effect that you feel the effect on your body, uh, depends upon the dose and the concentration that you're actually a circulating in your system. So they understood this relationship, uh, with great clarity with respect to these radionuclides so that the cancer estimates really are quite robust. One interesting thing is that if you look at the pattern of testing that really it peaked in the late 1950s, uh, so that, uh, you see, you see, uh, this is radionuclides in rainwater and then there was an agreement not to test for a period of two years. And you see that the rain water levels decline. It's in the rainwater. Hmm. That's interesting. It's in the rainwater. What does that mean for a fish?

Speaker 1:          24:13          What does it mean for rivers? What does it mean for, uh, parts of the West that a experience, high levels of snowpack? Well, it means that a snowpack, uh, for example, uh, Jackson, Wyoming, a couple of years ago, a Jackson Hole, Wyoming received more than 600 inches of snow in, in one year. And in a matter of a about a month, uh, in, in the period between April and a late May, uh, you get basically warmer weather melting all the snow. So in this period of time, you get this rush, you get this pulse of radioactive water that moves into a stream. And Lo and behold, where could you test that? Well, you could test that in the supermarket where, and in what supermarket and Salmon Supermarkets, Trod supermarket buying Trenton sooner supermarket, you could find, uh, uh, these levels increasing in the, in the Columbia River, uh, that goes by the Hanford uranium enrichment plant, plutonium enrichment plant in Washington and the state of Washington.

Speaker 1:          25:13          So the water levels concentrations were going up because the rainwater concentration, we're going up and the fish concentrations were going up. Uh, and also people that were drinking water out of wells that were fed underground by the aquifer from the Hanford area, they were also being exposed. The per capita dose was calculated as well. And you see the, uh, the dip between 1960 January of 1960, uh, and, uh, late 1962 during the, uh, uh, agreed, uh, cessation of testing. So this information was, was really quite, quite robust. So project sunshine, uh, basically pieced together this idea that these new Clyde's were in global circulation. Uh, they were contaminating every aspect of our environment, uh, and they were making their way into humans and particularly, uh, uh, they were concerned about strontium 90. Because, uh, if you have a diet that is low in calcium, your body's going to absorb more strontium 90 into your bone.

Speaker 1:          26:12          Uh, also, if you have, uh, uh, uh, a diet that's low in iodine, your thyroid is going to absorb more iodine, uh, one 31 than it normally would. So understanding this, uh, uh, this relationship between, uh, uh, calcium and strontium 90 is very important because it eventually led to calcium enrichment of breads a of milk. Uh, so the four fortification program was really, uh, it really had its origination and recommendations by the Atomic Energy Commission. So the public thought, oh, we're just getting more minerals in our, in our diet. Well, that must be a good thing. The nutritionist must be arguing that this makes a lot of sense. Uh, but in reality, what was going on was that the Atomic Energy Commission was a anxiously wringing his hands, recognizing that they've got to figure out how to lower the dose being experienced in the population. The population had no idea what was going on.

Speaker 1:          27:10          So project sunshine scientists, they eventually attained 15,000 bodies, dead bodies, trying to understand the distribution of these, uh, new Clyde's throughout the world. Uh, bodies from New York, San Francisco, Houston, uh, Japan, India, South Africa. Why from other nations? Well, predominantly because they were worried about the other nations, uh, coming back and, and, uh, uh, telling the United States that we were contaminating not only their food supplies, which was going to harm their, their ability to trade products internationally, uh, processed foods, uh, uh, water, uh, just about any kind of of, uh, uh, crop you could think of as well as animals. Uh, so that, uh, gradually over the period between 1955 in 1960, the atomic energy commission, uh, grew to really understand the global distributional pattern. Uh, and how, how people in certain areas of, of Latin America, in tropical areas, we're really experiencing quite high levels of fallout.

Speaker 1:          28:07          Why would that be a tropical rain forest? They experience intense rainfall, uh, so that, uh, the rain was so high that it would, it would concentrate the, the new Clyde's in, in, uh, some of the tropical forest areas. So permission to take the body parts was never sought or obtained. A family members were, were never consulted. Uh, bones were cleaned and packaged and formalin, uh, and then they were crushed and analyzed by laboratory technicians at Columbia and other prestige has us institutions, academic institutions, uh, and sometimes the bones were pooled together. Uh, gradually they decided that they were going to look for geographic variability and there are going to look for age related variability because they were finding that a kids, for some reason we're absorbing more of the radionuclides, especially strontium than the adults were. So why would that be? Cause it's something about their diet.

Speaker 1:          28:58          Was there something about their physiology? Well, it had to do with their, their rate of growth of bone. So kids are, kids are, are growing most rapidly at what point in their lives? Well, uh, from time of conception roughly till the time of 13, but different organ systems and different functions in the body, a mature at different rates. So statute statute for example, is quite linear, although you get this really serious growth curve, um, uh, in, in Utero, and then it goes up gradually, gradually, and then a more steeply, uh, during the early teenage years. So you could figure out the, that were correlated with these periods of rapid growth and development. So, you know, gradually, uh, these secrets started to leak out. Uh, and the US began to study fallout data and once the Soviets had developed their own capacity to make them 10 test a nuclear weapons, the atomic energy commission had this great argument.

Speaker 1:          30:02          Well, there are new collides in our food supply and in our bodies, it's not our fault while we take some responsibility, but it's the Soviets fault. And Soviets were actually testing these weapons up in Siberia. Uh, and so the Siberian radionuclides work tended to come down across Alaska and across Canada and into the, the, uh, western and Midwestern part of the u s so in, in, in threads that are similar to the ones that I showed you from the Nevada test site. So the, the U S was, was trying to at this point, desperately maintain public support for continued testing. Uh, in part because they were wondering, well, you know, what would happen if we did have a, a, a, a nuclear war, you know, what, where would the new Clyde's go and what would our capacity to respond to me? So these were legitimate national security concerns, uh, that they were exploring.

Speaker 1:          30:52          So, uh, the u s began to release some of its information at the same time that a state's started their own testing programs. So you know, just like, um, uh, you find variability and air pollution today from a motor vehicles depending upon climate and, and, uh, we're, our vehicle uses most intense, uh, you find, uh, in this case a states being worried about a specific patterns of concentration in the crops that they grow. Vermont cheese, for example, a or a mid western grains, uh, or a cattle grazed in, uh, in the western us. So Minnesota, Vermont and other states felt like they were environmental hotspots and they, that they're, uh, corporations were being hindered, their capacity to trade, uh, nationally and internationally was being diminished. The U s finally started a, an open test, a of milk for radioactivity in 1957, 12 years after the explosions began, uh, and Linus Pauling who won the Nobel prize for his work on nutrition, particularly related to vitamin C, uh, came out with, with his conclusion that the body really discriminates against strontium and favors calcium uptake if the calcium levels were high enough.

Speaker 1:          32:07          Uh, that prompted the, uh, the addition of a, of a calcium is how I was saying to milk bread and animal feeds as well as fertilizers. So this is quite, quite curious. Surgeon General, uh, for the u s denied that the fallout hazards were serious in, in the New York Times in 1959. And, uh, so there was, there was really quite an open public debate in late in the late fifties, in part that surrounded Eisenhower's campaign to become president again in, in, uh, 1956. And his competitor was his vice president Adelai Stephenson. So Stephenson, uh, basically broke the news that, uh, the atomic energy commission had been hiding this information from the public.

Speaker 1:          32:52          And, uh, in the, in this last minute a campaign effort, uh, he, he claimed that there were genetic hazards to future generation, a risk of bone cancer and, uh, the inability to conduct medical investigations. Now this is interesting. Uh, so that, that, uh, there's exposure that is universal. Everybody's exposed because everybody eats. Uh, and that means that, that you really don't have any opportunity for scientific control group that has unexposed to figure out what the long term health effects might be. 13 yell scientists including Arthur Gauston of the biology department who passed away just a, uh, a few years ago assigned a statement, a endorsing the views of Stevenson. Stevenson lost Eisenhower became president again. And, uh, what was interesting about it is that that, uh, transcripts from his, his, uh, conferences is a national security, uh, team, uh, had been released in the late 1990s as well. And Co and Eisenhower, uh, eventually got to the point where he was telling his staff that, uh, uh, the levels are radionuclides in the milk supply.

Speaker 1:          34:00          The buildup and especially in, in, uh, children's bones was unacceptable and something was going to have to happen. And that prompted him to be more aggressive in trying to, to, uh, negotiate with the Soviets, uh, to, uh, to create some sort of a treaty that would reduce atmospheric testing. So I'm going to jump ahead here so I don't run out of time. The atomic energy commission also was found to have withheld data, recognizing that there were these spikes in the New York City, uh, uh, milk supplies, uh, data that was collected just prior to the election that they understood posed a problem. They held that until weeks after the election. So it's kind of curious that milk became the standard for, for trying to figure out, uh, where the chemicals when, especially powdered buttermilk because it's dehydrated form, uh, it was easy to, to send around the country.

Speaker 1:          34:51          And this chart I think is also interesting because remember that the, the, uh, uh, limited test ban treaty of 1963, uh, really stopped protesting cold. And what you see is a gradual decline, uh, in worldwide, a fallout a represented by strontium 90, and CCM one's 37 and milk. So you see this gradual decline because of the residency time in the atmosphere so that these chemicals, uh, don't, uh, don't all wash out like quickly, uh, after the explosions, they go into global circulation. And there was great debate at the time about, uh, the, the amount of time that they stayed in the atmosphere. And the atomic energy commission was arguing, don't worry about it. They're going to stay in the atmosphere for a long period of time. Why would they use that logic while they, one of the radiation to dissipate? So that by the time the new Clyde's got down to the ground that they wouldn't pose such an intense radiation threat.

Speaker 1:          35:43          Now that's kind of an interesting story. So environmentalist's and, and, uh, public health advocates were arguing, no, you don't understand this pattern of deposition. Uh, it's often, it's often more quickly that it reaches the ground, uh, in a, in a higher concentrate and that higher intensity, uh, of radiation. So that, uh, uh, this story played out over the 1970s and 1980s until gradually, uh, you find, uh, uh, 1995, it really leveling off to what it is today. Curiously, you see the spike and CCM, one 37 in 1987, 1986, 1987. Anybody have any idea what that might be? Chernobyl. Chernobyl released more CCM one 37 to the atmosphere after the explosion that, where the dome with a building, uh, blew off. And, uh, there was a fire that was uncontainable for a period of weeks, spewed more radiation into the atmosphere in the form of cesium one 37. Then many of the earlier atmospheric weapons tests did.

Speaker 1:          36:52          So, um, I began by telling you that, uh, uh, under conditions of secrecy, uh, the people that hold power over the secret, uh, have great narrative advantage. They not only control the, the, the search for the data, they control it's interpretation and they control the story that's told to the general public. And a couple of elements of the story are kind of fun to think about because we'll see these, these, uh, uh, same narratives evolve for pesticides, for plastics, uh, for a variety of different environmental problems. Is the problem human induced, uh, or is it, uh, uh, more important to worry about natural sources, natural sources of radiation? Hm. So you see these comparisons between the dose that you would get by having a, a glass of milk or a having the diet of a trial comparison between that and number of flights that you would take across the United States.

Speaker 1:          37:45          And you probably know that you get a measurable dose of Radiation, uh, when, when you, you're up an aircraft. So this comparison between a human induced, uh, exposure compared to natural exposure. Another, a good example of that would be radon. And in Connecticut we have a problem with radon gas, which is radioactive being admitted, especially from the kind of rock that we have here. And particularly along the coastline. A heading east down here along long island, long island sound. Uh, and my basement, my house for example, we had a radon problem. We're radon gas was a, not just measurable, it was, it was really quite high. So we had to figure out how to remediate that. You dig a hole in your basement floor, you put a little fan and a pipe in and you'd get rid of it. If you don't do that, uh, then you're, you're, you risk exposing your family to, to rate on a, which is a very well known carcinogen.

Speaker 1:          38:33          The estimates of desk from radon exposure in the United States are actually quite high. You know, a 40 to 50,000 people per year are believed to, uh, get lung cancer as a, as a result of radon exposure. So that the comparison of natural sources of radiation to human induced, uh, sources related to national security protection, uh, there's some legitimacy to that and you have to be very careful about it. Also, the idea of relative risk, well, why are we worrying about radiation when we, we should be worrying about other kinds of risks. And we'll see that with respect to pesticides, where, where, uh, you find, uh, say the, the car manufacturers, uh, concerned about, uh, uh, the emission technology requirements under the clean air act for, for, uh, uh, tailpipe emissions, uh, and they, they point other sources, other critical sources of, of a human exposure to air pollutants such as power plants or incinerators.

Speaker 1:          39:29          So this idea of risk comparison, uh, really, uh, was, was well honed in the 1940s and 1950s by the atomic energy commission. And then, excuse me, in that case, uh, the concern was to express the risk relative to, uh, uh, misunderstanding, uh, the, the, uh, implications of, of nuclear war, uh, and, and, uh, not being able to protect the public, uh, from excessive, uh, patterns of exposure that played out by the way, in a variety of pretty unusual ways. Uh, so that, uh, uh, many people in the 1950s built a fallout shelters in their backyard. My neighbors did it. My family never had the, the, the means to do it, but my neighbors had these, these concrete buildings that they built underground. They look a lot like basements and they would store water and food and, and, uh, they would practice their drills where they would run down into the basement.

Speaker 1:          40:23          And, uh, this was especially important during the Cuban missile crisis where we came the closest that we ever have to, to a nuclear war. So the idea of how long do you have to stay in the shelter, uh, to protect yourself? Well, you wouldn't know that unless you had done these atmospheric tests and you understood how the concentrations diminished over a certain period of time. So the idea of relative risk also deserves merit. This is also an interesting time when, uh, the, the first environmentalist, uh, had formed their organizations back in the 1940s and 1950, say tended to be medical doctors. Uh, the very first environmentalist and the, one of the interest groups that you recognize today is consumers union that produces consumer reports, magazine compares a product quality, uh, and uh, often, uh, environmental or health claims and products. So consumer's union was very active in collecting milk, uh, in this case from 48 cities around the world.

Speaker 1:          41:23          No one talked about human milk. And I found this to be quite fascinating. So for the entire decade, uh, no one spoke about, oh, well, you know, if it's getting into cow's milk, why isn't it getting into human milk is getting into human milk. What's the capacity to be transferring these radionuclides across generations via breastfeeding? Well, in part, I think it was a, uh, a shyness, a reluctance to, to talk about breastfeeding in public, which was common at the time, but it was clearly an issue that the atomic energy commission had recognized. And I found a document, it was a document that a was declassified that was produced in 1952, uh, that, uh, that demonstrated quite clearly that the atomic energy commission had made the connection like that it's in cow's milk, it's going to be in human milk. Uh, we know that, uh, these, these compounds are capable of causing mutations in genes and some of those mutations are inheritable.

Speaker 1:          42:21          They can be transferred across generations in addition to the fact that we're exposing, uh, uh, the next generation via via breastmilk in addition to infant formula and milk and other, other parts of a, of a small child or an infant food supply. Also, uh, the, the group saying became famous at this point in time, uh, a group that was politically active to protect pregnant women. And this history is the first history, uh, in the 20th century where children's health became a logic for more, uh, for a, uh, a stronger set of regulations and rules relative to a meeting, something that, uh, could be thought of as dangerous to the, to the atmosphere. Uh, so, uh, gradually, uh, by the end of the decade, the Atomic Energy Commission recognize that does strontium 90 accumulated in soils, it accumulated in foods it accumulated in kids, they knew how to calculate with a cancer risk was because they understood the dose response relationship.

Speaker 1:          43:17          So they were basically sitting on a gold mine of knowledge that they had kept from the public, uh, as best they could during this period of time. So here's a list of 60 years of experimentation with nuclear weapons. 43 years, 45 years of negotiation. And you see the Antarctic Treaty, the agreement not to conduct the testing and the Arctic. This is common heritage for all of mankind, so to speak. You see, the hotline agreement, uh, before, uh, a nuclear war, uh, was, was, uh, uh, initiated. There was an agreement, uh, to call up a, the Soviets and, uh, try a last minute to attempt it. Negotiation, the limited test ban treaty that I just described, the outer space treaty, uh, the, the, uh, seabed treaty, it's not legal to, to, uh, conduct experiments in the seabed. Uh, uh, so that, uh, common property around the world is, is now protected by international treaty.

Speaker 1:          44:11          Uh, however the United States is testing, uh, at a rate that, uh, uh, is never been less, uh, the testing, however, the majority of it is underground. And I'll show you a clip next next week of, uh, some underground tests, uh, that, uh, uh, created earthquakes in different parts of the world, uh, particularly in Alaska. And we also see a very curious effect where these former testing sites, uh, were eventually translated into fish and wildlife reserves. So that's another interesting thing to try to explain and I'm going to close today with one more thought for you. This entire story unfolded between 1945 in 1963. Uh, the environmental protection agency was created in 1970 in the safe drinking water act was created in 1976 so there was absolutely no protection. There was no monitoring of public water supplies through this entire period of time. Uh, the clean air act was not in existence, so that there was no, there was no protection against, uh, the radionuclides as air pollutants are air contaminants.

Speaker 1:          45:18          And finally, in 1976, the environmental protection agency set an acceptable radioactivity limit for drinking water of one millisievert or that can be translated into 0.1 rim per year. How about reading that nuclides and food? Uh, one would think that this history, uh, would provide a very good logic for establishing limits for radionuclides and food. Uh, but you know, as the Chernobyl event in 1986, uh, unfolded, we realized that we were not alone and not having any sort of limits for radionuclides and food. Uh, neither did any of the European Union nations. So trade was completely disrupted. Uh, tens of billions of dollars of food was lost following the Chernobyl event because Italy had one standard for, for acceptable a contamination, whereas Germany had another, uh, they're all the nations had different standards. But just keep this in mind that the United States still has no maximum permit, maximum permissible limits. The takeaway point here, simply when secrecies combined with the absence of environmental and health surveillance [inaudible] the public opinion and politics favor the development of hazardous technologies. In this case, uh, this knowledge was controlled by elites and then relate, released selectively to an unknowing public, uh, in an attempt to, to encourage them to a favor continued atomic weapons testing.
