Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Everyone first, thank you for coming out on such a blustery day. If you've not picked up your exam from your teaching fellow, uh, you can do that after class today. And we're switching gears. We're moving from a questions about how to manage chemicals in the environment to questions about how to affect conservation and also especially how to allocate and manage land use, uh, and various natural resources associated with landscapes. And today I'm gonna use an example, uh, a history of a conservation effort in New York state, uh, known as the Adirondack Park that has a conservation, uh, uh, history that now spans almost 130 years, one of the oldest parks in the nation. And it contains many terrific examples of a variety of different strategies to conserve resources and to protect the land. Now, no matter where you are in the world, then if you're interested in managing land use, uh, and managing ecosystems or biological resources, there a variety of questions that I'd encourage you ask.

Speaker 1:          01:12          You know, one is first to become familiar with property rights. How are they defined? Who has rights to which types of resources? And in this case, it'll become clear that it's important for you to think about property not as a thing. Uh, but as a set of social relationships, a property is often defined in law as a bundle, a bundle of rights. Uh, but if I have a right that's defined and protected by law, uh, than others have an obligation. So you can't really think about rights in the absence of consideration of obligations. And if you violate your obligation, the concept behind a property right is that the state or some level of government will have the capacity to monitor, to discover the defect, uh, to enforce sanctions. Uh, so the second question that, uh, you need to consider is what is the appropriate level of government to institute protective policy?

Speaker 1:          02:15          Uh, should local governments have this ability? Often they don't because they have other obligations and their financial background is, is quite slight in comparison to state governments or the federal government. So thinking about the particular nature of a problem, you know, whether it crosses especially political boundaries, so many watersheds is an example. Cross political boundaries across town boundaries. They call it cross state boundaries. Uh, many water bodies, uh, uh, provide the boundary between political jurisdictions as well as nation states. So thinking about the appropriate level of government to the kind of problem you're interested in managing is a really important task. How about participation in decision making? As you think about conservation strategies, what should be the role of the public in participating in the type of strategy that chosen? And you might think of, you might think of a track of land that, uh, everybody feels is very special.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Uh, perhaps because it has endangered species per cap, perhaps because of its open space character, perhaps its wildness, uh, you might think of a variety of different strategies to protect that if it's currently in private ownership. And one of those would be land acquisition by on the part of the government. So many national parks, for example, particularly in the eastern United States, had been created through the process of land acquisition. And in some instances the exercise of eminent domain. And we'll talk about eminent domain where the government uses its authority to a cry, acquire a property for public purposes. Uh, virtually by taking it away from, uh, the private owner. Uh, but, but providing compensation intensity regulation regulation is another strategy. So you might simply adopt rules that govern density of allowable new development, uh, or the type of new development, whether it's residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial, uh, and this is the origin of the idea of zoning land use, segregation, a land use, density control, and often associated subdivision regulations, which are very specific in detail, how development has to proceed including lots sizes, a shoreline access requirements, a variety of different restrictions are associated with subdivision regulations.

Speaker 1:          04:32          How about the legitimacy of public value? If you create a really tough set of land use regulations and the property owners, uh, do not believe in the legitimacy of the regulation, it guarantees that you're going to have compliance. And noncompliance means that you're going to have extensive surveillance and monitoring costs and enforcement costs. So believing in the legitimacy of the public value is important. Often an educational process has to take place in order for people to understand why regulations are occurring. And in many cases, they're developed and adopted to prevent damage. The damage that might be induced by one property owner on an adjacent, an adjacent public, a private owner. So the idea of uh, uh, deciding that you want to build a casino on your property, your neighbors might object to that or perhaps a, a, a nightclub, a so that there are variety of different land uses that, that uh, threaten other land owners in the vicinity.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Property value often rises following a conservation efforts. So the establishment of a park is, is very commonly followed by adjacent land. Value's increasing quite dramatically. And I'll provide you with a couple of examples of that. Density restrictions, land use, segregation, aesthetics. Increasingly over the past half century we've seen zoning ordinances being used for the purpose of controlling aesthetics. So aesthetics might be managed by specifying density guidelines requiring larger and larger low lot sizes. So in parts of the California coastal area, for example, there are zoning ordinances that demand a hundred acres before a new housemate constructed a, this is to preserve the open space character of the area. So thinking about how you define a desirable a or an ideal aesthetic that would be your objective is a pretty difficult thing to do. The forest service started pioneering research into, to the question of, of what, uh, types of landscapes to people prefer.

Speaker 1:          06:32          And they were doing this because they were getting increasingly, uh, uh, taken to court because of the perceived aesthetic damage associated with clearcuts, particularly clear cuts that were visible, uh, because of timber leases they'd allocated, but they would be visible from a nearby wilderness areas. So they decided that they would establish a, a variety of, of social experiments where they would test people's preferences for different kinds of landscapes ranging from the wild to the fully domesticated agricultural to a intense urban centers. Uh, you might be interested in the results and following new regulation. When does the government have the obligation to compensate? So supposing a, I'm a private landowner and I have 50 acres of land and you develop a new zoning ordinance that tells me that I have to have a 25 acres before I can build a new house. So that tells me I basically have two building lots.

Speaker 1:          07:28          Well, I thought that I would have a, prior to that regulation, perhaps 50 building lots that might be one acre in size. So my expectation has been suddenly changed by the passage of law, uh, and my property value would significantly diminish. So under what situations, uh, does the government need to compensate the private landowner for regulatory activity? Not, I'd like to drop you down onto the case of the Adirondacks. But first I'd like you to think about the distribution of public land in the United States. So out of several hundred million acres of land that are currently under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service or the forest service, or the bureau of land management or the bureau of reclamation, the majority of these lands are located in the western United States, particularly in the mountain narrowed region. If you look in the eastern part of the United States, you can't see this too clearly because of the light that's on up here.

Speaker 1:          08:22          I don't know if it's possible to diminish that at all. But as you move toward a northern New England, uh, you might be able to make out a patch of landscape right up in this area. And that's the Adirondack park. It's one of the largest intact forests that we've got in the eastern United States, actually one of the largest intact forest that we've got, uh, uh, in the lower 48 states. And it also is adjacent to Vermont, which is adjacent to New Hampshire and Maine. And, and together these are, are clustered and form what is now thought of as the northern forests in the eastern eastern part of the country. And the Adirondacks, uh, within this zone has the longest history of protection, but there are the green, there are the green mountains, and there's the green mountain national forest, and there are the white mountains in adjacent New Hampshire, uh, that spill over into, into Maine.

Speaker 1:          09:10          So there's really quite a, uh, an unusual track of land, uh, that, uh, uh, has a, a long and, and, uh, curious conservation history. Again, a, a, a bit of a closer look at the Adirondacks. As you look out across this landscape. Uh, you might think of it as wild and natural, uh, but in reality, it's the location of intense conflicts over a competing interest groups about how they might best gain access to public lands. Uh, this is the Adirondack forest preserve, a protected since the 1880s. Uh, if you look back at the history of conservation effort in the nation, like Yosemite was deeded to California and 1864, Yellowstone, Yellowstone national park was created in 1872 and the Adirondack forest reserve was created in 1885. It was transformed into a park a few years later. Um, and an and a 1895, uh, the New York state legislature passed a constitutional amendment so that a lands that are designated as forest reserve lands and now called forest preserve lands, they are forever protected by the Constitution of New York state.

Speaker 1:          10:20          So that, that means that two successive, uh, legislatures need to, to, uh, enact a statute that would allow them to be transferred out of that category. So this is a very rigorous standard that is, is, is hard to change. And by the way, there are different kinds of laws that might be applied such as the executive order on, uh, by, uh, William Clinton that the creative, the largest, uh, track of, of, uh, wilderness, uh, by, by relying on, uh, uh, federally owned, uh, but non wilderness lands up in Alaska just before he left office. So you could use a federal executive order to accomplish wilderness designation or the, the, uh, forest service or, or the park service or the bureau of land management. They could also administratively designate tracks of land as being wilderness that, uh, under or under their jurisdiction. So that in terms of the gold standard of offering the greatest amount of protection, uh, you would want a designation that would be very difficult to change in New York state.

Speaker 1:          11:21          And the legislature, I think, got it right back in the, and the 1890s when they created the forest and jumping ahead, uh, the wilderness statute in the United States wasn't adopted until 1864. And then, uh, in 18th, or excuse me, in 1968, uh, the Adirondack national park was proposed by a variety of individuals in New York state. And this upset people in the Adirondacks quite a bit because they were worried about losing control. There were a Lulu or concerned about losing their authority and their ability to affect a policy within their, within their park, within the, within the state. Uh, and this prompted, uh, uh, the legislature to move ahead by 1971 and create the Adirondack park agency. Excuse me.

Speaker 2:          12:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Then by 18 or 1973, the Adirondack park agency land use planning and regulation went into effect. And this really will be the topic of the discussion today. Thinking about the forces that a lay behind the, uh, the development of the statute might, uh, consider the Erie Canal. A Uri canal runs from the eastern side of New York, uh, all the way to the western edge. And, uh, when the timber resources in the park, uh, were poorly managed, uh, when they, the tops of trees were left on the, on the ground, uh, and they dry it out, they would burn in forest fires. And the, in the 1860s, seventies, and eighties, we're really common response to these, uh, mismanaged a forest plans, uh, drying out. So what happens, what a track of forest, uh, uh, Burns, it basically loses its flood storage capacity. Uh, doesn't, uh, the organic matter in the soil often is, is uh, uh, released, it breaks down so that water running off the landscape commonly floods. So you get a burst into the rivers and through the Erie Canal and then you get drought. So that, uh, if, if, uh, New York state w was, uh, going to ensure that commerce could move westward, uh, it had to ensure a more sustainable form of forest management in the park.

Speaker 1:          13:35          I also think about what was happening in the middle of the 19th century. Uh, there were several movements in literature and, and art, uh, and also in a college either are quite curious and they were colliding in a way that a really provided a impetus for the creation of parks and protected areas. And one strain of thought, uh, known as transcendentalism, uh, that you can discover in the writings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Shelley Keats, uh, William Wordsworth, Emerson, Whitman and throw a, and particularly Emerson's essay on nature, uh, cause people to think very differently about nature and what it was and its importance to the human condition. Uh, so that s a a r excuse me, that a nature to, to Emerson, uh, uh, was an organism is a symbol of the mind. It was a moral educator, a source of spiritual truth and a resource for the imagination.

Speaker 1:          14:31          Now, at the same time, George Perkins Marsh was writing, uh, and he produced a book called men in nature, talking about the destruction that, uh, uh, the destruction of forests and how that might lead to the decline of civilizations. Quite curious. Uh, the writings in the, in the latter part of the 19th century. The Pre saged, uh, the, the, uh, loss of diversity, uh, as well as climate change, uh, that we're now experiencing. So he wrote back in 1864 a condition of impoverished, impoverished productiveness of shattered surface, uh, of climatic access has to threaten deprivation, barbarism, and even even extinction of species. So nearly a century and a half ago, uh, a scientist, uh, was predicting climate change associated the way with the way that we were mismanaging resources and landscape. Also, the targets, the transcendentalists include Christian views are they challenged the human role, uh, to be one of dominating nature, uh, the, the Christian view that we should be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it.

Speaker 1:          15:33          Uh, and that Christianity denies souls to nonhuman species. These were new and very interesting thoughts to people. This is captured in a, in a, a work produced by Roderick Nash Wilderness in the American mind that's published by Yale Press, uh, that I commend to you if you're interested in and following the way that these, uh, ideas collided. Now at the same time, there were many artists that were painting landscapes, both in the western part of the nation as well as in the east, including Thomas Cole and Albert Beers tot a Winslow homer in Frederick Church, and they all painted in the Adirondacks. So think about the fact that, uh, people were reading the transcendentalists literature at the same time that, uh, these art shows we're traveling around, not just the United States, but traveling around the world, giving people a very different impression of, of what it was like in the more remote parts of the United States.

Speaker 1:          16:28          So a Winslow homer has painted more on the Adirondacks and the others. So I just thought I'd show you his work on two guides, uh, the hunter, uh, and the fishermen, uh, basically celebrating the experience of being in the outdoors. I'm going to fast forward on Youtube, the, the middle part of the 19th, or excuse me, the 20th century. Uh, when you recall that, I argued that the interstate highway system was built, uh, you know, largely in response to concerns about the Cold War. Uh, but this network, uh, eventually ringed the Adirondack park and it made it accessible by the early 1960s to more than 10 million million, excuse me, million people within a day's drive. So access is really a critical determinant of property value. And also the rate of development by the 1960s in the 60s, in 1970s, uh, increasing, uh, uh, leisurely time, increasing demand for recreational opportunities, I'll lead to increasing property values within the Adirondacks.

Speaker 1:          17:32          People were looking for second homes. Uh, the development industry was booming, not just here, but also, uh, in the vicinity of Bar Harbor in Maine and the vicinity of, uh, of Grand Teton and, and, uh, uh, Jackson, Wyoming, uh, also in, in, uh, uh, the Sierras so that, uh, the population in the United States wanted access to, to a remote recreational opportunities. There was a real interest in, in wildness, in nature, uh, particularly, uh, in a, in the concept of wilderness. And quite, uh, quite honestly, I'm surprised that your generation, I don't see the same interest in wildness or wilderness that, uh, was, was, uh, very, uh, very prominent in people's concerns about conservation. Uh, back in the 1970s so that, uh, uh, many inlet than the legislature in New York, uh, became concerned about development being financed, uh, with, uh, international capital in the park, rapid cutting of the forest, rapid development, particularly along shorelines and rapid increases in property value in some communities, uh, communities that had populations of only 300 people, uh, new new projects were proposed, uh, up to 10,000 new units in size.

Speaker 1:          18:45          Uh, if you, uh, then extrapolate that a one new housing unit might house on average two to three people, uh, this, uh, could multiply the population of a community by 10 or, or even a 20 times. So what would that mean for that community? What would it mean in terms of it's a need to invest in institutional support for the community. And by that, what do I mean? Well, how about a road development, highway development, school systems, fire, police, so that the economic per pressure was being brought to bear on these communities there already where the most impoverished in New York state, that band of forest that I pointed out to you in northern New England is a demographically quite interesting. It's, it's grown to be bi modal in terms of income distribution in a dominated more heavily by the poorest. Uh, but also there are increasing numbers of private property owners who own second homes, but they don't vote.

Speaker 1:          19:39          They don't vote, uh, in the Adirondacks and many of them don't vote in New York state. Uh, so that, that uh, this, this by Moodle distribution, uh, creates a very interesting political dynamic, uh, attention between those that have always lived there, that are poor as opposed to those that have the capacity to buy the new houses, uh, and bring their conservation values, uh, to the Adirondacks. So this statute was really unusual. And, uh, the, the preamble to the statute includes this language. Local governments in the Adirondack park find it increasingly difficult to cope with the unrelenting pressures for development being brought to bear on the area and to exercise their discretionary powers to create an effective land use and development control framework. Now, the mission statement of this law is really quite complex. The basic purpose of this article is to ensure optimum overall conservation protection, preservation, development, and use of the sea unique scenic, aesthetic, wildlife, recreational, open space, historic ecological and natural resources of the Adirondack Park.

Speaker 1:          20:46          So within mission statement, you should, uh, you know, immediately see a number of potential conflicts. How can you at once maximize conservation at the same time you're maximizing development in use. Actually, it's interesting if you drive into a national forest to see a sign beside the, the, uh, the edge of the road when you enter all national forest and that, uh, the sign will say, land of many uses a land of many uses. Well, how do you reconcile multiple uses within one track of, of, uh, uh, land managed by a public agency? Well, it's difficult at best and that's largely part of the story today. Innovative requirements in this statute, a domain at an ecological analysis. So what is the resiliency of different ecological zones, a different ecosystems, uh, how much development can they sustain? Uh, and is there a logic behind a allocating a density, a requirement to a different types of ecosystems?

Speaker 1:          21:44          How about density regulations and the clustering concept? Uh, this statute relied on the idea that you should concentrate new development, uh, in close proximity to village centers so that you don't overstress, uh, the local governments need to develop new roads to maintain those roads, uh, and also require new power lines, new sewage lines, new water lines. So the idea that a cluster development build on existing, uh, uh, centers of, of the population is really quite interesting. And this was to protect the open space character as well as the ecological characteristics, uh, of the surrounding landscape. It wasn't, it wasn't devo designed really to a, uh, conserve energy. Uh, but if I were going to challenge you to design a today, a land use regulatory scheme, that would be the most conserving of energy resources, it probably would follow this model and it would follow the model because if you have people living closer together, uh, uh, you, you were clearly not going to use as much fuel moving around, uh, uh, between shopping and recreation and school and other, other activities.

Speaker 1:          22:54          So if you increase the density or excuse me, increase the density restriction, you, you, uh, increase the, uh, amount of land area required before a new house might be developed between the village centers, uh, then that would discourage development in those areas. And in the case of the park, uh, in the, inside the centers, there's no density restriction at all. So it's an encouragement basically to build up, uh, between the village centers. Uh, in the more remote areas, there's a requirement that you have 42 acres before a new house can be built. 42 acres is a lot of land. 42 acres. In Connecticut, most Connecticut is zoned on average one acre per new unit. So 42 units might be placed on that does, um, but only one could be placed on that area. Within the Adirondacks. It also required setback requirements, set back requirements, uh, from especially water bodies, uh, streams and lakeshores.

Speaker 1:          23:46          Uh, and this, uh, wild to urban continuum continuum was designed really with an aesthetic purpose to try to protect the park, like character of the area. Uh, it also had a provision that was really new back in the 1970s, uh, to offer specific protection for agricultural lands. Uh, so that agricultural lands were thought of, uh, not the way that we would think of them today is providing an opportunity for a locally grown produce that would be more energy efficient, but they were designed predominantly to protect the open space character of the park vista preservation. So that individual vistas were identified actually. Yeah. That, that's kind of an interesting sidelight story about how that occurred. You know, one might think that, uh, when there really might not be a legally defensible means of going out and identifying what the most beautiful areas are, uh, in an area this large.

Speaker 1:          24:40          Uh, so the Adirondacks is a, is a roughly 6 million acres in size. It's larger than Yosemite Yellowstone and glacier national parks put together. Uh, so that a wandering around and trying to figure out where the, the, uh, the ideal vistas are located, who was a challenge that the, the park agency had to confront. They were required to do that by statute. Uh, the, uh, the reality of how they did it, uh, is that a, an engineer and a survey or got into a pickup truck with a case of beer, a and drove around for a weekend looking for what they thought were pretty landscapes. Uh, they put pins in a map and a Lo and behold, these pin holes in the map, uh, translated into a legally binding regulations that prevented development of different forms in the vicinity of the scenic vista. A wetlands and wild and scenic and recreational rivers were also designated.

Speaker 1:          25:31          A, the definition of a wetland is actually quite interesting and quite difficult. Uh, today is, uh, as I was coming into, uh, uh, to give a lecture, I noticed that, uh, areas, uh, that normally look dry, uh, had standing water in them. Uh, and, uh, so that low lying areas, uh, can be, uh, quite deceptive. Uh, if you're, if you're not there during extreme rain events, uh, so that a wetland designation gave the Adirondack Park Agency jurisdiction to deny development people were not allowed to build in wetlands period. Uh, now, most states have wetlands laws as well. Uh, not just, uh, in the Adirondacks. Uh, most states do not have wild scenic and recreational river statutes, uh, that provide the a, an overlay on top of the Adirondack Park Agency statute. Uh, finally, uh, the provision that a stirred terrific controversy was that the zoning authority that previously held was held by local governments was overtaken by the state government.

Speaker 1:          26:29          So not only would you have private property owners that would be highly resistant to this new set of very complicated regulations that they viewed actually took away their private property rights and diminish their property value. Uh, but they also, uh, had local governments that, uh, uh, felt that they were being pushed out of the picture, that they, their zoning responsibility that they'd had for a hundred more than a hundred years, that that was taken away from him. So that the statute's set up class eight projects, which were large development projects that might have more of a regional influence. And those were reviewed by the state in class beat projects, uh, were reviewed by local governments, but only if the local government's adopted the state standards to apply to those projects. So if you were given the responsibility to, to, uh, uh, develop, uh, an ecologically grounded approach to land use regulation, what would you do?

Speaker 1:          27:23          We probably would go off and conduct an inventory of what resources are there in the, in the park. You look for aquifers, uh, you'd map them out, you'd map out surface waters and you'd map out a setback distances from those surface waters to try to be sure to protect water quality. You take a look at surficial geology, uh, particularly areas that had shallow soils are soils that had Claybon. Ethan at our annex is rather famous for its clay. Uh, which means that a, you have a clay impervious surface that is often only a one or two feet beneath the, uh, the top of landscape. That means that if you're going to put in a septic system and a septic system basically means that human sewage from a facility or a house goes down into a pipe, it goes into a holding tank, uh, solid settle out and then fluid drains off and it leeches out through pipes that have holes in the bottom of them, uh, and then down through a bed of sand.

Speaker 1:          28:19          But if there is a clay area that lies beneath the sand, that means that the sewage is going to stay close to the surface. It's not going to dissipate, it's not going to break down. And it means that bacterial contamination of a surface water supplies is much more probable. Genital soils characteristics were also mapped. A elevation was mapped. And I'll tell you more about that in just a second, as well as land use. Where are the residential areas? Uh, so that the idea of clustering development in close proximity to where existing development, uh, was, was a critical, uh, way of thinking about this. Now, our land cover also was considered to whether or not to track of land was forested, whether or not it was heath land I, whether or not it was wetland. Uh, so that the biological resources we're also mapped on top of where did the state lands lie?

Speaker 1:          29:09          So there are 107 towns and villages in the Adirondack Park. So 107, uh, different local governments that were upset with the state of New York for taking their authority away, but they all had to go through this mapping process. Uh, so those of you that are familiar with geographic information systems know that this process now goes on electronically. So soils and vegetation and land use and property ownership patterns, they're, they're all piled on top of one another electronically. So you can zoom in or you could change the layers that you're looking at. Uh, instantly. In this case, they drew these maps out by hand and that actually led to some pretty interesting problems. Uh, when, uh, private land owners would come to the government and say, you know, I'm not certain what zone I'm in, I appear to be on a boundary. And it turned out that, uh, by drawing a line on a map, uh, that, uh, is really small and scale, that the, uh, the, the width of the line itself often was a hundred yards wide and a hundred yards may or may not include all the property of an individual.

Speaker 1:          30:13          So which section would they lie within the 42 acre zone or perhaps the a 3.2 acre zone and made a huge difference in the eventual saleability and property value, uh, of the area. And also proximity to roads. Uh, I mean if you think about an area you'd also want to know that we're the new road network was he'd what you would think very carefully about how you would allocate density based upon access to, to roadways. So all of this information was put together, uh, to develop, uh, this map, which is a legal instrument. The idea that a map might be a legal instrument. It's kind of an interesting thought. Uh, so that, uh, in order for someone to know what their rights are, their property rights are, they would have to pinpoint themselves on this map. And each color is associated with a certain density allowance.

Speaker 1:          31:01          So if you are located in the green, that means that a, you need 42 acres in order to develop a new house. If you're located in the Yellow, oh, that's eight acres. If you're located in the red, then you only need one acre. And if you're located in the village centers, it's designated as Brown. You have no density requirement. It is all and at all, by the way, you've heard about cap and trade. Well, the cap and trade idea can be applied very well to a situation like this, uh, so that you might allow trading rights under certain circumstances, uh, within a designated boundary, perhaps within a community. So that a, the idea of transferable development rights, uh, it's something that we'll talk about, uh, next week. So these are the different zoning, uh, uh, limits that have been established by law and have governed. The Adirondack Park Agency is implementation of this plan for quite a while.

Speaker 1:          31:51          How does this play out as you're looking at a landscape? Uh, well, here's a little community. It's a community of, of King Valley, uh, that, uh, is just at the foot of the high peaks region, the highest mountains in New York state. And, and this is a community of about 800 people. And here's the village center with no density requirements. And as you move away from the village center, you find that a, you're required to have larger and larger lots, uh, before you can build a new structure until you reach a, the public lands, uh, which, uh, begin in this case up on these hillsides leading up into the high peaks so that you can think about this as a kind of a set of concentric circles. Uh, it's much more complicated than just concentric circles, but a development, a ranging from the urban center on one hand to wilderness areas that are designated on the other hand so that the public lands have their own set of regulations under this statute, the village of Lake placid where the Olympic Games was held, provides a good example of this where you see the Brown and the center, uh, is, uh, the area where there are no density requirements.

Speaker 1:          32:56          And then the lands that, uh, a border, the federal wilderness areas designated by this blue, uh, they have the higher, uh, higher restrictions, the requirement for larger acreages. So we're a battlegrounds. Where would you imagine you would get the most, uh, litigation? Where would you, uh, find that the greatest amount of, of, uh, private conflict, uh, over these, these regulations? Well, one clearly would be, uh, areas with views, so areas that have a high elevations or areas that, that are adjacent to water bodies. So if you were going to map out property values, you would find that areas that had the best views that had the highest elevation and that were adjacent to either rivers or lakes or ponds would have the highest property values. So you can be predictive about this, about where you're going to receive your, your greatest amount of, of, uh, conflict and resistance to new regulation.

Speaker 1:          33:51          When property values are highest, uh, you'll find people are most anxious to, uh, to develop. Uh, the rate of development occurs more rapidly along roadways along the lakes and rivers. And, uh, uh, the, uh, costs of developing in the mountainous areas at higher elevation are more prohibitive to developers. So shoreline such as, uh, uh, this example on the lake shores are, are, uh, extremely, uh, uh, desirable from the perspective of a developer, a multi million dollar boat houses that had been constructed also, uh, hotels and, and, uh, uh, large camps on islands. There are more than a thousand islands on a Adirondack lakes and ponds. Uh, here's, uh, here's one of them in, in Lake George as an example, a lake George provides the water supply for its town. Uh, so that, uh, the, the water is, it's treated with chlorine like new haven's water is, it's filtered in a very rough way through sand, uh, but it's not filtered by a activated carbon, which could remove a variety of different kinds of organic pollutants, uh, that might be in the water supply.

Speaker 1:          35:00          Uh, so in this situation, if, if, uh, this facility, I had a, uh, its own a leaching field, you'd be worried about it because most of the islands in the Adirondacks are, are basically mountains of bedrock that have very shallow soils on them that have very low capacity to absorb a human sewage. So that a, there is a considerable conflict between the developers interest to build adjacent to water bodies and the concern of these communities to protect their, their water supplies. Another good example over a prime development land from the perspective of, of, of, uh, the investor would be a scenic vistas such as this. This is one of the 40 odd scenic vistas is that, that, uh, uh, had specific development restrictions, uh, so that it sits on the, uh, just adjacent to mountain van Hoven Berg and overlooks the Adirondack high peaks and a developer, a Mcdonald's corporation decided that this was a site that they wanted to put a Mcdonald's up for.

Speaker 1:          35:57          Uh, when they, uh, when we're preparing for the Olympic Games, they didn't want to go next to Wendy's or, uh, to, uh, build their golden arch next to, uh, uh, Burger King. Uh, and there was a strip already built in lake placid, uh, just nearby. Uh, but, uh, their vision of, of, of what might look best in this area. It was something like this. Well, the restrictions in the map, the fact that a, the surveyor and uh, and, uh, the, uh, uh, other park agency employee had to put a pin in this area, gave the, the state of New York the authority to deny a permit to, to this developer, uh, simply based on aesthetic grounds. Uh, the developer eventually did construct Mcdonald's next to the Wendy's and burger kings on the strip and lake placid. Here's another example of a developer developer that proposed a, a several hundred unit condominium complex on the edge of lake placid.

Speaker 1:          36:49          Uh, Lake Placid Lake Lake George also provides a water from the lake to its community as their drinking water source. And they're very sensitive about different threats to it, whether or not it's a motorboat, uh, develop a motorboat, uh, use, uh, or whether or not it's a new development on the lake shore. This is a very large and a beautiful lake and the water quality is extraordinarily high. Uh, so here you see that a part of this complex is a golf course, but they wanted to build hundreds of additional condominium units. And, uh, the, the argument that a developer will make, there's often, uh, when I called technologically optimistic, you know, we can build this without causing any a decline in water quality. Uh, within the lake. We will have the state of the art sewage treatment system. We will be sure that no sewage reaches the lake. Uh, we will also construct our buildings, which they wanted on the edge of the lake, uh, in a way that would not cause sediment to, to a flow into the lake so that there would be no diminished, uh, water clarity.

Speaker 1:          37:49          The water clarity issue is often a very significant point of debate. Uh, with respect to new development and Lake Tahoe, it's been extremely important because the clarity of Lake Tahoe over those that have you been, have been there is, is exceptionally high. Uh, they measure this by a Secchi disk reading, which is a, just a disc that they dropped down into the water and you can see that disc in Lake Tahoe, uh, at about 50 feet in depth, which is really pretty remarkable. But gradually over several decades, uh, the visibility declined and it was because of development on the lake shores. It was because of sedimentation and also a runoff from adjacent, uh, agricultural uses or, uh, uh, say a runoff from streets and roads and parking lots that were building up in, inside the watershed so that most communities that have lakes of, of extremely high quality had this concern.

Speaker 1:          38:39          And it, it justifies their, uh, adopting tougher zoning regulations. In this case, uh, when I worked in the Adirondacks, I happen to be responsible for the state of New York's review of, of the project. And remember very distinctly, uh, the, the initial proposal and, uh, uh, my response, a requesting additional information, uh, that, uh, was about a 50 page letter that, uh, I and, and colleagues wrote, uh, that, uh, we felt we needed in order to understand the environmental impacts of this development on the lake. Well, the developer decided that, uh, uh, they would scale the development back quite substantially. They wanted a marina, for example, uh, that would be suitable for at least a hundred motor boats. Uh, but the villagers and lake placid didn't want motor boats. Motor motors on boats are notoriously inefficient, meaning that, uh, much of the fuel, uh, he's burned.

Speaker 1:          39:33          But, uh, you know, uh, uh, there is a proportion at that point in time, it was between 10 and 12% for the standard engines that were being used on a motor boats is simply shunted into the water. So that, uh, uh, slicks a are common around Marina's, uh, that really are our, uh, evidence of, of their inefficiency. So gradually, a, the proposal was whittled back from several hundred units to, uh, uh, several dozen units. Uh, the developer agreed not to build the marina need agreed also to put the, the buildings back further from the water, uh, to protect it from a sedimentation, uh, and uh, protect the water clarity and the total amount of impervious surface allowed, uh, uh, uh, uh, was, was also a restricted, so the number of, of uh, uh, parking spaces for example, or the size of, of, of the track of land that they owned, a that could actually be covered by the pervious surface.

Speaker 1:          40:31          So these are all regulatory tools and strategies that could be used to protect this area. In addition, uh, a darker color for the buildings was required in building height was restricted and this was to protect the character of the area. If you were looking at this site, uh, from, uh, the middle of Lake placid, looking back at mountain peaks and looking at, at, uh, the, the public lands that live back here. It's a very natural looking landscape and that was something that was, uh, protected by the statute. Uh, so that, uh, the, the Adirondack Park Agency had the authority to say, no, sorry. You got to make sure that your building is dark in color. Uh, and that it's not higher than, than x stories. So that, uh, what's really driving, uh, the, uh, uh, concern about this is his underlying, uh, instincts, underlying ideologies about a appropriate uses of land and appropriate definitions of private property rights, a libertarian instinct as opposed to an authoritarian instinct.

Speaker 1:          41:31          So the, the, uh, uh, longtime residents to the Adirondacks, uh, would march down the street with the American flag and, and, uh, argue that, uh, their freedom, that their liberty was being violated by this communist organization that has taken away their property rights and not compensated them. So the centralization of authority has been the primary mechanism of affecting conservation policy in the United States. Taking the private property rights or assuming a authority to control public lands, uh, is a form of, of a concentration of authority. Uh, also the ideology of a utilitarianism that these resources, resources are there for human benefit in human use. And we ought to be allowed to, to gain access to them. We got to be able to cut down the timber on a forest preserve land. We got to be able to, to a ride our snowmobiles a across these trails that, uh, the preservationists instincts, they're concerned about the noise, about the air pollution.

Speaker 1:          42:28          Uh, they're concerned about a dense populations in, in a wild areas that, uh, that was, uh, uh, something that was less important than freedom of access, uh, and, uh, the right of the people to make use of the land. So, uh, some of the towns, uh, already had a high percentage of ownership, uh, in state lands and this created a very different kind of problem. So you know, that, uh, towns get the majority of their income from property taxes that get some state subsidies for, for a variety of purposes, including schools. But, uh, also, uh, for, for transportation, uh, and sometimes for a medical facilities. Uh, but, uh, uh, a town such as this town, uh, uh, has the majority of its land in public ownership already, which means that it has a highly restricted private tax base, uh, so that the state of New York pays payments in lieu of taxes.

Speaker 1:          43:28          Uh, but, uh, these really are not comparable to the kind of income that could be generated if development were unregulated, if they were allowed to build a more rapidly. Uh, another example of a conservation strategy, uh, is demonstrated by this case in the town of keen. There is a long strip of land that's privately owned by the US Sable Club that extends back, uh, perhaps a six miles in length and maybe a half, a mile wide. Uh, and if I should have a photo here that would show you that the, the sides, uh, of this lake go these lakes, I'll go up quite dramatically into the mountain side. It's owned by a private club. Uh, and the private club decided that they were going to self restrict their development rights, uh, but that they were going to sell those development rights to the state of New York. So the state of New York did not take over complete ownership with the land.

Speaker 1:          44:20          But remember I said the property rights might be thought of as a bundle. They sold off the developable rights to the landscape while maintaining the underlying fee ownership, uh, so that, uh, they were able to do this in a way that reduced their tax burden. The tax burden, uh, to this community, uh, was substantial given the, uh, uh, hundreds of acres of lands that they own, a so that they were anxious to, uh, go to the town and, and say, look, you know, our property value has been diminished. We've given up our development rights, uh, so that, uh, our taxpayers should, should, uh, be lowered. There are a variety of different instances where the Nature Conservancy, uh, throughout the United States is affected the strategy, uh, and it's less expensive than the state going in and buying up all rights to the land. Uh, and it does offer this benefit, uh, for those that feel like they do not want to see the area developed any further.

Speaker 1:          45:11          So, uh, in, in this debate is in many debates, uh, who are the key actors? Who are the stakeholders that are, that are common? Well, there are interesting tensions between conservationists and environmentalist, uh, particularly in respect to the intensity of use of public lands. So that in the Adirondacks for example, you, you would have the Adirondack 40 sixers that pride themselves in having climbed all 46 peaks in excess of 4,000 feet in elevation. And then you'd have the environmentalist's, uh, and they were often at odds about what the right way to, uh, manage public lands ought to be the recreational user groups as there are surrounding all public lands in the United States. And these might vary from cross country skiers, uh, to, uh, snowmobilers, uh, to downhill skiers, to timber companies, to oil companies, uh, to those that feel like they're a values associated with those public lands that they want access to, that they can make a profit from a, there are tourists, uh, corporations as well that always surround these tracks of land.

Speaker 1:          46:16          Uh, uh, outfitters in the western part of the United States, a horse pack, uh, uh, uh, trip offers, uh, and, uh, uh, another good example might be, uh, uh, what happens with the tour boats and the cruise ships up in Alaska. Uh, they're also, uh, as I mentioned earlier, a, they're commonly, uh, serious conflicts between permanent residents that are more anxious to see additional development of the park and the seasonal residents that are trying to basically keep it as undeveloped as possible. And there are tensions among government agencies. Uh, the agency that existed before the Adirondack Park Agency was the state's department of Environmental Conservation and it had authority before the, the 1973 act to administer private public lands. So if you suddenly give that authority and policy making responsibility to a different organization, you're going to have terrific resentment on the part of the agency that formerly had that, uh, authority, just like local governments were resentful about the state assumption of authority. And then you have need of American claims as well that, that, uh, uh, uh, caused conflict in, in management, both private and public lands and led to litigation in the park. Uh, what we're a time today and I'll pick up a on public land issues and also property rights questions with respect to the fifth amendment on Thursday. Thank you.
