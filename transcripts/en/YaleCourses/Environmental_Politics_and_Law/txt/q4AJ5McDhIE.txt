Speaker 1:          00:02          Tell her to continue talking about air quality today and air quality law and, uh, also to, uh, uh, make some comments about women versus American trucker in response to a couple of questions. So with respect to Whitman, uh, EPA in 1997 had proposed new pm and ozone standards, uh, and both the northeastern states and California supported these measures and a members from Congress from the Midwestern states did not support it. This is quite common with their quality standards. It was unprecedented in a eps history for a single change in a national ambient air quality standard. Have 28 days of hearings in Congress. And finally, this was brought to court and made its way to the court of appeals and the DC circuit. And the circuit found that the standards were unconstitutional, was eventually elevated up to the Supreme Court. And I read you, uh, the conclusion of the Supreme Court and, but they also a raised a separate question about the consideration of costs and whether or not costs should be part of the calculus a and section 109 B one instructs the EPA to set primary ambient air quality standards, uh, the attainment and maintenance of which are requisite to protect public health will inadequate margin of safety.

Speaker 1:          01:28          That seems rather clear. However, they went on saying that, uh, the respondent's argue, uh, that many more factors than air pollution affect public health. In particular, the economic costs of implementing a very stringent standard might produce health losses sufficient to offset the health gains achieved and cleaning the air, for example, by closing down whole industries and thereby impoverishing the workers and consumers dependent upon those industries. So this is unquestionably true. And the congress was unquestionably aware of it at the time. Uh, and considering the role of economics and decision making and how that might be balanced against a estimates of risk and the benefits from a tougher air quality regulations. Uh, the court continued, uh, Congress has commissioned, had commissioned in the air quality act of 1967 a detailed estimate of the economic impact of air quality standards on the nation's industries, communities, and other contributing sources of pollution.

Speaker 1:          02:23          The 1970 congress not only anticipated the compliance costs, uh, that could injure the public health, but provided for that precise [inaudible] exigency, excuse me. Exigency and the section one 10 of the clean air act permitted the administrator to waive the compliance deadline for stationary sources if sufficient control measures were simply a unavailable and the continued operation of such sources who was found to be essential to the public health or welfare. And it a section, uh, two oh two prescribed the emission standards for automobiles could take effect only after such a period that the administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period. So Epa could decide that it's time for a new air quality standard, but they could find that the economic effects were so intense, uh, that, uh, uh, they could delay that.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Uh, and, and to offer the industry the opportunity to retool, reorganize in order to develop by the necessary technology, say a new, uh, uh, mission control system in order to meet that new standard. So despite this consideration of costs, uh, the court found that the engine driving nearly all of title one is section one oh nine B one. And I commend you to read this. Uh, you can call it up on [inaudible] website, uh, that these standards have to be set to protect public health with this margin of safety to account for uncertainty and the risk estimate. So when interpreting the statutory text, Congress does not one might say hide elephants and mouse holes. So they overturned the appellate ruling. I don't want to take you back to a where I left you a on Tuesday and talk a little bit more about asthma and, and, uh, the, the prevalence of asthma and the finding by Mark Colon.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Uh, and Eileen story at the University of Connecticut that between three and 22% of kids in Connecticut schools, I had been diagnosed by physicians. And by the way, the, uh, one of the gold standards for, uh, recognizing an illness and a population would be looking at whether or not it had, had been diagnosed by a physician and in schools. It's interesting that if, if your child is on any medication, other then you have to register those medications with the school nurse. So the school nurse has to keep a very tight control, uh, in fact, uh, they, they maintain the meds in the nurse's offices so that, uh, uh, this is a really interesting and important than high quality method of record keeping. So mark and I and several others wondered together about what the causes of the rise in asthma might have been during the 1980s in 1990s.

Speaker 1:          05:06          And we started thinking about what had changed and whether or not kids might be exposed to different kinds of chemicals. Uh, and I left you also with uh, uh, this lung section and I want it to come back to this because I didn't explain it very carefully the other day. Uh, so on the left is basically rat lung tissue exposed to low concentrations of diesel exhaust. And what you see is the coagulation, uh, between, uh, cells of the particulate matter, the carbon, uh, in those that are exposed at higher concentrations. Now, what this suggests is that, that, uh, you might think about scenarios that would lead to higher levels of exposure. So what might those be? Well, we're talking about black carbon in this case. So, uh, when are people more exposed to combustion byproducts? Uh, so the, one of the, one of the things you should always think about in terms of those that are more exposed would be occupational settings.

Speaker 1:          05:59          So how about for example, minors? So in coal mines, uh, the coal dust is also carbon dust, uh, but also they use diesel generators to provide electricity to, uh, uh, basically, uh, give energy to, to, uh, uh, the jackhammers and a to the lighting that they have in the minds. So the combination of unventilated a diesel generator, fumes on top of the coal dust leads to high exposures. And what about, uh, what about truck drivers? It was interesting after the study that I'm going to review with you in a few moments. Uh, I received a, a phone call from someone who had seen it and they wondered whether or not they should get involved. This was the, the American Federation of Labor, the AFL CIO. Uh, they were concerned that, that, uh, they were an organization of truck drivers that really might be one of the more highly exposed groups, highly exposed because they sit inside their trucks all day long.

Speaker 1:          06:55          Uh, and especially in, in urban areas where, where traffic comes to a standstill, you could expect that the exposures would be highest. So occupational settings are clearly a one area where people might be more heavily exposed. A couple other human lung tissue samples that I wanted to show you with respect to black carbon, uh, actually only one. So bringing you back to, uh, the, the map and the concept of, of the way that we understand the air pollution problem is really driven by these dots on this map. We could be in any state in the nation and you'd see a similar kind of map with, with the monitoring stations scattered about. Uh, and in some instances they have a concentration, uh, where they think that the, the, uh, ambient concentrations are our highest, so that you can see them down along the southeastern part of the coast.

Speaker 1:          07:46          Uh, and this is the area that is out of compliance. It's a non attainment zone for both particulate matter and ozone and also up in the Hartford area. Uh, so that, uh, you see, uh, uh, a collection of monitors. Uh, but it also also, they are trying to figure out the, uh, the, the, the variability in distribution of pollution. So they put monitors also in parts of the state that are less densely populated. So thinking about this, a group of us decided that we really wanted to understand, uh, what the air was like and if kids day. So rather than relying on, on, uh, the, the reports from these different monitoring stations, you know, what if we took a monitors and we put them on children and then we followed them at, through their daily routine from the time they left home to the time that they came back to their house after, after school.

Speaker 1:          08:36          So a group of us, uh, including David Brown from, uh, uh, the, the Centers for Disease Control and, uh, Nancy Alderman who runs a group called environment and human health, Mark Colon, Susan Adams, the former commissioner of health and Connecticut and Bob Low camera who's a professor, professor of pediatrics here. Uh, this was the group that took this study on along with some technical analysts at Yukon that, that run the, the, uh, EPA testing lab. So all of the air quality measurements that are taken in the state, uh, go through their, their laboratory too, to make sure that a, they're, they're carefully analyzed. And I also left you with this chart so that you could, you could, uh, keep in mind the idea that you've got a temporal variation in ambient outdoor air quality that appears to be a driven and perhaps predictable, not just by month of the year, uh, but also by hour of the day.

Speaker 1:          09:30          So what would these have monitors? Like here's a, an example, a, a gas canister, a little, uh, metal globe, uh, that, uh, was pulling in air at a preset rate. It had a vacuum in it and a, so that we were looking for about 55 different volatile organic compounds that we knew, uh, we're part of, of diesel emissions. And by the way, we, we weren't really sure whether or not, uh, the, uh, exposure was highest, uh, during, uh, the, the, uh, travel to school or whether or not their exposure and their risk would be highest within the school. Uh, so we, we used a variety of different pieces of equipment that could monitor chemicals that might be more concentrated either in traffic or, or an indoor environments and in indoor environments. What kinds of chemicals might you be concerned about? Well, it could be a, say the chemicals in a photography laboratory or a chemistry laboratory such as a benzine or, or other solvents.

Speaker 1:          10:24          Or it might be, uh, uh, other kinds of cleaning products or it could be pesticides so that, uh, we, we tried to figure this out in a way that would point us to the most risky sources of exposure and with respect to particulate matter, these carbon particles. Uh, this was the chart that we produced. By the way, part of the story is that, uh, this is my daughter when she was about 12 years old. And so she was the first Guinea pig she agreed to, to carry this a voc, a canister, but also she has a formaldehyde pump sitting here on her jacket and a, she's got a particle meter here strapped to her belt and she carried a, uh, an ID card that had a carbon monitor on Ethel amateur that's about the size of a microwave. So she walked around with this thing, uh, by her side all day long. And a, as a, as a rather, uh, uh, uh, an amusing anecdote on the side. When she first stepped on a bus, all the kids in the back of the bus screamed, uh, because of our post 11 sensitivity about what people might look like, all strapped up in technical equipment. The bus driver threw her off the bus, and that's when I realized that I should have called the superintendent and a warn them what we were doing.

Speaker 1:          11:41          So here's the, here's the, uh, outcome of, of, uh, our initial tests. Uh, we found that there was a burst of exposure early in the day, uh, to pm 10 and a also a burst of exposure at the end of the day. But there are also a increases that we saw during the middle of the day that really were not explained. And it took us a little while to figure it out. But, uh, the, the kind of of of, uh, particles that we were measuring a varied by we're the, we're the, the, uh, the child was, so if they're waiting for the bus or they're on the, on the school bus, one could presume that these were carbon particles. Uh, but if they're just a in the, in the gym, uh, moving around, these could be dust particles. So if I had a chalkboard up here and I could take an eraser and just pat it against the board, you'd see a cloud of park pm 10 particulate matter 10, uh, move up into the air.

Speaker 1:          12:29          The same thing with a, a gymnasium where you have, I say, yeah, 50 kids running around playing basketball or, or, uh, uh, some of the sport you get to particles moving into the air. So we needed to, to discern the carbon particles from other kinds of particles. So 6,000, 600,000 school buses exist in the United States. Uh, and we also face the problem of trying to figure out whether or not, uh, exposure during those high periods, early in the day and late in the day were the result of, of, uh, going to school and traffic from the buses or were they the particles coming from other vehicles? So I'll tell you a bit more about that in just a moment. So here's a, a very quick summary of this study that was picked up by a good morning America when it was released.

Speaker 2:          13:16          Now expected to get the FDA approval. But now we turn back to the story. Important News for anyone. One second. Children who ride school buses later today, a new study from Yale University will be released saying the amount of diesel fuel

Speaker 3:          13:34          standard and those few are going on the record in the area. Yeah, we need it most. Yeah. You can get those children on APP as an estimated 180 hours every year. Uh, according to a new game university study by Professor John Parker [inaudible] off using both the sensitive monitor, which he places directly on school children took [inaudible] rolling around with children. I have full day. You found out exactly what [inaudible] water goes. We've showed just slides and the management of the diesel off at certain points of the day is we jumped to different, those are the EA, the EA measure, air quality location. An advocate is the results or what were you hearing? How much higher than the government's acceptable. Where you finding routinely or for short periods is common? We're finding levels that were five to 10 times higher than the government standard. That's his biggest fight. Uh, it was a surprise to me.

Speaker 3:          15:12          There's no telling exactly what exposed you to this kind of, these leads off the, do you have job? No, but children with asthma, like 30 year old Aaron, I don't know. They feel it every time they get on their boss. Did you ever had a time when you had gotten the Buffy and gray and got off the bus deal and said her father John does that say, man, we're doing something right now with harmful to our children. Let's wait five more years before we were in the parents on stank. But that's exactly what the EPA is doing and 2006 there's only to implement nuclear standard for all diesel engine and clearly the research little any layer standards. And in part they say because diva leads off is likely the cause of lung cancer and they say the regulations will prevent more than 8,000 premature deaths and more than 300,000 asthma attacks and want to go do use two devices, one measure gas with light bending and the other measure side part of us such as, so mark, go ahead.

Speaker 3:          16:26          15 schools Yelder and carry these devices throughout their school days. What we found was, uh, when it looks close to a higher intensity particulars, but we tend to diminish during the school day also found the level of [inaudible] office. The, the buses was especially I under certain conditions such as when the buses were parked end to end in front of the school with the engine exhaust. All of us. Yes, absolutely. That's a school bus. Industry says there's an earlier study conducted in a Virginia School district last March that shows really the air on Fairfax County public schools for poses. No health risks. I was one thing was causing your feelings. Uh, don't feel along with weight and make sure we understand everything before we make decisions that affect the health of workflows and our unhelpful cells. Another industry group, diesel technology forum argues that the diesel engines now they produce are much cleaner than the diesel engines of the path. And that with the proper name is easiest to buses, no threat, the rights and costly process of upgrading on the march. But give it poses a challenge to cash strapped punks and

Speaker 1:          17:50          even move the cash. It will still take your time. I could send the corresponding great hundred joins us now. So your parents, you've seen this, you want to do something that you bought.

Speaker 3:          18:01          Well the best thing about the Margot says that schools can do and the good and California to do it in stages like cad getting his, having a no either policy but school was holes up they not and why not kicking out all that diesel exhaust and other thing. They can do a staggered at times but the buses to connect. So instead of all of them pulling up the kids, getting on, all of them pulling off, they standard at times, they kind of, and it will no problem. He says it's going to be kind of expensive. Retrofitting some of these buses in five to $6,000. It would take time.

Speaker 1:          18:28          What's more important? A couple of asides, when we were both standing on the school bus, there was a film crew there with about six people. Uh, the, the fumes were, it was a day actually like this with a high level of humidity. Uh, all of us got sick. All of us got sick within a matter of about five minutes. And, uh, it was curious because a, the consumer correspondent, Greg Hunter, he didn't believe that a, we were really picking up chemicals that were dangerous. Uh, but after, uh, after he and the entire crew felt nauseous and, uh, we all got headaches, uh, because we had lined the buses up one in front of another and we were the emissions. We're basically just building up as, as, uh, uh, the time went by. Uh, he was, uh, he was clearly convinced that this was a more serious problem.

Speaker 1:          19:18          So I want to take you back to the averaging issue and remember that there's this 24 averaging 24 hour averaging requirement over three years that's in play with this standard. And that was represented by the graph that I showed you yesterday. If you took the data that we produced a for just one child as an example, then you average it over a one hour or over eight hours. You see that, uh, all of the levels would be reduced. So your, your image of, of, uh, you know, what the levels were would be down in this low range, uh, missing, uh, experiences have a much higher pollution. So again, the averaging issue played out in, in the way that, that, uh, we had to think about different kinds of strategies. The other issue that I wanted to bring to your attention, uh, that, that surprised me was that that, uh, the amount of time, the amount of exposure was far higher than I could have imagined. So this diagram just shows you that, that, uh, the, the millions of hours per year spent on buses by kids in different states. And I want to point to just a couple of states here in New York has the highest amount of time spent by a child hours on a bus, uh, because, uh, predominantly because, uh, uh, of the rural parts of New York and the relatively high population in New York. Uh, but compare that to California, a California has a, a little bit less than, than a half of the hours or the total exposure, uh, the New York. Now, why might that be? Anybody have an,

Speaker 1:          20:50          sorry,

Speaker 3:          20:53          there's more cars.

Speaker 1:          20:56          Okay. Well, remember the population of California is 40 million people. So it's a much larger population than New York. And I think that, that, uh, uh, the, the answer is likely to be the way that, uh, uh, residential populations and, and communities in California are more closely clustered together than they are in New York state. So it also, if you find what we found was that in in places like Idaho, Wyoming, and Alaska, uh, that it's very common for kids to spend two, three hours a day on buses as opposed to here in Connecticut, maybe an hour at most 45 minutes to an hour. So the pattern of land use really was driving the pattern of exposure that vary quite a bit state by state. And one other aspect of this that, uh, was, was important was that the kids that have disabilities and they, they might be disabled for a whole array of different reasons, but kids that are disabled or often a bust to regional districts, a regional school systems that have very specialized expertise.

Speaker 1:          21:56          So, uh, on average, uh, kids with disabilities that are moved around to a, to benefit from the specialized expertise, uh, they experience a higher level of exposure. Uh, some, some kids spend three or four hours per day going back and forth between these control centers. And I mentioned earlier in the term that, that, uh, uh, I got a call from a woman in Alaska who a wondered about her child who was, uh, uh, only three years old who she put just behind the driver's seat. She was the driver of the bus. Uh, the child was asthmatic and, and, uh, she was having trouble controlling the asthma, uh, with medications. And she wonder whether or not the school bus might be a problem. So I asked her, well, how long is it is a, your, your daily routine, how long does your child spend on the bus?

Speaker 1:          22:38          And it was eight and a half hours per day. So that, uh, thinking about these high end exposures and, and we're, uh, which groups in the population might be susceptible is an important aspect of this. So just one other thing that, uh, uh, was, was interesting in terms of study design. And again, in terms of sampling strategy, first of all, we were monitoring individual kids and individual buses. Uh, and I just want to reinforce again, the importance of, of thinking about sampling strategy. And remember the little, uh, uh, 200 mile radius from the Nevada test site when the atomic energy commission set up their sampling design. And in that way, and how everybody was fooled into thinking that, tell those particles wouldn't go beyond that, that area. There's another defect in a scientific thinking that that led to two a confusion in this case. Uh, we, we really didn't understand whether or not the level of pollution, uh, was a, that we were measuring was coming from inside the bus, uh, from other traffic or from, uh, uh, from, uh, other sources.

Speaker 1:          23:42          And a recall the other day, I said, well, you know, within Connecticut, we three times as much diesel fuel indoors to heat heat our, our, our buildings, uh, compared to what's submitted from, from vehicles. Uh, so it was very important to us too, to get a sense of, of what was actually coming out of a bus. So we set up a separates experimental bus route in a very rural part of Connecticut that was far away from any residential unit or any other source of carbon that we could think of other than carbon. That's kind of moving long distance, uh, and, and, uh, existing at low levels. So we would look at our meters and see that the levels were, were, uh, close to, to zero. Uh, and, uh, this was reflected also in the states monitoring facilities. Uh, and then we turned the buses on and we saw an immediate jump in the particular account and also in the voc emissions, uh, within the buses.

Speaker 1:          24:32          After we did that, we also saw a couple of interesting patterns. And, uh, my daughter for example, was it was on a school bus. She, she was picked up, uh, near my house and she was taken to school and there's this increase in concentration, which is kind of curious. And then as she got to a school where she got off the bus for about 10 minutes or five minutes until she was transferred to another bus, she walked about 50 yards away from the bus, uh, and then got back on the next bus and picked her up and took her eventually to school. So, uh, this was pretty good. A pretty good demonstration that, that, uh, that the air quality within the bus itself was, was a serious, a source of exposure. We also found a kind of curiously, if we looked at kind of the, the horizontal movement, uh, and we also looked at the, the uh, uh, behavioral pattern that we could, we could figure out that a elevation change across a root made a difference in the particle level within the bus cabin.

Speaker 1:          25:32          So it was a bus went uphill. It's underload, uh, it produces more pollution. Ah, emissions are quite a bit higher both for [inaudible] as well as for for uh, uh, the small particles. In fact, I was a, I was coming to work the other day in, in traffic and uh, there was a truck next to me and uh, the truck was using his, his engine as a brake. So we would accelerate and traffic. And I was, I was right behind this bus accelerate and traffic. I could see the dark black smoke coming out, meaning the engine is under load and it's not operating very efficiently. And then the traffic in front of the truck would slow down. And he would use his, his engine to break the truck. It was under load again. And then you see the black smoke come up again. So I remember that a cruising speed that at about 65, 70 miles an hour is the most efficient level of combustion for, for most diesel trucks and vehicles.

Speaker 1:          26:20          And by the way, I don't think I mentioned this the other day, there are about 90 million diesel trucks and vehicles, uh, uh, uh, in the United States today. So this problem is much bigger than just the 600,000 school buses that, that, uh, I'm looking at in this study, we also found that if we compare the level of exposure to the kids on the bus inside the cabin, uh, and to the federal standard, uh, that they were experiencing levels that were quite a bit higher, uh, sometimes 20 to 25 times higher, uh, on it for short periods of time. And then we found this kind of a curious thing that, uh, an idling vehicle, uh, collects more pollution inside the cabin, then a, a moving vehicle. So there's a ventilation process that did occur is when a vehicle, one vehicle moves, unless the vehicle is moving in a train of a bus, our buses that are coming into a school or, or, or leading a school.

Speaker 1:          27:12          By the way, most vehicles have, have no filtration system. Most trucks and buses have no filtration system for the air, uh, in, in, in the, uh, indoor cabin. And by the way, if you get to the point where you want to buy a new car, I would really encourage you to think carefully about the relative quality of air filtration. There's some vehicles now the Japanese vehicles started to put filtration equipment in first. Uh, but it, it makes a significant difference to the quality of the indoor air. You can test that in a kind of an interesting way with respect to particulates and carbon. Cause you can just take your finger and they don't clean your dashboard for six months, for example. And then just take your finger and wipe it across and you'll pick up a variety of, of particles that will come in because of the, the interior cabinet is so poorly filtered.

Speaker 1:          27:54          So this, this idling issue, uh, prompted us to think, well, you know, one no brainer as a policy response would be to try to get the bus drivers to shut their engines off while they were idling. This is a much harder problem to crack with respect to two trucks because trucks today, uh, are commonly, uh, on their, their ignition is switched on a 24 hours a day because the, the, uh, engine itself is providing electricity through a generator to refrigerate the, the, uh, cargo, but it's also providing electricity for the main cabin. Uh, and for some long distance haulers, especially independent operators, you know, they basically live in their trucks. They will pull over to the side of the Mcdonald's and sleep for six or eight hours, or the pull into a truck stop. And most truck stops are not equipped with these electronic outlets so that they could plug their truck in and turn their engine off.

Speaker 1:          28:47          So they're burning fuel, uh, almost 24 hours a day and island and the, uh, the, the, the level of emissions are higher, uh, in the engine while it's idling. But also I think that, uh, the, the truck drivers exposure is, is really quite a serious issue. So we also found that the, uh, the filtration equipment in, in these buses that were built in, in year 2000 [inaudible] was so poor. It virtually, it was large enough the, the little spaces in the airflow, we're large enough so that you could stick a pencil point through it. Uh, so clearly it wasn't going to give any protection at all for low diameter particulate matter pm 10 or pm 2.5. So there are a variety of factors here that you can read an influence, the degree of concentration and whether or not the windows are open or whether or not they're closed the engine type, the age of the, the uh, uh, engine in the bus so that older buses are more polluting than the newer buses are. [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          29:43          And a one curious thing about this was whenever I, whenever I do a study, I always assume that I'm going to get sued. And I was assuming that the large diesel manufacturing companies were, we're uh, uh, going to give me a pretty rough ride. And I was really quite surprised because they wanted to promote my work. They were really interested in having this become very common knowledge. And why might that be, sorry, sell new engines. That's exactly the answer. They were interested in selling new engines that would emit lower levels of the particles that we were measuring. And uh, you know, put that idea together with the fact that most trucks have a, a, a, an active lifespan of three to 4 million miles and, and often 30 to two, sometimes even 35 years. So they were anxious that the standards be lowered so that they could sell more vehicles.

Speaker 1:          30:36          So there are a variety of, of lessons here. Uh, we were also measuring emissions with when, uh, the vehicles we're using, uh, on sulfur content and the fuel that was 500 parts per million. And remember I told you the other day that now the ultra low sulfur fuels are available and in use, uh, as a requirement completely phased in in the nation, uh, as well as has a, a particle traps that will take out some of the compounds of concern. Now, as you're thinking about this as a policy problem and then you're thinking about it with respect to the clean air act, you should also think about different parts of the country that are either within or are out of compliance with our standards. So the, these exposures that are, are being experienced by, by kids or, or the drivers, they're coming on top of background air quality problems.

Speaker 1:          31:26          In other words, the, the, uh, if you look here in Connecticut, you see that, uh, uh, we are a southern part of Connecticut. We are in an orange where we're exceeding a the eight hour ozone standard. Uh, and we were also, uh, when we were doing the study exceeding the particulate matter standard as well, so that, uh, on a day like this, uh, you get many of the particles being rained out of the air, but on a still humid day, in the middle of the summer, you're going to get a very high level background. Ambient has called ambient exposure. So that these, these, uh, uh, within the bus exposures, or you could imagine other kinds of pollutants in your daily life, they're coming on top of this background level of exposure. I was also quite surprised to find that, uh, diesel particles are measurable, uh, in any building in the nation.

Speaker 1:          32:20          There's an ambient background level of diesel particles, uh, even in this room as we were able to discern just the other day. But, uh, I can't smell diesel exhaust in the room today. Uh, but if you had a, the, the latest and most sensitive detection equipment, uh, you could smell it. So we're all experiencing this background level of exposure. So I'm, you know, one way of thinking about it is how many hours on the bus is going to lead to two, what kind of a total exposure and a, so if the, the blue here is represented and representative of, of the background level of exposure, maybe 18, 17, 18, uh, uh, uh, uh, micrograms per cubic meter of pm 2.5, then these other bus exposures in the colored segments are coming on top of that. So if you look way over on the right for our child, it's on a bus for three hours, they would be experiencing, uh, the, the level of pollution that would be twice with the federal standard is.

Speaker 1:          33:17          So as you're thinking about how to create a health protective standard, uh, you need to think about these ambient average background levels that are being picked up and measured by, by the fixed monitoring equipment. But also think about just how daily behavior leads people to be exposed and in very different ways. Now also, it's curious that the European Union is moving much more rapidly to, to promote diesel vehicles and, and diesel engines, uh, predominantly to reduce co two emissions. Uh, so that, uh, diesel now represents about 20% of the Europeans passenger fleet, whereas in the United States it represents less than 3%. So that, uh, it, it presents a real dilemma too to think through. Do we want to reduce co two or do we want to be more concerned about lowering the level of exposure to these particular dates? So, you know, these kinds of questions can, can lead to policy recommendations, uh, and for any kind of a problem.

Speaker 1:          34:15          I want to encourage you to think about, first of all, you know, what's the right target for your, your proposal is that the federal government, state government, local governments, uh, would it be a, a voluntary standards that you might encourage to the corporations that manufacture these, these products? Uh, or what could you recommend to an individual to reduce their exposure today? Kind of curiously in response to that last question. Uh, many parents responded to this study that got much more publicity than it deserves in terms of the investment of money. This study costs about, uh, probably 30, a 30 to $35,000 to, to, uh, to do, but people all over the country stopped driving their kids to school, which was a problem. Uh, so I had to, to come up with some press releases, uh, that, uh, demonstrated that the congestion at some schools was increasing because people were not putting their kids on the bus.

Speaker 1:          35:10          Uh, and it was also increasing the risk of injury from accidents at the schools so that, uh, driving your, your kids to school is not the right answer. You get a, you know, many more, many more vehicles arriving at the school, creating a pollution that would be, uh, a higher than the quote would be coming from the bus. So recommendations to the federal government, a retrofit diesel buses with two to ensure lower put particle traps on them. And as the, uh, the film segment showed a that's expensive, that cost about $6,000 per vehicle to do. Uh, and it's, it's an important issue in, in some of of the states and the federal government have really stepped up in response to this so that, uh, who's going to pay for this? Well, uh, it's, it's interesting that a, so far I've been keeping track of, of uh, uh, what the state expenditures have been and what the federal government's expenditures have been.

Speaker 1:          36:03          And, uh, right now we're close to a half a billion dollars that's been spent on school bus retrofits or, or substituting the, uh, the, uh, uh, lower emitting newer engines for the older, older engines so that requiring the buses to use ultra low sulfur fuel at the time the study came out was a really important recommendation. 5,500 parts per million of software as opposed to 15 parts per million of sulfur produces a much, much higher level of particulate matter. So testing tailpipe emissions. It's kind of interesting that that, uh, we have to have our cars, uh, tested for tailpipe emissions, but trucks and buses generally do not, uh, so that, uh, they, they are exempt. In fact, they can be pulled over on the highway, uh, and uh, they can be asked by a department of Environmental Protection, uh, working, uh, an employee working for the state, uh, to turn their engine on.

Speaker 1:          36:57          And they will hold what's called a wrinkled chart up against it that gives them different levels of opacity and the hold that up against the sky and visually try to compare, uh, the darkness of the emissions to their chart to figure out what, whether or not they think that the truck is in compliance. Well, this is not, this is not the right way to go. There should be much more, a much more intense and a precise estimate, uh, that, that, uh, we had the technology available to conduct this kinds of emissions testing. So, uh, the other thing to think here that is important on this list is that the federal standards, the 15 micrograms per cubic meter that is assuming a safe level, uh, what the safe threshold would be with respect to outdoor pollution, not with respect to within vehicle pollution or other indoor sources, uh, being added on top of that.

Speaker 1:          37:52          So that, you know, my belief is that these federal standards are not health protective because they basically are looking at the problem as a one source at a time or just measuring what's going on in the outdoor environment and forgetting that we spend 90% of our time either indoors or, or within vehicles. Uh, so we also clearly need to expand the monitoring network and the idea that we're getting our image of the intensity of this kind of a problem by just relying on fixed monitors outdoors, it really makes little sense. So putting monitors on individuals and then following them through their daily life, that's, that's going to give you a much more accurate representation of really what your exposure and risk might be. So this is a very expensive alternative. Uh, but it's likely to be the wave of the future. So the a second target for this study has been state governments.

Speaker 1:          38:40          So what could state governments do that, uh, the federal government could not do? Well, they could, they could prohibit a school bus idling by statute. And in fact, uh, when this study came out, we proposed a law in Connecticut that would demand a maximum of three minutes for idling. And since we did that, there are 26 other states that have adopted this same idea, say fuel as well as reduce pollution. So it's kind of a, uh, a double win situation. So requiring buses to, to, uh, uh, also, uh, are requiring more buses to drive shorter distances is another way of reducing exposure. So when most school districts like, uh, uh, uh, we're, we're seeing today with respect to, to declining state grants and federal grants, uh, to, to two school districts, what are they doing there? They're using fewer buses and they're using their, they're, they're putting the kids on the buses for, for longer periods of time.

Speaker 1:          39:37          So the roots are actually going in the wrong direction leading to higher exposures. And finally, local governments are really responsible for enforcing these island bands. And, uh, we found a couple of followup studies that there's about, there's about a 55 to 75% compliance rate, uh, for no island, particularly at schools. So now when we did this study, all the buses would pull up and they'd idle while a kids got on the buses or they would idle as the kids got off the buses to go into school. Uh, but now it's quite interesting. The, the, the monitors here turned out not to be, uh, people that worked for the government, but instead the school teachers, cause the cu school teachers were, were, have long been angry. I hadn't understood this, but they were angry at the way that, that, uh, the emissions were, were making their way into the school.

Speaker 1:          40:23          And we found that many school systems had their ventilation system set up so that, uh, they were, they were pulling the air from the bus loading area into the school. Uh, and I had one superintendent tell me that, that, uh, she always knew when the buses were, were arriving, uh, even though she was 250 yards away from where they were arriving on the other side of the complex, uh, because the air ventilation system was picking it up and redistributing it throughout the entire school. So just kind of thinking about to a building design as well as important also in my own town and a response to this because we did some of the testing and the town, when the town build a new school two years ago, it decided to create a staging area, separate parking facility or buses could go and instead of all the buses training in at the same time, we're all leaving at the same time, they could stagger it so that, uh, you know, when one bus is following another bus, it's simply going to be picking up the exhaust, uh, uh, and distributing it.

Speaker 1:          41:21          So I wanted to give you just a sense of a couple other kinds of air quality problems that you may not have heard of. This one was new to me. I the, there was a CNN reporter from, uh, uh, uh, who's, who's beat as a Pentagon who called me the other day and he said, uh, can you help me out? Can you help me understand what the threat is to, uh, people in the military from open pit burning, open pit, burning of garbage. Uh, right now is, is it prohibited in the United States, although many people do it in their backyard and open pit burning is the primary source of emission of dioxins to the atmosphere. So people on the right hand side of this, uh, in, in a barrel will stuff their, their garbage, their waste into it, and just burn it instead of having to, to pay for a trash collector.

Speaker 1:          42:09          So you might save a, you know, $100 per month if you did this. So, so that, uh, what, what's coming out is a product of very low temperature combustion, which is perfect for the formation of dioxins and furans dioxins. Some of the congeners are known to be the most carcinogenic substances that we are now aware of. So that, uh, uh, also you could think about how pollution would kind of gather on, on the surface nearby, could gather on foods or vegetable gardens, but also kids playing in a sandbox. So this is a kind of a surprising source of, of our exposure to dioxins that are persistent bioaccumulative and carcinogenic. Uh, there is a lawsuit that is being considered by a group of, of, uh, uh, those in the, uh, air force, uh, that we're responsible for maintaining these trash pits. They're responsible to throw the garbage in and you can imagine what their exposure would be.

Speaker 1:          43:05          And what is the primary component now of most of our waste? Well, it's turning out to be in terms of of, uh, a spatial volume rather than wait, it's turning out to be plastics. So plastics, when they're burned, particularly polyvinyl chloride, is pretty well recognized to emit dioxins. We have another phenomenon going on in response to higher fossil fuel prices, uh, especially in the northern latitudes in the country. And these are wood boilers. People are buying wood boilers and basically not using their, their furnaces, they're natural gas furnaces or their, their, uh, uh, diesel fuel furnaces. So that, that, uh, these burn at a fairly, uh, low temperature and they also admit a variety of pollutants including most of the particles, uh, that, uh, uh, in diameters that, that, uh, are, are quite small, just like tobacco smoke or we're like a diesel emissions. And here's just one example of the effect of, of, of one household having a one wood burner.

Speaker 1:          44:05          And you can see this spreading over an area that that, uh, is now, uh, at this point in the photograph, uh, it's about, uh, almost a half a mile wide and the concentration of particulate in this area because I've worked on woodsmoke smoke, if you can see wood smoke at this level, the particular concentrations are likely to be, uh, in the, uh, many multiples above that 15 microgram federal limit. So that this is a phenomenon that, uh, is increasing in prevalence and leading to two really quite extreme exposures. I know this firsthand because I have a neighbor that, uh, installed one of these boilers and to, he lives in a valley and I live on the hill above the valley. So every morning when the air is still, because the sun has an energize the atmosphere, it builds up in the valley, just like you can see in, in, in this case, it takes a son too to a heat, the atmosphere and basically until about nine or 10 o'clock, uh, it, it elevates, but a, our house is filled with wood smoke from his house as an example.

Speaker 1:          45:04          And, uh, the, the compounds in Woodsmoke are just as dangerous as the compounds in tobacco. You know, one other kind of idea that a student picked up on after this lecture a few years ago was the idea of mapping out healthy roots, uh, for exercise and urban environments. I mean, could you think about what the healthiest route would be through new haven to ride your bike or, or to run? I mean, you certainly would want to run a, say a in New York City within central park where you would have much higher quality than you would if you ran, say along the Hudson River Parkway. Uh, so that, uh, could you map out the healthiest running route? Uh, and, uh, the student did putting our particle meters on a, on a bicycle. And, uh, one other thing that I'd like you to think about that we're not going to have much time to consider is, you know, the kinds of consumer, uh, uh, behaviors that could, could, can lead to rather intense exposures.

Speaker 1:          45:57          You know, whether or not it's the plugin fragrances, uh, the, the car air fresheners. And when I saw this, and I mean everybody knows about these, but the concept that, uh, you know, you're sitting in traffic and you're really bothered by diesel exhausts, so you put up a car, air freshener, uh, that submitting volatile organic compounds that, uh, you may think are more pleasing than the diesel exhaust, but they are, are largely untested. They're, they're completely unregulated. Also the idea of aroma therapy, uh, not knowing what those compounds are, fragrances. Uh, when we talk about plastics next week, we'll, we'll find that a, there are plasticizers that are, are hormonally active in, in humans and many species of mammals, uh, that, uh, are components of some of the most heavily used fragrances and also laundry detergents. And many people are experiencing reactions to these fragrances. And we're getting them in, in mixtures that really are not, uh, not well understood. So I'll leave you with that thinking that, uh, you know, as you walk through your daily life, uh, think about ways you could modify your behavior in a way that would reduce your exposure. Thank you very much.
