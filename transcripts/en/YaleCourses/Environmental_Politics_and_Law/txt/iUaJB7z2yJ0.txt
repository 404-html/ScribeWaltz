Speaker 1:          00:02          We're going to talk today about managing technological dangers. And in this case history on a nuclear weapons is really a good one because it, it, uh, provides insight into a whole array of technological hazards and dangers that, that, uh, we'll pick up in, in different cases as we move through the term. Uh, this one is, is quite distinctive and it'll give us a chance to explore a number of questions, uh, in this lecture, uh, particularly about different strategies like how you might, how you might decide to, to manage dangers in, in different ways. One typical approach are that was used in this history was the reliance on expertise. Uh, so technical experts, uh, had the responsibility not just to, to, to, uh, uh, design, uh, the new weapons, uh, to think about, uh, the other kind of public interest applications, especially nuclear energy in the 1950s.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Uh, but, but also to worry about, uh, what, what would happen to the, the bombs and the material once it was exploded. So the idea that you would concentrate expertise in an organization such as the Atomic Energy Commission at the same time, that you would give them complete authority over the technology. So that a, the statute that was passed in 1946 the created the AEC, I was really remarkable in that that had concentrated authority, it concentrated knowledge. It gave the AEC, uh, the intellectual property rights so that no corporation was allowed to understand or work on the technology unless they had reached a, received a specific security clearances. So this overlap of unlimited resources, unlimited expertise, and complete authority is really remarkable. I can't imagine a concentration of more power in a, in one organization. Another critical approach to a managing technological hazards is the control of experimentation.

Speaker 1:          02:04          So how would you try it out? And there are many products in the marketplace, many chemicals, uh, many other kinds of technologies for a burning fuels, coal, uh, gasoline that are released in the markets without adequate testing. So here's one, uh, that was released at grand scale and the public really had no understanding of, of what the government was doing because of the classified nature of, of the, uh, of the projects. Uh, so, uh, they amassed expertise in the form of academic experts to try to figure out not only what the destructive power of the different weapons would be a, but also what happened to them. Public Education is another approach. Uh, and we'll see in a film clip in a few moments. Uh, if our audio and video work correctly, we'll see the atomic energy commission, public service announcements, uh, designed to and, and, uh, and build public support.

Speaker 1:          03:02          So, uh, obviously the, uh, the public was well aware that that, uh, these nuclear explosions were going on. I mean, walking to the top of casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, uh, at night to watch them explode. I mean, the public was well aware of this, uh, but they understood well the destructive power, uh, but they didn't really know what to make of, of, uh, what the danger might be. The danger to, uh, uh, uh, the environment. The, the danger to, to human health of, of the remnants of the explosions. Uh, another approach would be to limit the potency of a technology. So to try it on a really small scale. And what's curious about this was that the arms race that grew between the Soviets and the US s, uh, caused the development, the rapid development of bigger and bigger, uh, weapons greater and greater explosive power.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Uh, so that, uh, rather than, uh, trying to move from a system, uh, which we'll see in a couple of weeks, uh, with pesticides or pharmaceuticals is another good example where the attempt, uh, on the, on the part of corporations is to ever more design, uh, technologies or, or drugs or, or biocides that, that pose less and less risk, but are still effective in getting the job done, minimize environmental release and exposure. Uh, the, the, the increased potency moving from the, the, uh, uh, first atom bombs to the hydrogen bombs in the mid 1950s, uh, was the opposite direction. Uh, so that, uh, more and more materials were being released to the atmosphere, uh, as testing expanded. Uh, another notion that grew in this history was the, the idea of susceptibility, special vulnerability that different people would be exposed to these chemicals in different ways because of their behavior or because of their specific physiology.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Uh, so that, you know, chemicals move differently in children or in, uh, uh, fetuses and they do and, and you or, or in me, so that, uh, uh, basic, uh, patterns of growth and development, uh, determine this and also compensating those that are harmed. Uh, so that with vaccines, h one n one vaccine is a good example of that. Uh, vaccines always affect some people adversely. Uh, and if people are seriously damaged, if their health loss is substantial, uh, we have laws that are in place to offer compensation. Uh, if the adverse effect can be tied tightly to the exposure. So that, uh, we'll, we'll look in a few moments here or closer to the end of the lecture at different compensation strategies, recognizing that there would be people that would be intensely exposed, particularly those that were involved in, in, uh, uh, producing the technology or in other occupations that led them to experience greater risk.

Speaker 1:          05:54          So the atomic energy act of 1946 really created this authority. It's a remarkable piece of legislation. And uh, there, there are very few other pieces of law that I can point to, uh, that, uh, would, would give such power to an organization. So it created a five member atomic energy commission, uh, that, uh, was assigned the responsibility to manage the technology. And this gradually evolved into the Department of Energy, which we have today. So I'm going to try to show you a couple of film clips here. Hopefully this will, uh, pick up on the effects of radiation and fallout.

Speaker 2:          07:02          So let the capsule can be retrieved. But after exposure and the radiation, the Ledger Dev organization may do its damage or there to your work or cool one that may physically I'm directly destroy tissue or eventually they call it all the top guy to cut those which concern us principally. They have life period ranging from several years who follows the beers. No harm unless they are taking into our body with food or drinking water or in the air we breathe. Let us consider the results of a powerful thermonuclear explosion and the Pacific proving grounds in the Marshall Islands 11 degrees north of the equator. That huge cloud source up punches through the Tropo pause and find any spreads and stabilizes as high as 70 or 80,000 feet entirely within the stratosphere. Late. Yeah. This brings us to the most. Why didn't they discuss sufficient product? Strong Cim, 90 chemically similar to the soil, calcium with which it becomes mixed.

Speaker 2:          08:03          The start you have 90 follows calcium through its regular cycled into our platform and into the bowl. Meat and milk of our plant, getting hammered, reading our own bodies. This function I like. Calcium tends to be concentrated in our phone, particularly those of children who are building new bone. You're ready. Hey, from the structure of the night, he has extremely short range in the body so it causes no genetic breadth to the reproductive cells, the bone marrow, and in the form of either leukemia or bone Fisher that it would be a tragic thing for those injured. No matter how small or number, whether it be physically, very few categories can be justified. Your personal value outside of the scope of this report, each citizen must make heads or her own. You will maintain that there is no actual prep. It's a free world at all. Certainly not. That could justify either testing, nuclear armament, the officer's viewpoint. Hold that Paul, that's been absolutely necessary for protection against common responsibility and a threat and this view all off category. When we see it and the service you can mind in a war, which is not, I know John of your Paul, you're kind of promoter stars.

Speaker 1:          09:33          What's remarkable about his comments was he demonstrated by the late 1950s at the AEC had really strong knowledge of not just what the effects of the bombs might be, but also what the health implications might be. So they'd worked out the science, they worked out the science actually in, in a more sophisticated way than we have for the majority of chemicals that we've classified as toxic or hazardous under the clean air act, the safe drinking water act, the toxic substance control act today. So it's really pretty remarkable that, uh, this concentration of expertise and authority and resources, uh, produced a quality of knowledge that a is really pretty unusual in 20th century environmental history. Now, the, the, uh, experts wondered where they should experiment, should they experiment in the United States? Should they experiment in other parts of the world? And they decided that they would concentrate most of their, they're a hydrogen bomb explosions in the Pacific in the Marshall Islands.

Speaker 1:          10:32          And one of the atolls in the Pacific is Bikini Island, uh, which is a very small area. And I'm going to spend a few moments talking about this. These atolls basically are, are volcanic, uh, so that the rim of the volcano was sitting on the surface of the ocean. Uh, and what you see here is really a rim of coral and sand. And several hundred Bikinians were asked by the federal government back in 1945 if they would move from the island, if they would give up their homeland in order to provide a, a location or a territory for the explosions, recognizing that the Marshall Islands are, are a hundred, excuse me, thousands of square miles of open ocean with a very, very small population. There. There are very few places on earth where you could find such a, uh, an area where the population population density was so low.

Speaker 1:          11:22          Again, they were worried about, uh, uh, not really understanding what would happen to the, the materials, uh, and what the exposures might be. So the idea was to move the islanders away from the center of the low or the explosions to save for islands. So eventually the Bikinians decided that they would, uh, move from the homeland, uh, to surrounding islands and the government first place them on an island known as Ron [inaudible], Ron Zurich, uh, uh, was not as fertile. Uh, you can't see this very carefully, but, uh, if you go on Google Earth, you'll see the, the, uh, amount of, uh, the, uh, a land that is covered by vegetation is extremely small, so that they tried to grow crops here and they found that the soils were very infertile. Basically, they were just sand and beneath the sand was volcanic material, uh, so very nutrient poor soils and that really would not support them.

Speaker 1:          12:16          And, uh, they planted coconut trees, but the coconut trees were, were killed by, by a fires. They were then moved to quash Milan, uh, within about six months. And Kwajalein is a, another atole, uh, basically a, a ring of, of coral reefs. Uh, but it's also a military base. And they were forced into a, uh, a, a tent encampment for, for a period of about three or four months. And they protested that they had no place to grow their own food, that they had no fishing boats and they couldn't maintain the lifestyle that they had had before. Gradually, they were moved, uh, within actually about 12 months, they were moved to the island of Kiwi, a Kiwi. Uh, I could not find any, any photograph of Kiwi, uh, but, uh, Keely was, uh, an island that was not our, is an island that w is not, uh, a on a toll a instead it, uh, it has no lagoon, uh, and it's open.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Uh, it's, it faces the open ocean on all sides, uh, which meant that they had no lagoon deficient, uh, so that they had a very poor land, again, land that a w would not support the development of crops. And gradually over a period of, uh, several years, the population began to starve. The military eventually brought them a fishing boats that were large enough so that they could continue their, their fishing activities. Uh, but they lived a miserable life through the 1950s and early 1960s. Uh, what was going on on Bikini in their absence was a series of experiments and a one was quite curious. It, uh, I was one of the first attempts to blow up a weapons both above ground and below the ocean, and they decided to test the resilience of the naval fleet, uh, two different, uh, to different intensities of, of what other, of different sizes of the weapons. So they amassed this group of ships that you can see in the upper right, uh, and within the center of it, a, they detonated a bomb, uh, wondering what would happen to the navy if the Soviets dropped a bomb, say at Pearl Harbor or a if they found a fleet of US ships at sea.

Speaker 3:          14:39          Hello. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:53          Remarkably, the atomic energy commission, also a hired film crews and outfit them and led suits, uh, so that they would fly in the vicinity, that those films were taken by, by, uh, a cruise that we're sitting inside aircraft that were flying around the, uh, the mushroom cloud. But they also flew directly into the mushroom cloud. And before they had a, offered them the possibility of, of, uh, uh, the, the lead suits to offer protection from the radiation. Uh, the, uh, the pilots and the crews came back and they experienced such a high level of radiation that the, uh, uh, the expert's became quite worried about their long term health. I saw the gradually, the, uh, the shielding grew as they flew in and around. So a single aircraft, for example, would be outfitted with up to 70 different cameras so they could figure out what the pattern of radiation emission was.

Speaker 1:          16:42          Uh, and, uh, what the, the, uh, uh, effect would be as the cloud would dissipate, uh, uh, in the direction of the prevailing winds. Now, among the 23 different bombs that were dropped on this island, uh, Bravo in 1954 was perhaps one of the most remarkable, the first hydrogen bomb that had been developed in the world, uh, that had, uh, an explosive force a nearly a thousand times that a force, uh, the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima so that the, they, they really did not understand what the effect might be. Uh, what the, the, the distance, uh, of damage would be away from ground zero. So this was called a the big one. And by the way, these clips are coming from a, a, a, a film that I'll put on reserve if you'd like to see the entire film called the atomic bomb movie.

Speaker 3:          17:35          Call me, get him his food. At 1954 castle largest device ever testing students, Robin was the hydrogen ball using some of the thermal nuclear fuel confirming the designs of Edward Teller and Stan paving the way to producing aircraft deliverable. How did these bombs and more effective, those 15 minutes float release launch one of these? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          20:48          Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          20:53          So it's a prize. The president is surprise the experts. It created destruction over, uh, an area that was completely unexpected when they finally interpreted the radiation readings from ships and different monitoring facilities that they established. They produced this map. And this is a contour map in a way, uh, in a contour map that the, uh, different, uh, ellipses a would represent different elevations. Uh, so think about this as representing different intensities of radiation that one would experience had they been in, in a proximity to the site of the explosion. First of all, uh, the explosion itself created a, uh, a crater in the atoll. It was a mile and a half wide, uh, in one direction and a mile wide in another direction. Uh, but this graph or chart was more disturbing, uh, especially to those that had security clearances. And we're responsible for funding, uh, in the Senate in the house because it demonstrated that the lethal zone is represented by the area that's crosshatched.

Speaker 1:          22:01          This area spans a distance of about 170 miles in length by about 70 miles in width. So if this were a perfect circle and it landed on, say, a downtown in the mall in Washington DC, it would would've wiped out all of the buildings within a 12 mile radius. Within a matter of several years. The Russians, uh, developed a bomb that they first found was too big in order to, to lift off the ground. And eventually they worried that a, the aircraft that would, would release it wouldn't be able to get far enough away so that it wouldn't be destroyed. Uh, and gradually they overcame those technical difficulties. And a Tsar Bomba was the largest bomb ever exploded in northern Russia, uh, in the 20th century. Uh, and it had a destructive force that, uh, was lethal, uh, over a distance of some 500 miles. A 1500 square miles would be completely devastated.

Speaker 1:          23:09          So the bikini explosion would have taken an area from New Jersey, uh, to the other side of Boston and leveled it. Uh, and an area that roughly would have gone from just south of Albany down to long island sound, uh, would have destroyed all structures. It would have made the area uninhabitable. Uh, it would have radiated the soil so that no crops could grow. Uh, any, any other vegetation that Mike Rowe would have absorbed the radionuclides. So the, uh, the trees could not be used for building material. They couldn't be used for firewood because it would simply release the radioactivity back into the atmosphere we're in, into the environment. This understanding of the enormous destructive force of a single weapon really transformed the impression of the experts about the implications of what they were doing. And they were extremely worried that the public would understand the scale of the damage that, that, uh, the single weapon could face.

Speaker 1:          24:08          By the way, how many nuclear weapons? Uh, we're in existence by the late 1980s and early 1990s, roughly 70,000, 70,000. That ranged from bombs with this scale to those that would be deliverable, uh, via a suitcase or a from an artillery shell. So an enormous diversity of weapons, an enormous, uh, destructive capacity that was being a math, it was simply being built up in the stockpiles around the world. So what was, uh, the result of this understanding? Uh, more classification of information, more secrecy, uh, more worry about how to tell a story, uh, to develop a narrative advantage, uh, to, to be able to persuade the public that continued testing was important. And, uh, that, uh, uh, in order to, to, uh, uh, prevent the Soviets from believing that, that, uh, they could survive a first strike, uh, that, uh, we would build more weapons and, and bigger weapons.

Speaker 1:          25:10          Now what about the island itself? What about the environmental implications of 23 different tests on a, on a, on, uh, south Pacific or a Pacific, a toll such as this? Well, you saw what happened to the coconut trees. All of the, all of the frauds were blown off at all. The coconuts were blown off at all the bark, the exterior bark, uh, was burned off of it. Well, the government decided that, well, we'll just, uh, we'll just go back and we'll, we'll cut all those trees, uh, and we'll, we'll plant new ones. So they planted 50,000 new coconut trees on the island. Uh, they then said, well, you know, we know that the soils are, are, uh, still highly radioactive. Uh, we'll, we'll go in and we'll scrape all those soils off and we'll bring in soil from other islands so that they will have the potential once again to, to grow new crops.

Speaker 1:          25:59          So they're thinking about, well, uh, in the, uh, in the film clip you saw a few minutes ago now you saw the atomic energy commission officials saying that they understood what the key roots of exposure might be and those were by air, uh, via food, uh, and via drinking water or by dermal uptake, uh, through the skin. Now, those are the four routes of exposure, uh, that we would think about today if we were wondering about the, the, uh, risk or the hazards of any technology. What's the root of exposure? Is it by air? Is it by food? Is it by, uh, inhalation? Is it by dermal uptake? A, these are all ways that a, that chemicals can get in your body. So understanding their persistence in vegetation, there a pattern of accumulation and different kinds of foods. Uh, did the compounds make their way into drinking water? Uh, and what would it be? There will be their persistence. What would be their ecological pathways? How would they move through the environment? Uh, and what, what would the long term threat? Uh, B.

Speaker 1:          27:04          So here's a unexampled, uh, after planning 50,000 coconut trees, they found no hint that there would be a problem with the coconuts, the vegetables, and the water. This was his late as early 1978. So they faced this problem. How do we persuade the public that this dangerous technology was worth developing? Uh, that it, uh, it made sense to continue the funding and continue the testing, uh, based on the argument that we have to understand how we might be able to survive a nuclear attack. Uh, but also that the Russians need to understand, uh, that, uh, they could not possibly initiate a nuclear attack, uh, without committing suicide. So they developed a variety of different public service announcements. I'm going to show you one of those now that's entitled Common Sense.

Speaker 1:          29:07          This is a u s air force film. Uh, and this is Marilyn Monroe who was, you probably know a film star at that, during that period of time. So message there was the technology is manageable. Use common sense, uh, avoid exposure. And what would this mean? What would this mean to, uh, to, uh, hundreds of millions of people in the United States at the time, or to the government's responsibility to educate them so that they would know what to do? Well, you tsar and, uh, the Bravo test, uh, basically told them that the cities were enormously vulnerable. So what happened during the Eisenhower era? One of the, the, uh, first thing that was done, uh, following this was the investment of tens of billions of dollars in the national highway program. So the argument was, well, we really need to be able to move troops around the city, but they were really concerned about developing the capacity to evacuate.

Speaker 1:          30:10          Uh, is there, is there the possibility that we could, uh, protect against dangerous exposures, which are most of concern, uh, their, their, uh, highest, uh, in closest proximity in space and time to the, uh, the side of the blast. So if we could warn people, uh, via sirens, by a radio announcements, if we could tell people what they need to do in the event that we detected an attack, that would help them. Uh, so not only did they, uh, they build a hundreds of thousands of miles of highways in the United States and the hope that evacuations might work, uh, but they also developed evacuation drills. And I don't have a shot of duck and cover, but to ask your parents about duck and cover a, they'd probably remember being told that, uh, uh, an emergency drill was going to be held in the school. All the children are now required to get down on their hands and knees and duck underneath their desks and cover their head.

Speaker 1:          31:07          And in fact, there's a cute little song that I, uh, almost developed the courage to sing to you called the duck and cover, but I'm going to resist doing that. The idea that a ducking and covering beneath your school dusk would offer you, uh, uh, sufficient protection against exposure, uh, and the damage of a collapsing buildings is, uh, quite, quite ridiculous. But it was part of their approach. It was part of their persuasive strategy to, to convince the public that they could take precautions, they could get themselves into the subway, or they could build the, uh, the fallout shelters and store it with food and water and offer themselves protection until the bulk of the radiation had had blown away. Well, you know, we've had quite a bit of experience with evacuation drills and, uh, a couple, uh, that you, you may, uh, uh, recall would include a hurricane Katrina Hurricane Katrina found people sitting on the highway stalled trying to leave, leave, uh, uh, southern Louisiana and a parts of Texas and, and also other parts of the Gulf coast, uh, so that, uh, moving people out of a city, even despite having an interstate highway system, was much, much more difficult than anyone could possibly imagine.

Speaker 1:          32:22          And, uh, these are a bit out of order, but I wanted to come back and show you this. A notice. Back in 2005, the Connecticut State police ordered an evacuation of the state. Uh, there was no stated purpose, uh, but this aired on the radio and it was out on the Internet. Uh, an evacuation of the cities was called for a, and it was an error. It was an electronic signal that had been tripped. Uh, and what was the public's response to the evacuation request and the warning? Nothing. They didn't even receive one phone call, a so that the public is quite actually resistant to a rings of, of the alarm.

Speaker 1:          33:03          So although the Bikinians were promised that only one or two tests would be conducted on their island back in 1945, uh, more nuclear energy was released on this one site than at any other site in, in history. Uh, so that the cumulative force of bombs had exploded. There was nearly four times the energy released over almost a thousand tests conducted at the Nevada test site. Uh, so this was, uh, uh, labeled the most contaminated site in the world. And at the same time, President Johnson was feeling great pressure to clean up the island and uh, to, uh, uh, basically remove the radioactive sands and soils, uh, to, uh, restore the vegetation to, uh, try to figure out whether or not a fisheries might be viable, uh, so that the population could return to the island. So one decade after the bombing ceased, uh, President Johnson gave the okay for the Bikinians to return to their homeland.

Speaker 1:          34:06          Now, during the next decade, uh, scientists continued to work, particularly at the Brookhaven national laboratory on Long Island, uh, and reported back to the House and Senate. And here's an example that the house appropriations committee heard reports from these scientists in 1973 that the CCM [inaudible] concentrations were 10 times higher than the 1970 levels. CCM is measured in their urine. It's an easy, an easy radio, new quad to detect. And it was attributed to the foods that were grown on the island. So during the period when they were restoring the soils and they were trying to, to figure out which crops they could grow, there were often importing food, but as they grew more and more food on the island, they found that the, the plants that they had had chosen, we're drawing the radionuclides from the soils and from the underground waters. So they decided, oh, well, perhaps our surveillance, uh, was not sufficient enough.

Speaker 1:          35:02          Our sampling strategy didn't pick up the fact that the underlying aquifers were contaminated or that the soil concentrations were higher than were, were originally estimated. And they found that, uh, they had scraped the top soil off, but they've not gone deeply enough. And that some of the plants were drawing water up from a distance that, that, uh, uh, included, uh, uh, uh, sands and, and, uh, organic matter that had absorbed significant concentrations. So that by 1978, uh, the body burdens succeeded the maximum permissible level, uh, according to, uh, the, the National Institute of Health, they took the islanders off the island again and they were returned to the island of Keely, the one that, uh, has no, uh, coral reefs surrounding that, that there was open to open to pounding, pounding, surf. So they were allowed to stay there for, for a, a year. There were conflicting interpretations of the evidence that was available.

Speaker 1:          36:00          And you find, we'll find this again and again through the 20th century with respect to air quality, uh, arguments over how much, uh, inhalation of an air pollutant is okay. Or how much of a drinking water contaminant is okay, or how much of a pesticide residue in food is okay. Uh, you find that often the government or the, uh, the purveyor of the dangerous technology will make an argument. Well, you know what, uh, let's, let's average the risk. Uh, so the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reduced its radiation dose estimate of the inhabitants by averaging the exposure to the population. Uh, so Rosalee Bartelle from the nuclear regulatory commission protested to this arguing. This is like telling one smoking member of family, his or her risk of lung cancer is lowered if the other nonsmoking members of the family are included. And an average risk is given, it's scientifically ridiculous as an approach to public health.

Speaker 1:          36:57          So this idea of, of averaging risk across people when you have some people that would be more exposed than others, uh, some people would have a diet that might be high and coconut milk. Uh, and during periods of drought throughout the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, it's pretty well known that a, the islanders stayed hydrated by drinking more and more coconut milk. Coconut milk happens to be loaded with saturated fats. And so how the saturated fats were very effective and binding on to some of the radionuclides. And that explained why the drought was correlated with an increase in the body concentration of some of the compounds. So the idea of averaging that across the entire population across space and time made no sense. By 1999, the government accounting office is what it used to be called, by the way, that's now the government accountability office if you ever are searching for it.

Speaker 1:          37:46          And it's a great site to look at for critical evaluations of government to activities and particularly with respect to environmental and health problems associated with dangerous technologies. That's government accountability office. Uh, they argued for restricted access and uh, that, uh, if the return or the former residents, uh, occurred that it would expose them to, to, uh, uh, dangerous levels of radiation despite the fact that they'd spent $100 million trying to restore the site. By 1980, the Department of Energy, uh, concluded that the Bikinians could return to a new island, which is one location and the Bikini Atoll, uh, that received the, the least amount of radiation, but only if only if they ate no more than 50% of locally grown food and spent no more than 10% of their time on Bikini Island. So this idea that they could adjust their behavior in a way that would reduce their exposure is a very interesting one.

Speaker 1:          38:49          One of the islanders. Uh, Pero Joel in 1989 reflected on the second, uh, exodus from the island, uh, saying finally the Americans and the scientists came back a few years later saying that we had to leave again. They said we'd ingested too much poison and that it wasn't safe to live on bikini anymore. And we didn't care at this point because we'd already started to get that hopeless feeling again though, because we all wanted to stay on Bikini. We did explore all possibilities and an attempt to find a way out of this problem. We kept thinking, the Americans first told us it was safe to live here. Then they changed their minds and some rules for us to follow. Now they're telling us to leave and should we go. So they were constantly, uh, being manipulated by a estimates of, of, uh, what was risky and what was safe.

Speaker 1:          39:35          Uh, and gradually, uh, this became the site of extended epidemiological studies of, of the, the health, uh, very carefully correlated with measurements of, of, uh, new Clyde's in their body. The quality of this science is really extraordinary. Uh, again, it's exemplary in in the 20th century. And they found that thyroid disease on the islands that experienced the greatest fallout, uh, was excessive. More than a third of all the residents have thyroid disease. On, on Roger Lab, Ron's lab was an island, uh, that following the Bravo test that a thermonuclear explosion, the hydrogen bomb. Uh, they hadn't expected that the ash would reach Ron Jalop. Uh, but the ash fell out of the sky like it was snow. And the children were described as running along the beach, picking up the snow and throwing it over their heads, uh, eating it and rubbing it into their skin. And it didn't take long before they, uh, uh, realized that something was terribly awry.

Speaker 1:          40:32          And, and, uh, uh, their skin started to burn, uh, the, they became a nausea and vomited because of their radiation poisoning, then they lost their hair. So that, uh, the, the combination of exposure to strontium that lodges in the bone to, to, uh, the, uh, iodine one 31 that lodges in the fibroid eventually led to this fibroid disease. So what are the remedies? What are the remedies for populations such as this? Uh, well, and we'll come back to this, uh, when we get back together on Thursday, but litigation is one, uh, litigation is a really, uh, difficult, uh, approach because of the amount of time it normally takes. A but also the amount of funding that it would take, uh, in litigation, uh, that would be, uh, brought against the United States government would be fought intensively. So that a, it's not uncommon for litigation to span of pattern, a period of time, including a decade, a financial compensation, financial compensation to a, those that can demonstrate that they end their property taken away, that they had their livelihoods taken away or that they lost their, their health financial support.

Speaker 1:          41:42          So the building of schools or hospitals or roadways or ah, job training or that's another possible form of support or community development, medical monitoring and medical treatment, and also the landscape land restoration costs such as, uh, uh, uh, those that occurred, uh, when they removed the soils, uh, when they brought in the trees that cost the government $100 million. So, uh, I'll close with this slide that, uh, uh, a $20 million resettlement trust fund for the people of Bikini was authorized by Congress, uh, and it was later supplemented with an additional $90 million. And these were used for the construction and resettlement, uh, of the Bikinians to live on Kili island and another atole a nearby, uh, and, uh, uh, a fiscal year budget now ranges between about 7 million and $10 million. It's going into this community, uh, that originally was only several hundred people in size. So we'll come back to this a again on Thursday. And then, once again, my apologies for being late today.
