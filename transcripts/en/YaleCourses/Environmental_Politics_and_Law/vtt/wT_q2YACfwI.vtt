1
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:02.761
Today,

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:07.200
I want to continue talking about energy futures and a alternative choices that

3
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.410
we have to face.
And I,

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.830
I think about this as a problem of being on the horns of a,
a quad.
Lemme.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.750
And after I put this slide together,

6
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.360
I was on my way to lecture this morning and I was saying to myself,

7
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:23.360
it's not really a quad lemme uh,
and being an allergy,
being a Di lemme,
uh,
it,

8
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:26.940
it really has many more dimensions to it.
Uh,
but the,
uh,

9
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:31.800
the way that it's being characterized to the public by politicians and those

10
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:35.160
that are concerned about energy futures is predominantly a choice between

11
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:38.880
renewables and existing production capacity.
Well,

12
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.100
with respect to fossil fuels,
particularly coal,
uh,

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050
and also our nuclear future that we discussed lacks last week.
Uh,

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.650
but the topic that,
uh,
really does not make it onto the agenda,

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.540
which is one that I think is crucial is a energy efficiency and what we could

16
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:59.310
achieve by altering our patterns and consumption.
And I think a as well,

17
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:02.820
our capacity to read the energy demands of,
of,
uh,

18
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.550
our own daily behaviors in the marketplace.
And in our daily lives,
uh,

19
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:10.200
make it extremely difficult to do that.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.460
today I want to concentrate predominantly on the,
the problem of renewables,
uh,

21
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:18.930
but also,
uh,
specifically,
uh,
talk about,
uh,
wind energy.

22
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.620
So the National Academy of Sciences prepared a publication that a,

23
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.480
you read hopefully up on the classes server for this week,
uh,

24
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.200
on the potential of a renewables,
particularly wind and solar and solar and wind.

25
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.700
They concluded renewable resources offer a significantly larger total energy

26
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.100
potential than do other domestic renewable resources.

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.660
Solar intensity obviously varies across the nation.
Uh,

28
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.770
the land based solar resource exceeds by several thousand fold president annual

29
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:48.870
US electrical energy demand.

30
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.130
So when is capable of providing at least 10% to 20%,

31
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.110
and in some regions of the country,

32
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:58.680
potentially higher percentages of current electrical energy demand.

33
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.070
You think about,
uh,
installed capacity,
uh,
in the world.

34
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.910
Germany is clearly the leader in terms of megawatt,
uh,
production,

35
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.740
but also percentage of their total electrical energy demands.

36
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:16.560
And about 2120 4% a,
the u s follows and second at about 18%.

37
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:20.330
Then Spain,
India,
China,
Denmark.
Uh,
but this,
uh,
this ranking is,

38
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:22.930
is shifting quite rapidly,
uh,

39
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.950
particularly in China and India and other rapidly developing parts of the world.

40
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.970
Well,
there was a statute that was passed back in 19 in 2005,

41
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.150
a that has really provided a lot of incentive,
economic incentive,
uh,

42
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.700
to the private sector and to government agencies as well too,

43
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.180
to think about a new forms of providing energy,

44
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.950
particularly from renewable resources.
So income from activity,
uh,

45
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.790
may maybe excluded from gross income and not taxed a,

46
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.380
if it's expanded on renewable energy,
uh,

47
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.010
facilities income may be taxed at a lower rate.
Uh,

48
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.380
the expense from the activity may be deducted more quickly.

49
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.290
And those of you that filed your income taxes the last week,
probably,
uh,

50
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.580
do not itemize your deductions,

51
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.420
but deductions are set up in ways that,
uh,
uh,

52
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.800
you may depreciate property at a different,
over different lengths of time.
Uh,

53
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.400
you may be able to,
to,
uh,
uh,
uh,
depreciate a car for example,

54
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.370
over a eight or 10 years or a truck over that period of time.

55
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.870
A house is 32 years and other kinds of products that you might buy,

56
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.280
you could appreciate those of fully in the first year,

57
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.470
meaning that you can get an a,

58
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.260
a total deduction on its value during the year that you purchased it.
Uh,
so that,

59
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.740
uh,
these expenses may be eligible for tax credits as well.

60
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:46.090
And the deduction is different than a tax credit.
Uh,
abduction deduction is,

61
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.590
uh,
a,
an itemization that,
uh,
uh,
you would use to reduce your total,
uh,

62
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.570
estimated,
uh,
uh,
or adjusted gross income,
uh,
whereas a tax credit,
uh,

63
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.040
would be a reduction in your taxes at the end of your return.

64
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.160
Most people would favor taking a tax credit,
it would be more to their advantage.

65
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.870
So these production tax credits that came into being in 2005,
uh,

66
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.750
really had been quite successful as it's demonstrated.

67
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.610
There were previous production credits,
uh,
back in 1999,

68
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.820
uh,
and uh,
2001 and 2003.

69
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.180
And then they expired at the end of those years.
So that,
uh,

70
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:26.910
if you can see this chart,
you can see the rather dramatic decline.
And,
uh,

71
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.590
uh,
the,
the populations,
uh,
uh,
taking,

72
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.050
taking advantage of of these credits,

73
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.520
there is a business solar tax credit that offers a 30% tax credit for the

74
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:39.690
purchase of equipment that produces solar electricity business,

75
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:44.220
fuel cell credits are available,
uh,
that,
that,
that are produced.
Uh,

76
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.770
uh,
even using,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

77
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.500
chemicals that are created by fossil fuels.

78
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.820
There's a residential energy efficiency or efficient property credit,
uh,

79
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.420
which is a personal tax credit for eligible eligible,
uh,
uh,

80
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.740
technologies such as water heaters,
furnaces,
boilers,
heat pumps,

81
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.220
central air conditioners,
building insulation,
windows,
doors and roofs.

82
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.110
And my income taxes.
This year,

83
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.060
I installed a new energy efficient water heater,
uh,
that,
uh,

84
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.220
I was able to take a tax credit of a 30% of $2,000,
uh,

85
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:22.730
which is,
uh,
excuse me,
a substantial savings.
Uh,

86
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.261
also,

87
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:27.490
many states are acting on their own in a topic that we've discussed repeatedly

88
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:32.230
in the course is a,
if you're thinking about trying to change behavior,
uh,

89
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.670
what level of government is the appropriate government to establish law or,
or,

90
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:39.700
or policy?
And the federal government has been clearly,
uh,

91
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.380
behind the eight ball.
They'd been delinquent,
uh,
or neglectful of,
uh,

92
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.300
passing,
uh,
renewable energy,
uh,
standards and,
and,
uh,

93
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.070
creating incentives,
uh,
in a way that really,
uh,

94
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.930
had a strong influence on,

95
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.340
on renewable energy production relative to the two particularly fossil fuel

96
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.330
production.
Uh,

97
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.130
so states have jumped into this problem by creating their own renewable energy

98
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:09.110
portfolio standards.
So for example,
Massachusetts has a standard,
uh,
that,
uh,

99
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.140
is targeting 15% renewable of their total energy demand by 2020.

100
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.540
Ohio is 25%.
By 2025.

101
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.530
A New Mexico is 20% by 2020.
Uh,

102
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.030
California is 20% by 2010,
uh,

103
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.710
in Washington is 15% by 2020.
So that a,

104
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.320
these are legally binding,
uh,

105
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.130
standards and the states are required to figure out how to,
uh,

106
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.030
reduce their reliance on fossil fuels while increasing their reliance on

107
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.260
renewable sources.

108
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.310
So if you look at the problem of when you think about a,

109
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.290
its distribution in the nation,
uh,
Texas,
uh,

110
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.340
perhaps not surprisingly a has the largest current installed capacity,

111
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.390
uh,
almost 9,000 megawatts followed by Iowa,
California,

112
00:06:56.391 --> 00:07:01.370
Minnesota,
Oregon,
Washington,
New York,
Colorado,
Illinois.
And then Kansas.

113
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.880
You can also see the effect a in this graph of the,
uh,

114
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.480
recession on,
uh,
uh,
installation of a wind,

115
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.130
uh,
provided electricity.
So 2008,
uh,

116
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.310
I was a far higher in,
uh,
uh,

117
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.600
new installations in 2009 so that,
uh,
uh,

118
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.090
this industry also is subject to the same kinds of limitations as any,

119
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:32.010
any other sector.
The cost of wind and transmission,
uh,

120
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.020
that is economically available,
uh,

121
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.480
might be broken into two different categories on shore and off shore.

122
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.740
It's quite obviously a more expensive to develop further off shore.
Uh,
and,

123
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.690
uh,
the less expensive,
uh,

124
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.540
areas are those that are closest to the coastline.
And,
uh,

125
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:55.370
what we see,
uh,
we'll see,
uh,
a case in a few moments,
uh,
known as Cape Wind,
uh,

126
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:59.350
that,
uh,
is being proposed for Nantucket sound.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,
the,

127
00:07:59.351 --> 00:08:04.010
the advantage obviously is that,
uh,
this is in federal territory,
uh,
so that,
uh,

128
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.760
no private property needs to be purchased.
Uh,
so that the,
uh,

129
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.410
the quantity available offshore is believed to be,

130
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.300
uh,
just about the same as his onshore.
Uh,
but the difficulty of,

131
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:21.510
of,
uh,
getting,
uh,
a wind project off the ground on private property,
uh,

132
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.520
as we'll see in a few moments,
uh,
compared to offshore is,
is really,
uh,

133
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.950
uh,
quite significant.

134
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.120
So many people are now arguing for a 20% target by 2030 as,

135
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:40.700
as a,
a,
a,
a goal for,
for wind based energy.
So how do we,

136
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:42.430
uh,
if we choose this as a target had,

137
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.950
how do we get there and what would be the influence on our use of alternative,

138
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.840
uh,
sources of energy.
So if we have a no new wind,
you can see in this chart,

139
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.890
uh,
than our reliance and natural gas,
coal,
nuclear,
hydro,
uh,

140
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.320
and current wind would look something like this with wind and the green,
uh,

141
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:02.410
but at 20% wins scenario would predominantly cause us to,
uh,

142
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.030
reduce our reliance on coal.
Uh,

143
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.990
but also some of our reliance on natural gas and nuclear.
And why nuclear?

144
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.590
Well,
because many of the reactors are going to be approaching the a,

145
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:18.330
the end of their licensed periods.
Uh,
and many of them,
as we discussed last week,

146
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.650
uh,
are beyond their 30 to 40 year licensing period.

147
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.980
So we're going to be phasing out nuclear and depending upon,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

148
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.840
incentives for investment in new nuclear plants,
uh,
the,
uh,

149
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:35.160
the future growth is going to be impeded not just by the extraordinary capital

150
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:39.360
costs and the incremental cost of,
of,
uh,
uh,

151
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.440
securing loans for nuclear given,
given its uncertainty.
Uh,
but,
uh,

152
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:48.240
also also the,
uh,
uh,
problems of,
uh,
uh,

153
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.790
simply the amount of time it takes to build a nuclear plant.

154
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.470
If we rely more heavily on wind,

155
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:57.930
we need to think about how to get transmission facilities,

156
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.410
transmission lines in close proximity to the,

157
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.300
the key sources of wind.
So that obviously as you look at the United States,

158
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:10.230
you find,
uh,
a wind capacity varies geographically,
uh,

159
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:14.940
the coastal areas.
A Washington,
uh,
Portland or excuse me,
Oregon,
California,

160
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.440
uh,
the east coast and the Gulf coast,
or are the predominant,
uh,
uh,
sites for,

161
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.150
for offshore development in the mid,

162
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:25.560
mid western United States as the predominant location for,
for,
uh,

163
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.420
uh,
uh,
development,
uh,
non coastal areas.
And this creates a,
uh,
a problem,

164
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:35.190
particularly for the Midwest because the Midwest is not an,
uh,
uh,

165
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.840
population center in the nation.

166
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.220
So that a transmission as needed to relieve congestion in the existing system,

167
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:44.360
to improve system reliability for all customers,
uh,

168
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.900
to increase access to lower cost energy,
uh,

169
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.200
but also to,
uh,

170
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.280
act access new and a remote generation resources so that if the,

171
00:10:56.551 --> 00:11:00.230
uh,
20% scenario by 2030 is,
is followed,
oh,

172
00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:03.660
this is going to have a very significant effect on co two emissions from the

173
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:08.580
electricity sector.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,
this is,
is thought of as a,

174
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.660
uh,
a really,
uh,
important,
uh,
type of investment.
Now,

175
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.490
a citing a often creates a,

176
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.640
an enormous complex on normally complex,
uh,

177
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:24.641
a set of rules and regulations that have to be followed in order to,

178
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:27.660
to gain permits,
uh,
from the federal government,

179
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.000
state governments and local governments.

180
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.100
The predominant concerns about development include visual impacts,

181
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.690
a property value impacts affects on local wildlife and habitat,

182
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.790
a turbine or a rotor noise,
uh,
and,
and land use,
uh,

183
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.420
potential,
uh,
uh,
effects on adjacent land uses.

184
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.480
So when generation is,
uh,
uh,
for example,

185
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.320
responsible for about 0.03% of human caused avian mortality,

186
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.610
particularly in,
uh,
among passerines and,
and,
and bats.

187
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.760
And that mortality has been found to be higher than expected,

188
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:05.940
but the only in certain areas of the,
uh,

189
00:12:05.941 --> 00:12:10.420
of the world and certain a high elevation zones,

190
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:13.630
a mountain peaks and also a mountain passes.

191
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.790
So that these are the predominant,
uh,
uh,
concerns that,
that,
uh,
uh,

192
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.650
cause litigation,
uh,

193
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.570
people are also worried about the amount of area that it's going to take in

194
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:30.280
order to reach this objective of 20% by 2030.
Uh,
and the actual footprint,

195
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.250
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,
has been measured and is being used by the proponents of,

196
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:38.120
of wind energy is really quite small.
Uh,

197
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.700
so about a total acreage of about 15 million acres,
you know,

198
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:47.590
roughly about the size of a Rhode Island or,
or anchorage.
Uh,
so that,

199
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:52.350
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
deceptive,
a aspect of that statistic is that,
uh,

200
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.900
uh,

201
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.610
the conflict that surrounds this is not generated by the site,

202
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.500
uh,
development,
uh,
and the amount of area,
the law of the land area or the,
uh,
uh,

203
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:05.110
ocean area that has to be disturbed in order to put the facilities.

204
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.950
And it's generated by its visibility,
uh,

205
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.580
predominantly by people's impressions that I find to be really quite curious.

206
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.470
I was,
I was driving to work this morning and,
and uh,
admiring the,

207
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:21.690
the wind turbine that was just put up a over here next to the Q bridge.
Uh,

208
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.170
and was thinking about that and thinking about people's acceptance or,

209
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:30.010
or preferences to view landscapes a without towers generally.

210
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.190
And as a kind of surveyed the landscape quickly,

211
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:37.700
I was looking at the old coal fired power plant next to the Q bridge.
Uh,

212
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.280
then I was looking at,
uh,
the transmission lines,
uh,
that a line next to it.

213
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.880
I was looking at the bridge itself.
Really an industrialized landscape.

214
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.780
Probably not a good thing to say to people here for Yale bulldog days.
Uh,

215
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.190
they're very beautiful parts of new haven and the university has a central

216
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.320
source of a new haven's beauty.
Uh,
but that part of new haven is,
is not,

217
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:04.240
it's a,
it's one of the most industrialized zones,
uh,
in,
in Connecticut.
Uh,

218
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.580
but there are stands this new wind turbine,
a gleaming white,
uh,

219
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.220
and actually it's,
it's dwarfed by other stacks,
smokestacks and,
uh,

220
00:14:12.221 --> 00:14:15.640
the transmission lines nearby.
But people have,
uh,

221
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:19.960
problems with towers generally.
Uh,
and I was wondering about that.

222
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:23.600
And I've worked on tower siting problems in the past.
Uh,
and I,

223
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.770
I use the example when we had the lecture on,

224
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.570
on land preservation of the controversy over the Olympic Games and northern New

225
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.810
York,
uh,
where the,
uh,

226
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.390
90 and 70 meters ski jump were proposed that a almost brought the Olympic Games

227
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:42.391
to a halt because of a threatened litigation by the Sierra club and the aversion

228
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:46.840
there was the loss of the sense of,
of a natural landscape.

229
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.970
And a,
this is very much a,
a prominent part of the argument on the part of,
of uh,

230
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.070
land owners in the coastal area,
uh,

231
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:59.060
that looks out over Nantucket's sound.
They're worried about the view,

232
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:00.740
they're worried about the visibility.

233
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.340
Somehow they think it's going to diminish the sense of naturalness of that

234
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:09.200
landscape,
uh,
and that's provoked their,
their litigation so that,

235
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:12.700
uh,
there are other kinds of towers that we seem to accept.
But,
uh,
you know,

236
00:15:12.701 --> 00:15:16.160
it may be a function of whether or not we can get up into the tower to take a

237
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:20.360
look.
Many people up in lake placid eventually accepted a 300 foot towers,

238
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.560
a ski jump,
uh,
that,
uh,
was immediately adjacent to a wilderness area.

239
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.720
But a part of the fascination was,
well,
this is a,
this is for,
for sport.

240
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.231
Uh,

241
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.740
but it also is going to give the opportunity to create an observation deck that

242
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:34.910
people could go up to.

243
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.990
I was thinking about other towers that we seem to readily accept and more

244
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:42.560
urbanized environments,
residential towers,
office buildings,
uh,

245
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:44.960
or even the Eiffel Tower.
So that a,
you know,

246
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:49.961
what is it about towers and our sense of naturalness that provokes this kind of

247
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:54.980
reaction.
Also worked on,
uh,
uh,
communication towers and electrical,

248
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.090
electrical transmission lines,
the demand high towers.
And,
uh,

249
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.160
these are,
these are commonly fought,
uh,
uh,
with a great energy,
just,

250
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:08.900
uh,
just as people are fighting the,
the,
uh,
uh,
wind turbines,

251
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.400
so that,
uh,
uh,
that would be the subject of a,
a,
a great,
uh,
senior essay.

252
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:16.550
By the way,
if anybody is looking around for one next year,
uh,

253
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.670
think about also the nature of property rights to wind,
uh,

254
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.430
and to solar radiation.
So a does the developer,
for example,

255
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:30.290
have the right to block access to a resource such as wind or solar,
radiation,

256
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.180
uh,
or water.
If you live upstream and uh,
uh,

257
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:39.080
you decide you want to put a dam in a,
in a,
in a river or sand,
remember,

258
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:43.280
uh,
the,
the shifting sands on barrier islands.
And remember,
uh,

259
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.271
as you,
uh,

260
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.620
if you fly out of new haven over the coastline and you see these groins that are

261
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:49.350
set up to,

262
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:54.350
to traps sand as it moves along the coastline and that causes the San deficit

263
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:57.590
downstream so that the person that lives next to you,

264
00:16:57.591 --> 00:17:01.650
it has to build a groin so he can catch sand to prevent his shoreline from a

265
00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:06.080
road eroding the same basic principle here.
So that if I build a structure,

266
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:10.010
a perhaps a high rise building,
the blocks,
uh,
uh,
your,

267
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.080
your,
uh,
access to wind a,
or even if I build a high rise building and it,

268
00:17:15.081 --> 00:17:20.060
and it blocks your access to solar radiation,
uh,
do you have the right to,
to,

269
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.140
to,
uh,
uh,
take me to court and,
uh,
uh,

270
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.980
either to prevent the development or,
uh,
to,
uh,

271
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.930
do I have the right to demand that a,

272
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.080
you compensate me for my property loss in value?
Well,

273
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:37.970
common law law passed by a by a courts is really unclear on,

274
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.460
on the matter unless there's clear malicious intent.

275
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.760
So unlike a underground minerals,
uh,

276
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:47.360
no one can extract wind or solar radiation from your property without your

277
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.580
consent.
And I want you to think about the lecture.
Uh,

278
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.150
several weeks ago when I considered the horse whisperer out in Wyoming,
uh,

279
00:17:55.151 --> 00:18:00.151
and the extraordinarily rapid development of coal bed methane gas being

280
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:01.824
extracted,

281
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.620
a because the federal government sold off the underlying property rights,
uh,

282
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.080
to private corporations who then,
uh,

283
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.320
basically had the right to transfer,
uh,
their,

284
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.180
their production equipment to build towers on people's ranches on their private

285
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.990
lands.
So the,
uh,
the,

286
00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:24.630
the story was the horse whisperer woke up to a construction crews bulldozing

287
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:29.010
roads over their property and outraged thought that,
uh,
uh,
he had,
uh,

288
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:32.100
the right to call the police and stop the development when he didn't,

289
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:33.510
because those,
uh,

290
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.350
those gas extraction companies had purchased the rights legitimately from the

291
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:41.280
government.
Well,
in,
in this case are the,
uh,

292
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.870
wind or solar radiation rights,
uh,
similarly,
uh,

293
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:49.980
owned as common property by the federal government.
Uh,
and the answer is no.

294
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.400
So that a,
you would have the opportunity,
uh,

295
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.210
to prevent somebody from coming onto your land,
uh,
and building a,
a,

296
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.730
a wind turbine.
But it kind of an interesting comparison here,

297
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.440
the way that law is structured to,
to,
to allocate common property rights.

298
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.090
Uh,
to,
uh,
the private sector for energy development.

299
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.210
So think about a wind capacity and,
uh,
the,

300
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.780
the desirability of different areas of the country.
And,
uh,

301
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:19.710
also think about the nature of private development in the coastal zone.

302
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.920
And I remember,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

303
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.330
California oil spills and to how the tar and the oil would wash up on the

304
00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:29.070
beaches.
And it was kind of interesting.
You know,

305
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:31.000
you'd go for a run on the beach and,
and,
uh,

306
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.830
you get back to your house or wherever you're staying and,
uh,
your,

307
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:38.850
your feet are covered by a tar.
Even today.
They,
in some parts of California,

308
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:43.560
they're covered by tar from the Santa Barbara oil spills back in the 1970s.

309
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.630
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,

310
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.620
these tend to be highly a developable properties,

311
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:53.850
highly valued property.
Uh,
and if they are,
uh,
uh,
uh,

312
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.210
the side of residential,
uh,
uh,
structures,

313
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.520
you're guaranteed to have a fight for any significant offshore development.

314
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.440
So there's an interesting kind of coincidence here of,
of uh,
uh,

315
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.400
high end property,
people that,
uh,
uh,
uh,

316
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:14.340
are likely to have values,
uh,
that,
uh,

317
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.270
are instinctively to protect the coastal zone,
uh,

318
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.850
as well as to protect the naturalness of the views from their private property

319
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.220
so that this conflict is the source of,
of,
uh,
uh,

320
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:30.060
litigation and also legislation.
So the top 10 energy,
excuse me,
the,
uh,

321
00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:33.350
this is a repeat slide.
Here are the top 10,
uh,
uh,
uh,

322
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.550
states for a wind energy potential.

323
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.330
The last slide I showed you was a top 10 states for,

324
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:44.790
for current generating capacity.
So Texas,
Kansas,
Montana,
Nebraska,

325
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.690
uh,
and mid western states,
and a,
and particularly in the coastal zone as well,

326
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.770
South Dakota,
North Dakota,
Iowa,
Wyoming,
Oklahoma,
New Mexico.

327
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.280
It's a very interesting that a,
these have the highest capacity,
uh,

328
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:01.780
but they tend not to be close to where the majority of people in the u s live.

329
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.280
The jump ahead here.
Hmm.
So here's the scenario.
Uh,

330
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.380
offshore development versus land based development.
Uh,

331
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:15.390
the projections are that the majority of of new capacity will come from onshore

332
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.380
or land based development.
Uh,

333
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:21.340
that creates all the political conflict because of questions about how to manage

334
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:25.090
private property rights.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
if you look at the,
uh,

335
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:30.040
the quantity available offshore and onshore,
and you look at the,
uh,
uh,
the,

336
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:34.150
the relative,
uh,
uh,
wind speed in,
in these areas,

337
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:36.330
you see that the land based,
uh,
is,

338
00:21:36.331 --> 00:21:40.660
is going to likely generate more gigawatts then the offshore.

339
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.820
So what are the,
uh,
the key benefits here?
Well,
uh,
benefits to the environment,

340
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.890
uh,
benefits in terms of of uh,
reduced air pollution from fossil fuels.

341
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.450
And,
uh,
there's no question about the fact that we'll be facing increased coal

342
00:21:55.451 --> 00:22:00.220
generation coal power generation,
uh,
that is going to,
uh,
give us,
uh,
uh,

343
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.400
problems with particulate matter,
sulfur and nitrogen oxides.
Uh,

344
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.040
and remember that statistic that I told you last week that,
uh,
Eh,

345
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.760
this is a really important statistic,
uh,

346
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.680
particularly relative to the health effects of coal.
Uh,

347
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.930
between 30 and 60,000.

348
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:20.950
People are estimated in a variety of peer reviewed.

349
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.890
And I think highly defensible studies,
uh,
they,
they,
uh,

350
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.140
suffer premature death in the United States every year,
uh,

351
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.970
due to coal production.
So that a,
you compare that to nuclear,
uh,

352
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.880
you compare that to a mortality estimates from,

353
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.490
from a wind or solar development.
And there,

354
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.320
there really is no contest in terms of climate.
Uh,
the,
the,

355
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:45.154
uh,

356
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.280
reduce co two emissions are estimated to be about 825 million metric tons per

357
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:51.394
year.
Uh,

358
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:56.490
if the 20% increase over 20% of our electricity is produced by 2030,

359
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.930
a reduced water,
uh,
reduced coal use,

360
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.300
a reduced cost per kilowatt hour,
hour,

361
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.320
and also the increased tax revenues that'll be generated to local communities.

362
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.800
So if you build a wind turbine on your property,

363
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.000
you're going to have to pay the local government to property taxes,
uh,

364
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:19.720
on your revenue and also you're going to be paying the federal government,
uh,
uh,

365
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.190
taxes on,
on the revenue.
So the,
uh,
the future of wind,
uh,

366
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.180
as I mentioned earlier,

367
00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:30.120
is likely to have the greatest influence on our reliance on coal,
uh,

368
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.160
but,
uh,
could also affect our reliance on nuclear.

369
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.120
There's a lot of concern among environmentalists over avian mortality.

370
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.420
So it's important to think about the different causes of avian mortality.

371
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.250
And it's quite striking that,
uh,
uh,

372
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.000
mortality from buildings and windows.
And these are deaths per 100.

373
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.890
These are 80 and deaths.
Uh,
uh,
uh,
so that,
uh,

374
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.570
you see that the majority are being caused by birds flying into buildings and

375
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:04.310
windows followed by house cats,
a high transmission lines,
vehicles,
uh,

376
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.930
pesticides.
Actually,
the pesticide a estimated is low.
Uh,

377
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.230
I worked on a panel that,
uh,
uh,
addressed the question about,
uh,

378
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.480
several of the largest,
uh,
uh,
uh,

379
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.310
most produced a insecticides in,
in the world.
And,
uh,
uh,

380
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.490
they are responsible for very significant avian losses,
uh,

381
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:28.640
communication towers and wind turbines.
Uh,

382
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.940
if they reach this 20% by 2030,

383
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.490
our projected to be really quite low.
Now,

384
00:24:34.491 --> 00:24:37.130
that doesn't mean that we don't pay attention to them and legally we have an

385
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:41.060
obligation to do so.
Uh,
and that's because of the endangered species act.

386
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.580
And this will come to play.
And when we talk in a few minutes about,
uh,

387
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.000
the Nantucket sound case,
uh,
that,
uh,
might influence the,

388
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.430
the piping plover that nests in the adjacent shorelines.

389
00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.190
Also,
there's concerns about,
uh,
uh,
noise.
Now how windy or excuse me,

390
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:05.510
how noisy are they compared to other,
other sources of noise?
So if you,
uh,

391
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:09.230
if you look at a jet aircraft at 250 meters,
uh,

392
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:13.070
he looked at a pneumatic drill.
You look at a truck,
uh,
an office,

393
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.820
a car at 40 meters,
uh,
then,
uh,

394
00:25:15.821 --> 00:25:20.590
and you find a wind power plant at 350 meters,
uh,
would be,
uh,

395
00:25:20.591 --> 00:25:23.420
about equivalent to a quiet bedroom,
uh,

396
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:26.990
or perhaps a car operating at 40 miles an hour,
uh,

397
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:32.000
that drives by 40 meters away,
excuse me,
a hundred meters away.
So,

398
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.581
you know,
the,

399
00:25:32.581 --> 00:25:36.590
the implications of this are kind of interesting in terms of managing a noise.

400
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.880
How might you do that?
Well you could think about a using zoning,
uh,

401
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:45.380
you could demand very large lot zoning and remember the case and the Adirondacks

402
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:49.290
where one new house for,
uh,
perhaps,
uh,

403
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:54.260
40% of the private land in the Adirondacks,
40% of two and a half million acres.

404
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.070
So one new house requires 43 acres up in the Adirondacks.

405
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.210
So what would it take you to get a,

406
00:26:00.211 --> 00:26:05.211
a buffer between the turbine location on land and a separation distance that

407
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:09.890
we're would reduce the decibel level on adjacent properties?
We can,

408
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.440
you can imagine designing a zoning ordinance that would,

409
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.130
would allow you to control noise on adjacent lands in that fashion.

410
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.470
Well,
so that,
uh,

411
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.040
it's important for you to think too about the structure of the u s utility

412
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:29.780
industry.
There are about 200 investor owned utilities in the nation,
70,

413
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:32.630
large municipal and federal or state systems,

414
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.170
50 rural generation and transmission cooperatives,
uh,

415
00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:38.900
and 3000 local distribution companies.

416
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.090
I think also about Def,
uh,

417
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.420
who are the dominant consumers of energy in the United States.

418
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.450
It turns out that the federal government is the largest single consumer of

419
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:52.180
electricity in the world.
Uh,
the federal agency,
uh,

420
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.470
electricity consumption in 2005 was more than 55,000 gigawatt hours,

421
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.010
which would equate to approximately 18 gigawatts of wind capacity.

422
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.730
So federal agencies were encouraged to meet an executive order,
uh,

423
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.760
goal of 2.5% of them site electricity from new renewable energy sources by the

424
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:16.020
end of 2005.
By the way,
we've not talked about the executive orders in the class,

425
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:21.021
but I'm going to pause here just to point out that that a law may be established

426
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:25.860
at a very different levels of government,
state,
local,
federal,
uh,
but,
uh,

427
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:28.560
also in may be established by regulation.

428
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:33.210
So EPA has the legal authority to establish regulations and the executive branch

429
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.080
of the government,

430
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.190
the office of the president has the legal authority to establish executive

431
00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:42.150
orders,
uh,
that must be complied with within the federal government,

432
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.190
by federal agencies.
So that in this case,
uh,
to meet an order of,
uh,

433
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.130
uh,
the,
uh,
the order goal of 2.5%.

434
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.130
This goal was actually exceeded a,

435
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:58.131
with a final tally of about 6.9% of electricity consumed,

436
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:01.470
was derived from renewable sources.
So that's kind of an interesting idea.

437
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.540
So figure out who are the largest consumers and then set goals for them and then

438
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:09.600
challenge them a set up a competition.
And,
uh,

439
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:12.840
we've seen that competitive spirit work here in the college as well,

440
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.680
so that to colleges are trying to,
not just to reduce their,
their uh,

441
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.630
uh,
uh,
waste and to increase their rate of recycling,

442
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:26.190
but they're also trying to reduce their energy consumption so that,
uh,

443
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.700
now the federal agencies are all challenged to try to figure out how they can

444
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.590
increase their,
a renewable component of their energy consumption portfolios.

445
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:40.500
Uh,
there's also the concept of renewable energy credits and renewable energy

446
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:42.120
certificates and these are,

447
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.740
are tradable non-tangible energy commodities in the u s that represent proof

448
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:51.480
that one megawatt hour of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable

449
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:56.400
energy solar resource,
uh,
which would include solar,
wind,
geothermal,
hydro,

450
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.990
biomass or energy derived from hydrogen fuel cells.

451
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.490
Uh,
now I want to talk for a few moments about the,

452
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.260
the problem,
uh,
up in Nantucket sound.
Uh,
and this is a,
a,

453
00:29:11.261 --> 00:29:16.010
a project Cape Wind that was initiated in 2001,
uh,
when,
uh,

454
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:21.050
this company decided that they wanted to put up about 130 turbines and that

455
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.450
Nantucket sound and it,
uh,
uh,
the state of Rhode Island,
by the way,

456
00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:31.390
has taken a very different path,
not just reacting to a developer's proposal.
Uh,

457
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:31.950
but,
uh,

458
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:36.950
Rhode Island has taken the initiative to a zone parts of its offshore territory.

459
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.750
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
they have a designated a,

460
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.520
a company,
a developer as a preferred developer,
uh,
and,
uh,

461
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.750
have now proposed about a one point $5 billion farm in eastern Rhode Island.

462
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.880
So states could,
uh,
uh,
uh,
you know,
basically be reactive in their,
uh,

463
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:59.650
uh,
approach to developing wind energy.
Just wait for the developers to show up.

464
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.200
Uh,
but Rhode Island is taking a,
a,
a very different,
uh,

465
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:04.930
approach to this so that they are,

466
00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.960
are in a way acting as the developer themselves.

467
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.740
So if you take a look at this wind map of,
of uh,
the,
uh,

468
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:17.830
southern New England coastline,
you see that there are areas particularly,
uh,

469
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:21.470
off of Rhode Island and particularly here in Nantucket sound,
uh,

470
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.900
which are really quite,
uh,

471
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.880
quite suitable in terms of the amount of wind energy that that is available,
uh,

472
00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:32.280
for development.
So the Cape Wind,
uh,
proposal,
uh,

473
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.940
would involve,
as I said,
130 different turbines.
Uh,

474
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:41.770
and on average it would provide about 75% of the entire electrical requirements

475
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:46.810
for the Cape and the islands.
So,
uh,

476
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.280
I don't know if this is going to work,

477
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:52.240
but let me see if I can show you a youtube video here

478
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.340
just briefly.
Now,
here is a,
uh,
uh,
a,
uh,
seen,
uh,

479
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:03.380
that,
uh,
shows a boat of sightseer just moving through a,

480
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:06.720
a wind farm off the coast of Denmark.
Uh,

481
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.060
just to give you a sense of what it would be like.
Now,

482
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:13.370
there are questions here about a navigation,
uh,

483
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.510
their questions about interference with others' property rights.

484
00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.140
So offshore waters,
if you're beyond the three mile jurisdictional limit,
uh,

485
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.260
then it becomes federal lands.
If you're between the mean high water mark,
uh,

486
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.040
and the three mile zone that is state land.
And,
uh,

487
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.050
what this means is because these,
uh,
these power lines,

488
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:36.880
we'll have to lie beneath the surface as they run from the turbines back to the

489
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:38.080
mainland,
uh,

490
00:31:38.081 --> 00:31:42.380
that they clearly will cross from federal lands into state lands.
Uh,

491
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:47.380
and then they will cross private lands.
Or in some instances they will be,
uh,
uh,

492
00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:50.000
require a dredging,
a wetland areas,
uh,

493
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:54.700
up onto a local government property so that local,
state,
federal,

494
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:57.490
and private property rights are all at play.
And in this case,

495
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.153
so that,
uh,

496
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.240
there are also issues that arise from conflicts with fishermen who may have the

497
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:11.860
right to a lobster in this area.
Perhaps they,
they,
uh,
uh,
uh,

498
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:16.120
use a form of fishing that drags over the,
the,
uh,
the bottom.
Uh,

499
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.980
these are known as the Nantucket shoals,
uh,
known to be,
uh,

500
00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.940
a former,
uh,
clamming areas.
Uh,
the,
the Nantucket area,

501
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:29.560
the buzzards bay area is,
is,
has a long and rich history as a,
as a,

502
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.660
as a fishing,
uh,
being important as a commercially viable fishing,
uh,

503
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.890
uh,
area so that,
uh,
they're also potential conflicts here with,

504
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.870
with the air rights,
with respect to,
uh,
uh,
uh,

505
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:48.150
flight paths so that the Federal Aviation Administration is also involved.
Uh,

506
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.730
so that this is really a,
uh,
illegal,
a quagmire in a way.

507
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:56.300
It's a cobweb of,
of rights,
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

508
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.300
touch off jurisdiction on the part of,

509
00:32:58.301 --> 00:33:02.660
of three different levels of government in many a local jurisdictions and a

510
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.450
different different state and federal agencies as well.
So the,

511
00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.490
the location in the sound that is being proposed,
uh,

512
00:33:10.491 --> 00:33:14.150
is pretty much between and to the north of Nantucket,

513
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:15.710
which lies over here on the south,
uh,

514
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:19.520
on the right side and the bottom and a in Martha's vineyard,
uh,

515
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.190
roughly five to six miles off.
For now,

516
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:25.940
this has become most controversial because that is close enough so that the,

517
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.420
the towers would be visible from a shoreline areas.

518
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.730
So they've completed six years of environmental studies of the surface and

519
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:37.580
subsurface geology when tied waves,

520
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:42.530
sediment transport patterns benthic a in and shellfish resources,

521
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:43.430
fish habitat,

522
00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.080
a commercial and recreational fisheries and marine mammals and threatened and

523
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.440
endangered species.
And,
uh,
what,

524
00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:55.370
what's interesting about this is also that they've been quite successful.

525
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.960
Cape Wind,
the corporation has been successful in federal court litigation.
Uh,

526
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:04.880
so that,
uh,
uh,
all of the permitting on the part of local governments and,

527
00:34:04.881 --> 00:34:09.830
uh,
the state government,
uh,
is now complete.
This also fell under the,
uh,

528
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.740
uh,
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act,
uh,

529
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.720
that demanded that an environmental impact statement be prepared.
And,
uh,

530
00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:22.070
this was,
uh,
done,
uh,
with,
uh,
with great care.
Uh,

531
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:27.071
and it also pointed to all of the possible effects on fish,

532
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:32.440
on,
on wildlife,
on endangered species.
Uh,
but,
uh,
also,
uh,

533
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.970
was clear in identifying conflicts,
uh,
between,
uh,

534
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:41.870
the developers and,
and,
uh,
the,
the wind turbine,
uh,
turbines,

535
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:46.790
uh,
with,
uh,
with,
uh,
the,
the various interest groups that,
uh,
uh,

536
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:48.260
currently have rights to a,

537
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:53.240
to use the areas so that a state permitting status is complete a,

538
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:57.410
as of the fall of,
uh,
2008.
And,
uh,

539
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.160
the,
uh,
there's a facility siting board in Massachusetts,

540
00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.350
there is a state environmental quality,

541
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:08.090
a permitting process that was required to be complied with.

542
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.080
Uh,
they're also our state wetlands laws in Massachusetts,
uh,

543
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:16.470
that are particularly protective of coastal wetlands.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,

544
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.290
all of these permits have been.

545
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:23.590
Now granted the federal permitting status is managed by the Minerals Management

546
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.750
Service,
uh,
and that sits within the department of the interior.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,

547
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.140
favorable draft impact statement was prepared in,
in 2004.
Uh,

548
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:36.800
and then it released a favorable draft,
uh,
or exceeding.

549
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.450
That should be a final environmental impact statement.
Uh,

550
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:44.160
on January 15th of 2000,
uh,
uh,

551
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:49.190
2008 favorable comments on the part of different organizations including the

552
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.070
Natural Resources Defense Council,
uh,
known for being very protective of,

553
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:57.450
of coastal areas around the nation and being very concerned about issues of

554
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.640
climate change,
keep wind,

555
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.420
NRDC argued is to our knowledge the largest single source of supply side

556
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:07.530
reductions in CO2 currently proposed in the United States and perhaps the world

557
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.450
and the Department of Energy Assistant Secretary said as the first shallow water

558
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:16.830
off shore project under a review in the United States utility scale projects

559
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:20.370
like Cape Wind are important to our national interest and a crucial first step

560
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:22.920
to building a domestic globally competitive when supply.

561
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.980
And a another,
a former,
uh,
US Department of Energy Assistant Secretary,

562
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:34.230
uh,
and now a Massachusetts Secretary of environmental,
uh,
officers.

563
00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.990
It,
uh,

564
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.360
Susan Tierney comment of the Cape Wind draft environmental impact statement is

565
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:39.751
thorough.

566
00:36:39.751 --> 00:36:44.751
It's detailed to identify as analyzes and describes a wide variety or wide array

567
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:48.720
of impacts with great care,
detail and comprehensiveness.
Indeed,

568
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:51.960
it's one of the most thorough that I've ever seen.
So wide support.

569
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:56.550
Among a variety of different,
uh,
agencies.
Now.
Uh,

570
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.710
right now,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

571
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:04.590
Cape Wind Company is awaiting a decision on the part of Ken Salazar who was the

572
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:08.950
secretary of the interior.
Ken Salazar,
uh,

573
00:37:08.951 --> 00:37:13.530
is responsible for the National Park Service,
uh,
that also sits within the,
uh,

574
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:17.280
uh,
uh,
separate booth than the Department of the interior.

575
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.690
And you might ask a question of,
well,

576
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:23.691
what does the park service have to do with the permitting for facilities such as

577
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:27.250
this?
Well,
the park service curiously,
is responsible,
uh,

578
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.100
because of the national historic preservation act.
Uh,

579
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:36.150
this requires a,
that a historic facilities in the United States be,
be,
uh,

580
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:38.790
identified and ranked for their relative importance.

581
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.130
And if they're found to be of national significance,

582
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.660
they are eligible to be placed on the national registry of historic places.

583
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.910
So that the,
uh,
the secretary of the interior,

584
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.680
and I have to jump ahead here for a second.

585
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.220
The secretary of Interior had the ability,
uh,
to,
to uh,

586
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.910
uh,
decide that,
uh,

587
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:07.040
either the national significance of this as native American burial grounds,

588
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.920
uh,
was,
uh,

589
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:13.620
so high that it would be designated and therefore this wind farm would not be

590
00:38:13.621 --> 00:38:18.040
allowed to go forward.
And he's committed to reaching a conclusion about this,
uh,

591
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.330
within the next two weeks.
So pay attention to,
uh,
to the press.

592
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:24.860
It will turn out to be quite interesting.
So the,
uh,

593
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.130
secretary went out and took a look at the,
uh,
uh,
at the site,
uh,
uh,

594
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.590
several months ago and,
and uh,
uh,

595
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.530
has held a variety of press conferences over the past couple of weeks that

596
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:39.070
demonstrate that he is really on the edge not knowing whether or not this he

597
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:41.400
should be pursuing the national,
uh,

598
00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.940
objective and increasing the renewable energy,
uh,

599
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.560
a portfolio of the United States.

600
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.980
I'm going to have to jump ahead here because I've got way too much material.

601
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.970
So forgive me

602
00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:59.860
or to talk just a moment about comparing this case to two other kinds of

603
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.140
problems that we've discussed in class or that you may be familiar with.

604
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.760
And the idea of the government role of providing either credits or subsidies.

605
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.880
So I want you to think about,
uh,
the,

606
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.900
the relative historical absence of federal subsidy of renewed renewable energy

607
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.280
sources and compare that to,
uh,
uh,

608
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.780
the subsidies that have occurred for the oil industry.
And the,

609
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.580
perhaps the greatest subsidy that I can think of.

610
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.740
A is in part a reflection on what happened.
Uh,
when,
uh,
major,

611
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:37.460
uh,
uh,
automobile company,
a tire company in oil companies,
uh,

612
00:39:37.461 --> 00:39:39.560
in the early 19 hundreds,
uh,

613
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.540
went around to different cities and purchase up,
uh,
uh,
the,
the trolley lines,

614
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.290
uh,
the,
the tram lines,
they purchase them up,
uh,
as a way of,

615
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:53.170
of a diminishing,
uh,
the public's ability to use public transit,

616
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.490
uh,
and to develop an increased reliance on automobiles.

617
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.180
Now think also about the national costs,
uh,

618
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:06.210
to maintain and build or rebuild our national highway system.

619
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.320
And,
uh,

620
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.760
where would the auto industry in the oil industry be in the United States,
uh,

621
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.090
if that,
uh,
were not accomplished by our tax dollars.

622
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.830
So now I think about,
uh,
uh,
the,
the highway system,
uh,

623
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:22.210
as being really a,

624
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:26.680
an enormous subsidy for the oil industry as well as for the auto industries.

625
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.570
I think also about to how we have,
uh,

626
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.300
in the past year a subsidized a,

627
00:40:32.301 --> 00:40:36.560
the auto industry and banks as well.
So that,
uh,
uh,

628
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.900
how do we come to choose to subsidize a certain private ventures and,

629
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.650
and not others.
We have a clear problem that,
uh,
we need to deal with their,
uh,

630
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.570
I also want you to think about a,
a variety of different,
uh,
uh,

631
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.030
conclusions with respect to land use regulation.

632
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.290
We've looked at land use regulation and we've looked at problems of controlling

633
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:59.560
private behavior,
taking away rights,
uh,

634
00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:04.150
from individuals on private land.
Uh,
and,
and I want you to think about,
uh,

635
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.830
the opportunities for a variety of new land use and,
uh,
uh,
uh,

636
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.280
regulation and subdivision regulations,
schemes that might,

637
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:15.530
a zone lands for wind farms.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

638
00:41:15.531 --> 00:41:19.600
if you think back on the Adirondack Park Zoning scheme where they did zone

639
00:41:19.601 --> 00:41:21.280
certain areas for industrial growth,

640
00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:26.200
they zoned other areas for agricultural growth.
Uh,
food farms,
uh,

641
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:30.130
that,
uh,
why not the concept of a zoning for,
for wind farms.

642
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.650
Now you could argue that,
uh,
well if you're going to zone wind farms,

643
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:37.490
you need to think about how you're going to manage the externalities that might

644
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:41.300
fall onto adjacent landowners.
Well,
that that could be dealt with,

645
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:45.890
as I mentioned them a few moments ago and a variety of ways.
Uh,
and,
uh,

646
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.470
these might be,
uh,
uh,

647
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.460
these might include the offering development credits to adjacent landowners to

648
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:55.310
increase density elsewhere.
In other words,

649
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:58.130
a transferable development rights might be,
uh,
uh,

650
00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.650
a component of these land use regulations.

651
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.640
So the adjacent land owners are actually given a bonus.

652
00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:08.300
They're given a development,
uh,
uh,
right,
uh,
that,
uh,

653
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:12.760
would be assignable to an area that was zoned to receive increased density.
Uh,

654
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.910
these would be bankable,
so they wouldn't have to physically develop it.

655
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.790
They could put the credit into a bank and somebody else in another developer who

656
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:23.570
wanted to build in that high density zone,
uh,
could purchase that credit.

657
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.400
So there's a potential here to,
to uh,

658
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:30.430
to tie zoning for wind farms to transferable development rights.

659
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.750
Uh,
require minimum acreage is a hundred acres,
200 acres,
a thousand acres,

660
00:42:35.751 --> 00:42:38.810
whatever.
It would be a and regulate lot dimensions.

661
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.110
So you could imagine a thousand acres in a,

662
00:42:41.111 --> 00:42:45.580
a relatively narrow strip of land are going on for a,
for miles.
Uh,

663
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:50.620
but you could also think about how you might design a lot dimension requirements

664
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:55.130
in a way that would ensure that you would have a separation distance from the

665
00:42:55.131 --> 00:42:57.880
turbine to the adjacent landowners.

666
00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.440
That might sense a offense.

667
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:05.840
We also need to think carefully about zoning for new transmission lines.
Uh,
and,

668
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:09.860
uh,
zoning zoning in corridors,
uh,
is always been a part of,

669
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.260
of a local and state land use regulations.
Uh,

670
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.030
so that I think about where the corridors are right here in new haven.
Uh,

671
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.060
we have a real corridor that also serves as a highway corridor.

672
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.810
It's also a powerline corridor.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
you know,

673
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:28.811
building a new transmission lines and areas where rail and highly corridors or

674
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:30.950
already exist.
Make a lot of sense.

675
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:35.120
If we have to buy new land to create new transmission lines,

676
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.560
that's going to be an extraordinarily expensive venture.
Uh,
and,
uh,
think about,

677
00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:41.910
uh,
uh,
again,
this problem of having the,

678
00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.320
the production being located in distance,
uh,
in,

679
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.020
in large distance away from,
uh,
the,
uh,
the points of,

680
00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:54.050
of higher population densities and,
and,
uh,
uh,
uh,

681
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:54.943
consumption.

682
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.750
So another conclusion that I want you to walk away with here is with respect to

683
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.730
property rights so that offshore development is going to be much easier to

684
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:09.440
accomplish,
uh,
the non shore development.
Now here we are in 2010,

685
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:14.570
the Cape Wind developers made their proposal in 2001 they've wandered their way

686
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:19.040
through this regulatory permitting process for,
for nine years.

687
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.580
There's a lesson there.
The lesson,
uh,
is,
uh,

688
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:26.270
has been followed in a variety of other regulatory contexts and it's called one

689
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:31.080
stop shopping,
one stop shopping for a permit.
You know,
what if we had one,
uh,

690
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.790
renewable,
uh,
uh,

691
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:37.170
agency renewable energy agency that had all of the authority to grant the

692
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:40.890
permits and yes,
they would have to consult with state representatives,

693
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:43.440
they would have to consult with local representatives.
Uh,

694
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:47.820
but a developer could go through this process perhaps in three or four years,
uh,

695
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.500
instead of nine years,
uh,

696
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.340
the capital carrying costs that are involved here when you're purchasing

697
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:57.690
property,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
trying to figure out,
uh,
uh,

698
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.880
what state of technology you're going to apply.

699
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.610
Capital costs here are enormous and can be discouraging.

700
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.620
I mentioned the coal bed methane issue and,

701
00:45:05.621 --> 00:45:10.260
and thank distinctively about how that coal bed methane property,
right,

702
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.360
uh,
was,
was allowed to be purchased by the private sector.
Uh,
whereas,
uh,

703
00:45:15.361 --> 00:45:19.060
the,
the,
the wind property,
right,
like the solar property right,
uh,

704
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.440
is generally assigned,
uh,
with a surface lands.
Uh,

705
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:24.000
so who has the right to block wind,

706
00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:27.990
who has the right to block solar radiation and are these legitimate bases for

707
00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:32.280
civil actions as news nuisances.
Now I'd like to close by having you think about,

708
00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:35.400
uh,
uh,
damages and how we calculate damages.

709
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.490
And as you think about every case that we've discussed in this term,
uh,

710
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.460
when we think about environmental effects,

711
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:44.430
you should be thinking about the magnitude of the effect.

712
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.460
And you should be thinking,
thinking about the distribution of the effect.

713
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.680
So think about a,
uh,
this,

714
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.880
this comparison between nuclear power on the one hand and wind energy on the

715
00:45:53.881 --> 00:45:55.200
other.
Uh,

716
00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:59.970
what are the adverse environmental effects from a wind power likely to be while

717
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:03.390
we've gone through a variety of them,
uh,
biological resources,

718
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:05.930
a land area that's going to be required,
uh,

719
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.840
but they all pale in response to,
uh,

720
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.890
the problems associated with constructing and operating a nuclear power plants

721
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.810
and then figuring out what to do with the waste.

722
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:19.890
And one way to think about distribution is just to think about,
uh,

723
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.850
how something spreads geographically,
but think about distribution,
uh,

724
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:28.500
in a temporal way as,
as well.
So that,
uh,
uh,
the,

725
00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.490
the,
a fact that the environmental protection agency is required to develop a,
a,

726
00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.010
a nuclear waste disposal plan,
uh,
to cover 1 million years,

727
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.900
uh,
for the management of the Yucca Mountain a storage facility,
uh,

728
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:47.400
that has to do with the persistence of,
of,
uh,
the radiant nuclides,
particularly,

729
00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.020
uh,
uh,
plutonium isotopes.
I mean,
think about that.
Uh,

730
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:56.490
the persistence of the problem over time is another way to consider
distribution.

731
00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:01.620
Uh,
so,
uh,
the consideration of magnitude and distribution by,
uh,
as well,

732
00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:06.600
by thinking about questions of equity,
who are these damages going to fall onto?

733
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.880
A,
how should they be managed?
Uh,

734
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:13.340
and some people are much more capable of managing risk than other people are.
Uh,

735
00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:17.400
so they can buy higher quality insurance than,
than,
uh,
uh,
uh,

736
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:20.040
poorer people can.
So,
uh,
once again,

737
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:24.930
magnitude and distribution for a variety of different kinds of effects.
So,

738
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:25.311
uh,
the,

739
00:47:25.311 --> 00:47:30.311
the effect in my opinion on wildlife and fish noise on aesthetics and vibration,

740
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.170
uh,
on the shadow and flicker effects,
uh,
that,
uh,

741
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.710
are being studied alone with a vibration affects right here in the Yale medical

742
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:41.830
school.
Uh,
there is a claim by the way,
that,
uh,
uh,

743
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:46.690
these wind turbine farms create vibrations that you can't actually feel,

744
00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:51.160
but they're strong enough if you are in close enough proximity to these fields,

745
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:55.720
uh,
to have,
uh,
uh,
your,
your sleep disturbed.

746
00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:59.290
And also on the property values and an on recreational access.

747
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:04.000
These are the core points of contention,
but compared to managing nuclear waste,

748
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.120
uh,
over,
uh,
hundreds of thousands of years,

749
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.100
these seem like relatively minor issues.

750
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.880
And I'd like to close with just one thought and that is,
uh,
uh,

751
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:17.380
as you think about difficult tradeoffs such as this,
I encourage you to,

752
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.930
to consider the idea of reversibility.

753
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:25.270
Reversability isn't a concept that has been built into a variety of different

754
00:48:25.271 --> 00:48:28.930
laws,
so that a,
under many different statutes,
uh,

755
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:33.960
the government is required to consider whether or not the effect is reversible.

756
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:38.880
So,
uh,
plutonium,
uh,
the creation of a,
uh,

757
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:43.860
plutonium and,
uh,
he's not a reversible decision.
And,
uh,
uh,

758
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.550
given that,
uh,
uh,
length of persistence,
uh,

759
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.690
the construction of a coal fired power plant such as you see here on the upper

760
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:57.080
left,
yeah,
that's reversible.
You could pull that apart.
But if we look at our,
uh,

761
00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:01.060
our history of rehabilitation of a damaged sites in industrial facilities in the

762
00:49:01.061 --> 00:49:04.840
nation,
uh,
they tend not to be rebuilt because they're so highly contaminated.

763
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.010
Now think,
uh,

764
00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:11.010
think about the disassembly of a turbine farm or the disassembly of a solar

765
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.860
generating facilities such as this,
uh,
out in the new banks,

766
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.910
New Mexico desert.
Uh,
these are easily disassembled.

767
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.720
So just consider the idea of reversibility,
uh,

768
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:27.490
as you think about how these kinds of choices might be made.
Okay,
well,

769
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:29.670
that is the end of lecture 23 and a,

770
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.230
we'll wrap up with a final lecture on Thursday.
Thank you.
