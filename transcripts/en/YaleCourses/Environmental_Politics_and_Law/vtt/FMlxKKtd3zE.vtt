1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.830
Okay.
So I want to continue the story about cleaning up,
uh,

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.070
landscapes that had been severely affected.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.470
And I wanted to use this as a basis for reviewing a variety of different laws

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.080
that apply in certain key provisions in the statutes,
uh,
that,
uh,

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.990
have met with more or less success.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.640
And I'm going to start today with the National Environmental Policy Act,

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.150
which was passed in late 1969 and it was one of them,

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.580
the first statutes that declared a comprehensive national policy to protect the

9
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:38.814
environment.

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.380
And I wanted to just pause on this because many people think that the idea of

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.570
sustainability is fairly new.

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.630
But if you look at the purpose statement inside the statute,

13
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.300
you see that back in the late 1960s,
uh,

14
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.650
that many of the ideals that people now believe and think of when they use the

15
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:59.550
phrase sustainability are deeply embedded in the statute.

16
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.520
So let me just go through this quickly.

17
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:07.200
The congress recognizing the profound impact of man's activity on the

18
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.690
interrelations of all components of the natural environment,

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.460
particularly the profound influences of population growth,
high density,

20
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:18.720
urbanization,
industrial expansion,
resource exploitation.

21
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.220
And New and expanding technological advances and recognizing further the

22
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:27.750
critical importance of restoring and maintaining environmental quality to the

23
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:29.520
overall welfare and development.

24
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:34.500
A man declares that it is the continuing policy of the federal government in

25
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:38.790
cooperation with state and local governments and other concerned public and

26
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:43.560
private organizations to use all practicable means and measures including

27
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:48.360
financial and technical assistance in a manner calculated to foster and promote

28
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:53.160
the general welfare to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature

29
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:56.880
can exist in productive harmony and fulfill the social,
economic,

30
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.210
and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.

31
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.590
This is a,
an exceptionally broad mission statement.

32
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.030
This law was passed,
uh,
not with any regulatory authority,

33
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.920
so it could not prevent human development,
uh,

34
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.430
but it demanded instead that any project,
uh,

35
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.140
private or federal,
uh,

36
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.230
that would receive public funds from the Federal Treasury,

37
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.290
Treasury,
uh,

38
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.310
would be required to declare exactly what the proposed development was and to

39
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.130
project out what the environmental effects might be in the future.

40
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.250
The statute was also curious,

41
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:41.130
and that it included something called a citizen suit provision,

42
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.470
so that environmental groups or other citizen watchdog groups could monitor

43
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.760
federal agencies.
They could look at their budget and think about what kinds of,

44
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.740
of,
uh,
development,
uh,
were being proposed by Congress,

45
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.320
a contained in authorization statutes are,
uh,

46
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.580
and then think down the road about,
uh,
how to,
uh,

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.010
make sure that those developments proceeded in a way,
uh,
that,
uh,

48
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.360
had a minimal impact on the environment.

49
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.580
So this was the origin of the idea of an environmental impact statement,
a model,

50
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.500
uh,
for declaring and,
and,
uh,
uh,
basically,

51
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.700
uh,
making public,
uh,
all proposals for new development.

52
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.740
And also it created a,
an enormous industry in the environmental sciences.

53
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.880
Uh,
an industry that really,
uh,
involved,
uh,
soil scientists,
uh,

54
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.560
atmospheric chemists,
a water quality experts,
uh,
that,

55
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:42.730
that all joined together to try to figure out exactly what the effects of new

56
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.100
development might be.
Now,

57
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.190
if you think about the scale of our economy and you think about,
uh,
the,

58
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.880
the federal budget,
you,
you realize that,
uh,
just this past week,
uh,

59
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.580
our president issued his proposed budget almost $3 trillion,

60
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.180
and that's an enormous amount of money being expended,
uh,

61
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.180
that would be put into projects,
uh,

62
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.900
developed by the Defense Department,
the Energy Department,
uh,

63
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.690
the Department of Transportation and highways.
Uh,

64
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:14.620
even the environmental protection agency when they issue a permit now to a new

65
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:17.290
sewage treatment plant or a new water supply facility,

66
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.670
that treatment plant must be reviewed in the context of an environmental impact

67
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:25.070
statement so that any expenditure of funds,
uh,

68
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.510
demands that this forward looking projection occur.

69
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.970
And it's always open to citizen's suit citizen contest,
uh,
through litigation.

70
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.280
And it's been very effective in altering new development.
Uh,

71
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.190
many dams had been stopped by this statute,
uh,

72
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.660
by judge's interpretation of it because of claims of insufficiency,

73
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.650
of the environmental impact statements.
Uh,
and so that a,

74
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:55.651
it also includes a very extensive public hearing process whereby drafts have to

75
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.540
be prepared,
they have to be taken to public hearing.

76
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.650
People have to have an opportunity to review the material so that they can

77
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:07.480
understand what might be happening in their backyard.
Uh,
and they,
they,
uh,

78
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.180
may also be very critical of the quality of science.

79
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.380
And this is not a laboratory science.
This is a science that,
that,
uh,

80
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:19.090
really is predictive in nature.
It's a probabilistic in,
in a sense.

81
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.090
So most environmental science,
uh,
that,
that,
uh,
demands forecasting,
uh,

82
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.300
you should think about it as being probabilistic.
Uh,
which is why most,

83
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.380
uh,

84
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.310
programs and environmental studies have a requirement for taking statistics and,

85
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.400
and often probability.
So,
uh,

86
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.630
the scientists needed to look into the past and try to discern from previous

87
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.630
studies what was most likely to happen in the future.

88
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.080
And the only way that a project could be stopped would be that would be if,

89
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.640
if the impact statement were found to be insufficient,

90
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.590
to not fully have disclosed what the effects would be or to include a science

91
00:05:56.591 --> 00:06:01.220
that really was poorly done,
uh,
that,
that,
uh,
uh,
did not seem defensible.

92
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.530
So I'm going to move on,
uh,
to,
uh,
discuss several other statutes now.
Uh,

93
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:10.100
but one key point is that citizen's suit provisions have been built into a

94
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:13.490
variety of major environmental laws,
including the clean air act,

95
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:17.090
the clean water act,
a circular,
which is the super fund law,

96
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.430
the resource conservation and Recovery Act,

97
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.400
the cradle to grave statute that I mentioned the other day.
Uh,

98
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.280
the emergency planning and community right to know act,

99
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.610
which gives communities the,
uh,
the right to,

100
00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:31.340
to know when chemicals are being released in their environments,

101
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.520
if those chemicals are recognized to be hazardous substances and the endangered

102
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.940
species act.
So basically this,
uh,

103
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.640
this opportunity for litigation,
uh,
has,

104
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.710
has really radically changed the way that new development,
uh,

105
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.720
and uses of the environment I've gone forward.

106
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.100
Now in this case and the case that we talked about on Tuesday,
uh,

107
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.560
hazardous site on VA case in Puerto Rico.
Uh,

108
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.390
this was a very important statute,
uh,
in that the,
the,
uh,
uh,

109
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.010
court case,
uh,
uh,
Romero,

110
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.110
Marcello v Weinberger or Weinberger v,
uh,

111
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.910
Romero Barcella,
uh,

112
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.330
was brought in part a because the navy had not developed an environmental impact

113
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.050
statement,
uh,
that,
uh,

114
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.740
projected out what the longterm effects might be of their continued bombing of

115
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:29.180
the island.
So this statute,
uh,
uh,

116
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.930
required,
uh,
it was interpreted by a judge in Puerto Rico to,
uh,

117
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.220
require the development of,
of a draft environmental impact statement,

118
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:38.060
which was prepared.

119
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.420
It's kind of curious because I wanted to find that draft environmental impact

120
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.950
statement.
I didn't know whether or not there might be projections of,

121
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:48.470
of a longterm damage or,
or perhaps a counting of,

122
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:52.160
of kinds of weapons that had been released.
So I looked for it.

123
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.890
And in mud library,
the former government documents library here,
uh,

124
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.050
we,
we had,
and we still have many environmental impact statements that,
uh,
uh,

125
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.000
you can request.

126
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.750
Unfortunately you can't wander through the aisles anymore because it's been

127
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:10.280
closed down.
Uh,
but the university is still maintains these,

128
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.880
these environmental impact statements that are actually quite interesting too to

129
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:17.210
browse through.
Well,
I couldn't find this impact statement.

130
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.790
And a then our,
uh,
our social science librarian,
uh,
put out a message,
uh,

131
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:27.470
on her email list and to asked if anybody in the nation might have a copy of

132
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:28.100
this.

133
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.330
And it turned out that one person on this list of all university libraries and

134
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:34.460
public libraries responded yes,
uh,

135
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:38.030
that he had collected all military draft environmental impact statements,

136
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.370
including this one.
So he's xeroxed it and Senate.
To me,

137
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.380
it turned out to be a gold mine in that it demonstrated a variety,
uh,

138
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.830
of,
of a historical action on part of the navy,

139
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.560
including diagrams such as this.

140
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.500
You see the bombing range up here on the upper left.
Uh,

141
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:57.840
but you also see in basically the same scale,

142
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.270
other maps that the,
the,
uh,

143
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.300
navy put together showing where their targets were showing also color codings of

144
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:10.890
these areas.
In this case,
concentric circles that,
uh,
had the,

145
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:15.891
the metric in the key member of bombs dropped or pounds of bombs dropped per

146
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.120
acre per year.
So this,

147
00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:23.140
this proved to be really important to try to think through,
uh,

148
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.210
what was released when it was released,
uh,
and where it might've gone.

149
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.660
And one interesting thing is that you see that this side of the bay over here,

150
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.520
it looks like it was continually targeted.

151
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.730
Fact tanks were located at the top of the hills,
uh,

152
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.500
and they were clearly being targeted both by a bombers but also by artillery

153
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.590
shells.
Uh,
so gradually this area,

154
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:48.570
this part of the landscape was being flattened.

155
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.740
And by flattening the beach area at the end of that runway,

156
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.850
they basically created a trough or trough by which that lagoon could drain all

157
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:01.500
of the material that had collected,
uh,
into the bay.
It also,

158
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.520
and I looked at this,
uh,
air photograph maybe 30 or 40 times,

159
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.440
and it hadn't dawned on me that this little light patch right here,
uh,

160
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.950
seemed like it was just an open area sand.
But it,
it,
uh,

161
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.230
you can track it in Google earth and find that it reaches down gradually and

162
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:21.470
then fades into seagrass beds.
Uh,

163
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.480
but clearly it's evidence that material has flowed out of that area and kill the

164
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:29.010
vegetation on the floor of this bay.

165
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.900
The same thing happened on the other side and if you see these lines in the

166
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:38.790
diagram down here,
these lines depict the,
the bombing rude,
uh,
so that,

167
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.360
uh,
uh,
uh,
planes would take off from aircraft carriers.

168
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.440
They would fly up in this direction on the,
on the east side.

169
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.210
They'd circle around and come back and fly back this way and bomb in both

170
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:51.900
directions.

171
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.900
So three or four a firefighter planes would be doing this continually year after

172
00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:01.890
year,
decade after decade,
millions of pounds after millions of pounds.

173
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.690
So that a,
they disclosed not just a pounds per acre per year,

174
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.920
but a total amount of munitions so that the estimate,
the estimate,
uh,

175
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.720
of a hundred and a hundred to 150 million pounds of ordinance,
uh,

176
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.340
is basically derived from information that was provided in the environmental

177
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:24.540
impact statement that would not otherwise have been put to get the made

178
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:27.900
available.
Since that time,
I've recognized also that,

179
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.540
that the navy has maintained a really tough and tight accounting system of,

180
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.910
of what they did.
And how would I know that?
Well,

181
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:40.911
by talking to people that were ordinance officers and you recall those,

182
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.390
uh,
large concrete bunkers,
couple hundred concrete bunkers up in the hills,

183
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.650
a loaded with different kinds of weapons while they were officers or enlisted

184
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:53.920
men that were responsible for the inventory in each,
the buildings.
I mean,

185
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.950
they want to know how many nuclear weapons they've gotten and where they are

186
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.310
at any point in time.
So they had kept their records very neatly.
Uh,
again,

187
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.450
this information was not included in the environmental impact statement,

188
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.100
but it provided a basis for,
for litigation.
So,

189
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.730
so that,
uh,
it,
this,

190
00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:19.150
this type of a historical documentation is often very difficult to come by.

191
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.150
Another statute that,
uh,

192
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.360
has played an important role here and in many hazardous sites around the nation

193
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.690
is the resource conservation and Recovery Act of 1976,

194
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.590
which was designed to manage both hazardous and nonhazardous waste.
Uh,

195
00:12:33.591 --> 00:12:38.050
and included the cradle to grave tracking system mean meaning that uh,

196
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.880
waste or hazardous chemicals from their time of creation,

197
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.650
their movement,
uh,
via a ship or by rail or by,

198
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.020
by a tanker truck,
uh,

199
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.330
and their ultimate disposal disposal had to be recorded.
So it was a,

200
00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:58.840
a large scale national inventory system.
And the key to this system,

201
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.140
it's just like the endangered species act that I was talking about the other day

202
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.180
or the safe drinking water act.
Uh,
the,

203
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.490
the core of this system and its Achilles heel is really that the chemical has to

204
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.730
be listed as a hazardous substance to make its way onto the list.

205
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.510
So you can imagine that adding additional chemicals is something that a,

206
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:19.930
the chemical companies and,
and people that use,
uh,
uh,

207
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.220
basic chemicals don't really want to have happen because it increases their,

208
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.400
their accounting responsibilities and the reporting responsibilities to the

209
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:30.320
government.
Uh,
it included a,

210
00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:33.430
a hazardous waste land disposal band.

211
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.180
And this is kind of interesting because there are about 300,000 community

212
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:41.470
landfills sprinkled around the nation.
Every town has a landfill.

213
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:45.100
They used to call them dumps.
Now they call them sanitary landfills,

214
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:46.990
which is an oxymoron,
a,

215
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.640
if anybody has any sense about what's happened there.
But,
uh,
for,

216
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.460
you know,
much of have a history,
people have taken everything,
uh,
and just,
uh,

217
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.740
a piled up in a landfill.
And then by about 1950,

218
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:02.020
they started covering it over with,
with soil.

219
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.960
I'm not thinking about where the material might go.

220
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.430
I remember when I was young going to,
uh,
our local dump,

221
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:13.900
we called it a with my dad and watching trucks pull up an oil trucks,

222
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:18.790
pull up and drain their tanks into the piles or refuse,
uh,
people that,
uh,
would,

223
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.960
would pull up that were,

224
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.140
we're a mechanical mechanics that worked on people's heating systems and they

225
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:29.440
would use solvents to take the grease off of the,
uh,
uh,

226
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.960
somebody oil burner and that grease would,
uh,

227
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.800
the grease and the solvent would then just be thrown into the dump.
Uh,
so that,

228
00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:39.520
uh,
if you dug down beneath any of these sanitary landfills today,

229
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.500
you would find not just a solvent's and,
and residues of oil and fuel,

230
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:44.951
uh,

231
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:49.750
but you'd find many other chemicals has plastics and other products degrade,

232
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.460
just leaching into the soil and to underlying water.

233
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.590
So that preventing land disposal was a very significant provision back in 1984.

234
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.450
Also,
the underground storage tank program is located in,
in this statute,

235
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.640
and it requires an inventory and monitoring of,
of underground storage tanks.
And,

236
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:07.971
uh,
you know,

237
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:12.020
you can imagine that a underground storage tanks that contain gasoline or,

238
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:16.550
or other fuels or,
or oils,
uh,
sitting beneath the surface,
uh,
in a,

239
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:18.530
in a steel tank,
uh,

240
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:22.370
designed to last 40 years has contaminated many,
many sites.

241
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.490
Those gas stations that you see with the yellow ribbons around them,

242
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.170
they basically are regulated under this statute and they are a product of some

243
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:35.171
engineer who had the bright idea probably back around 1920 or 1930.

244
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.560
That a 40 year life cycle for a storage tank made out of steel was going to be

245
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:43.910
an okay thing.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
you know,
what's the life cycle of a storage,
uh,

246
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.820
barrel?
A 55 gallon drum for example.
Uh,
so this,
uh,
this,

247
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:49.903
this,
uh,

248
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:54.930
design error has polluted groundwater and soil literally around the world and

249
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:58.340
used oils as well.
What happens to that oil that you,

250
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.230
your mechanic drains out of your car when you get your oil changed every 3000

251
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:07.100
miles?
Well,
it used to be just taken to the town landfill.

252
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.560
So this statute prevented that from happening.

253
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.690
So the case was like any other community that had done many of these landfills,

254
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.553
so to speak.

255
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.820
And it was a repository for a variety of hazardous chemicals.

256
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.590
So key Rick rock controversies that have emerged include,
uh,
the listing issue.

257
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:25.341
Uh,
you know,

258
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:29.960
what's hazardous mixed years if a waste is mixed with nonhazardous waste,
uh,

259
00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:34.340
is it still hazardous?
This has been a debate that has been intensely litigated,

260
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.160
uh,
with the idea that a dilution is not the solution.
Uh,

261
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.210
the idea that motor oils,
some of them are exempted even though they're toxic.
Uh,

262
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:48.860
that's been the subject of a much litigation household wastes a also,

263
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.430
can they be mixed up with a more hazardous waste mining and oil production waste

264
00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.780
had been excluded.
Uh,
and,
uh,

265
00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.740
one interesting provision in this case is the corporate officials can be found

266
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.540
guilty of criminal behavior.
Uh,
so,
uh,

267
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.050
the standard of evidence for a criminal case is different than a civil case.

268
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:13.190
A civil action,
uh,
whereby,
uh,
a civil action would,

269
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.510
would be decided by a preponderance of the evidence means,

270
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:21.590
which means that it's more likely than not that a damage was induced.

271
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.050
Uh,
but,
uh,
a core,
a criminal case of demands,
a higher burden of proof,

272
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.450
meaning basically that,
uh,
uh,

273
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:32.940
it has to be demonstrated that the causal link exists,
uh,

274
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.980
beyond a reasonable doubt.
And Rick were also,
as I mentioned earlier,

275
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:41.540
contains a citizen suit provision.
So by 1986,

276
00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:46.541
about 27,000 contaminated sites had been identified and as I mentioned the other

277
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.880
day,
now there are more than 3003 skews me,
300,000,
uh,

278
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.740
contaminated sites in the private sector and perhaps 50 to 100,000 in the public

279
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.574
sector.

280
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.080
The on other statute that is at play here,

281
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.050
he's the emergency planning and community right to know,
act,
uh,

282
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:08.010
that's contained in the Super Fund amendments of 1986.
Uh,

283
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.900
and this basically gave every community the right to know about chemicals that

284
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:17.280
are made by stored in,
are admitted from local businesses.
Uh,
so that uh,

285
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.120
this,
this evolved after many first responders,

286
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:26.030
a experienced toxic reactions to chemicals that were stored in buildings that
uh,

287
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.280
uh,
we're on fire.
So they went into a,

288
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.870
put the fire out and received intensive exposures and it created something

289
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:38.790
called the toxic release inventory.
Uh,
the toxic release inventory is,
is a,

290
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:43.050
uh,
a list of who releases what,
uh,

291
00:18:43.051 --> 00:18:46.990
where and when,
and it has to be provided,
uh,

292
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.500
on an annual basis to the environmental protection agency,

293
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.830
but only if the chemical is put on the list and only if it's produced or present

294
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.300
in at a,
uh,
uh,
a level that exceeds a certain volume or,

295
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:01.134
or weight limit.

296
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.730
So the Sarah amendments a authorized the additional funds for national priority

297
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:11.290
list sites,
uh,
mandated public involvement,
uh,

298
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.620
provided permanent remedies to,
uh,
uh,
uh,

299
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:20.310
restore sites or to,
to,
uh,
uh,
basically pay for proven damages.

300
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.940
It also requires something known as best available technologies,
uh,

301
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.450
to clean up the site.
So a huge question in all these cases is a,

302
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.390
once a site is contaminated,
how,
how should it be restored?

303
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.150
What's the standard for restoration?
Is it prehuman?
Uh,

304
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.250
is it a certain risk based standard so that it's okay to have a little bit of

305
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:42.870
lead or a little bit of benzine in the,

306
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.120
in the soil or the groundwater or the trees.

307
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.430
So these are very difficult questions.
No site is cleaned up,

308
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:50.850
uh,

309
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.850
back to its pre polluted condition completely so that the remedies are always

310
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:56.891
detectable in,

311
00:19:56.891 --> 00:20:00.930
in all of these cases [inaudible] state standards apply if they are more

312
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:01.650
stringent.

313
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.620
And this is an interesting provision because it's one of the few laws that

314
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.230
allows states to preempt federal standards.

315
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.900
So the Clean Air Act,
uh,
uh,

316
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.020
basically preempts Connecticut for example,

317
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:20.230
from having tougher standards then then the federal government to,
to,
uh,

318
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.240
you know,
admit chemicals to the air.
But,
uh,
unless,
uh,

319
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.610
uh,
we'll talk about this in a,
in a week or so,
uh,
unless,
uh,

320
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.850
Connecticut is out of compliance with the clean air act standards,

321
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.530
then we have to meet California standards,
which are the toughest in the nation.

322
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.940
So the idea of preemption not preventing a lower level of government from

323
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:45.840
passing a law that is more stringent than the federal level of government is

324
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:49.690
very desirable from the perspective of,
of the private sector.

325
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.050
Now why would that be?
Basically,

326
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:56.620
you'd want a kind of a common ground you'd want to,
you want to deal with,

327
00:20:56.621 --> 00:21:00.730
with only a one set of regulations rather than worrying about,
you know,

328
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.550
moving your goods or your,
your material or whatever it is,

329
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:08.551
your service across state boundaries and having to negotiate a 50 different sets

330
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:12.910
of regulations.
So this is a really important statute statutory provision.

331
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.100
And that includes a citizen,

332
00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:20.410
a supervisions litigation basically stalled out in [inaudible] and it stalled

333
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:25.921
out a superfund cleanups during much of the 1980s in 1990s predominantly because

334
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.890
of the citizen's suit provision.
It's an interesting thing,
so that,
uh,

335
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.760
potentially responsible parties would then sue the government claiming that they

336
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:38.761
really were not the primary responsible party or that they should pay only for

337
00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:41.110
the proportion of,
of the material.

338
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.480
It was hazardous that was detected on the site.

339
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.700
So the superfund amendments in 1986,
uh,

340
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.060
prevented certain forms of litigation by PR,
uh,

341
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:55.600
potentially responsible parties or parties that EPA had declared to be

342
00:21:55.601 --> 00:21:59.900
responsible.
And things sped up.
The vak story,
uh,

343
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.940
was also affected by,
uh,

344
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:07.020
these amendments in one way in that it created the agency for toxic substance

345
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:13.210
and disease registry.
That's quite a mouthful for a federal agency.

346
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.020
It sits inside the Centers for disease control based in Atlanta,
Georgia.

347
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.880
And this group,

348
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:23.530
how has the responsibility to respond to any community that petitions the

349
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:27.520
federal government,
uh,
arguing that,
that they have been damaged?

350
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:32.200
Either their property or their health has been damaged,
uh,
by federal actions,

351
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.850
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,
are,
are now declared to be superfund sites.

352
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.330
So it allows the citizens,
uh,
of the nation to,

353
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:44.420
to basically get expert scientific advice to,
uh,

354
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.140
to figure out what chemicals are released and how people might be exposed and

355
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.090
what the hazards are.

356
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.950
And this agency has played a really unusual role in that they,
they very,

357
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:58.420
very rarely in their history.
Now there are 23,

358
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:03.300
24 years old.
Uh,
they very rarely have found that there was a,
a,

359
00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:07.390
a conclusive that there was conclusive evidence that,
uh,
the,
uh,

360
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.830
the wastes on a site,
uh,
that the,
uh,
hazardous materials are released,

361
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.950
proved,
produced a adverse health effects.

362
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.180
So in 2003,
they went down to VA case,
uh,

363
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:22.220
because one of the islanders petitioned the agency,
uh,

364
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:27.270
with this question and they went about their business looking for a whether or

365
00:23:27.341 --> 00:23:30.670
not the contaminants in drinking water might be a problem.
And they concluded no,

366
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:34.990
the drinking water is okay.
The water comes from,
from a,
a national forest,

367
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:36.460
which is on the mainland Puerto Rico,

368
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:39.370
and it's actually pipe six miles underneath the,
the,
uh,

369
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:41.710
the bay to the island of VA case.

370
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.800
Or they also concluded that now that the navy had,
had left the island,

371
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:48.240
that the air quality was sufficient so that,
that,
uh,

372
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.080
that did not pose a significant threat to the community.
Uh,

373
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.780
they also concluded that that,
uh,
the,

374
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:56.690
the food that was grown on the island and the fish that were caught in the

375
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:59.220
coastal waters,
uh,
we're not,
uh,

376
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.080
contaminated at a level that poses a significant threat.
So they,
they,
uh,

377
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.660
virtually washed their hands of,
of,
uh,
uh,

378
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.120
this being a significant threat to human health.

379
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.700
And they dismissed all of the claims on the part of the,
uh,
VA case residents,
uh,

380
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.940
that,
who believed that,
that,
uh,
the,

381
00:24:17.941 --> 00:24:22.670
the navy's behavior in their contamination caused a whole array of different

382
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:24.110
kinds of adverse health effects.

383
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

384
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:32.850
<v 0>A lawsuit was filed on behalf of of 7,100 residents on the island in night in</v>

385
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:39.230
2007,
uh,
that,
uh,
claim that the navy was responsible for,

386
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.080
for,
uh,
uh,
loss of,
of health.

387
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.350
And the government's response has been really quite interesting,
uh,
in,

388
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.630
in one respect,
they responded that,
uh,
well,
they,

389
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.690
they are protected by sovereign immunity.
Uh,

390
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.220
which basically is an argument that,
uh,
you know,
the,

391
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.520
the king is immune from any,
uh,
any litigation that,
uh,

392
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.800
uh,
uh,
uh,
the king,
uh,
uh,

393
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.580
it should not be held accountable for a past behavior.
Uh,
they also argued that,

394
00:25:09.581 --> 00:25:11.950
uh,
bringing a class action lawsuit,
uh,

395
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.270
representing a large group of people like this,

396
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.410
but focusing in on a representative sample of that group so that you wouldn't

397
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:22.940
have to litigate and develop evidence for each individual among the 7,100.

398
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.080
They,
the Justice Department,
uh,
uh,
believe that,
that,
uh,
uh,

399
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.880
they should be handled case by case.
Now,
here's a community that is well,

400
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:36.260
well below the national poverty level are they had no resources to mount a case

401
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:41.210
like this.
So that,
that,
uh,
uh,
several law firms,
if he had picked this up and,
uh,

402
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:45.770
one in particular has been pursuing Sanchez versus versus the United States.
And,

403
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:49.160
uh,
you know,
by some mysterious coincidence,
uh,

404
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:53.900
there was a convergence a of this lecture,

405
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.280
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

406
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:59.690
the lecture on Tuesday and the CNN documentary on VA case that was released this

407
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.850
week.
I'm going to play you a,
if this works,

408
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.940
I'm going to play you just one clip from this documentary.

409
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.203
<v 1>Oh,</v>

410
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.680
nearly 40 years ago,

411
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.680
July [inaudible] 70 I was 17 and a half.

412
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.300
You said holding hands or twice.
He's nearly blind and he's an oxygen tank.

413
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.100
He has Lou Gehrig's disease,

414
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.270
crippling back problems and sometimes it needs a wheelchair.

415
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.080
This is where we lived.

416
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:16.530
The I can catch [inaudible] says he's been sick ever since he was stationed on

417
00:27:17.071 --> 00:27:18.720
the island.
During that period of time.

418
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:21.660
Did you ever think something is really wrong with this picture?

419
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.040
All the time because I get sick

420
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.690
sometimes.
I stopped bleeding automatically from my nose.
I said,
my God,

421
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:36.660
why am I lead?
I come back and maybe I'm vomiting.

422
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.860
I used to get diarrhea pains in my stomach all the time.
Uh,

423
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:46.250
headaches,
I mean tremendous value.
My region and used to get blurry.

424
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.780
So what was on there today?

425
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.730
This decorated former marine is the thong witness in a multibillion dollar,

426
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.620
more than 70,000 residents of is Caribbean island.

427
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.060
About 75% of the people here or who would you,
US government.

428
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.780
They said what the US military did here maintenance sick when nearly six decades

429
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.390
beginning right after World War Two the American Ireland never jacket was what

430
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.460
the name of the wall

431
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.460
and you get a picture of what was the light when they would,

432
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.250
when they would use this island as a training ground and he started the brace.

433
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.940
You could feel the ground,
the ground would,

434
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.220
you can never go to college.
You could feel it.
You're off the way.

435
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.140
It would rain and rain bombs and this will go on seven days a week.

436
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:52.180
The people need the truth to understand what has happened is their Johnny Jr if

437
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.590
the attorney and the law school,

438
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.590
one of the biggest problems we have is it we don't believe that the military has

439
00:28:59.591 --> 00:29:04.350
bullied complaint with all the chemicals and agents that have the news on myself

440
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.670
after years of controversy and protests and they left the,

441
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:15.660
I can sign it in 2003 today,

442
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.850
much of the base is demolished.
And what's that largely overgrown?

443
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.130
It hasn't started some toxic

444
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.510
Dr job walk up

445
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:39.730
of sick cause he has of the navy's bombing range

446
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.680
or results from the longevity involving uh,
the shelling,

447
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.340
the stranger and uh,

448
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.350
many different compounds including lead and mercury and cadmium as well as from

449
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.910
retardants fuels.
And many of these would be some baby tensing

450
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.690
these images five years ago by University of Georgia scientists,

451
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
she'll omer bombing and surrounding water through loaded ordinary.

452
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.780
According to Uga Sciences,
many of those bombs.

453
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.580
Can you think you could corrode leaky out synergetic.

454
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.410
The Environmental Protection Agency in 2005 doesn't need it.
Park as of yet,

455
00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.200
I feel good fun toxic site requiring the navy.

456
00:30:25.201 --> 00:30:27.320
Does he get to clean up the navy?

457
00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.380
Identify many thousands of unexploded initiative and instead of one the not

458
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.500
outrageous islanders fear more tenable,

459
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:41.690
we'll the relief the US government's response to the islanders lawsuit is to

460
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:46.400
claim the sovereign immunity that residents have no rights to sue the

461
00:30:46.401 --> 00:30:47.234
government.

462
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.870
And the government offered disputes that enables activities under yes,

463
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.630
they Anders ill

464
00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.730
Saturday it 2003 government study.
That sounds Noli.

465
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:05.380
So do you think
my phones

466
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.490
for
texting with these orders

467
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.420
is not one of the plaintiffs,
but what question deposition,

468
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.380
he testified with weapons.

469
00:31:21.381 --> 00:31:24.270
If you found the islands included chemical insecticides,

470
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.320
the fleet of uranium navels and the agent all

471
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.760
short and

472
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.333
[inaudible],

473
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:43.530
the old man for the Chrysler,

474
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.080
the military has acknowledged delete

475
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.290
and it's fun at Vf,

476
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.870
this American term,

477
00:31:59.060 --> 00:31:59.893
Hey,

478
00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.860
how do you do some big 10 year old back yard and you you've hurt someone

479
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.570
and you help them and if not we'll make it.

480
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.420
<v 0>All right now as you reflect on that,</v>

481
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.990
he should be asking yourself a whole bunch of questions.
One of them would be,

482
00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:38.050
here's a gentleman who is now a mid fifties he obviously has many different

483
00:32:38.661 --> 00:32:39.494
medical,

484
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.200
but he faces a serious burden of proof of exposure to chemicals that were

485
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.340
released by the navy.
So how would you think that through?
How would you,

486
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.280
how would you make that connection?
One question you might ask is,

487
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.150
were the chemicals that they described in the lawsuit that were released by the

488
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:02.570
navy present in his body?
Well,
you know,
the,

489
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:06.040
the historical reconstruction problem that I mentioned on Tuesday is,

490
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.700
is extraordinary.
It's incredibly complex,
scientifically,

491
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.660
and it will be very expensive to document how long do these chemicals last in

492
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:18.530
somebody's body?
What are plausible alternative sources of exposure?

493
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.650
You know,
the Navy,

494
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.720
the navy argued that heavy metals used in the weapons were also minerals that

495
00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:27.080
had,

496
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.080
had been driven by winds from Sahara and dust storms across the Pacific and rain

497
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:34.130
down.
And perhaps that's a route of exposure.

498
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.420
So the navy has been very good along with the justice department in developing

499
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:41.810
these plausible alternative hypotheses.
Another,
Ben has another,

500
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:43.700
has been the ritualistic use of mercury.

501
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.860
Did the mercury come from a navy switches and the bombs that leaked out on that,

502
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.640
on that site made its way into the marine food chain built up and then made its

503
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:55.460
way to the dinner table and into people's bodies?
Uh,

504
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.180
or did it come from an electric plant that was located on the island?

505
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.460
Or could it have come from any fish and efficient in the area?
Uh,

506
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.500
when the agency for toxic substances and disease registry did their fish sample,

507
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.530
uh,
they wandered around the island,
uh,

508
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.760
sampling fish from many different locations.
But as I mentioned,

509
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.990
often the sample sizes were incredibly small,

510
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.730
less than 10 in size.

511
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:28.100
So what you want to do is you'd want to know that these chemicals had moved,
uh,

512
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.110
in a gradient from their location of,
of a release,
uh,

513
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.510
further and further away.
And you hope to find a,

514
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.490
a declining gradient in the concentration as you move further and further away.

515
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.120
But they didn't,
they didn't conduct this kind of work.
James Porter,

516
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.200
who is a professor at the University of Georgia that I mentioned has done that

517
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:51.380
work.
And as you move further and further away from the bombed area,

518
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.180
you do see these declines.
So key questions that are raised by this video.

519
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.580
What was the prior knowledge of the Defense Department?

520
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.800
I know that the Defense Department had very accurate records of the ordinance

521
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:06.920
that was released and where it was released and when it was released.

522
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.060
Another key question is,
should this move forward as a class action lawsuit?

523
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:16.250
If it,
if,
uh,
uh,
the,
the courts find that,
uh,
it,
it cannot,

524
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.180
that it has to be,
uh,
uh,
judged individually person by person.

525
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:23.720
There's no help that this would be a concluded in the next 50 years.

526
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.880
The idea of sovereign immunity,
uh,
should the United States be responsible.
And,

527
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:31.500
uh,
this has spoken to quite clearly,
uh,

528
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:35.900
in the variety of environmental statutes that,
that,
uh,
I described to you,
uh,

529
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.080
just 15 minutes ago.
Uh,

530
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.460
but so the central core question here is one of causation.

531
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.060
Did these chemicals caused those illnesses?

532
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.810
What's the matchup between the chemicals released the chemicals found in

533
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:53.040
people's bodies and what we know medically about the effects of those chemicals?

534
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:58.020
This is very difficult science to be held to a standard of scientific proof,

535
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.130
say 99% confidence that that,
uh,

536
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.080
there is this established cause and effect relationship,
uh,
would,
uh,

537
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.370
virtually make it impossible for this community,
uh,
to,
to,
uh,

538
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.020
recover damages,
uh,

539
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.880
beyond a reasonable doubt said a different different matter.
Uh,

540
00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:19.740
so what you see here as you see the,
uh,
the media getting behind this case,
uh,

541
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.600
being sympathetic,
uh,
having a very clear story about a chemical release,

542
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.040
not really knowing where it went,
uh,

543
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.830
not really fully understanding what people's exposures were,

544
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:36.810
uh,
how they might've been exposed by air or water or food.

545
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:37.740
Uh,

546
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.740
but you also have a community that has lived in an environment that socially has

547
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:44.730
been seriously affected.

548
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:48.480
There is no debate about the fact that the presence of the military,
uh,

549
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.960
put the economy of that island in the freezer for much of the 20th century and

550
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.500
the impact of that in,
in diminishing their income,

551
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.650
diminishing their access to basic public services and such as education and

552
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:08.160
health fair health,
health care,
uh,
such as early detection,

553
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.830
having to travel off the island when you don't own a car,
uh,

554
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.030
to a hospital on the mainland to Puerto Rico,
uh,

555
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:20.210
is a big disincentive to get early medical care.
Uh,
so late medical care,
uh,

556
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.730
translates into a higher incidence of disease,
uh,

557
00:37:23.731 --> 00:37:27.330
and detection when the illness has progressed to become more serious,

558
00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.950
cause more difficult to,
to manage.
Uh,
also,
uh,

559
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.800
everyone is thinking about,
okay,
what is the cost going to be?

560
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.470
What's a likely cost for this one site?

561
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.970
And remember the figure that I showed you the other day,
that,
uh,

562
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.060
the congress allocates a roughly a two to two,

563
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.190
two and a half billion dollars per year for the entire superfund program,

564
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.410
whereas plausibly,
uh,

565
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.120
it could take up to a billion dollars to clean this area and also to,
to,

566
00:37:57.121 --> 00:38:00.030
uh,
provide sufficient medical care for the community.

567
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.100
And also remember the fact that many of these families had,
uh,

568
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.750
uh,
uh,

569
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.980
earlier generations that were plucked up off their property and moved.

570
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.820
How would you think about compensating them for their loss of property value

571
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:20.100
given $25 in 1945 for a track of land,
uh,
or for a,

572
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.480
uh,
uh,
the costs incurred by having your house,
uh,
uh,

573
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:28.710
bulldozed and in,
in having the family moved to a different part of the island.

574
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.940
It's also raises a very interesting counterpoint to the,
the uh,
uh,

575
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.190
Marshall Islands case that we saw the other,
uh,
the other week.

576
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.410
And that is that a,

577
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.180
when the United States decided to take over in the Marshall Islands,

578
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:45.280
they did so thinking,
uh,
that,
uh,
no one could survive an attack there.

579
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:48.820
They had to move everybody out of the islands that they bond in this case,

580
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.970
they believe that they could conduct their,
their weapons testing,
uh,

581
00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:56.730
in a way that,
that,
uh,
uh,
would not harm the,
the,

582
00:38:56.731 --> 00:38:59.590
the population if they concentrated them in the center of the island and they

583
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:00.700
bombed the end of the island.

584
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.430
But they weren't thinking ecologically about pathways.

585
00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:04.720
They weren't thinking about diet,

586
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:09.460
they weren't thinking about airborne dust and prevailing winds.
So that,
uh,

587
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.313
uh,
the,

588
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:16.120
the idea that they should move the entire population off the island was

589
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:21.000
reconsidered.
Uh,
there are now available documents,
uh,

590
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.720
demonstrating that,
that John Kennedy a thought very,
very carefully about this.

591
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.560
And Kennedy,
uh,
you remember was president during the,
the,
uh,

592
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.430
Cuban invasion and a VA case was a very important base for,

593
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.430
for staging for the invasion of,
uh,
the Bay of pigs.
And what,

594
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.670
what,
uh,
Kennedy was thinking about was,
okay,
uh,

595
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:46.180
why don't we completely remove the island islanders and resettle them in other

596
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:50.650
parts of the Caribbean.
He decided against that move.
Uh,
but,
uh,

597
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:52.150
that decision,
uh,

598
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:56.860
perhaps as a come back to haunt the government and certainly is haunting the,

599
00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.650
uh,
the islanders.
Uh,
however,

600
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.880
this whole mess is a product of misunderstanding,
uh,

601
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.390
basic ecological principles,
uh,
as well as,
uh,
a,

602
00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:12.580
I think a,
a disregard for,
for,
uh,
uh,

603
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.620
the longterm health of the community.

604
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.250
There are a couple of other statutes here that,
that are at play.
And,

605
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.420
and I wanted to raise your,
uh,

606
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.150
bring your attention to the wilderness act of 1964.

607
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:30.460
And this statute is,
is quite,
uh,
interesting,
uh,
in that,
uh,
it,

608
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.650
it defines wildernesses,
uh,

609
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.730
an area in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the

610
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:40.630
landscape is hereby recognized as an area where the earth in its community of

611
00:40:40.631 --> 00:40:45.550
life or untrammeled by man,
where man himself is visitor who does not remain.

612
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.270
It goes on to define characteristics of,
of,
uh,
an area that,
uh,

613
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.090
I would have to be met before it could be designated as wilderness.
Uh,

614
00:40:55.150 --> 00:41:00.150
but at the same time that the government left VA case and transferred

615
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.850
jurisdiction to the fish and wildlife service to create a u s fish and wildlife

616
00:41:06.851 --> 00:41:08.560
refuge on the island,
uh,

617
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:11.980
Congress decided that it was also going to declare the area of federal

618
00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:12.814
wilderness.

619
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.620
So it is distinctive in the United States right now because it is the only super

620
00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:21.670
fund site,
you know,
reserved for the most hazardous sites in the nation.
Uh,

621
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.310
that is also declared to be a wilderness area.

622
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.630
A paradox that,
uh,
maybe you could explain to me,

623
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.570
especially looking at,
uh,
at the site,
the,

624
00:41:34.571 --> 00:41:36.550
the government clearly thought that that,
uh,

625
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.920
it would give them greater power to exclude people,
uh,

626
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:44.280
which they think they're doing well by posting signs on the beach.
Uh,

627
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:48.880
this is a sign that,
uh,
is,
is,
uh,
right on the edge of the water that,
that,
uh,

628
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.050
is within perhaps a hundred yards of,

629
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:54.390
of tank sitting on a hillside that became the target,
uh,
for,

630
00:41:54.391 --> 00:41:58.050
for planes as well as artillery shells.
So the idea that that,
uh,

631
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.080
you could post a sign and it would keep people out.
Uh,
I,
I,

632
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:08.060
well,
I took a research crew out there,
uh,
several years ago and,

633
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:08.420
uh,

634
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:13.420
on one afternoon there were six or eight large pleasure boats all lined up about

635
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.620
50 yards from this sign.
Uh,
kids are out swimming in the water,

636
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:21.440
playing on the beach.
Uh,
so that the idea that you would,

637
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:26.360
you could control people via,
via signs with no other presence,
uh,
is,

638
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:28.640
is a defies explanation.

639
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.840
Another statute that's a play here is the endangered species act.

640
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.200
And the purposes of this statute passed in 1973 are to provide a means whereby

641
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:42.360
the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend maybe

642
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:46.580
conserved to provide a program for the conservation,
uh,

643
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.550
for their conservation.
So,
uh,

644
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.640
certain types of acts including,
uh,

645
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:58.220
damaging the habitat of an endangered species or taking an endangered species,

646
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.430
either shooting it,
uh,
by,
by killing an endangered species.

647
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:04.730
You are taking it under this statute.
Uh,
so,
uh,
this,

648
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.910
this law again pass back in 1973 a and the u s left the Ireland in 2003.

649
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.680
There were three decades,
uh,

650
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:18.140
during which species declared to be rare or endangered.

651
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.720
Uh,
particularly the turtles that lived on the island,
uh,

652
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.730
were clearly being affected by military,
uh,
behavior and maneuvers.

653
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.170
So here's a list of the species of any of you,
uh,

654
00:43:28.171 --> 00:43:31.370
happen to be particularly interested.
So

655
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.740
I'm going to have to scoot ahead here so we can keep moving.
Moving on.

656
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:39.980
But I want to do to recognize that,
that this history,

657
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.170
this history of military action,
uh,
uh,
of,
of training,

658
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.330
uh,
basically testing weapons,
uh,

659
00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.520
of staging maneuvers that preceded major military actions.
Uh,

660
00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:57.290
it's created a legacy of severely contaminated sites around the nation.

661
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.540
Here's Johnston Atoll,
uh,

662
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.510
which is now the Pacific islands national wildlife refuge.

663
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.950
So you see that there actually is a pattern of taking a former former highly

664
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:08.360
contaminated military base,

665
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.650
translating it or transferring its jurisdiction into efficient wildlife refuge.

666
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.020
Uh,
this may look like the Moonscape,

667
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:19.820
but this is the atomic testing site in Nevada where you can see the craters

668
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.680
that,
uh,
uh,
are the result of,
of hundreds of other,
uh,
uh,

669
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:29.240
above ground tests.
Here's another highly contaminated sight in Hanford,

670
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:31.500
Washington.
Uh,
the Hanford works,
uh,

671
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:35.100
the side of the green run that you could read a about and,
and,
uh,
uh,

672
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.330
green intelligence,
uh,
the underground storage tanks,

673
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.000
the same problem that I mentioned earlier in the lecture,

674
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.610
a leaking radioactive waste that is,

675
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:49.050
is highly concentrated into the Columbia River.

676
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.970
The Columbia River is a,
a,
uh,
uh,
habitat for Pacific Salmon.

677
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.920
Uh,
and many other,
uh,
species of fish.
And it's a very,

678
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.440
very highly prized region.
Uh,

679
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:04.650
the military reservation on Cape Cod provides one more example.

680
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.520
This reservation has a history that span just about the same amount of time as

681
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:12.750
VA case.
Uh,
from about 1942,
uh,

682
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:17.500
just about a year of 2000,
2001,
actually,
the jets that,
uh,

683
00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:20.750
were poor trying to catch up to,
uh,
the,

684
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.840
the September 11th,
2001 hijackers,
uh,

685
00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:27.240
they were scuttled from,
uh,
uh,

686
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:31.690
the Massachusetts military reservation on Cape Cod.
Uh,

687
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:36.360
this site,
uh,
uh,
is sitting on go sands and gravels,

688
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.570
uh,
and it's basically a,
a,
uh,

689
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.720
a collection of very large aquifers on Cape Cod,

690
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.600
a in which the freshwater sits on top of,
of a underlying saltwater.

691
00:45:47.601 --> 00:45:49.560
And the closer you get to the ocean,
uh,

692
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.420
so that anything put on the surface will drain into underlying,
uh,
uh,

693
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:59.480
sands and aquifers moving very quickly.
Uh,
so this has become the largest,
uh,

694
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:04.200
drinking water contamination site and remediation site in,
in the United States.

695
00:46:04.201 --> 00:46:06.430
Now they drilled some,
uh,

696
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:10.740
8,000 different wells to try to figure out where the fuels,

697
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.540
the flame retardants,
the munition residues,
the TNT and RDX,

698
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:18.900
et Cetera,
or where did it go?
And they've monitored it out.

699
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.900
And they created these plumes that pump the water up out of that Aquifer,

700
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.420
entering into these charcoal,
uh,
tanks,
uh,

701
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:28.530
activated carbon tanks that,
uh,

702
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.020
some of which are bigger than this entire lecture hall.
Uh,
so,
uh,
you know,

703
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.750
day after day,
24 hours a day,
a decade for decade,

704
00:46:36.751 --> 00:46:40.810
this water is pumping through their,
uh,
hoping that it will be cleaned up,
uh,

705
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.790
to meet the safe drinking water act standards.
By the year 2035,

706
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.290
3000 pounds of solvents had been removed from that water.

707
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.850
1000 pounds of fuels removed from the groundwater in eight plumes are now

708
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:56.660
undergoing treatment and remediation.
Uh,

709
00:46:56.670 --> 00:47:00.050
this is immediately adjacent to a variety of cranberry bogs.
Uh,

710
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.480
so cranberry farmers bore the brunt of economic loss,
uh,

711
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.700
when this was discovered.

712
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.250
So critical lessons here about VA case knowledge is power that's very clear.
Uh,

713
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.900
classified information,
uh,

714
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:16.960
prevents the public from understanding what was done when and where,
uh,

715
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.310
what the nature of surrounding or nearby community threats might be.

716
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.150
A question of who conducts the science.
Uh,
it's clear that the ATS,

717
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:28.240
Dr within the Centers for Disease Control,
uh,
was,
was,
uh,

718
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.690
not doing high quality science and,
and,
uh,
uh,

719
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.100
came to a premature conclusion of safety.
Uh,

720
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.500
based upon the highly limited sampling.

721
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.410
A science normally proves no causal relation.
Uh,

722
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:47.060
so this type of science is perhaps,
uh,
uh,
one of the more complex that a,

723
00:47:47.061 --> 00:47:51.700
I could imagine.
Uh,
also one lesson here that is,

724
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:55.090
is,
uh,
uh,
