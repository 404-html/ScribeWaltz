1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.590
I want to continue talking about property rights today.
And I'm going to also,
uh,

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.270
uh,
address,
uh,
most of the lecture to the problem of taking [inaudible].

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:13.470
And when the government has the right to take private property for public

4
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:18.330
purposes and under what kinds of circumstances compensation is required,

5
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.030
uh,
and you were calling the fifth amendment of the constitution,

6
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:26.031
that private property can't be taken without compensation if it's going to be

7
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.440
used for public purposes.
Before we get there,
I want you to think about,
uh,
the,

8
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:34.110
the way that property rights are fractured by law,

9
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:38.650
but also by jurisdictional boundaries.
And I wanted to spend a moment,
uh,

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.020
to,
to,
uh,
give you a sense of the kinds of problems that are experienced,

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.740
uh,
out in Wyoming in the Northwestern corner,
uh,

12
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.890
known as the greater Yellowstone ecosystem.
Uh,
and this is a,

13
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:53.640
an extraordinary area.
It's one of the last great tracks of,

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.450
of a forest lands in the,
uh,
in the northern Rockies.

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.220
And it also is a habitat to a variety of,
of,
uh,
uh,
large mammals,

16
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
many of which are either threatened or,
or rare or endangered.

17
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.150
And the jurisdictional boundaries are really complicated.

18
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.360
And I think very interesting.
There are several national parks,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

19
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.870
Yellowstone national park,
uh,
also,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.660
national forests,
uh,
the grand Teton national forest,
uh,
the,
uh,

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.840
uh,
several other,
a national wildlife refuges are,
are also in this area.

22
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.160
Uh,
several native native American reservations are,
are in this area as well.

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.400
And what you see on the right hand side of this slide is just one example of one

24
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.300
species of,
of wolves,
uh,
that,
uh,
cross these different boundaries.

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.540
So the purpose of this chart is to give you a sense that there are a wide number

26
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:52.140
of laws that are at play on the give a implementation authority to different

27
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.590
agencies such as the Forest Service,
the bureau of land management,

28
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.670
and the National Park Service,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

29
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.640
fish and Wildlife Service and also state complimentary state agencies.

30
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.040
And there are also a large,
uh,
uh,

31
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.770
set of private land owners that own,
uh,
uh,

32
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.770
a huge tracks of land so that it's a mixture of public and private,

33
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.780
uh,
rights that,
uh,
uh,
have a,
uh,
a complexity that,
uh,

34
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.260
uh,
often does not fare well for the natural resources in the area.

35
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.540
And the area is also rich in,
in natural gas as well as oil reserves,
uh,

36
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:32.520
that,
uh,
creates some other,
uh,
types of conflicts.
So a timber harvesting,

37
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.290
oil,
extraction of water rights,
uh,
all of these different resources,

38
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.580
uh,
need to be managed very carefully.
Uh,
and the,
uh,

39
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:46.581
the central problem represented by this map is that that a certain kinds of

40
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.050
resources such as wolves or grizzly bears or,
uh,
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.980
complexes of,
of species transcend these jurisdictional boundaries.
And,

42
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:56.720
and,
uh,

43
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.790
the forest service may have a very different policy than the national parks

44
00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:02.290
service,
uh,
in determining how they're managed.

45
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.400
So the same species of a unusual timber,
uh,

46
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.740
might exist on forest service land and the Forest Service May,
uh,

47
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.560
be giving out leases to,
to extract those timbers timber,
uh,
resources.

48
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.610
Uh,
whereas the park service would not do so.

49
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.360
And I mentioned that in the problem of,

50
00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:20.500
of a fire crossing these jurisdictional boundaries as well,

51
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.610
and having the forest service have a policy of fire suppression as opposed to

52
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.760
the park service's policy of,
of,
uh,
let it burn.

53
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.480
So that the fundamental problem here is that these resources are spanning the

54
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.780
jurisdictional boundaries.
And,
uh,
there,

55
00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:40.400
there is inconsistency and the mission and intent of,

56
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.680
of these different agencies,

57
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.730
which I also think just a moment about the grizzly bears.

58
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.630
Grizzly bears are found in Yellowstone,
uh,

59
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.420
they're found in Canada and Alaska,
uh,
as well.

60
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.480
But consider that,
uh,
the,
the,
the bear,
this bear,
uh,
was,
uh,

61
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.660
uh,
really a common property resource,
uh,
in legal terms.

62
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.460
It basically a w would cross from one area to another.
Uh,

63
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.090
this bear would be protected if it to happened to be wandering through national

64
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:14.410
park lands.
Uh,
but if it had wandered on,
uh,
on,
uh,

65
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.060
uh,
national park land,
say a up in Alaska,
uh,
that,
uh,
we're,

66
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.750
we're also on a native American lands that had been dead dedicated by the native

67
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:29.630
claims Settlement Act,
uh,
that applies to a Alaskan Lens.
Uh,

68
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.290
then this bear would be,
uh,
uh,
appropriable.
In other words,
uh,

69
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.930
uh,

70
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.950
native Americans that lived in that area would have the right to hunt this bear.

71
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.960
So,
I mean,
I think also about the idea of fish,
uh,
in addition to,

72
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:48.850
uh,
uh,
mammals such as this,
they are public resources until they're killed.

73
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.750
So if you get the right to,
uh,
to go hunting,
uh,
once you kill the animal,
uh,

74
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.240
then it becomes your private property.

75
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.200
Unless of course it's a rare threatened or endangered species,

76
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.240
but even they may be appropriable or shot,
uh,
or,
or caught,
uh,

77
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.950
under some,
uh,
provisions of,
of,
uh,

78
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.420
native populations rights.

79
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.010
So also think about the way that we allocate fishing rights.
Uh,

80
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:17.450
and in class,
uh,
I was asked,
uh,
in,

81
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.620
in section about the boundary that,
uh,
uh,

82
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.150
surrounds nations and a,
where the rights are to a,
to fish and,
and can,

83
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.990
can a different country come into the waters of the United States,

84
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:31.840
the jurisdictional boundary of the United States.
And,
and,
uh,

85
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.310
we have a 200 mile limit as to,
uh,
uh,
other nations,
uh,

86
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.800
within which,
uh,
uh,
uh,
we have the right to exclude other,
other,
uh,
uh,

87
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.730
parties or other groups from coming in and,
and,
uh,
uh,
uh,

88
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.150
fishing for a fishing,
uh,

89
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.450
for valuable a species.
I also want you to think about,
uh,

90
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.200
uh,
the main coast for a moment.
Uh,
this is an island.

91
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.360
I had an opportunity to,
uh,
uh,

92
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.030
become a steward or a manager of a nature conservancy preserve,
uh,

93
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:09.020
when I was a phd student here.
And,
and,
uh,
I actually had writing block.

94
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.400
I was having a hard time writing my doctoral dissertation and a,

95
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.760
I called a friend who I knew was managing some lands in for the Nature

96
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.110
Conservancy and asked if they had a reserve that,
uh,
uh,

97
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.500
they needed help with for a period of about six months in.
And uh,

98
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.750
I'll never forget her.
She was delighted to,
uh,

99
00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:28.970
offer me a chance to sit on this island,
which is about 250 acres.

100
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.430
It has a population of zero.
Uh,

101
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.340
so I would be the only person there and that's the little,
uh,

102
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.630
that was my house for six months.
I had a picnic table that,
uh,

103
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.720
I looked out over the,
uh,
these these waters.
Uh,

104
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.800
this little shed was right about there.
The picnic table sat right there.
And uh,

105
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.780
so I cranked a,
the no electricity,
no running water,
uh,
uh,

106
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.230
just a little outhouse.
And uh,
the only person on the island and a,

107
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:57.690
I had a little Smith Corona,
a non electric typewriter.

108
00:06:57.691 --> 00:07:01.700
So I cranked up 350 pages of my phd sitting there looking out to sea.

109
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.050
It was really quite an experience.

110
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.830
But I also learned a lot about property rights and how rights are allocated to,

111
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.040
uh,
to,
to fishermen on the Maine coast.
And you know,

112
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.780
lobster is a valuable resource.
And so how are fishermen allowed to,
uh,

113
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.820
to set traps?
You know,
what,
uh,
how is this regulated?
But it turns out that,
uh,

114
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.120
it's regulated differently by a different local governments and it's regulated

115
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.660
in a variety of ways.
Each,
each of these,
uh,

116
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.910
different buoys represented by a different colors you see here,
uh,

117
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.830
basically are allocated to individual.

118
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.240
So a color is assigned to a single individual.

119
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.060
They have a legal right to fish,
uh,

120
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.670
via a license that is provided by a local community.

121
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.230
And it's a license that a is not gained easily.
Uh,
in,

122
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:51.260
in most of these communities you are not allowed to get a license unless you've

123
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:54.070
lived there for a good part of your life or unless your,
your,
uh,

124
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.220
parents or grandparents have also,
uh,
uh,

125
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.360
fished in the area and they also regulate the number of traps that's allowed.

126
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.650
They're allowed to be put on the line.
So the deal is that a,
you have,
uh,

127
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.541
a buoy here.

128
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:09.500
It's tied by a rope a to one of these traps and that is linked by robe to

129
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:12.230
another trap.
And it may be a nine,

130
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:16.850
10 traps and in the times of,
of a lobster scarcity,

131
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.890
uh,
or during certain seasons of the year,

132
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.810
or they may restrict the number of traps.

133
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.050
So you stuff the bait inside the trap and then you throw it overboard when

134
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:30.200
you've got a,
uh,
you have a buoy on it on either end.
Well,
you know,
uh,

135
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.440
some Lobsterman,
uh,
uh,
our,
our fishing without licenses and,
uh,

136
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:37.800
it's kind of curious that the culture in Maine,
uh,

137
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.950
is extremely protective of property rights.

138
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.440
If you look out across the water in the main area,

139
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.570
you see the coastline literally dotted by these different buoys.
And,
uh,
it's,

140
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.310
it's very common for one boat to run over another boats line and basically cut

141
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.190
the trap from the buoy.
That's why have two buoys to,
uh,

142
00:08:56.191 --> 00:09:01.020
to protect against the loss,
basically reduces the risk in half.
But,
uh,

143
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.510
what happened in,
uh,
and,
uh,
the,

144
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.990
the instance that I'm going to tell you about when I was on the island was that,

145
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.030
uh,
there was,
uh,
a newcomer,
a young guy,

146
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:13.380
about 18 years old who wanted to set traps in this area that had been formerly

147
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.950
allocated to different members of the community.
He wasn't from that town.

148
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.180
He was thought of as an outsider.
Uh,
they saw the new colored,
uh,
uh,
buoys,

149
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.060
and they decided that they would teach them a lesson so that they,
uh,

150
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.470
first thing that they did was they,

151
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.210
they cut the line to one of the buoys and they cut it cleanly.

152
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:34.810
So he would recognize that,
uh,
this was an intentional cut.
If,
uh,
if,
uh,
uh,

153
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.060
a propeller runs over one of these lines,
uh,
basically phrase the end of it and,

154
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:43.790
uh,
it looks like it's not been cleanly cut.
So he,

155
00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:48.300
he didn't go away.
Uh,
he,
he came back a reset his traps and a,

156
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:53.220
so that it cut,
uh,
the second line,
uh,
uh,
of,
of,
uh,
or excuse me,

157
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:56.040
the second buoy off,
uh,
in addition to the first buoy.

158
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.640
So he lost all of his traps.
Each one of these traps costs about $200.

159
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.280
So if you have five or six of them,
which he had,
it's,
it's not,
uh,

160
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.320
a minor investment.

161
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.190
So he came back the same color of buoys popped up,
uh,
in,

162
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.600
in the area a little bit further out to sea.
So they decided that,
uh,
uh,

163
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.980
they're gonna have to take further action.
Uh,
one Lobsterman,
uh,

164
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.490
pulled up and pulled a gun out and shot over his bow,
you know,

165
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:21.580
a warning shot over the bow,

166
00:10:21.581 --> 00:10:26.310
but literally a shot over the bough a and a that didn't seem to work either.
So,

167
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:28.860
uh,
one night,
uh,
they found where he,
uh,

168
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.890
he kept his boat in the evening and they unscrewed one of his spark plugs from

169
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:39.240
his engine and put the spark plug inside his gas tank.

170
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.810
Uh,
so he showed up the next morning and turned over his engine and a,

171
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.540
the boat was a blown to smithereens.
Luckily,
he was not seriously injured.

172
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.460
So that a,
that basically,
uh,
uh,
taught him the lesson that,
uh,
this was,
this was,

173
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.950
uh,
not his territory.
And that he should move on.

174
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.300
But what's curious about this is that they have this,
uh,
they had this,
uh,
uh,

175
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.700
belief in tradition,
uh,
this belief and custom and,

176
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.410
and a belief in that they have the right to fish in that area.
Uh,

177
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.940
and no one else should come in this area.

178
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.360
And the local government doesn't have the capacity to monitor or police this,

179
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:16.290
nor does the state government or the coast guard or the national marine fishery

180
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:20.550
service.
So they take the law into their own hands.
So now,
then,

181
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.640
if you ever are around a coastal area,
including the Connecticut coast,

182
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.550
and you see these,
these a lobster buoys out there,
you'll know that they are,
are,

183
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.810
uh,
territorial boundaries that,
uh,

184
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.950
have really important economic and legal significance.
Uh,
think,
uh,
think about,

185
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.600
uh,
the case of national forest.

186
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.490
Every time I fly to California and I looked down at the rocky mountains,

187
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.650
say I shake my head,

188
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.770
I'm thinking that most of the lands that I'm looking at that look like they're a

189
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.480
denuded of forest,
uh,
our,
our national public,
uh,
domain.

190
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.540
And they've been a basically denuded and,

191
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:54.520
and the soils of have washed the steeper,
uh,

192
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.080
parts such as this example on the Tsongas national forest in Alaska.

193
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.510
And,
and,
uh,
they have no capacity to regenerate.

194
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.020
And this is because the forest service gave out leases to timber companies to

195
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:12.670
clear cut on lands that really did not have the capacity to,

196
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.970
to uh,
uh,
sustain that form of,
of timber harvesting.

197
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.760
Clear cutting may be okay if a lans are,
are,
are flatter and,

198
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.390
and you would not have this,
uh,
uh,

199
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:26.450
likelihood of a loss of soil and organic matter that literally prevents,
uh,

200
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.130
uh,
any form of sustainable timber harvesting so that,
uh,

201
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.440
hundreds of thousands of acres in these a steeper areas,
it at higher elevations,

202
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.610
uh,
now are incapable of supporting timber because of,

203
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:42.280
of the pressure that's been put on the forest service to give out these property

204
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:46.930
rights in a sense,
uh,
these,
these timber harvesting rights.
I like to,

205
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:51.520
uh,
switch gears for a moment and I'm going to begin talking about a number of

206
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.900
cases,
uh,
that,
that,
uh,
involve how we manage,
uh,

207
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.020
coastal development and coastal resources.

208
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.810
And I'd like you to think for a moment about the California coastline.
Uh,
and,
uh,

209
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:09.811
this is being managed under the California Coastal Act of 1976 that created the

210
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:15.490
California coastal commission.
Uh,
and what's unusual about this and,
and,
uh,

211
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.790
uh,

212
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.230
important is that they basically took the idea that's embedded in the Adirondack

213
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.320
park agency act.
Uh,
the idea of zoning,
uh,

214
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:28.120
restricting density of trying to a cluster development in areas that had

215
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:30.770
existing services and,
and,
uh,
uh,

216
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.790
then take areas that were undeveloped and,
uh,

217
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.530
apply rules that demanded very large acreages before new development could

218
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:43.280
occur.
So,
uh,
this,
uh,
area,
uh,
uh,

219
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.750
lies within,
uh,
you know,

220
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.820
roughly about a quarter to a half mile of the California coast and the demands

221
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.480
that the state get involved in permitting,

222
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:54.240
just the way that the state gets involved in,

223
00:13:54.241 --> 00:13:58.440
in permitting new development up in the Adirondacks so that,
uh,

224
00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:02.430
the California is unusual and it's history of,
of,
uh,
uh,

225
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.720
public ownership of,
of the,
uh,
uh,

226
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.750
much of the coastline either as state parks or,

227
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:12.580
or a county parks or in some instances such as the point Reyes national
seashore,

228
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.470
uh,
that,
uh,
was carved out from lands.

229
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.730
And I'll speak about in just a moment so that,
uh,
you know,

230
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:21.550
think about the diverse set of,
of,
of tools.

231
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.260
What strategies could you use to manage coastal development?
Well,
the,
the,

232
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.650
the government might,
uh,
just go in and buy up the land,

233
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.910
exercise their right of eminent domain,
take it out of the public sector,

234
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.250
or can you take it out of the private sector,
excuse me,
uh,

235
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.830
bringing it into the public domain,
which they did,
uh,

236
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:40.390
at the point Reyes national seashore.

237
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.050
They also did this at the Cape Cod national seashore,
fire island,

238
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:47.710
national seashore,
a acid Teague island in Maryland,
uh,

239
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:49.990
and also padre island in Texas.

240
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:55.040
So this idea of going in and buying up private land in the coastal zone,
uh,
has,

241
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.900
uh,
should have a strong interest to a,
to us here in new haven,
uh,

242
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.630
given our proximity to long island sound.
But if you,

243
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:05.690
if you put this idea of protecting resources in the coastal zone,

244
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.220
in the context of what we now know about climate change and the probability of

245
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:14.610
sea level rise and the increased frequency of storms,
uh,

246
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.440
that are severe and increased severity of storms,
uh,
then,
uh,

247
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.750
you should begin to think about,
uh,
the,

248
00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:25.650
the degree of liability that we face collectively as a,
as a nation,
uh,

249
00:15:25.651 --> 00:15:28.760
about the intensity of development that we've allowed in the coastal zone.

250
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.350
So these coastal zone management,
uh,

251
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.720
strategies a bear a lot of attention,
uh,
they're,
they're,

252
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.030
they're worth thinking about what works,
uh,

253
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.830
in protecting a critical resources,
uh,
what doesn't and why and,

254
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.950
and how property rights might be allocated in different ways.

255
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.960
And remember the idea that,
uh,
you know,
rights,
uh,
uh,

256
00:15:48.961 --> 00:15:52.670
are not a unitary,
they are a bundle.

257
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.840
They can be allocated in a variety of different ways so that the point raised

258
00:15:56.841 --> 00:16:01.310
national seashore that lies right next to the San Andreas fault is a wonderful

259
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:05.620
area and,
uh,
uh,
to,
to go out and camp on hike and bike on.
Uh,

260
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.690
but it also is a really interesting example of this idea of buying up up part of

261
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:15.420
the bundle of rights.
So the park service went into this area,
uh,

262
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.360
that was owned by farmers that had fairly large tracks of land,
uh,
some,
uh,

263
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:23.000
hundreds or thousands of acres in size,

264
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.460
but because of its proximity to San Francisco,

265
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:30.461
property values were increasing quite rapidly during the 1960s in 1970s.

266
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.790
And there were a variety of different condominium development plans that the

267
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:37.990
parks service began worrying about.
And this,
uh,
uh,

268
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:43.150
this increase in development pressure coincided with the park services,

269
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:48.020
uh,
intent to create more recreational opportunities,
uh,
in coastal areas.

270
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.740
Why would they do that?
Well,
in part because,
uh,

271
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.230
there were not many national parks in coastal areas.
Uh,
but,

272
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:59.231
but also in part because the US population is concentrated more heavily in

273
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:03.530
coastal areas than it is in the interior part of the country.
Uh,

274
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.830
and they could expand their political,
uh,

275
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.320
and thereby economic base of support if they located them in,

276
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.530
in areas such as Massachusetts or a Texas or a or California.

277
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:22.170
So they would,
uh,
they would enjoy a larger budget.
Uh,
they would,
uh,
uh,

278
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.930
uh,
have a,
a,
a more diverse set of supporters in Congress.

279
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.250
So in this case,
they bought up the development rights,
uh,
to these farms.

280
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:34.670
Some 20 different farmers,
uh,
agreed to sell the land.

281
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.490
And when the park service does this,
uh,

282
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:40.600
they may come in and offer you a,
uh,

283
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.450
x amount of dollars for your development rights,
uh,

284
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.780
or they may tell you that,
uh,
if you don't agree to this deal,

285
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.810
then we're going to exercise eminent domain,
uh,
uh,
in full,

286
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.570
and we're going to take over your lands.
So in this case,

287
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.050
all the farmers eventually a agreed to sell the development rights.
And in,

288
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:59.010
in part the,
uh,

289
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:02.700
the idea was to protect the open space agricultural character of the area,

290
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.950
which is really quite unique.
Uh,
and you,
you,
you see this,
uh,

291
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:12.000
and he's ruling pastoral landscapes,
uh,
that if it were in the form of a,

292
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.530
uh,
traditional national park,
uh,

293
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.930
where timber would not be allowed to be harvested.
No,
no timber leasing,
no,

294
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:24.080
no.
Uh,
a mineral extraction and national parks,
uh,
no,
uh,

295
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.600
uh,
leasing of grazing rights.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,
and no,
no,
uh,

296
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.950
no farming.
So that,
uh,
these,
these,
uh,

297
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.060
restrictions inside a national park made this a split of the bundle of rights.

298
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.030
Uh,
kind of an interesting strategy to maintain the,
uh,

299
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.580
the pastoral character of the area.
Uh,

300
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:45.760
I'd also like to you to think about a different kind of problem that we face

301
00:18:45.761 --> 00:18:50.580
with respect to,
to mining.
And the mining law of 1872 was quite,
uh,

302
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.090
quite curious and important and environmental history.
Uh,

303
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:58.170
and it basically states that all valuable minerals in an on lands belonging to

304
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:03.000
the u s are free and open to exploration and purchased by US citizens.
So that,

305
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.870
uh,
you know,
you could go out and try to stake a claim to a,
to mind on,

306
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.310
on public lands,
you know,

307
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:13.020
provided that they were not done national park lands or designated Federal

308
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.830
Wilderness Lands and,
uh,
you know,
try to,
to,
to make your fortune.
Uh,

309
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:19.980
this was amended by the mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970.

310
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:23.010
And I'm not going to go through all of this,
uh,
but,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

311
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.760
the intent and the purpose was really to promote economic development on the

312
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:30.180
public lands.
So,
you know,
if you think about the public domain,

313
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:34.650
many of you think of public lands as being areas,
uh,
that,
uh,

314
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.630
uh,
the government is protecting and managing for future generations.
Well,
uh,

315
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:42.420
you know,
most of the public lands,
uh,

316
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.320
are thought of as economic development opportunities,
uh,
by,

317
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.310
by,
uh,
those that are responsible for their,
their management,
uh,

318
00:19:50.311 --> 00:19:51.420
whether or not it's mining,

319
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:55.530
whether or not its timber resources or grazing rights,
uh,
or,
or,

320
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:57.020
or water resources.
Uh,

321
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:02.030
the public lands have long been thought of as is playing a critical role in the

322
00:20:02.081 --> 00:20:03.480
economic development of the nation.

323
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.160
This explains in part why the underlying mineral rights or the oil and gas

324
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:15.300
rights are separable from the surface rights.

325
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.720
And many people do not understand this.
So here's an example of a,
uh,

326
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.650
a problem that we're facing in the West right now.
Uh,

327
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.150
they're called the coal bed methane gas reserves,
and a,
from a,

328
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:30.720
this is a hand drawn map in the high country news.

329
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.590
He can see that they're scattered from Arizona and New Mexico all the way up,
uh,

330
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:40.530
into Montana and North Dakota,
by the way,
a,
a plug for the high country news,

331
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.180
uh,
one of,
uh,
yells graduates.
Uh,
uh,

332
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.010
Florence Williams is a reporter for the,

333
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.060
has been a reporter for the high country news,

334
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:54.220
a Yale graduate back in I think the,
uh,
early 1990s.
But,
uh,
you know,

335
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:56.210
I commend that journal to you if you're interested in,

336
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:59.980
in western environmental politics in this case.
Uh,

337
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.650
what has happened is that those that own surface rights are often not aware
that,

338
00:21:04.651 --> 00:21:06.880
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
federal government,

339
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.490
he's often sold off the underlying oil and gas rights so that farmers are waking

340
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:18.700
up in the morning,
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,
notices that,
that,
uh,
uh,

341
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.760
their lands are going to be invaded by a bulldozers and roads are going to be

342
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:27.730
constructed to get,
uh,
mining equipment in,
uh,

343
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.590
that looked like this kind of a drilling rig.
Uh,

344
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.970
the technology is quite,
uh,
quite simple actually.
Uh,

345
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.240
there are a variety of different approaches to this,
uh,
but,
but basically,
uh,

346
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.480
the,
the predominant method now used is that,
uh,
uh,

347
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.890
forget about the direction of these arrows from the moment.
Uh,

348
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:52.150
if you want to extract the,
the,
uh,
the methane gas out of a,
a coal bed,
uh,

349
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.640
and vet gas sits in the fishers,
it's often kept there by the,
uh,
uh,

350
00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:01.360
water that's also,
uh,
in those interests,
disease within the coal bed.

351
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.640
So one way of getting and releasing the methane gas is to pump the water out of

352
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:08.080
the area.
And the,
uh,

353
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:11.710
the analogy that's commonly used is that it's like the opening a soda can and

354
00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:13.630
you hear that,
that pop,
uh,

355
00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:18.020
so you release the pressure and the gas comes up,
uh,
and his,
uh,

356
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.390
pumped into a storage area.
Well,
what happens when you,
uh,

357
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.780
you pump a whole lot of water out of an area such as this.

358
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.260
And to give you an example of the scale of,
uh,
this,

359
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:33.970
this extraction operation in the West right now,
uh,
as of about five years ago,

360
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:38.170
there were nearly 10,000 of these extraction wells that were being,
uh,
uh,

361
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.160
actively,
uh,
used in a Wyoming,

362
00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.850
a alone in the powder river basin,
especially up near Sheridan.

363
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:50.380
And Ashley Roberts who graduated in the environmental studies major a few years

364
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.860
ago,
wrote her senior essay on this problem in,
in a,
in Sheridan,
Wyoming,

365
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.490
and conducted her own research that demonstrated that a,
the,

366
00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.650
this groundwater extraction,
uh,
is occurring at such an enormous rate,

367
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:03.830
uh,
that it,
uh,
it,

368
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.930
it's causing a change in the chemical composition and the biological diversity,

369
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.290
uh,
of this region.
So,
uh,
the,
the,

370
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:15.760
there are trillions of cubic feet of natural gas beneath the surface here.

371
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.470
So the scale of this operation is,
is really quite remarkable.
And other firms,
uh,

372
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:25.240
looking at this diagram are now paying attention to the,
the arrows,
uh,

373
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:28.120
where the,
the,
the gas is being extracted this way.
Uh,

374
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.220
the gas is being extracted a in this method by pumping CO2 down into the

375
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:36.630
underlying coal bed.
So this is thought of as a,
a,
a,

376
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.640
a win win situation from a miner's perspective in that a CO2 is being injected

377
00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:46.880
and a sequestered,
uh,
under this,
under this hypothesis,
uh,

378
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.750
while the natural gas is being extracted.

379
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:57.070
Here's an example of one of the unintended consequences from a,
a,

380
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.960
a,
a rancher in southwestern Colorado and,
uh,

381
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.280
Laplata county.
Well,
in the late 1980s,

382
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:07.730
the kid started lighting the lemonade on fire.
So I knew something was going on.

383
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.300
Why would a,
why would the lemonade catch fire?
Well,

384
00:24:12.301 --> 00:24:16.290
that would catch fire because the methane wasn't a completely extracted a,

385
00:24:16.291 --> 00:24:19.790
it would seep into the groundwater resources,
uh,
so that,
uh,

386
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:24.080
the lemonade had methane that was flammable.
Another example,

387
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.530
you may have read or seen the horse whisperers,
uh,

388
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.080
a film or book a,
so this is a story that,
uh,
uh,

389
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.460
has to do with a horse whisperers complaint about cold bath bed,

390
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:42.210
methane extraction on his property.
He,
the,
the,
the real,
uh,
horse whisperer.

391
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:46.370
The trainer,
uh,
woke up one morning,
uh,
to bulldozers,

392
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.690
carving a road across his property and he was outraged and he was one of the,
uh,

393
00:24:50.691 --> 00:24:55.160
the ranchers that w was not aware that the underlying mineral rights were

394
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:58.760
separable from the surface rights and that,
uh,
he,

395
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.350
he thought that he got his gun out and,
uh,
uh,
thought that,
uh,
uh,
you know,

396
00:25:03.351 --> 00:25:06.710
he could drive these people off the land and checking with authorities.

397
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.050
He found that they actually had a purchase the lease a to,

398
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.930
to extract the minerals from beneath the land.
So that a,

399
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:19.931
he was basically left with trying to figure out how he could minimize the damage

400
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.160
so that,
uh,
uh,
he did not have a right to stop them.
Uh,
they,
they built the roads.

401
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:28.550
They built the,
uh,
the wells,
uh,
they extracted the gas,

402
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.460
the water that was pumped up a change,
the chemical composition of,

403
00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:37.300
of water.
And in,
uh,
uh,
on,
uh,
on his,
uh,
uh,

404
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.270
lands and in is a streams and a drainage areas.
Uh,

405
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:43.820
and also the ditching,
uh,
and,
uh,
the,

406
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.750
the diking that was a necessary to control the water,
uh,

407
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.150
made it dangerous for him to run his cattle.

408
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.860
So a lot of the farmers are experiencing a more dangerous situation,

409
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.650
uh,
to,
uh,
to pursue their own livelihood.
So here's another example of,

410
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.040
of a,
you know,
what it looks like from,
from the air.
Now these patches,

411
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:08.160
this patchwork quilt of,
of a extraction sites,
uh,

412
00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.600
that so now tens of thousands of these things,
uh,

413
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.130
had been constructed across the western United States.

414
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.780
So one way to think about this is to think about the law of Nuisance,
uh,

415
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:18.530
an act,

416
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:22.550
a object or practice that interferes with another's rights or interests by being

417
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:27.050
offensive,
annoying,
dangerous,
obstructive,
or unhealthful.
Uh,

418
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.230
there's a distinction between what's thought of as a public nuisance and a

419
00:26:30.231 --> 00:26:33.020
private nuisance.
So a public nuisance,
uh,

420
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:36.890
interferes with the collective interest and criminal prosecution.
Uh,

421
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.480
maybe the remedy,
but a private news nuisance,
uh,

422
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.020
maybe thought of as a tort or a civil wrong,
uh,

423
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:45.330
at any activity that interferes with the enjoyment and use of one's property.

424
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.740
I e the horse whisperer is property,
uh,

425
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.920
and it may be the basis for civil litigation.
So the horse whisperer does have,

426
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:56.510
as it would these other ranchers,
uh,
the,
the opportunity to,
uh,

427
00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.420
to take the,
uh,
uh,
drilling company,
the gas company,

428
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.660
the mining company to court.
Uh,
but,
but you know,
that,
uh,

429
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.430
that form of litigation often spans long periods of time so that to avoid

430
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:12.450
litigation,
uh,
if you were the minor or the,
the,
the gas extractor,

431
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:16.370
what would you do?
You would try to enter into some sort of a,
uh,

432
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.450
a legal agreement with each of the,
uh,
the farmers,
uh,
that,
uh,

433
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.300
you would pay them x amount of money if they would agree not to litigate.

434
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.260
So there's a lot of,
of,
uh,
uh,
uh,

435
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.630
legal agreements that underlie these,
uh,
these wells.
Uh,

436
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.600
and another nuisance case from the 1880s that has a bearing on this.

437
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.600
If land use is considered to be a nuisance,

438
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:44.100
it may be regulated without compensation.
Well,
so that a,

439
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:48.690
the damages in this case might be regulated by a local government agency.

440
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.340
So local governments traditionally have the role of a adopting zoning and

441
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:57.840
subdivision regulations in a way that would control these kinds of nuisance.
Uh,

442
00:27:57.841 --> 00:28:01.870
so in,
in one case,
a,
this nuisance was defined,
uh,

443
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.720
by Mugler versus Kansas.
A supreme court decision back in 1887,

444
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.330
uh,
where the sale of alcoholic beverages was,

445
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.380
was believed to be a public nuisance and prevented by regulation.
Uh,

446
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:16.110
and in this case,
compensation was not required.

447
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.670
So not all rights to use the land were removed as the land could still be used

448
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:21.600
for other purposes.

449
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:27.050
So the idea that a government could regulate land and not be required to

450
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.120
compensate a,
that the land owner,
in this case,
the owner of the,

451
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:36.900
the store that sold alcoholic beverages,
uh,
that,
that's an interesting idea.

452
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.980
Uh,
but the,
the condition here is that not all of the rights were removed.

453
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:44.460
And that he had other opportunities to make economic use of that land.

454
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.850
So keep that in mind as you think about a takings law.

455
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:53.190
Another famous case in takings law history is Euclid versus Ambler.

456
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.110
Uh,
the,
the origin,
uh,
this is a supreme court decision,
uh,

457
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.780
uh,
from 1926,
uh,

458
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:05.781
where a land use ordinance that segregated residential and commercial districts

459
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.350
was challenged.
Uh,
its constitutionality was challenged,
uh,

460
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.573
and uh,

461
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.880
it was believed by private interests that the restrictions on new development,

462
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.410
uh,
in each zone,
uh,
was,
uh,

463
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:22.350
taking because it removed the value of that property.

464
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.660
So if an individual was in a residential zone and they wanted to build a store

465
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.640
shopping center or a casino,
they would not be allowed to do so.

466
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.080
So that the authority of the state or local governments acting on behalf of

467
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:38.790
states to restrict land use,
to segregate land,
use,

468
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.950
uh,
to,
to control density.
Uh,

469
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.330
this has been substantiated as early as 1926.

470
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.770
So the Supreme Court concluded at state police power may be used to classify and

471
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:55.480
regulate land use to prevent nuisances.
Another case,

472
00:29:55.481 --> 00:30:00.190
it's interesting,
uh,
and one that I'm sure all of you have been to is,

473
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.070
uh,
the case of,
uh,

474
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:08.200
Penn central transportation company versus the city of New York decided in 1978.

475
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.940
So the question here surrounded grand central station.

476
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.100
Now Grand Central Station,
uh,

477
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.280
at that time was managed by the Penn Central Transportation Company and the city

478
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:23.480
of New York decided that they wanted to designate,
uh,
uh,

479
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.420
grand central station as an historic landmark and thereby prohibit development

480
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:30.390
above the terminal a.
Now,

481
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.240
would this be constituted with this constituted taking a property without

482
00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:38.980
compensation?
So here's another kind of,
right.
Uh,
so that uh,
right,

483
00:30:38.981 --> 00:30:43.810
uh,
to subsurface resources such as oil and gas needs to be considered.
Uh,

484
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.140
the,
uh,
the right,
uh,

485
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.000
associated with building on the surface needs to be considered.
But,
uh,

486
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:52.840
this is an argument about air rights.
So if you own the surface rights,

487
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.550
do you also own the air rights or could the government come in and restrict your

488
00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:02.260
ability to,
uh,
uh,
build to an infinite height?
Well,

489
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:05.590
zoning ordinance is commonly have building height restrictions.

490
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.460
And in this case it was a bit unusual because the district that,
uh,
uh,

491
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.020
grand central station is in,
I mean,

492
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:14.650
you walk out and you see the Yale Club and the Yale Club has just about as high

493
00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:16.880
as a grand central station.
Uh,
but,
uh,

494
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.310
then look around you and you see office buildings that are towering,
uh,
you know,

495
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.580
dozens and dozens of stories in height.
And in this case,

496
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.900
the Supreme Court affirmed that the restrictions imposed by the New York City's

497
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.830
landmark preservation law,
uh,
uh,

498
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.860
on Penn central's right to construct an office building above,
uh,

499
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.710
the terminal do not constitute a taking of private property.
Uh,
so that,

500
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:41.951
uh,

501
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:46.360
it upheld the legitimacy of the designation of the site as an historic landmark,

502
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.470
uh,
and the authority of New York to,
uh,
to regulate,
uh,
air rights.

503
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:55.660
So one cannot presume that they have a kind of infinite freedom,
uh,
to build,

504
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.390
uh,
to a greater height.

505
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.310
I to bring another Supreme Court case to your attention that's curious.
Uh,

506
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:08.020
this is Hawaii housing authority versus Midkiff decided in 1984,
uh,

507
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.550
now Hawaii is really a,
an unusual state.
And,
uh,
back in,

508
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.580
uh,
prior to this time,

509
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.790
96% of the state was owned by 72 land owners or the state or the federal

510
00:32:20.921 --> 00:32:23.140
government.
It's just think about that for a moment.

511
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.390
So 96% of the state was honed by just a handful of land owners.
Uh,

512
00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:29.980
so that 1967,

513
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.720
the Hawaii legislature approved the use of eminent domain to condemn residential

514
00:32:34.721 --> 00:32:38.410
lots and sell land to existing tenants.
Now,

515
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.500
if they're only seven 72 landowners in Hawaii,

516
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:45.590
and I don't know what the population of why I was at that time,

517
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:50.390
but let's just say for sake of argument,
that it was a,
uh,
a million people.

518
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.620
Uh,
basically that meant that,
uh,
uh,
most of those people,

519
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:58.520
the overwhelming majority of them will be forced into a tenancy relationship

520
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:02.300
with the land owner so that they would have to enter into a lease agreement.

521
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.910
But the legislature's had,
well,
you know,

522
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:07.490
we basically want to break up this oligopoly,

523
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.900
even if the land owners object,
and we should have the right to do that.

524
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.490
So they literally went in and,
uh,
uh,
appropriated the land.
Uh,

525
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:20.870
but they compensated the land owners so that these 90,
these 72,
uh,

526
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.700
land owners did receive compensation and then they sold the land back to the

527
00:33:25.701 --> 00:33:27.860
existing tenants.
So this is really a,

528
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.770
a fairly dramatic act on the part of any state government.

529
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.020
And it also raised questions about the use of eminent domain.

530
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.340
And the Supreme Court in this case found that,
uh,

531
00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:44.300
that this was a legitimate use of,
uh,
the,
the constitutional right,

532
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.253
that,
uh,
the,
the,

533
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.030
the government has to exercise eminent domain and that it's not a taking a,

534
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:54.200
that the single most important criterion to justify the use of eminent domain.

535
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:58.040
It's the nature of the public use a on a public use is created even when

536
00:33:58.041 --> 00:34:01.760
immediately turned over to private hands.
And in this case,
uh,

537
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:06.761
the public use or the key public interest was defined by the breakup of the land

538
00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:10.340
oligopoly.
Uh,
another,
uh,

539
00:34:10.341 --> 00:34:15.341
take on what public uses was decided to just several years ago,

540
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:16.490
right here in Connecticut,

541
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:21.491
about 40 miles away in new London in a case known as key low versus the city of

542
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:22.580
New London.
Uh,

543
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.080
where the supreme court found that the use of eminent domain in that case,
uh,

544
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.790
by the,
the city of New London,
uh,
because it wanted to,
to,
uh,
uh,

545
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:35.000
encourage redevelopment of an area that was in private ownership.

546
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:39.440
It decided that it would use eminent domain,
uh,

547
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.900
and then it would sell the land back to a private developer.
So that,
uh,

548
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.010
as in the Hawaii case,
uh,
either the,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,

549
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.700
the large land holding was broken up and then,
uh,
uh,
uh,
redistributed to,

550
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.840
to willing buyers.
Uh,

551
00:34:54.841 --> 00:34:59.390
in this case the developer was already known to the city of New London,

552
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.960
uh,
so that the private reits were transferred first to the city,

553
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:05.870
but then back to the private development organization.

554
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.860
And the court found that a,
if an economic project creates new jobs,

555
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:14.420
increases taxes or other city revenues and revitalizes the depressed urban area,

556
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.590
then that qualifies as a public use and it's a little bit legitimate exercise of

557
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:22.910
eminent domain and does not require compensation.

558
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.770
Uh,
now this was decried by,
uh,
uh,

559
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.670
by many who argued that,
uh,
you know,

560
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.960
the Supreme Court really had a lost its bearing.
Uh,

561
00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:36.410
and this cartoon gives you a sense of that.
And a,

562
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:38.820
this cartoon is a,

563
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:43.140
the Supreme Court sitting on its front steps with a wrecking ball sitting in

564
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:46.740
front of it.
Uh,
with a caption thanks to your ruling on eminent domain.

565
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:49.590
We can finally level this building to make way for a Chucky cheese

566
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:57.710
so that the decision about when a taking his occurred is often dependent upon

567
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.240
when a regulatory action renders property to be valueless.

568
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:08.130
So,
uh,
take you back to the Adirondacks for a moment and have you think about,
uh,

569
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.020
the way that the,
the Adirondack park was regulated.
So,
uh,
you know,

570
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:19.190
rewind back to 1972 before the park agency existed and just assume that you had

571
00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:23.460
a hundred acres of land and you had a,

572
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.960
had a intended that you are going to sell off one acre per year and that was

573
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:32.280
really going to also provide retirement for you and your family.
Uh,

574
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.450
1973,
the state legislature passes a law and lo and behold,

575
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:38.520
you are in the green area and that means that you will,

576
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.810
you require 42.3 acres for a new building.
Uh,

577
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.240
now shouldn't that constitute a taking?

578
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.450
So that a year expectation that you could sell off a hundred lots,
uh,

579
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.610
under the old zoning ordinance,
uh,
was being dashed and,
and,
uh,

580
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.990
now you could only sell off to lots,
uh,
and uh,
uh,

581
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.681
what does,

582
00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:02.090
shouldn't the government had the obligation to compensate you for that loss and

583
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.340
in right,
uh,
in that loss in value?
Well,

584
00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:10.200
the supreme court has argued across a wide diversity of cases that,
that uh,

585
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:15.420
uh,
if you are left with a property right,
that has some lingering,

586
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.200
a remnant value than a taking has not occurred.
Uh,

587
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:23.460
this was established back in 1922 in a case that's a quite interesting

588
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:27.870
Pennsylvania coal company versus Mahoen a statue that prohibited the mining of

589
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.920
coal underground in a manner that causes substance of homes on the surface.

590
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.770
I went too far and did constitute a taking.

591
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.600
So imagine if a coal company started digging under your family home.
Uh,
and,
uh,

592
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:44.070
the,
the extent of the ditch digging or the,
the,
uh,
the instability of the,
the,
uh,

593
00:37:44.071 --> 00:37:49.030
the geology caused your,
your,
your land surface to subside and cave in and,

594
00:37:49.031 --> 00:37:53.820
and,
uh,
harm your property.
Uh,
uh,
does the,
uh,
does the government,

595
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:57.780
uh,
uh,
have the,
the,
uh,
the right to prohibit a mining company from,

596
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:02.680
from digging under underground?
Well,
uh,
in this case,
uh,

597
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.460
uh,
uh,
the,
the court had argued that,
uh,
uh,
the,

598
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:12.510
the,
uh,
the Prohibition of mining,
uh,
did constitute a taking why?

599
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.990
Well,
because the underlying mineral rights became worthless.

600
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.640
All the value was taken away from the underlying mineral value.

601
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.970
Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote,
while property may be regulated to a certain extent,

602
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.450
if regulation goes too far,
it will be recognized as a taking.

603
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.820
So the key question and most of these regulatory cases is a,

604
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.130
when is it gone too far?

605
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.160
I'll give you another example from the Adirondacks from a personal experience.

606
00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.800
And there was a developer that wanted to build on a,
uh,
river,
uh,

607
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.470
area that,
uh,
was designated under the New York state,

608
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:46.600
wild scenic and recreational rivers act.

609
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.970
And this developer wanted to build a about a hundred new units,
uh,

610
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:55.510
right along the river.
The park agency came along and decided that,
uh,

611
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.440
uh,
it would damage,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
a flood plane.

612
00:38:59.441 --> 00:39:04.060
It would cause physical structures to sit in the flood plain.
The flood plain.

613
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:08.590
For those of you that don't know the term is an area that's designated by a,

614
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:11.290
a boundary that sits at the,
uh,
uh,

615
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:15.790
a location and elevation of a probable 100 year flood.
Uh,

616
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:20.860
so that the,
it's,
it's probable that,
that,
uh,
uh,
that intensity of storm will,

617
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:24.940
will not occur except once every hundred years,
by the way,
new haven and,
uh,

618
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:29.890
my home experienced almost a a hundred year storm,
uh,
just last week.

619
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.630
So all of the,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,
low line lands were,
were flooded in the area.

620
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.860
[inaudible] Connecticut River is,
is just cresting now from the storm last week.

621
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.670
Uh,
so that many people aren't aware of this a hundred year flood,
flood plain.

622
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:43.960
So that in this case,

623
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:49.450
the decision was made not to allow the development in the flood plane and,
uh,

624
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.650
basically to a permit the land to be used for different kind of a purpose.

625
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.870
In that particular instance,

626
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.110
it was a camp ground that was allowed so that the,
uh,

627
00:39:59.111 --> 00:40:02.800
the property owner went to court and claimed that his property rights in his

628
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:06.100
value had been taken by the government and that he demanded he demanded

629
00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:10.600
compensation.
Uh,
and in New York State Supreme Court found that,

630
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.750
that,
uh,
no,
uh,
it was not taken.
In fact,

631
00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:16.900
he was left with a perfectly viable economic use,
uh,

632
00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:20.260
which would be the continuance of his campground.

633
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.540
Give you a,
another example here,
uh,
from a coastal area in California,

634
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.150
Nolan versus the California coastal commission.

635
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:34.080
Nolan had a leased property in Ventura,
California.
Uh,
and he,
he,
uh,
uh,

636
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.220
uh,
at least it with the option to buy,

637
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:41.020
but it was conditioned on the replacement of a 500 square foot bungalow and it

638
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:43.690
required a permit from the agency.
I mentioned a few moments ago,

639
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:45.780
the California Coastal Commission,
uh,

640
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.000
the coastal commission found that the new house would block the ocean view

641
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:52.850
contributing to the development of a wall of residential structures,
uh,

642
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.050
that would prevent the public psychologically from realizing a stretch of

643
00:40:56.051 --> 00:41:00.190
coastline,
uh,
uh,
that exists nearby,

644
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.920
uh,
that they have every right to visit.
Uh,
so to give you some sense of,
uh,

645
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.310
uh,
this case,
here's an aerial shot looking down at,
uh,

646
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:14.320
at the Nolan Bungalow here,
and you can see that all these,
uh,
structures are,

647
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.670
are sitting,
they're actually sitting at the base of a cliff,
uh,
uh,

648
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:19.930
north of Los Angeles.

649
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.200
And like many of the California coast area that is privately owned,

650
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.340
uh,
you find these houses separated only by several feet,
uh,
these bungalows.

651
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.500
So what would be the effect of,
uh,

652
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.710
of building higher a while the California coastal commission,

653
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.850
I was concerned about the obstruction of the view from the public.
So in effect,

654
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:45.470
it was a question about psychological or visual access so that it would,
uh,

655
00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:45.950
uh,

656
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:50.270
the court found that the new house would increase private use of the shorefront

657
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.450
and would cumulatively burden the public's ability to traverse a,

658
00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.720
to traverse to and along the shore front.
So the,

659
00:41:57.721 --> 00:42:01.220
the coastal commission granted a permit requiring public,

660
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.630
a public access easement.

661
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.250
So this is kind of interesting so that the problem that they found was blocked

662
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:11.840
visual access,
but the remedy that they required was physical access.

663
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.320
Now you may not understand that in California,

664
00:42:15.321 --> 00:42:20.120
physical access to the coastal area is thought of as a,
a very important public.

665
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:25.040
Right?
Uh,
and so Nolan,
the,
the,
uh,
the person who had bought the,

666
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:29.570
the,
a option to buy,
uh,
looked at the access condition as a taking,

667
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.620
he didn't want to provide access across his property for the public.

668
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.780
He didn't want to worry about,
uh,
the public traipsing over his land,
uh,
or,
or,
uh,

669
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.680
concerns about security.
And if the Supreme Court listen to the case,

670
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:45.650
and it said that if California wants an easement across Nolan's property,

671
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:49.550
it must pay for it.
Yeah,
this constituted a taking without compensation.

672
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.050
And this is,
uh,
uh,

673
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:55.430
the definition of what's come to be known as the nexus argument.
So that the,
the,

674
00:42:55.431 --> 00:42:58.340
the,
uh,
projected damage in this case,

675
00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:03.341
the lack of visual access from a higher building was being remedied by a,

676
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:08.450
an easement,
a demand on the part of the,
of the state to provide public access.

677
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.430
So the court looked at that and said,
you know,

678
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:13.500
there's no real connection between the remedy and,
uh,
the,

679
00:43:13.501 --> 00:43:18.380
the hypothetical damage.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
in cases where,
where,

680
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:22.180
uh,
uh,
there is a damage that is being claimed by a private land owner,

681
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.270
this would demand that any successful attempt to,
to,
uh,

682
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:30.740
seek compensation,
uh,
uh,
look to this,

683
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.040
uh,
the,
the quality and the strength of,
of the nexus argument.

684
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.850
I'm going to leave you with one final case here.
And this is the case of Florida.

685
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:42.700
And given my earlier comments about climate change and the vulnerability of,

686
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.940
of a coastal environments,

687
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.470
I can think of almost no other state in the union that has more property value

688
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:52.460
that is liable,
uh,
or excuse me,
that is susceptible to loss.

689
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:56.450
And then the state of Florida and the state of Florida has a,

690
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.870
a very active beach renourishment program.

691
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.620
So in the face of storms and the hurricane damage,
you know,

692
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:08.300
one of the responses is,
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,
I'm going to scoot ahead here.

693
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:13.070
One of the responses is to a park barges offshore and pump sand from offshore

694
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.030
areas,
uh,
onto the beach.
Uh,
for those of you that are interested in geology,

695
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:21.560
there's a kind of a very interesting science about the grain size.
And,
and they,

696
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.430
they test very carefully the green size of the sands offshore.
Uh,

697
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.470
and they know that some of the larger grains are more stable than the,

698
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.790
than the smaller Greens,
uh,
so that they will be less prone to erosion.

699
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.420
So the teams just think about what you're looking at here.

700
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.880
This is sitting on a barrier island.

701
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.810
It's a strip of land that literally is now no more than a quarter of mile,
uh,

702
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.020
and width.
Uh,
and behind it lies a bay.
Uh,

703
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:50.250
this is typical of barrier islands in the United States.
And in this case,

704
00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:55.251
you probably have hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate value value

705
00:44:55.501 --> 00:44:59.370
that is highly vulnerable.
So that a,
you know,
in the face of sea level rise,

706
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:04.320
we're going to be basically looking at coastal areas as those in,

707
00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.600
in the Netherlands have.
Uh,
in other words,
thinking about how to,
uh,

708
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.630
to keep the coast a safe,
how to push back the water,
how to reflect the,

709
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:15.180
the wave energy by building dikes or sea walls,

710
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.760
or in this case beach nourishment.
There's another example of buildings,
uh,

711
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:22.250
almost,
uh,
almost sitting in the water,
uh,

712
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.650
and the erosion that is occurring following storms.
So,

713
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.730
and here's another example of what the state of,
of,

714
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.680
of a Florida is doing to,
to build up that,
uh,
that beach front.
So,

715
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.030
uh,
just,
uh,
a quick version here,
uh,
in,
uh,

716
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:42.660
Walton County,
uh,
the Florida wanted to renourish.
Uh,
the,

717
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.360
the shorefront was sand,
uh,

718
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.780
under the provisions of the Florida is beach and shore preservation act that was

719
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:49.710
recently adopted.

720
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.500
It fixed boundary between the publicly owned land and privately,

721
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.130
privately owned land.
So that,
you know,

722
00:45:56.131 --> 00:46:00.300
imagine that this is your house and imagine that you have a thin strip of sand

723
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:02.250
between your house and in the ocean,

724
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:07.170
which is a this open area in front of the stage here.
And then imagine that,

725
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:10.620
uh,
the state lost and you think of yourself as being a,
uh,

726
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.930
shorefront owner and a,

727
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:17.931
that a republic has no right of access across your area because the mean high

728
00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:22.560
water mark,
uh,
sits down a ways from where you are now.

729
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:26.010
Supposing that the state comes through and decides they want to nourish the

730
00:46:26.011 --> 00:46:26.580
beach,

731
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:31.020
we're going to build up that area so that the state literally set a boundary

732
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:36.021
between the private land in the public land and the sh the property owners of

733
00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:39.750
private property owners argue that that was a taking that was a taking of their

734
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:43.940
property,
right.
Uh,
to,
uh,
own shorefront.
Uh,

735
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.700
because now there was private land up to the edge of the stage.
Uh,

736
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:51.660
and then beyond that where the,
the,
uh,
uh,
stand had been deposited,

737
00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:56.640
that was a strip of public land that was open for public access so that these

738
00:46:56.641 --> 00:47:00.210
land owners wanted to a exclusive right to control that area.

739
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.430
Well,
the,
uh,

740
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.940
they alleged that the Florida Supreme Court violated the due process and takings

741
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.970
causes,
uh,

742
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:11.010
by suddenly and unpredictably changing state substantive law to deprive these

743
00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:13.740
owners of their private property without compensation.

744
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.820
And the Florida Supreme Court rule that beach front property owners had no right

745
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:22.260
to their property to continue contact with water nor any vested right a future

746
00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:24.810
beach accretion.
So the court,
uh,

747
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:29.320
argued that basically they didn't know what was going to happen in that area

748
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:34.240
that was,
uh,
uh,
at or that is now open water,
uh,

749
00:47:34.241 --> 00:47:35.074
that,
uh,

750
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.870
the private landowner doesn't have any right of expectation that,
that the,
that,

751
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:44.440
uh,
their land would just simply extend all the way down to the mean high water

752
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:44.710
mark.

753
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:49.710
You have to state kept dumping sand in front of it so that this has become a

754
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.190
very popular case that's pending before the supreme court now.

755
00:47:54.191 --> 00:47:56.660
And it may be decided in the next week or so.
Uh,

756
00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.840
so it stopped the beach nourishment a versus the county and a coalition of 26

757
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:06.910
states have,
uh,
supported,
uh,
Amoco Amoco briefs,
uh,

758
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.880
including the Obama administration.
So that,
uh,

759
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:11.740
during the argument in front of the Supreme Court,

760
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:15.040
it was interesting because the solicitor general that represents the United

761
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.020
States government in the Supreme Court,
uh,

762
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:21.890
made a case in favor of the states' rights to a,
to a renourish.

763
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.770
The lands,
uh,
every state in the,
in the country that has coastal property,

764
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:28.090
uh,

765
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:32.380
has an interest in this because they do not want to have to compensate private

766
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.640
owners,
uh,
for any activity that they take to try to,

767
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.770
to prevent additional property damage.
Uh,

768
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:41.560
I'm going to zoom ahead here and then we'll conclude and just a minute.

769
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.970
But remember also that pesticide regulation raises the questions of property

770
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.810
rights and takings because the government's required in the case where we're,

771
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:53.950
the government bans a chemical that is already licensed,
uh,

772
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:57.970
it's required to purchase existing stocks of newly band products,
uh,

773
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.330
so that even though they find that a chemical is,

774
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:03.700
is more dangerous than they thought,
and they had previously licensed it,

775
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:07.390
if they've got new evidence of risk and they take away the right to market that

776
00:49:07.391 --> 00:49:12.340
product,
the chemical companies can successfully argue and have argued that that

777
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:15.640
constitutes or taking a takings that a is compensable.

778
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:20.170
So there are 23,000 of these registrations out there.
Uh,

779
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:25.060
I'm going to conclude with a,
uh,
one,
one final thought.

780
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.380
Uh,
and that is that,
that,
uh,
among all these strategies,
uh,

781
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:33.910
that might be applied to protect a public resources and,
and,
uh,

782
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.740
uh,
also,
uh,
to protect,
uh,
uh,
uh,
private,
uh,

783
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:44.340
PR protect against private damage,
uh,
to the environment.
Uh,
the,

784
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.630
the use of regulation is an extremely important,
uh,
uh,

785
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.600
opportunity for state and local governments so that,
uh,
uh,

786
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:55.780
if you apply a strict standard,
uh,
against takings,
in other words,
if you,

787
00:49:55.781 --> 00:49:58.100
if you demand that,
uh,
uh,

788
00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.810
taking of all property value be required prior to the,
uh,
uh,

789
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:07.630
uh,
prior to the grant of compensation that offers the greatest opportunity for

790
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:11.590
governments to be effective in pursuing an environmental agenda's.

791
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.400
So we'll come back and talk a bit more,
uh,
at the end of the week about,
uh,

792
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:16.750
several alternative strategies,

793
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:21.250
particularly marketing of ecosystem service payments.

794
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:22.540
Thank you.
