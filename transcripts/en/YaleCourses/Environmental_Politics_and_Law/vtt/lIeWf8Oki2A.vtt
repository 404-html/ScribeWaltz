WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.640
All right.
Today I want to talk about,
uh,

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:06.840
what I think of is one of the most significant failures of environmental law in

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.580
the 20th century.
Uh,

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:12.600
and this is the way that we manage toxic substances.
Uh,

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.810
but this is a story that is more about,
uh,
uh,

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.800
not just the individual chemicals,
but also,
uh,

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.300
the products that are created when chemicals are merged together.
They're,

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.110
they're synthesized.
So what is the plastics problem?

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.230
In part,
it's the enormity of the industry.
Uh,

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.120
about 119 billion pounds now produced each year in the United States.

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.430
This is a roughly about a $400 billion industry.
And I mentioned earlier that,

12
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:45.330
just to give you a point of comparison,
uh,
to the pesticide industry,

13
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.800
the pesticide industry produces about 10 billion pounds.
Uh,

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.840
so it's about 10 times smaller than the plastics industry.
And,
uh,
the,

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.471
the,
uh,

16
00:00:55.471 --> 00:01:00.360
annual sales from pesticides are about 10 to $12 billion per year in the,

17
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:05.010
in the nation.
So compared to the attention that a pesticides have been given,

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.060
uh,
over the past 30 to 40 years,
uh,

19
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.880
the plastics problem has been just about fully neglected by Congress,

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
although it did pass the toxic substance control act back in 1976.

21
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.270
And this law was intended to encourage premarket testing of chemicals.

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.200
And what we'll see today,
he said the majority of chemicals,
uh,

23
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:29.750
remain untested,
uh,
that the ingredients are unlabeled.
Uh,

24
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.930
the country of origin is unknown for and for most products,

25
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.550
the recovery rate is exceptionally low.
Uh,

26
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.570
and recycling failure occurs for many reasons.
Uh,
but,

27
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:45.930
uh,
uh,
and we'll look,
we'll explore several of those later in,
in the,
uh,

28
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.670
in the session.
Uh,
environmental contamination at a global scale,
uh,
has occurred.

29
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.950
There are plastic particles,

30
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.190
molecules in ambient air outside and indoors,
uh,

31
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.890
plastics who contaminated underground aquifers as well as surface waters.

32
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.170
In many parts of the industrialized world,

33
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.250
there's been universal human exposure that exposure is chronic.

34
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.960
You get it on a daily basis.
And,
uh,

35
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.350
the health effects that we now are beginning to understand a have to do

36
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.820
predominantly,
uh,
with endocrine disrupting compounds,

37
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.980
chemicals that are mimicking human hormones.
Uh,

38
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.390
we rely unfortunately for the most part on animal studies to,
uh,

39
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.490
give us some insight into what the effects on humans are likely to be.
Uh,

40
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.380
but we rely on that evidence for many other classes of compounds as well.

41
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.350
So this,
this area has received,
uh,

42
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.610
virtually no attention from the environmental protection agency.

43
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.130
And I want to talk a little bit today about why that is.

44
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.260
So 850,000 people employed in this industry,

45
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.483
uh,

46
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.080
at number three 79 is now up above $400 billion per year.

47
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.740
Uh,

48
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.550
and plastics comprise 70% of the synthetic chemical industry in the nation,

49
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.620
including 500 different resins.

50
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.580
Plastics labeling is confusing to many people.
You may not,
uh,
uh,

51
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.380
look on the bottom of,
of,
uh,
uh,
a milk carton or you may not look a on the,

52
00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:21.130
on the back of a,
uh,
many different products to look at the recycling code.

53
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.640
The recycling code in the United States is completely voluntary.

54
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.840
There is no legal obligation to post or the chemical content,

55
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:29.980
the origin of the plastics,

56
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.150
or what should be done with it once the product is discarded.

57
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.000
So give you an example here.

58
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.100
Polyethylene hat has the symbol number one.
So I,

59
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.110
bottled drinks such as a Pepsi and Coca Cola are packaged in pet.

60
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.510
Sometimes it's called Pete a polyethylene.
Uh,

61
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.240
there's a high density version of that,
which is number two,

62
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.240
and there's a low density version of that,
which is number four.

63
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.330
So carrier bags and a bin liners for example,

64
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.820
as opposed are the low density polyethylene as opposed to say,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

65
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.730
uh,
gallon milk jugs,
which are the high density polyethylene.
Uh,

66
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.610
the polyethylenes are the most likely to be recycled among all plastics

67
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.680
polyvinyl chloride,
uh,
by comparison,
PVC for short,

68
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.180
uh,
[inaudible] is contained in many different products,
uh,
water pipes.

69
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:24.940
And I'll show you some examples of that in a few moments.
Uh,

70
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.670
it's almost never a recycled,

71
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.320
which means that it's either buried or it's burned.
Once it,
uh,
uh,

72
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.130
is finally discarded polypropylene.
Uh,
you may,

73
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.820
you may find polypropylene in,
in,
uh,
rugs.

74
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.620
He can find it also in a margarine tubs,
different kinds of food packaging,
uh,

75
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:49.600
products.
Uh,
but also in a,
the microwavable meal trail,
meal trays,

76
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.900
polystyrene,
most people don't understand what styrene is.
You,

77
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:56.420
you are all familiar with styrene balls.
Uh,
but,
uh,

78
00:04:56.421 --> 00:05:01.070
it's also an absorbent material that's put at the base of,
of meats,
uh,

79
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.300
in packaging.
And a,
I mentioned to you that uh,
uh,

80
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:09.190
the packaging problem is especially related to food is incredibly complex.

81
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.180
There's no way for you to know what chemicals are in the packaging materials

82
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:16.290
that you buy in the grocery store.
Uh,

83
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.550
seven is reserved for other kind of plastic resins so that they,

84
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:25.060
the only those that do not fall into the other categories are given the number

85
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:27.670
seven and we'll,
we'll concentrate on one of those today,

86
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:32.620
which is called [inaudible].
Is,
is what's used to form polycarbonate plastic.

87
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.240
It's very dense,
very hard.
And often it's in clear form.
It can be colored.

88
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.470
So Nalgene bottles are a good example of a number seven,
uh,
uh,

89
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.110
the polycarbonates.
And,
uh,
also you might think of the,
uh,
the head lamps on,

90
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.790
on a car or a motorcycle helmet or advisor.

91
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.300
These are all examples of,
of polystyrene,
or excuse me,

92
00:05:55.301 --> 00:06:00.301
polycarbonate here is a chart that lists the recycling rate in yellow for all

93
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.590
the different classifications.
And you basically see pbcs,
uh,

94
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.980
are at the bottom of the list.

95
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.660
So PVCs are not recycled because the chemical content is so complicated.

96
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.950
Uh,
the highest degree of recycling occurs with a polyethylenes.

97
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.140
So the Pete bottles,
uh,
have a,
uh,
roughly,
uh,

98
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.390
20 to 25% recycling rate on average in the United States.

99
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.510
And this is highly variable by,
by a region and the nation.

100
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.050
And also by my time of the year,
uh,

101
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.980
the polypropylene is almost never a recycled,

102
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.760
nor is polystyrene poly carbon.

103
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:42.620
That's the hard plastic composite,
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

104
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.600
exist.
For example,
in my,
my glasses.
Uh,

105
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.980
these are also almost never recycled.
So what happens to them?

106
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.240
I'm gonna take you on a quick cook's tour of plastic in your life and you'll

107
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:55.700
remember that I challenged you to think,

108
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.880
to try to find out if you could avoid purchasing plastics for a week.

109
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.590
And if you are able to do that,

110
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:04.850
I challenged you to avoid using plastics for week.
And I believe that,
that,
that,

111
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.830
uh,
today is a virtual impossibility.

112
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.080
So I started to do a little inventory in my own life,
uh,
and uh,

113
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.860
actually got quite disturbed at myself and my own ignorance and a what I had

114
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:18.960
exposed my family to.
Uh,
and I,

115
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.110
I became extremely interested in trying to,
to,
uh,

116
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.050
kind of reconstruct a why I was so clueless about,

117
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:29.650
uh,
uh,
the thousands of different products that,
uh,

118
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.290
had made their way into into my life and into my family's life.

119
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.520
A contact lenses are a good example on their hard contact lenses and they're

120
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.920
soft contact lenses.
The hard lenses could,

121
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.530
could contain a Biz Faena lay as polycarbonate,

122
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.120
the software contact lenses that will change their shape,
uh,

123
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.900
with your eye or as a rotate,
uh,
across a,
uh,

124
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:52.850
a surface that is not completely even,
uh,
those,

125
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.800
those contact lenses normally contained Falaise.

126
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.720
Phthalates are softeners.
So bis fee and La is the hardener,
uh,

127
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.910
validates or softeners.

128
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:07.510
And these valleys are a particular problem with respect to a one which is

129
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.520
called,
uh,
uh,
die.
FFL Eight.

130
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.520
Dehp that I'll talk about a little bit a little bit later.

131
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.930
My daughter wears a retainer,
a,
she's 10 years old.
My youngest daughter,

132
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.000
and I don't know what's in that,

133
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:24.020
but I would imagine that it's predominantly polycarbonate.
Uh,
she wears it,
uh,

134
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.640
about 12 to 15 hours per day.
Uh,
and also,
uh,

135
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.240
most people have dental sealants.
Dental sealants are pretty interesting,

136
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.321
so that a,

137
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:38.090
you can test people's saliva after the dental sealants are put in and you can

138
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:42.040
find,
uh,
the Biz fenal a,
uh,
in the saliva.
Uh,

139
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.580
also there's a protective characteristic of these sealants.

140
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.720
They prevent you from getting cavities,
uh,

141
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.880
that would demand putting a different kind of plastic into your tooth or a metal

142
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:57.480
amalgam.
And many people in my generation,
my parents' generation,

143
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.460
uh,
have,
uh,
uh,
fillings in their mouth,
uh,
that include metal amalgams,

144
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.040
uh,
including compounds such as mercury.

145
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.980
So it's a very interesting kind of a trade off.
One might make

146
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.140
you think about a different,
uh,
uh,
other sources of plastic in your life.

147
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.710
Most of you are probably familiar with that smell of the vinyl shower curtain

148
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:18.360
when you first opened the package.

149
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:21.330
And for a couple of days it's offgassing in your bathroom.

150
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.700
Different kinds of clothing,
uh,
raincoats fabrics,
a Gortex for example,

151
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:30.120
are made out of of a different plastic,
uh,
uh,
resins.

152
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.630
And these also are generally non-recyclable.
Uh,

153
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.460
and I want you to think about the built environment.
When a house is built,
uh,

154
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.810
in the northeastern part of the U S it's generally framed out of wood.
Uh,

155
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.110
you see the plywood there,

156
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:47.120
that's being tacked onto these two by fours or two by sixes.
Uh,

157
00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:49.790
and then you see the,
the plastic sheeting that,
uh,

158
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.570
is being attached a made by dupont called TYVEC.
A TYVEC is,
uh,

159
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.540
is a,
uh,
an interesting,
uh,
uh,
product and that it,

160
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.540
it seals the house from mold.

161
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.260
And that also has a protective effect in that molds are known to,

162
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.040
to threaten human health and,
and a induced asthma or,
or exacerbated,
uh,

163
00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.610
as one example.
Uh,

164
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.510
but this product also is extremely rarely a recycle a tyvec.

165
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:19.570
Also,
you can find in a variety of different settings.
Uh,
here's,
uh,
uh,

166
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.290
Tyvec a disposable coverall,
uh,

167
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:26.640
that is claimed by the corporation to protect against more than 150,

168
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.840
a hazardous chemicals.
So for those people that work with hazardous chemicals,
uh,

169
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:33.040
here's a product that helps to protect them.
Uh,

170
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.390
the idea of it being just stoked disposable caught my attention.

171
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:39.180
It's advertised as being disposable.
Certainly,
uh,
you know,

172
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.380
most things are disposable,

173
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.860
but that doesn't give you any clue about where they might end up eventually in

174
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:48.450
the environment.
In this case,
uh,
this will not break down for,
uh,

175
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.500
probably,
uh,
uh,
hundreds,
if not thousands of years.
Now think about a house.

176
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.760
This House has plastic,
uh,
in many different areas.

177
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.130
It's got the vinyl siding on it.
It has pillars.
You can see,
uh,
uh,

178
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.120
pillars here in the front and over on the side.

179
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.930
You might think those pillars are formed out of wood or perhaps a that they're

180
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:10.950
ceramic,
but,
uh,
they're generally plastic.
Uh,
you see the light post,

181
00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:14.850
that's plastic as well.
Uh,
you see the,
the railing on top of the,

182
00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:17.880
the front porch,
uh,
near the front door here.

183
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.340
This is also a,
probably a,
a polyvinyl chloride plastic.
Also,

184
00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:28.020
the doors are commonly plastic.
Uh,
the windows,
the window frames are plastic.
And,

185
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:32.190
uh,
how do they seel when your door shuts?
Uh,
it doesn't,
uh,
uh,

186
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.160
shut with a hard plastic meeting,
hard plastic.

187
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.230
It's kind of separate alliance that lies the next to the door,
uh,

188
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.510
that will absorb the shock and also it will prevent a heat from escaping.

189
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.270
So generally with a a window,
you'll have several different kinds of plastic.
Uh,

190
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.860
the same with,
with doors.
Uh,

191
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.610
the vent that you see on the up here on the near the peak of the roof,
uh,

192
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.330
also would be plastic.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
the exterior surfaces of this,
uh,

193
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:01.570
this structure,
uh,
are predominantly made out of plastic.

194
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.750
Many paints also contain plastics,
uh,
within them.

195
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.390
I think also about,
uh,
uh,
court or wire.

196
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.460
A wire is generally coated with vinyl polyvinyl chloride.
And,

197
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:18.020
uh,
just as an as an example,
uh,

198
00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:21.880
there are in a new building like a coon hall where I've gotten my office,

199
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.120
there are probably hundreds of miles of electrical conduit,

200
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.650
uh,
that circulate through that single building.

201
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.720
And then think about power lines and the,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

202
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.720
cheating that exists on the power lines.
Uh,

203
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.410
well how many miles of power line do you think there are in the United States?

204
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.560
Well,
one thing you could do is you could just calculate a on,

205
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.420
on a Google type in a number of miles of roads in the United States,

206
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.260
because most roads,
uh,
are also corridors for power lines.

207
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.270
So I would estimate that we probably have hundreds of billions of miles,

208
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.930
uh,
of electrical cable,
a that cheated in polyvinyl chloride,

209
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.550
all of which is not recyclable.
Interestingly,
uh,
the value of,

210
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:11.140
of copper inside the wire is high enough to encourage it's recycling,

211
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.720
but the value of the PVC is,
is negligible.

212
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.430
And I'd also like you to think about your own water supply.

213
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.980
I think about where you grew up.
Uh,
do you,

214
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.710
do you know where your water came from?
Do you know how it was piped to,
to,

215
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.410
to your,
your faucets?
Well,

216
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:30.610
here's an example of a water supply being fed by copper pipes at the top,

217
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.990
and then there's a district distribution network throughout the house.

218
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.250
I know going to say they're the refrigerator or going to the kitchen sink,

219
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.880
going to toilets in different parts of the house.
Uh,
well this also,
uh,

220
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.240
is made out of plastic.
Uh,
and you know,
one would think that,
uh,
uh,

221
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.110
somebody would have demanded that these chemicals be tested to know,

222
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.260
to understand whether or not they would Leech,
uh,
out of the,
uh,
out of the,

223
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.390
of the lines.
And in many cases,
particularly with newer houses,

224
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:02.740
you'll have a filtration system and you may have seen these cartridge filtration

225
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:06.100
systems.
They look like canisters or they come in various sizes.

226
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.820
I've got one in my house that's a sediment filter as as one example,

227
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.690
and it was a,
it was put in before I understood this whole plastics issue.

228
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.800
And I also can tell you that it's almost impossible to find a water filter

229
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:21.550
that's not made out of plastic.
So within this plastic canister,

230
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:23.500
it's got a top that screws on.
Uh,

231
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:27.970
so to change the filtration that you take the filler material out and then you

232
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:32.971
put a new one in a after a certain number of months so that most water filters,

233
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.470
uh,
also are plastic.
Uh,
also nobody asked the question,
well,

234
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.290
what's leeching out of the,
out of the filters into the waterline?

235
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.800
And I'd like you to think about the vehicle environment and that's kind of

236
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:45.730
interesting.
You know,

237
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:50.050
I use the phrase that that people are spending in the United States about 90% of

238
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:52.190
their time indoors.
Uh,
well it's,

239
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.130
it's about 87% of their time indoors.

240
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:59.230
And it's about three to 4% of their time within vehicles.
Uh,

241
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.080
and think about the interior cabins of on the upper left here.
Uh,

242
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.530
uh,
a new vehicle,
a so that this probably has a,

243
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.030
maybe a couple of dozen different polymers in it,
uh,

244
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.280
ranging from the TV screen and all of its components down through the plastic

245
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:19.440
steering wheel,
the plastic plastic dashboard,
uh,

246
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.200
the plastic console between the seats,
uh,

247
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.260
different kinds of plastics in the seat itself,

248
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:29.170
including the polyurethane foam inside the seat,
uh,
almost,
uh,

249
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.280
none of which are recyclable.
So eventually,
uh,

250
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.110
most of these parts that are made out of plastic or simply going to be burned,

251
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.680
uh,

252
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.540
which gives off a quite a bit of an energy in an incinerator because of a high

253
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:43.130
carbon content in the plastic.

254
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.580
So remember that most of these plastics are derived from what,
uh,
their,

255
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.950
their petroleum based,
uh,
so that it's very important to,
uh,
to recall that,

256
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.930
that,
uh,
uh,
fossil fuels,
the,
uh,
uh,
oil,
uh,
is being,

257
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.890
uh,
or is the predominant source of,
of plastics,

258
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.220
the interior of a subway or in this case,

259
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:07.800
an Amtrak train on the upper right also is predominantly plastic,
uh,

260
00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:11.940
as is the interior of an airline cabin.
Uh,

261
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.610
and this is all for,
uh,

262
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:17.990
an interesting and really important purpose and that is to lighten the weight of

263
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:22.370
the vehicle.
So 30 years ago,
vehicles were much heavier than they are today.

264
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.040
So an average vehicle today might be 2,500 pounds.
Uh,
but,

265
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:32.450
uh,
an average vehicle,
uh,
perhaps,
uh,
40 years ago,
uh,
was,

266
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.140
uh,
perhaps a three or 400 pounds.
More than that.
Indeed,

267
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.590
there are about 300 pounds of plastic and every new vehicle,

268
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.850
and it's a pretty much guaranteed that that material would not be recycled.

269
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.370
Also,
I'd like you to think about a coatings,
a whole idea of coding things.

270
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.120
I've realized that really late in my,
uh,

271
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.810
in my career that I hadn't,
I hadn't paid any attention to coatings.

272
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.480
But if you think about the number of buildings,
uh,
that are,

273
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.960
that exist in the world,
the number of buildings in the United States,
uh,

274
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.280
I think like a,
say Sherman Williams,
the paint industry.
You know what?

275
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:10.760
There a phrase is,
you know what their corporate motto is?
Uh,

276
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.520
the corporate motto was covered the earth.
And you see this red paint a,

277
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.940
their symbol as red paint that is flowing down across a,
the top of a globe.

278
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.660
Uh,
well think about the surface area.
A simply have this room.

279
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.440
Think about the surface area in your house.
Uh,
the flooring,
uh,
think about,
uh,

280
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.470
the walls.
Think about the ceiling.

281
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.550
And if you're an executive for a paint company,
you're thinking,
oh my gosh,

282
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.020
we have such a huge market.

283
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.250
Everybody is going to want to paint something a different color.
Uh,
and,
uh,

284
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.760
should we make the paints,
uh,

285
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.400
to be a more stable or not quite as stable so that they will,
uh,
uh,

286
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.120
want to repaint after a certain number of years.
So just as another example,

287
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.680
I've done this myself.
I've refinished floors,
which is a pretty nasty business.

288
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:58.830
You don't want to just spend much of your life a refinishing a floor,

289
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.560
especially if you are addressed,

290
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:06.060
such as this gentleman is a with no respirator on because he's breathing in a

291
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.050
pretty nasty mixture of dust that include of course the wood flooring,

292
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.510
but it also includes a plastic,
uh,

293
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.970
the polyurethanes that are put down on the floor.

294
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.070
You can see them right here up on the podium.

295
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.190
You can see the shiny coating on top of the desk and you can see it also on the,

296
00:18:22.191 --> 00:18:22.750
uh,
uh,

297
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.330
the desks on the side of your chairs so that the number of surface coatings in

298
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:32.160
the world is enormous in Area A and we don't really think about,
uh,
the,
the,

299
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:33.840
the long term consequences of that.

300
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.530
What would happen if we didn't code the surfaces?
What,

301
00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:41.920
what happened to the floor?
I mean,
could you wash it?
Uh,
could you,
uh,
uh,

302
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.030
not put a coating like a polyurethane or a varnish on walls like this?

303
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:52.080
I mean,
would it,
uh,
with a decay or break down more quickly?
And the answer is no.

304
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.090
A,
and I've been wondering about that and I've been wondering about are,
uh,

305
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.310
the origin of our aesthetic of,
of smoothness.

306
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.720
We love smooth things.
You know,
whether or not it's skin,
uh,

307
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:05.580
whether or not it's a surface,

308
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.600
if something is rough and harsh and it has a negative attitude toward it.

309
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.710
So if you're in the business of making these coatings,
you,
you play on that also,

310
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:17.160
if you're in the business of selling cosmetics,
but you also play on that.

311
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.250
What about other sources?
I've mentioned a fragrances in the past.
Uh,

312
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.710
these two contained plasticizers,
a diet for Alfalfa.

313
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.620
It has been found in a number of,
of,
uh,
common perfumes as well as,
uh,
uh,

314
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.680
in some air fresheners and also think about other kinds of products in your
life.

315
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.720
Now,
why is a diaper absorbent?
Uh,
why is a personal hygiene product absorbent?

316
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.231
Well,

317
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:43.980
this diaper has probably a two or three different kinds of plastic within it.

318
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.680
And what's going to happen to this?
We'll certainly,

319
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:51.000
it's not going to be recycled.
Uh,
it's likely to be burned or,
or,
or buried.

320
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.650
I think about where you sleep.
Uh,
what is your mattress made out of?

321
00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.790
Anybody here know exactly what your mattress is made out of.
Now,

322
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.960
it's a very difficult thing to discover.
Again,

323
00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:08.730
there's no requirement to label the content of your mattress or your pillow.

324
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.170
You get a,
a,

325
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:15.170
a broad description of it and like a polyester filled a polyurethane foam.

326
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.010
But you really don't,
you really don't know what the,
the,
uh,

327
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.230
environmental fate of these compounds might be.

328
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.010
So what I'm doing is I'm painting a picture for you here that we're all as,

329
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.600
as innocent.
You're all as innocent as I am.
And thinking that,
well,

330
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:33.360
somebody must've been paying attention to this.
Uh,
nobody would,

331
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:37.360
would really want us to be,
uh,
uh,
lying with our noses,
uh,

332
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.190
within a half an inch of a surface where we had no understanding of what the

333
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:44.010
chemical content is.
Think about toys,

334
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.590
90% of the toys produced in the world.
Now,
you know,

335
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:49.840
between 80% and 90% are produced in China,

336
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.220
and increasingly they're made out of plastic.
Uh,
you know,

337
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.470
consider yourself to be the executive of a Mcdonald's a and you're thinking

338
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:03.280
about the introduction of a new meal,
a new supersize meal,

339
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:08.830
or maybe an environmentally responsible downsize meal.
What are you going to do?

340
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.050
Well,
one of the first things you're going to do is you're going to try to,

341
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.000
to contract out with a toy manufacturer to try to figure out what the next toy

342
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:19.390
is going to be that you're going to give for free.
Uh,
so all the children,

343
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:23.080
when they come to Mcdonald's,
I will sit in and play with a toy while they,
they,

344
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:27.480
uh,
eat their hamburger.
Well,
what happens to those toys?
Uh,

345
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.130
the overwhelming majority of them get discarded within a week of,

346
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.320
of when they're,
when they're issued a,
and these also are not recycled.

347
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.540
Think about your own entertainment,
uh,
what you purchase.
And by the way,

348
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:44.350
all of these toys are wrapped in plastic,
uh,
of different forms.

349
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.560
And to think about the polycarbonate CD disk,
uh,
that,
uh,
the,

350
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.730
the number of CD disks that you have lying around your house or your apartment

351
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:55.780
or your dorm room,
and think about how you,
how you,
uh,
uh,
bought it.
Well,

352
00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:56.614
it came in,
uh,

353
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.230
a cover that looks something like this and it probably was also wrapped in some,

354
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.260
uh,
other additional kind of a vinyl coating,
plastic coating on the outside.

355
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.150
Uh,
that makes it actually difficult to,

356
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.700
to get the discount at least within the store in a,
in an unobtrusive manner.

357
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.540
So,
you know,
think,
think about your iPhone.
So think about your iPods,

358
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:19.870
think about your computers.
Uh,
think about your electronic world.

359
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.730
I want to talk a little bit more about food because food is,
it turns out,
uh,

360
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.760
is now believed to be the predominant source of chemical components in plastic

361
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.340
that are now measurable and human,
a human tissues.

362
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.920
And I'd like you to think also about the way that we store food,
uh,

363
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:42.010
the way that we buy food,
uh,
the way that it's processed and how it's,
uh,

364
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.930
how it's packaged and sold.

365
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:49.170
And it's done in very specific ways to promote its freshness and to avoid a food

366
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.820
borne illnesses.
Uh,
and this is very important,

367
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:57.490
but we haven't been thinking ecologically about how to manage this problem,

368
00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:02.740
uh,
because,
uh,
really,
uh,
no one has designed these products so that,
uh,

369
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.750
uh,
the end of the life fate is,
is,
uh,
uh,
being considered,

370
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.790
uh,
indeed that no,

371
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.850
no producer really has a responsibility for a disposal or the ultimate fate of

372
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:20.290
the product.
I think also about your electronic world with respect to computers.

373
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.780
I became fascinated when I read that,
uh,
a printer I was using,
uh,
uh,

374
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.360
had ink in it.
Uh,
and the ink,
I mean,
obviously the printer is,

375
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:32.760
is a foreign predominantly out of plastic or different kinds of plastics,
uh,

376
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.900
including the electronics board.
Uh,
but I didn't know that,
uh,

377
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:41.680
the ink itself could have plastic in it.
Why would ink have plastic in it?
Well,

378
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:45.010
it turns out that the plastic and Biz Faena lay has an effect on paper,

379
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.160
that it prevents the ink from spreading into the fibers of the paper once it's

380
00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:54.050
applied.
This is apparently a more common with,

381
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.770
uh,
uh,
the inkjet printers or the,
uh,
the,
uh,

382
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.130
heat driven printers that you get as a credit card receipt.

383
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.730
I think also about,
uh,
uh,
bisque Faena lay and polycarbonates and a,

384
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.260
the next generation of,
uh,
water bottles and containers.

385
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:17.090
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,
many people have recognized now,
uh,

386
00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:22.030
that when infants are fed formula,
uh,
it's very common for a,
uh,

387
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.930
a mom or a dad or whoever to fill up a bottle,
a plastic bottle,

388
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.450
uh,
either with hot water or to put it in the microwave.

389
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.100
So that the idea that a heating,
uh,
of,
of these,
uh,
uh,

390
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.010
products could energize the molecules and,
and cause some of them to,
uh,

391
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.970
migrate into the,
the,
the food or the liquid itself.
Uh,
this,

392
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.930
this was not tested.

393
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:49.430
It was not required to be tested in a sufficient way by the food and Drug

394
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.850
Administration.

395
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.820
Although the food and Drug Administration has the legal authority to do so.

396
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.101
And so what,

397
00:24:54.101 --> 00:24:57.470
what I'm doing is painting a picture here that the environmental protection

398
00:24:57.471 --> 00:25:01.400
agency has the responsibility to implement the toxic substance control act.

399
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.890
They have not required prior testing.

400
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.860
They have not demanded that to hazardous components.
Uh,

401
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.530
those chemicals that are found to adversely affect the health of other species

402
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:14.270
that they be eliminated from the product.

403
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.000
And there's no labeling involved either in the,
uh,

404
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.800
uh,
uh,
uh,

405
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.220
country of origin or in the chemical composition of the product.

406
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:29.780
So there's absolutely no way that the consumer has to discriminate between safe

407
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.070
and unsafe or environmentally responsible products.

408
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.270
Also,
I want you to think a little bit more about,
uh,
what we drink from.
And uh,

409
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.200
many of these containers,
uh,
have some,
uh,
fibers,
uh,

410
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.960
plant material in them,
but they are often coated with plastic as well.

411
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.570
This is a typical grocery store,
uh,
on the next time you walk into a supermarket,

412
00:25:53.571 --> 00:25:56.690
I hope you walk down the isles and I want you to just pay,

413
00:25:56.691 --> 00:26:00.980
pay to pay special attention and look particularly for products that are not

414
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:04.640
wrapped in plastic or they're not stored in plastic environments.

415
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.100
And the same thing goes with respect to coke.
I gave a lecture similar to,

416
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:13.910
to this,
uh,
several months ago,
and that was,
I was struck,

417
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.540
a gentleman came up,
uh,
after the lecture,
he was a,
a very heavy set guy and,

418
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:23.030
and uh,
he said,
you know,
I drink a three to four liters of,
of,
uh,
uh,

419
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.780
a soda every day.
And he said,
and I'm worried about from what you said,

420
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:30.980
I'm worried about the,
the plastic chemicals migrating into,
uh,

421
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.890
into liquids and,

422
00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:34.910
and whether or not it's building up in my body and I'm thinking of the three to

423
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:37.940
four liters of soda per day.
Uh,
that's not good for,

424
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:42.950
with respect to the sugar alone.
And,
uh,
he said,
well,
from what you said,

425
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.620
uh,
the,

426
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:48.620
the internal lining of the cans is lined with an epoxy resin that often contains

427
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:51.390
Biz Faena lay now,

428
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.980
and should I choose to drink coke in cans or should I drink the coke out of

429
00:26:55.981 --> 00:27:00.780
these liter bottles that are made out of polyethylene?
Well,
I said to him,

430
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.610
I thought that for a couple minutes.
And I said,
well,
you know,

431
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:05.750
I think I would avoid the cans.
Uh,
because of the,

432
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.850
at least the polyethylene does not have a,
a,

433
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.300
a hormonally active compound in it's such as Biz Faena light.
Well,
he was,

434
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.010
he was not pleased about the story,

435
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.260
but it gives you some insight into the way that the epoxy resins are being used

436
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.860
in order to prevent oxidization on the inside of all sorts of cans,

437
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.800
canned tomatoes.
Uh,
think about your dining hall.

438
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.010
And if you work in the dining hall,
think about the large cans that they,
they,
uh,

439
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.610
have their food delivered within.
Uh,
and,
uh,

440
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.350
all of these are potential sources of exposure.

441
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.820
I think of the way that meets or packaged,
uh,
that,
uh,
are wrapped in vinyl.

442
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:45.390
They're sitting on polystyrene,
none of which is recycled.

443
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.230
What happens when you get your food home while you bring it into her

444
00:27:48.231 --> 00:27:52.890
refrigerator and where do you store it?
You store it inside plastic bins,
uh,

445
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.090
and uh,
and my refrigerator,
it looks quite a bit like this.

446
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.340
And what she,
what I did didn't,
I'm not showing you here is the water supply.

447
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.860
Uh,
so that,
uh,
some refrigerators have a,
a,
a,
a,

448
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.890
a little interior cutout in the front door where you push a push of glass into

449
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:14.900
it to get a fresh water or,
or it's an ice dispenser.
Uh,

450
00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:17.920
so that tracing the origin of the water to that,
uh,

451
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.890
will lead you to plastic tubing,
uh,
which is made out of of a,
a Thali,
uh,

452
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.320
could be,
uh,
this phenotype.

453
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.930
What happens to all these products once we get rid of them?
Well,
you know,

454
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:30.960
it's kind of ironic that we take them out.
We put them in a plastic trash bin.

455
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.070
I just walked in,
uh,
uh,
past Vanderbilt hall and a,

456
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:40.071
you all know the walkway and there were about 15 or 20 different plastic garbage

457
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.640
cans all lined up.
What happens to those when they crack,
uh,

458
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.380
w where do they end up?
Uh,
similarly,

459
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:51.381
most will end up in either underground or they will end up in incinerators.

460
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.820
I think about sports.
I was thinking about Lindsey Vaughn,
uh,
and as I was,
uh,

461
00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.850
uh,
skiing over Christmas break,
I thought about my own,
uh,

462
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.030
my own gear that I had on.
I had plastic skis on.
I had plastic boots on.

463
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.080
I had a plastic polycarbonate helmet on.
I had plastic goggles on,

464
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.970
on top of my polycarbonate plastic lenses.
I had,
uh,

465
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.630
a Gore Tex jacket on.

466
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.010
I had waterproof pants on that not only were synthetic and,
and,
uh,

467
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.970
formed at least in part on a plastic,
uh,
but they also had been applied with a,

468
00:29:24.971 --> 00:29:28.890
uh,
a waterproofing agent that a we talked about earlier.
I,
Hey,

469
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.710
a compound,
uh,
uh,
that,
uh,

470
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.020
basically is designed to prevent a molecules from resting on them,
uh,

471
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.850
so that,
uh,
they shed water,
they shed stains,
stain resistant chemicals,
uh,
and,

472
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.880
and also,
uh,
I had,
uh,
uh,
underwear that was a long underwear that was made out.

473
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:46.780
A police,
uh,

474
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.870
fleeces is polyethylene often and a fleece actually can be recycled so that some

475
00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:54.340
people claim,
such as Patagonia,

476
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:58.060
that they use a certain percentage of recycled polyethylene when they make some

477
00:29:58.061 --> 00:29:59.440
of their products.
Uh,

478
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:03.790
the polls who themselves are made often out of plastic as are the,
the,
uh,

479
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.540
the,
the handles and,
and the,
the baskets.

480
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.340
So that just about any sport you can imagine is now dependent quite heavily on

481
00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:14.830
plastic.
Uh,
the sleds that they use,

482
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:18.200
a sled that won the games the other night for the u s,
uh,

483
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.510
has an outer shell that would be polycarbonate,
so it would have reduced weight,

484
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:25.250
but,
but great strength by the way.
You know,

485
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:30.240
I really appreciated a plastic in,
in,
in my car about,
uh,

486
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:35.370
two years ago I was driving down 95 and I was rear ended by a maniac who is

487
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:38.680
going about 95 miles an hour.
The police estimated,

488
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.570
and I was doing about 70 or 75.
Uh,
but,
uh,
my car,

489
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:49.210
uh,
survived quite well.
It was a Toyota,
uh,
and,
uh,
the Toyota,
uh,

490
00:30:49.211 --> 00:30:53.170
absorb the shock and the back,
uh,
fish tail back and forth in the,

491
00:30:53.171 --> 00:30:55.960
in the passing lane and eventually brought my car over.

492
00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.580
I got out and looked at the back and the back end was all banged up and smashed

493
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:03.250
up.
And,
uh,
that's when I realized,
boy,
you know,

494
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:07.360
they really have a system down here with these collapsible bumpers,
uh,

495
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:11.230
where they have different kinds of plastic that are lined up that have different

496
00:31:11.231 --> 00:31:15.670
degrees of hardness in them,
uh,
to basically distribute the energy from a crash.

497
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.810
So the,
the,
uh,
the use of a plastic compounds for their lightness,

498
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:24.800
for their energy conservation,
for their safety.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

499
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.140
it is clearly growing in,
in,
uh,
uh,
public acceptance.
Uh,

500
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.650
think also about the other recreational equipment.

501
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.400
Many of you may have a camelback,
uh,
what's in a camelback anyway?
Well,

502
00:31:36.401 --> 00:31:39.800
it's a plastic bladder made from polyurethane,
uh,

503
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.820
but it contains no [inaudible] or no thalates or there is an antimicrobial

504
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:45.964
silver lining.

505
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.800
So when people started realizing that they didn't want to buy the sport bottles

506
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:54.040
such as Nalgene because of this Faena lay,
Kamal back was a,

507
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:57.460
was quite fortunate that they had chosen a different material and think about

508
00:31:57.461 --> 00:32:00.750
stainless steel bottles,
uh,
such as these clean canteens.
Uh,

509
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.080
these are not aligned with an epoxy resin that contains Biz Faena lay.

510
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.400
And I told you the story about my own well water.
Uh,

511
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:13.250
but this is a good example here of a,
a tank that also has a,
uh,

512
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:18.280
this is my water supply,
a tank that has a,
an epoxy resin coating on the inside.

513
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.100
And then the over here on the right hand side,
you can see that canister,

514
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:23.440
that water filter that I was describing to you earlier.

515
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.520
I think about the Britta filter system built Britta also is made out of a

516
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:35.521
plastic polycarbonate and also a styrene.

517
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.490
And if you pay attention to the food,

518
00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:43.970
drug and cosmetic act and the safe drinking water act,
you know,
that,
uh,

519
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.930
bottled water curiously is under the jurisdiction of the food and Drug

520
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.570
Administration.
Whereas EPA is responsible for tap water.

521
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.550
That really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

522
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.600
There's a separate set of compounds that one might expect in bottled water,
uh,

523
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:02.660
uh,
based upon the potential for,
for,
uh,
uh,
the compounds to Leech,
uh,
from,

524
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.760
uh,
the plastic into the water.
So overall,
uh,

525
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:11.450
the plastic problem is that it surrounds us.
Uh,
we live in it,
we eat from it,

526
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:15.980
we drink it,
we play with it,
we work with it.
We listened to it,
we watch it.
Uh,

527
00:33:15.981 --> 00:33:19.130
we cook in it.
So what,

528
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.090
where is this material going in the environment?
Uh,

529
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.580
for one of the fal eight's the DEHP I mentioned earlier.
Uh,

530
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:29.090
here's an example of mean concentrations.
Detectable.
Now in the environment,

531
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.140
it's detectable and surface water.
It's detected in groundwater.

532
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.770
It's detected in drinking water.
It's in sediments,

533
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:41.210
in the bottoms of lakes as well as streams and rivers.

534
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.820
It's found commonly in soils.
It's found,

535
00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:46.160
especially in soils that are beneath landfills.

536
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:51.070
So when we buried the plastic material,
nobody thought about,
you know,
how,

537
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.710
how bad the soil contamination might get,
how concentrated,
uh,

538
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.010
and where it might migrate.
And could it get down into the underlying aquifer.

539
00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.930
It's found in indoor air 109 nanograms per cubic meter.

540
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.010
It's found an outdoor air,
which to me is really quite surprising.
Again,

541
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:10.250
this is a function of the sensitivity of the detection technology.
Uh,

542
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.240
but this is really,
uh,
quite a,
a,

543
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.100
a comment on our neglect of chemicals and misunderstanding there.

544
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.410
Their movement through the environment and their ultimate fate.

545
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.380
It's detectable inside in house dust.
It's detectable in wastewater.
Uh,

546
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.050
that should be no surprise.
And why would that be?
Oh my gosh.
I mean,

547
00:34:27.051 --> 00:34:30.660
we're feeding our,
our,
uh,
we're feeding ourselves with water,
uh,

548
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.780
that's coming in in pipes that are made out of plastics and then we're disposing

549
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:39.900
of waste,
the drain pipes themselves or polyvinyl chloride.
Uh,

550
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.420
so why wouldn't you find residues in the,
in the wastewater?
And for me,

551
00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:49.220
in one way,
this is a maybe the most disturbing,
uh,
it's in the rainwater,

552
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.570
uh,
so that it's detectable and rainwater just the same way that strontium 90 was

553
00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:55.670
detectable and rainwater.
So here's a,

554
00:34:55.790 --> 00:35:00.600
here's a case where we've got an industry that,
that,
uh,
uh,
basically,
uh,
has,
uh,

555
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.950
a legal framework that,
uh,
you know,
uh,

556
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.060
most of the other chemical companies like tobacco,
pesticides,
uh,

557
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.890
pharmaceutical companies,
I mean,
they would,

558
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.890
they would kill to have a legal license such as,

559
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:16.700
as a is being enjoyed by the,
the plastics industry.

560
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.110
This is a,
uh,
uh,
an example of,
of,
uh,
serious,
uh,

561
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.671
failure.

562
00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:25.880
And it will be a really interesting kind of a longer term research project if

563
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:29.720
anybody's looking for a senior essay down the road to,
to ask the question,

564
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.790
especially if you're interested in political science,

565
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.990
why wouldn't this industry be more heavily regulated than it is?

566
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.770
How did they escape control?
How do they fly underneath the radar screen?
Again,

567
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:45.170
I'm remembering it reminded of Dustin Hoffman's film,
the graduate where,
where,

568
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.610
uh,
uh,
a,

569
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.760
a middle aged guy walks up to Dustin Hoffman and,
uh,

570
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.940
pulls him aside at a party where Mrs. Robinson is hovering around in the

571
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:01.380
background,
uh,
next to the pool.
And he walks up and he says,
I have one,

572
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.980
one word for you son.
Uh,
and it's,
it's plastics.
Now.

573
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:07.520
This was back in the mid 1960s.
Uh,

574
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:12.220
so that we've had this explosion of an industry that's gotten into,
uh,

575
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.900
hundreds of thousands of different products.
Uh,

576
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.770
the chemical's plastic chemicals gotten into the products they've made their way

577
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:21.420
into our life.
And,
you know,

578
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:25.150
most of us have recognized what's plastic generally and what's not a,

579
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.620
but we really haven't thought about what it might mean for either our health or

580
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:33.450
environmental quality.
So I want to spend just a couple of minutes,
uh,
uh,

581
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.400
having you think about the,
the hormonal question that's being raised by,
by,
uh,

582
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.650
plastics.
And this was,
uh,

583
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.260
first recognized by Rachel Carson.
And,
and when,

584
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:49.560
when she wrote silent spring and back in 1962 and I've mentioned this on

585
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.701
occasions before,

586
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:55.701
but not with respect to hormonally active compounds where she discovered a,

587
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:58.170
along with colleagues that that,
uh,

588
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.330
exposure to a variety of pesticides that were hormonally active,

589
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:03.720
uh,

590
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.720
prevented calcium metabolism in eggshells so that it caused reproductive failure

591
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.760
in certain species,
especially large raptors.
Well,
you know,

592
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.190
that concept that we need to worry about reproductive effects of,
of,
uh,

593
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.230
some of these chemicals.

594
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.370
It really escaped much attention on the part of government through the majority

595
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:27.090
of the 60s,
uh,
in 1970s and a,
the 1980s.

596
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.080
And then in 1996,
Thiel Colburn,
uh,

597
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:35.370
who also was a wildlife ecologist like Rachel Carson,
uh,
wrote our stolen future.

598
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.890
So if you're interested in,
in,
uh,
this history,

599
00:37:37.891 --> 00:37:41.000
I would encourage you to read our stolen future.
Uh,
it's,

600
00:37:41.001 --> 00:37:44.190
it's written as a kind of a mystery story,

601
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.450
scientific detective story they say in their subtitle.
Uh,

602
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.920
but she wrote this with Diane do Menosky a,

603
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:53.490
a long time reporter with the Boston Globe,
uh,
and John Myers,

604
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:58.050
who also was a wildlife ecologist.
If you want to follow this,
uh,
in more detail,

605
00:37:58.051 --> 00:38:00.200
I recommend a Ted Schettler,
uh,

606
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:05.330
Ted Chandlers and Gina Solomon's a book called generations at risk.

607
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.040
So thinking about,
uh,

608
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.620
how our fertility might be affected by these chemicals that are,

609
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.700
that we're experiencing and mixtures,
uh,
without,
without our knowledge,

610
00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:18.960
without our consent.
This is really the subject of,
of uh,
uh,
most of these books.

611
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.250
So I want to look more carefully at one of these compounds.

612
00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:27.630
Biz Faena lay a because it's one that,
uh,
uh,
I think,
uh,
uh,

613
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:32.660
almost everybody now has detectable levels of BPA in their tissues and it's now

614
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:37.030
recognized to Leech from containers.
Uh,
it's soils and surface waters and,

615
00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.470
and fish,
uh,
in it's highest in kids aged one to fix.
Oh,

616
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:46.180
that's really pretty curious.
Why would it be highest?
And Kids ages one to six,

617
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.573
uh,

618
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.300
experts inside EPA and FDA now believe that food and beverages are the dominant

619
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:54.760
sources of exposure.
By the way,

620
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:58.960
there is no yet a good answer to the question why the kids are or more heavily

621
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.420
exposed the effects in animals,
uh,

622
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:06.370
include a female reproductive track abnormalities,
including

623
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.120
abnormalities in the ovary,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
abnormalities of the track,
uh,

624
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:18.270
reproductive track and in a older female mice and a changed vaginal morphology

625
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.900
among a post pubertal loss offspring.

626
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.920
And it also influences the male reproductive system in different species,

627
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.700
including reduced sperm production.
Uh,
reduced my testes,

628
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.940
wait a an enhanced anal genital distance.

629
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.540
It also has been shown to induce mammary gland development in mice.

630
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:41.681
So,
you know,

631
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:45.040
thinking about this chemical and thinking about the different decision making

632
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:48.400
standards that exist in different environmental laws that we've got.
Um,

633
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.150
I'm curious about this and that if this Faena a,
uh,

634
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.600
we're being sold as a biocide,
as a,
as a pesticide,

635
00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.900
EPA could not possibly a license this chemical for use the persistence of the

636
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:04.900
chemical.
It's environmental fate.
Uh,
its,

637
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.720
its threat to health as evidence by these studies.

638
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.180
I would be significant enough to prevent that from happening.

639
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.780
It's also been associated more recently,
uh,
with insulin resistance,
uh,

640
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.860
raising questions about diabetes.

641
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:23.250
And also there is some evidence of impaired immune function.
Now think about,
uh,

642
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.590
the fact that,
uh,
you know,

643
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.650
we're all being exposed to hormonally active chemicals and mixtures,
uh,

644
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.110
without really understanding it.

645
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.410
We don't really know what the intensity of our exposure is.

646
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.280
So what are we seeing out there in terms of fertility,
uh,
or,

647
00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:39.190
or diseases of reproduction in humans?

648
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.040
What we're seeing a rise in the prevalence of infertility,

649
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.980
a serious rise over the past several decades.
And,
uh,

650
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.690
we're also seeing a rise in some,
uh,

651
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.440
negative effects in humans and in males,

652
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.670
particularly in young males,
uh,
increase in Hypospadias,

653
00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:02.550
which means that the,
the opening of the penis,
uh,
uh,

654
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:07.540
does not occur at the end of the penis that occurs further up the shaft.

655
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.960
Uh,
and also,
uh,
cryptorchidism which means that,
uh,
uh,
uh,

656
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.730
little kids don't have fully descended testicles,
uh,
when they're born.

657
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.020
So that there are a variety of different reproductive problems occurring in the

658
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:23.620
population at higher incidence than formerly.
Well,

659
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.760
it's curious when a debate like this occurs when a product is out there in the

660
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:32.090
marketplace.
Uh,
it's,
it's a traded globally.
Uh,

661
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.890
w what do we about it?
Well,
the government,
the regulatory agencies tend to,
uh,

662
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.440
call in experts and get expert opinions.

663
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.800
So the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences and I,

664
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:50.430
EHS a convened a panel.
It turned out,
uh,
the,
the panel was,
was uh,

665
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:54.110
uh,
put together and some of the reading materials were put together by some

666
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:58.670
representatives of,
of uh,
the,
the industry itself.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

667
00:41:58.671 --> 00:42:02.480
it had a view that many had a view that this was not really an independent

668
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:06.350
analysis of what the effects of this fenal a might be.

669
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.580
And they concluded with a,
the phrase that there is some concern,
uh,

670
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.390
that exposure to this funeral eight causes some of these reproductive problems.

671
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.130
A second panel was convened a of independent scientists that had no connections

672
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:23.300
to the plastics industry or the Biz fenal a industry at all.

673
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.400
And they concluded something quite different.

674
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.510
The wide range of adverse effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals

675
00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:33.950
exposed both during development and adulthood is a source for concern with

676
00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:37.190
regard to the potential for similar adverse effects in humans.

677
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.560
So that this idea that a,
you take a question of science and,
and you,

678
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.200
you raise it in front of a group of experts,

679
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:50.150
a really forces one to think carefully about what the conflicts of interest

680
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:51.770
might be for those experts.

681
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:56.330
How could you put together a committee that that clearly was independent?
Well,

682
00:42:56.331 --> 00:42:58.620
full disclosure is one way of doing that.
Uh,

683
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.640
so the demanding that people disclose their income tax records or dis disclose

684
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:06.850
their affiliations or their consulting relationships with,

685
00:43:06.851 --> 00:43:11.090
with different industries,
uh,
could clarify from the public's mind,

686
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:16.370
uh,
whether or not there's a high probability of a bias.
Well,

687
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:20.360
remember what I said about Bisphenol a being the hardener,
uh,
the fal late,
uh,

688
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.100
DEHP is a softener.
Uh,

689
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.640
it's produced in a much lower volume 260 million pounds per year.

690
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.590
It's also found in a,
in our bodies,

691
00:43:27.591 --> 00:43:32.300
it's added to PVC plastic and it's recycling percentage,
uh,

692
00:43:32.301 --> 00:43:35.180
is,
is,
uh,
close to zero.
And it also is,

693
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:40.181
is widely found in the environment and it's been found with a similar kinds of

694
00:43:40.401 --> 00:43:45.290
adverse effects in,
in,
uh,
uh,
males in,
in test animals,

695
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:49.680
including reduced sperm production,
uh,
and early onset of puberty.
Uh,

696
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.740
and all of this exposure is coming predominantly because of the failure of the

697
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:58.010
toxic substance control act.
So,
you know,

698
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:01.430
Congress really recognized that we needed a test these chemicals before they

699
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:05.210
made their way into the market,
uh,
back in,
in the early 1970s.

700
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:10.310
So they passed a Tosca and gave the authority to EPA to demand premarket
testing,

701
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:16.100
but they didn't do anything about it.
So again,
the universe of chemicals is big.

702
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.730
82,000 chemicals traded in commerce.
They have some commercial value,
uh,

703
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.020
about 20,000 of those were added since 1986.

704
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.110
And what that means is that this statute,
the way it's worded,

705
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.420
it granted exemptions as,
uh,

706
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.550
chemicals that were grandfathered protected in the marketplace.

707
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.380
They couldn't be removed by EPA to 62,000 different compounds.

708
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.180
Uh,
the statute is unusual also because it places a high burden on EPA to

709
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:45.330
demonstrate that there's a significant date danger,
uh,

710
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.160
before it can cause the industry,
uh,

711
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.520
demand from the industry that they produced the evidence.

712
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:55.680
Now just like pharmaceuticals and like pesticides and other products that we've

713
00:44:55.681 --> 00:45:00.220
talked about,
you know,
how much sense does it make to have the industry,
uh,

714
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.740
producing the data themselves and then presenting their case to the Mammal

715
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.700
Protection Agency,
uh,
for licensing.
Uh,
where should this occur?

716
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.550
Should there be some sort of an independent organization set up a that would be

717
00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:15.370
more protected from potential bias?
Well,
clearly there's a,

718
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.120
an economic stake involved in industry is anxious to,
to spend that money.
Uh,

719
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:20.641
but,
uh,

720
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:24.480
this high burden on EPA to demonstrate danger is the primary reason for the

721
00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:28.140
failure of the toxic substance control act.
So that,
uh,

722
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.200
over this period of time,
uh,

723
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.080
they have demanded testing for only 200 different chemicals.

724
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.320
And out of those 200,
only five have been prohibited.

725
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:43.270
So what are states and other governmental agencies doing about this?
Well,

726
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:44.710
a variety of state initiatives,

727
00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:47.430
including a hearing Connecticut had been launched.
Uh,

728
00:45:47.431 --> 00:45:50.810
and a number of us had been involved in drafting legislation that in,

729
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.130
in a different states,
uh,
but here in Connecticut,

730
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:59.060
we now have a statute on the books as of last year that,
uh,
uh,

731
00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:02.980
requires that a Biz Faena lay be taken out of products that are intended to be

732
00:46:02.981 --> 00:46:05.050
used by a young children.
Uh,

733
00:46:05.051 --> 00:46:08.290
and similar statutes have been passed in these other states.

734
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.340
You can think about a regulatory policy being one of,
well,
testing a chemical,

735
00:46:15.341 --> 00:46:17.050
figuring out how dangerous it is,

736
00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:20.530
and then figuring out how you might regulate it.
Or you might just say,

737
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.730
here's a clear threshold.
If a chemical behaves in this way,

738
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.890
say it's persistent,
it's bioaccumulative,

739
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.600
it's found in human tissues and it's demonstrated to be hormonally active.

740
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.560
But that's it.
It's out of the marketplace.
That's a prohibitive policy.

741
00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.490
So once you decide not to employ a prohibitive policy,

742
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:42.920
once you decide not to ban,
you basically,
uh,

743
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.800
require the regulatory agency,
uh,
to figure out,
uh,

744
00:46:47.801 --> 00:46:50.440
you know exactly which uses would be allowed and which would not.

745
00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.670
And it creates a very expensive and difficult time consuming,
uh,

746
00:46:54.671 --> 00:46:58.090
monitoring and enforcement.
Uh,
problem for an agency.
So,
uh,

747
00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.080
the regulation chemical by chemical use by use,
uh,

748
00:47:02.081 --> 00:47:04.830
is not likely to have much effect in,
in that,
uh,

749
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.840
solving a problem such as this California is requiring the listing of DEHP under

750
00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:14.560
its proposition 65,
uh,
and this,
uh,
uh,

751
00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:18.970
was required in 2008.
And what it's done is it's limited,
uh,

752
00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.530
the concentration of DEHP,
uh,

753
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.900
in products to less than 0.01%.
Now what would that do?

754
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:32.740
You're going to limit the of a chemical and a product to 0.01,

755
00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:36.790
2%.
That's going to force the government into becoming,
uh,
uh,

756
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:38.020
monitoring organization.

757
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:41.590
So it's got to go out and it's got a test in order to find products that,

758
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.420
that do not comply.
Again,

759
00:47:43.421 --> 00:47:46.870
very expensive and a strategy that's not likely to work.
Now,

760
00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:51.630
the European Union is,
is taking a very different approach.
Uh,
they are,
uh,

761
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:54.580
they have adopted a law in 2006,

762
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:59.460
known as reach in reach requires toxicity and environmental fate testing,
uh,

763
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:04.290
for 1500 of the highest volume chemicals,
the highest,
uh,

764
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.930
uh,
uh,
amount produced,
uh,

765
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.340
among the 80,000 chemicals that are out there that are poorly tested.

766
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:16.390
Uh,
it,
it's,
uh,
also a program that's been delayed.

767
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.140
The endocrin screening program,
uh,

768
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.450
will not begin until 2012.
Uh,

769
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.860
the mixture problem remains the,
they still are not going to tackle the,
the,
the,

770
00:48:26.861 --> 00:48:31.330
uh,
uh,
issue that we're exposed to mixtures that might act by the same mechanism.

771
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.831
Uh,

772
00:48:31.831 --> 00:48:35.670
and also they will be grandfathering many of the chemicals that are produced in

773
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:37.420
the smaller quantities.
What,

774
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:42.421
why would it not make sense to focus exclusively on the high production volume

775
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:44.020
chemicals?
Well,

776
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.380
you've got to think about the fact that there could be some chemicals that are

777
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:52.480
extremely potent and extremely dangerous at very low doses.
So plutonium,
again,

778
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:56.890
is,
is a good example of that.
Also corporations are acting on their own.

779
00:48:56.891 --> 00:49:00.910
So that PVC corporate phase out policies and been adopted by a variety of firms,

780
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.020
including these,
and this is having a very significant effect.
Number one,

781
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:05.651
it's educating.

782
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:10.560
A lot of people when they see a label that says PVC free a or BPA free,
they,

783
00:49:10.561 --> 00:49:13.630
they start to pay attention and ask questions.
Why that,
uh,

784
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.080
why that might be a,

785
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.030
and I want you to back up and I want you to think about really what the core of

786
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:23.730
this problem is.
It really is consumerism.
Uh,
the fact that,
uh,
you know,

787
00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:28.410
we buy much more than than we need.
We don't pay attention in a way to,
uh,

788
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:32.650
uh,
the ingredients of different products that we bring into our environment.
Uh,

789
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.660
it also has to do with,
uh,
you know,

790
00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:37.390
the ignorance of our effects of our own behavior.
I,

791
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:40.240
while I was preparing this lecture over the past couple of days,

792
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:43.390
I have to admit that I got really angry with myself.

793
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:47.590
I got angry and I got surprised because I,
I think of myself as,

794
00:49:47.591 --> 00:49:49.420
as somebody that should have known better,

795
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:54.421
I should have adjusted my lifestyle to what I recognized as a potential threat,

796
00:49:55.390 --> 00:50:00.190
not just to the environment,
not just to the population,

797
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:02.860
but,
uh,
to,
to my own kids.
So,
you know,

798
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.610
there are many reasons for that that don't have to do with me.
Uh,
but,
uh,

799
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.510
I should have known better than that.
And,
uh,
hopefully after taking this course,

800
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.780
you will,
you will not make this,
this kind of problem yourself.

801
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.150
You can think about a national regulation,
uh,

802
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:20.890
as a partial solution because the markets are global.

803
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.150
People are trading these products and chemicals across national borders all the

804
00:50:25.151 --> 00:50:28.940
time.
So what does it mean if the United States passes a law?
Uh,
but,
uh,

805
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:33.290
say Germany does not pass a law or Germany's got a more restrictive statute than

806
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.124
the United States.

807
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.780
That's a recipe for trade barriers that are likely to be eventually litigated.

808
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.050
So think also about,
uh,
uh,
the concentration and,

809
00:50:43.051 --> 00:50:46.000
and dispersion of products and the,
the,

810
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:51.200
the effect of one corporation like Mcdonald's or,
uh,
are say Toyota,

811
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.820
uh,
to,
to make a choice that they are going to,
to,
uh,
uh,

812
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.410
not use certain products,

813
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.340
that they're not going to distribute a billion new toys over the next two years

814
00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:05.210
where their new market line or that they're going to demand a ultimate

815
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.480
accountability for the eventual fate or end of life of their product.

816
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.290
The way that some of the printer companies have,
uh,

817
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:19.280
that have demanded the recycling,
uh,
or not demanded,
but,
but offered,
uh,

818
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.660
uh,
to,
to take back the ink cartridges once they are,
uh,
uh,
empty.

819
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.980
So basically the government has been neglecting extra towels and externalities

820
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:32.000
and there's been an absence of,
uh,
uh,
accountability.

821
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:36.890
So here's a list of potential solutions and I know we're out of time,
uh,

822
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.980
go through these.
These will be up on the website later this afternoon.

823
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:43.760
So I'm going to conclude there and just remind you that,
uh,
the,

824
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:47.520
the electronic exam will be emailed out to you today at five o'clock,
uh,

825
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:51.680
that you have 48 hours to return it and return it both to the classes Vitu

826
00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:55.610
server,
Dropbox,
but also please return it to your teaching assistants.

827
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.450
Thanks very much and good luck and I probably won't see many of you before
break,

828
00:51:59.451 --> 00:52:01.280
so I hope you have a really great break.
