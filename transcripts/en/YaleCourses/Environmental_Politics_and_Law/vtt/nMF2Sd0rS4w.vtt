1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.860
Okay,
everybody,
let's start in
today.

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.570
I want to talk about green building and,
uh,
the,

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.060
the opportunity to also think about the laws that surround green building,

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.450
uh,
and also the energy,
uh,

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.030
implications of green building standards.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.620
And I'd like to also address the,
the,
uh,

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.630
the history by having you think about the way that these standards have evolved

8
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:30.870
over time,
uh,
particularly the evolution of certification programs.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.260
So the idea of certification,
uh,

10
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:39.060
I want you to think about it quite broadly at the outset because it basically

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.950
implies that certain standards are being applied to something.

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.020
It might be a product,
it could be a service,
uh,
could be a,
a neighborhood,

13
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:52.920
a city,
so that,
uh,
uh,
the idea that,
uh,

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.560
there is an expert group that would a review,
uh,

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.810
something whether or not it's your academic preparation and performance or

16
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:02.960
whether or not it's a building's performance,
uh,

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.360
and then certify it and give it a symbol.
Uh,
it would,
uh,

18
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.240
rank it relative to others.
Uh,
that,
uh,

19
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.200
is one obvious example would be looking at a GPA and a transcript.

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.240
Well we'll see after today's lecture is that the green building programs that

21
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:23.160
have a walled in Europe,
in the United States and Australia,
they really are,

22
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.510
are based on that same kind of concept.
So how would you rate,
uh,

23
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.060
the environmental and health responsibility in energy efficiency of,

24
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.260
of new building standards?
Uh,

25
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.250
how would they apply or how might they apply to a renovation projects?

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.870
So I'm basically going to use the lecture today to share with you a,

27
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:46.140
an overview of a paper that will be published in about two weeks.

28
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.240
That is a critique of,
of the US Green Building Council's program,

29
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.390
uh,
known as lead.
So I'd like you also to think about,
uh,
uh,

30
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.410
the importance of the building sector in,
uh,

31
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.420
its demand for energy in the United States.

32
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.420
Buildings consume 76% of the u s uh,

33
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.350
electricity in the mid almost half of the nation's greenhouse gases.

34
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.890
So that how we manage the future of building and development will very much

35
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.260
influence the intensity of energy demand.

36
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.970
And keep in mind also that the u s consumes more energy than any other country

37
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.050
in the world.
Uh,

38
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.170
and US consumers consumes nearly 25% of the world's energy and only accounts for

39
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.330
5% of the world's population.

40
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.200
So that our energy demand is increasing at about 2% per year.

41
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.370
So why,
why might that be?
I mean,
obviously we're changing our behavior.
Uh,

42
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.790
we're changing our technology,
uh,
and our dependence on technology.
Uh,

43
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.430
and also the environments that,
uh,
uh,

44
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
we shape around us have enormous implications for energy that often are not well

45
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:58.170
understood,
uh,
for a variety of reasons.
Uh,
you,
you,
for example,

46
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.790
probably have no understanding of,
of how your daily behavior,
uh,

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.190
and variability and your behavior might influence your daily energy demand.
Uh,

48
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.380
the way that you manage your computers,
the way that you manage your,

49
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.410
your windows,
your,
your air exchange between indoor and outdoor environments.

50
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.290
Will you manage lights,
whether or not you have a car on campus,
if you do,

51
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.980
how often you use it,
where do you park it?
Uh,
what's,
it's fuel efficient.

52
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.140
So thinking about how to keep track of,
of an individual's energy demand is,

53
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.530
is really not in most people's minds,
clearly defined.

54
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.540
So,
as I just said,

55
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.600
the contribution to the climate change problem,
uh,

56
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.050
and our,
our dependence on foreign oil,
uh,
is really,
uh,
very,

57
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.710
uh,
much dependent upon the way that we build and the way that we,
uh,

58
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.460
set up standards to encourage energy efficiency.

59
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.290
So 39% of co two emissions come from the building sector,
40% of energy,
uh,

60
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.440
consumption,
uh,
total energy consumption,
uh,

61
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.470
13% of water consumption and about 15% of the gross domestic product per year,

62
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.800
uh,
is associated with the building sector.

63
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.300
Think about the different patterns of growth and how the different patterns of

64
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:14.950
growth,
uh,
and neighborhood development influenced the way that we use energy.
Uh,

65
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.690
these houses are not connected,
so they can't gain any benefit for,

66
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.640
for,
uh,
uh,
uh,
heat,
uh,
conservation,
uh,

67
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.480
by having a joining walls.
Uh,
they all had their own yards.
And in fact,

68
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.990
if you think about how people move around in these kinds of neighborhoods,
uh,

69
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:33.110
you'd realize that,
uh,

70
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.160
because of the fencing in the backyard and a w without gates that go between all

71
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:40.400
the different lots,
uh,

72
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.650
and it would be quite normal for somebody to get in the car and the driver all

73
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.320
the way around the block to take their kids to somebody,
uh,

74
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.730
somebody else's house that might be,
uh,
uh,
less than a baseball throw away.

75
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.740
So that,
uh,
patterns of development,
uh,
encourage patterns of transit,

76
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.210
uh,
that,
uh,
have just an enormous influence on the way that we consume,
uh,

77
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.220
electricity,
but also petroleum products.
Uh,
so I think also about,

78
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:09.070
uh,
the cities in the nation that during the 1990s and,

79
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.800
and over the past decade of experience,
some of the rap,

80
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:13.780
most rapid rates of growth,
well,

81
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:18.640
these include Las Vegas in Las Vegas is expanding,
uh,
into the desert,

82
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.020
uh,
that,
uh,
in,
in a manner and at a density,
uh,
that,
uh,

83
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.940
is suburban.
It's sprawling,

84
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.560
but it's unusual in Las Vegas because of the environment.
So that a,

85
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:33.640
the every,
every house,
uh,
oh,
uh,
uh,
would,

86
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.720
would likely have a lawn.
The lawn would require a sprinkling.

87
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.110
Many of these houses also,
uh,
once they're,
they're built out,

88
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.110
I would have swimming pools,
uh,
so that,
uh,

89
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.860
think about the way that the use of water demands energy,
uh,

90
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:51.610
to not just move it around,
not just the distribution,

91
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.580
but also filtration.
Uh,
and also,
uh,

92
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:57.650
the energy that goes into putting in the infrastructure to move it around.

93
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.270
Now on Thursday,
and we're going to come back and talk more about,
uh,
the,
uh,

94
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.230
the new town movement in the United States and,
uh,
uh,
this problem of,

95
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.260
of managing growth at a larger scale than,
than today's lecture,

96
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:13.640
which is really focused on the building,
uh,
individual buildings.
Uh,
but,
uh,

97
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.200
it is interesting that a,

98
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:20.000
a movement evolved in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States to,

99
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.710
to design neighborhoods,

100
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:25.430
to design a whole new communities in a way that would take into account some of

101
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:30.380
these problems.
Uh,
Irvine,
California as the example in this slide.
And,

102
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:34.520
uh,
you can see the,
uh,
the center of the campus,
but you can also see,
uh,

103
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.020
the large academic buildings surrounding a green in the center.
And then the,

104
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:42.600
in the,
uh,
adjacent areas,
you have recreational facilities,
uh,

105
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.330
but also higher density housing nearby.
It's a very walkable community,
uh,

106
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.840
one that,
uh,
uh,

107
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.910
is not based on the idea of segregating land use is commercial versus

108
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.560
residential versus industrial versus recreational.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

109
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.390
in,
in suburban Connecticut,
uh,
you put your kids in a car and you drive from,
uh,

110
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.470
from the,
the area where you live,
to where you work,
uh,
to the recreational area,

111
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.120
to dance lessons,
whatever it is.
So the,
uh,
this community,
uh,

112
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.060
was intentionally designed back in the sixties and seventies,
uh,

113
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.120
in a way that would provide for mixed land uses and offer opportunities for,

114
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.730
uh,
much,
uh,

115
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.930
increased pedestrian traffic as opposed to a suburban areas around new haven.

116
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.180
Here's an example of a community about 20 miles away,
uh,
that,
uh,
many,
uh,

117
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.960
of my colleagues live in.
And,
uh,
uh,

118
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.800
this is a zoning at a scale of about a one unit per four to five acres.

119
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.040
So each of these houses,
uh,
has a strip of land that,
uh,
uh,

120
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.060
reaches back from it into an area that might otherwise be a common open space so

121
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.100
that,
uh,
this,
uh,

122
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:57.130
low density development demands even more time spent in cars in more fuel.

123
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.780
A good example of a house in a more rural part of Connecticut.
So that,

124
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:07.700
uh,
uh,
keep these things in mind as you're thinking about your own behavior,

125
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:11.590
the way you grew up,
uh,
and you try to consider how,
uh,

126
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.370
how your lifestyle choices,
uh,
influenced your family's consumption level.

127
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.581
Also,
a,

128
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:22.581
I want you to think about the idea of size and how we are increasingly dependent

129
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:26.680
upon many consumer products in our,
in our,
uh,

130
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.280
lives that are larger than they used to be.
Uh,
and,
uh,

131
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.680
housing is no,
no,
uh,
uh,

132
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:37.540
exception so that the average house size in 2009 is,

133
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.200
is grown to about 2,500 square feet,
uh,

134
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.810
with about 2.3 on average people per house.

135
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.280
That's really pretty remarkable.
So,
you know,

136
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.620
roughly a thousand square feet per person.
Whereas back in 1950,

137
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.820
the average number of people in a house was about,
uh,
uh,
much closer to three,

138
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.410
a little bit over three with a port post World War II,
baby boom,
uh,

139
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:03.690
with a total size of 800 square feet.

140
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.690
So the house size has grown by,

141
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.860
by a threefold 1970 grew to a 1500 feet.

142
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.260
So the energy demands of a larger house like that,
uh,
are,

143
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.670
are actually quite difficult to predict if you try to take into account,
uh,

144
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.040
the diversity of building materials.
Well,
I apologize for this and,
uh,

145
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.670
you know,
we,

146
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.200
one of you might go outside and let them know that there's a lecture going on in

147
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:32.700
here that would be a really nice,
the construction is,
um,
it's,
it's,
uh,

148
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.350
creating also a diesel fumes inside the,
uh,
the building.

149
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.690
Uh,
many of the garages that you find in suburban areas,
uh,

150
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:46.560
also have grown in size.
So here's an example of a garage that,
uh,

151
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.680
is actually larger than the average house size was back in 1950.
Uh,

152
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.960
this is probably about a 22,
23 by a 30 foot house.

153
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.690
So that's roughly 1200 square feet.
Pretty interesting.

154
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.670
I'm thinking about the way that,
uh,
uh,
space is laid out.
Uh,

155
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.580
so here's a studio apartment,
uh,
on the right hand side.
And,
uh,

156
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:07.230
you see a dining table,

157
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:12.060
a kitchenette walking closet in the bath on the,
on the upper level,

158
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.130
whereas the base level is,
is dominated by a garage so that,
uh,
we're,

159
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.780
we're allocating less space indoors to,
uh,
uh,
uh,

160
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:26.400
our bedrooms and we are to,
to,
uh,
our,
our auto storage areas.

161
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.820
Also,
many buildings are now constructed with much more glass in them than,

162
00:10:31.821 --> 00:10:33.540
uh,
previously.
Uh,

163
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:38.541
and the newer high end buildings are using a special glass that is designed to

164
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:43.660
reflect radiation,
uh,
so that,
uh,
it's not absorbed,
uh,

165
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.720
but a different glasses are really designed for different climatic regions,
uh,

166
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.380
so that,
uh,
some are more,
more efficient at reflecting radiation,

167
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.401
uh,
that,
uh,

168
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:57.210
are used in southern climates that are warmer and others are more efficient,
uh,

169
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:01.910
at providing insulating a installation.
So they've got a barrier,
uh,
in the,

170
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.030
in the interior that,
uh,
uh,

171
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.360
basically protects against a heat loss.
Uh,
so that,
that,
uh,
uh,

172
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:13.810
overall though,
uh,
buildings,
uh,
increased use of,

173
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:18.590
of windows,
uh,
has,
has,
uh,
created a increased energy demands.
Uh,

174
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.320
also lighting,
uh,
and also the way that we,
uh,
have,
uh,

175
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.780
increasingly designed bathrooms,
uh,
to have more than one fixed year.
Uh,

176
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.210
so here's an example of a shower stall that has,
uh,

177
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.080
a multiple shower heads in it,
multiple faucets,
uh,
so that,
uh,

178
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:37.690
water demand is,
is a often increased in,
uh,

179
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.930
bathrooms designed like this.
Uh,

180
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.440
most green building programs also attempt to regulate the building materials

181
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.090
that are used in furnishings.
So here's an example of a,
a bookcase,
uh,

182
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.990
and set of drawers seemingly are made out of Oak.
Uh,

183
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.410
but,
uh,
this is actually an,
an oak veneer.
Um,
and,
uh,

184
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:04.030
if you have been up in coon hall where the Forestry Environmental Studies,
uh,

185
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.720
school is,
you may know that,
uh,

186
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.660
about 70% of the wood that's on the interior of this was grown on yell property

187
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.740
on your forests.
Uh,
it also is,
is Red Oak,
but it's solid red oak.

188
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.210
It's not a veneer.

189
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.480
So what's beneath the veneer here you can see a strip of press board,

190
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.740
uh,
that,
uh,
is faced with,
with,
uh,
a white oak surface.

191
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.700
But the interior is,
is basically a low grade wood chips,

192
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:35.200
a of a variety of different species that are compressed together.
Uh,

193
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:39.930
and they are,
are mixed up in liquid form with adhesives.
Uh,

194
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.480
and then they are ruled out on a strip and then cut into a variety of different

195
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:47.300
sizes.
Uh,
the adhesives have compounds that,
uh,

196
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.460
are often proprietary and even unknown to most,
uh,

197
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.090
who purchased them at that,
uh,
uh,

198
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.990
or sell them a at building supply houses.
They commonly contain,

199
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:02.110
uh,
uh,
adhesives that are a poxy resins,
uh,

200
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.680
some of which contained Biz Faena lay that we talked about earlier in the
course.

201
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.120
Uh,
but also formaldehyde is a component that is commonly used.

202
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:12.050
It is an allergen and it's a,
uh,

203
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:17.300
a suspected carcinogen like you to think too about the problem of you're

204
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.640
understanding how,

205
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.230
how could you increase your understanding of the energy intensity of your own

206
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:27.060
lifestyle?
Well,
here's a,
a pretty good example of,
um,

207
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.110
the way that houses that were built in the 1990s and,
uh,
uh,

208
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.740
previously our metered,
so that this is what your,
your utility junction box,

209
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:40.170
where the line comes in from the road.
Uh,
this is my meter.
Uh,

210
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.020
I have the same brand and it's got five dials on it.
And you might think,
well,

211
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:46.870
that's not that tough to figure out,
but if you walk up to it,

212
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:49.960
you'll see that the dial is actually have the numbers that,
uh,
uh,

213
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:51.400
on the first dial on the left,

214
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.170
it goes from lowest to highest in a clockwise motion.
But in the second,

215
00:13:56.171 --> 00:14:00.550
it goes from lowest to highest and a counterclockwise motion.
So the,

216
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.800
they switch on as you move across the screen.

217
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.470
So this is actually a very difficult thing to keep track of.
Now also,

218
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:14.070
uh,
you might,
uh,
uh,
wonder,
well,
you know,
uh,
how would I find out,

219
00:14:14.071 --> 00:14:18.250
uh,
you know,
how my variance in behavior,
uh,
you know,

220
00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:23.251
how I manage my computers are my lights or my water consumption or how big a

221
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:27.220
refrigerator I,
I have,
how is that going to affect my electric bill?

222
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.430
It's really hard to figure it out,
given this kind of a metering system,

223
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.610
because if you can decipher what the,
the,
uh,
uh,
uh,

224
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.360
meter says,
uh,
you'll only get a total figure for your consumption.
Now,

225
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.750
this has created an opportunity for people to design a variety of smart meters,

226
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.650
uh,
that keep track of,
of energy intake and use and,
uh,

227
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.760
how it's distributed in a,
in a house for different purposes.
So that,
uh,
uh,

228
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.000
I tried to figure this out,
uh,

229
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.910
given my a dial meter at my home and ended up turning off absolutely everything

230
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:05.750
in the house and then starting up appliances one by one.

231
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.410
So I'd start the refrigerator,
then I turned the refrigerator off,

232
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:12.770
I'd start a drier,
uh,
start a dishwasher.
But,
uh,

233
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:17.630
that would be the only appliance that I would have running so that,
uh,
uh,

234
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.540
but you can imagine every time you plug in one and then,
uh,

235
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.080
go out to the meter and take a reading,
come back in,
uh,

236
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.750
unplug it and plug in something else.

237
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.010
It's going to take you a very long time to figure out where you're,

238
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.510
you're spending your money.
By doing that,
uh,

239
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.160
over a period of about eight hours,
uh,

240
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.180
I was able to save about 25% of my average monthly energy bill,

241
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.470
uh,
by,
by figuring out how to restrict access or fully,

242
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.080
fully turn off different appliances in the house,

243
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.510
a building products and building construction is,

244
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.720
uh,
normally regulated by a variety of building codes,

245
00:15:56.721 --> 00:16:00.790
many of which had been adopted internationally so that these codes,
uh,

246
00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:05.580
apply to materials.
Uh,
they apply to two electrical systems.
Uh,

247
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.330
they apply to two energy sources,
fire prevention,
um,

248
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.880
mechanical heating and ventilation and air conditioning systems,
uh,

249
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.870
plumbing,
uh,
they even apply to historical sites,
uh,

250
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:23.810
in an earthquake prone parts of,
of,
uh,
uh,
the country.
Uh,
they,

251
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.520
uh,
have a code that is distinctive in California for earthquake stability,

252
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.900
so that these codes,
uh,
uh,
evolved,
uh,

253
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.460
originally as being voluntary so that they were not formally adopted by state or

254
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.121
local governments.

255
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:43.121
But now you find most states do have a similar kinds of building codes and they

256
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:47.820
were originally designed to promote,
uh,
uh,

257
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.760
understanding of,

258
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:53.761
of the functionality and the safety and the durability of different kinds of

259
00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:58.870
products,
uh,
also to promote truth in labeling.
Uh,
but,
uh,
they,

260
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.320
they never really were designed to promote environmental responsibility,

261
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:08.530
health protection or a energy efficiency so that the green building movement was

262
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:13.630
really ripe for,
for a,
a,
a brand new certification system,
uh,
that,
uh,

263
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.570
would,
would apply a variety of different kinds of standards.
And,
uh,

264
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.140
the three programs that,
uh,

265
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.160
I'll mention today include the lead program by the US Green Building Council,

266
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:24.861
uh,

267
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:29.780
the bream program in the United Kingdom and the Green Star program in Australia.

268
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.650
Uh,

269
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.390
and the bre environmental assessment method is perhaps the best known,

270
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.040
uh,
in the world right now.

271
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:41.060
And it's the most widely adopted throughout Europe and a,

272
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.410
it sets standards for the back for best practices and sustainable design.
Uh,

273
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:46.640
and it's become really a,

274
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.690
a defacto measure used to describe a building's environmental performance.

275
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:56.580
Uh,
within the European Union.
Australia has,
uh,
the,
the Green Star program,

276
00:17:56.581 --> 00:18:01.530
which is a national,
it's also voluntary,
uh,
that evaluates construction,

277
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.300
environmental design.
Uh,
and to has been,
uh,

278
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.390
particularly a well developed for commercial structures,

279
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:13.590
especially office buildings in downtown districts were about 11% of the

280
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:17.730
buildings have had been constructed and a certified under the program.

281
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.160
So it's purposes are to first of all,

282
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:24.780
try to figure out a common language and common definition for what mean is,
uh,

283
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:29.430
so that,
uh,
before the national organic food standard was adopted,
uh,

284
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:34.110
there was no national consistency in the definition of what organic food was.

285
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.730
Uh,
so it varied by a certification scheme.
It also,
uh,

286
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:43.690
the greenstar program also sets measurement standards.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,

287
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.120
there is a common approach to,
uh,
to measuring,
uh,

288
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.180
say energy consumption or,
or,
uh,
uh,
uh,

289
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:56.130
the capacity of a different building materials such as electrical conduit.

290
00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.330
Uh,
and they also promoted a,
uh,
a whole building design.

291
00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:03.990
So that one would think about not just the individual components,

292
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:08.010
the individual building materials,
uh,
or the,
the different systems.

293
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.650
And by systems I mean like water supply,
electrical supply,
uh,

294
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.290
perhaps the heating and ventilation system or plumbing.
Uh,

295
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:20.070
but to figure out how to put all of these components together in a way,
uh,

296
00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:22.880
that,
uh,
would,
would minimize,
uh,
the,
uh,

297
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.950
long term adverse effect on environmental quality or human health or energy

298
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:29.070
loss.

299
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.460
So this idea that a one would think about building materials in the,

300
00:19:33.461 --> 00:19:35.990
in the style of,
of,
uh,
design,
uh,

301
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.320
in a way that we consider the ultimate product life cycle.

302
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.370
This is really a pretty new idea in the building industry,
so that,
uh,
you know,

303
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:48.120
what's going to happen to that PVC pipe that exists in your house when your

304
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:52.860
building gets torn down.
Uh,
what's going to happen to,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,

305
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.150
the copper piping that delivers the water or the PVC pipe,

306
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.650
you can almost be assured is going to be either burned or it's going to be

307
00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:03.870
discarded,
discarded in a landfill,

308
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.810
up with the copper piping is highly likely to be recycled because of its,
uh,

309
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.070
of its,
uh,
uh,
uh,
market value.

310
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.680
So differences in these programs are normally associated with the way that they

311
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:21.630
allocate credits or,
or points to buildings for different purposes.
Uh,
but,

312
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:26.310
uh,
there they really are quite similar and in their attempt to,

313
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.353
to,
uh,

314
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.480
promote energy conservation concern for chemical life cycles as well as human

315
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:33.750
health.

316
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.400
So the Green Building Council evolved in the beginning of 1993.

317
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.540
Uh,
and this is what I want to focus on now for,
for the remainder of the session.

318
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.500
And it is a voluntary nonprofit organization,
uh,

319
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.250
that has no government affiliation,

320
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.630
although it was started by a grant from the US Energy Department.

321
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.560
So,
uh,
this is,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

322
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.260
created with a board of directors that include,
uh,

323
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.880
people that have expertise in architecture and engineering as well as some of

324
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:06.040
the largest,
uh,
uh,
development firms,

325
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.940
construction firms in the nation.
There are,
are really not,

326
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.320
uh,
uh,
uh,

327
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.190
a number of people on this board or on the staff that have a deep environmental

328
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:20.080
or health expertise,
uh,

329
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.740
and its orientation is predominantly been to promote energy efficiency.

330
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.040
They claimed that the benefits of this,
this,
uh,
uh,

331
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.200
leadership and energy and environmental design,

332
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:31.820
which is what the lead acronym stands for,
uh,
that there,

333
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.380
it has three predominant purposes.
One is to promote environmental quality.

334
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.470
The second is economic development to uh,

335
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.050
basically stimulate,
uh,
a,
a new type of building,

336
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.370
a new building materials that,
that are more environmentally responsible,

337
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:55.150
sorry about the noise and also to PR to promote a healthy

338
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.580
lifestyles within buildings and communities and by healthy lifestyles within a

339
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:02.080
building.
And I'll give you one example.

340
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:06.940
A colleague of mine works at the Centers for disease control in Atlanta and they

341
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:11.230
have a relatively new building and a just as a,
a healthy lifestyle.
Uh,
they,

342
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.520
uh,
attribute,

343
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:17.521
they decided that instead of putting a staircase in the back of the building and

344
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:19.330
the elevator right near the front door,

345
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:22.270
when people walked in that they would reverse that.

346
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.210
So the elevator was put in the back,
uh,
in the staircase,

347
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:29.080
was surrounded by glass panels,
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

348
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.490
made it really light sunlight streams through and attractive so that people when

349
00:22:33.491 --> 00:22:37.090
they go into the building,
normally walk up the stairs,
uh,

350
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.410
seven or eight story building.

351
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.890
So that this individual who directs or directed the National Center for

352
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.970
Environmental Health told me that he and his staff,
you know,
didn't,

353
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.290
nobody uses the elevator.
Everybody goes up and down the stairs.

354
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.380
So that Burns,
uh,
it saves energy or the elevator's not used much in,

355
00:22:55.381 --> 00:22:58.660
in also it,
uh,
also is,
is a healthy,

356
00:22:58.661 --> 00:23:01.900
it's burning a burning up calories.
So that a,

357
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:05.110
the purpose of lead falls into a variety of categories.

358
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.470
One is sustainable sites and other is water efficiency.

359
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.940
Another is energy and atmosphere.
Another is materials and resources.
Uh,

360
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.790
the fifth is indoor environmental quality.
And uh,

361
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.450
the fourth is really creativity and innovation and design.

362
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.710
So I mean you might imagine a different categories might be a part of,

363
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.580
of a system such as this.
Uh,
but uh,
there,

364
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.830
there are interesting questions about the relative importance that these

365
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:32.080
categories should be assigned.
Should you,

366
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:36.040
should you be assigned as much about the nature of the site that's chosen for

367
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:39.310
building a,
whether or not it's remote and a is going to be in a,

368
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:44.250
in a Greenfield area as opposed to the site that might be the,
uh,

369
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.650
uh,
hazardous and contaminated so that the coon hall up on,

370
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.690
on prospect street across from the whale coon hall was built on a highly

371
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:55.370
contaminated site,
uh,

372
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:59.150
so that a former power plant was there and a lot of work had to be done to,
uh,

373
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.700
to clean that site up to,

374
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.030
to remove contaminated debris as well as other infrastructure.

375
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.140
The,
uh,
the heating and electrical and,
and,
uh,
uh,

376
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:14.120
hot air conduits that,
uh,
go from the power plant up to science hill.

377
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:18.700
Particularly client science tower,
so that the idea that,
uh,
uh,

378
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.620
you would give more credits to,
uh,
uh,
a building program that,
uh,

379
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.440
uh,
would not chew up,
uh,
undisturbed areas that are in,
uh,
uh,

380
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.110
say,
uh,
the suburbs.
Uh,
you,
you'd give more credit to those that,
uh,
uh,
we're,

381
00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:36.770
we're,
uh,
actively going to restore sites.
Is it an interesting concept?

382
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.303
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

383
00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.360
<v 0>the certification program,
uh,
that I'm going to talk about today,</v>

384
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.080
it has to do with,
with new construction and renovation,

385
00:24:47.081 --> 00:24:51.010
although there are other programs that that lead has a,
for example,

386
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.730
a program for schools,
a program for,
for homes.

387
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.320
So that in this program there are a hundred base points plus a 10 possible bonus

388
00:24:59.321 --> 00:25:02.460
points.
Uh,
and,
uh,
there are different,
uh,

389
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.350
levels of certification that can be achieved.
So if you achieve,
uh,
uh,

390
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.070
40,
uh,
42 or 49 points,
uh,
you are certified,

391
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.020
uh,
up to 50 to 59 points.
A,
you're given a silver certification,

392
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.670
a goal is 60 to 79,
and then platinum is 80 to 110 points.
Uh,

393
00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:26.590
you can imagine a variety of different strategies here.
Uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

394
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:31.090
I would hold the bar higher for,
for the base level of certification,
uh,

395
00:25:31.091 --> 00:25:35.170
or perhaps,
uh,
uh,
hold the bar higher for only the platinum level.

396
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.770
The croon building was just certified to be a platinum building as,

397
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.110
as an example.
So,
uh,

398
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.440
these are the different kinds of certification programs that lead has beneath

399
00:25:47.441 --> 00:25:50.320
its umbrella.
Uh,
and as I mentioned,
the first one,

400
00:25:50.321 --> 00:25:55.110
new construction and renovation is the subject of today's talk,
uh,

401
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.560
but also schools,
uh,
core and Shell,
uh,

402
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.960
components of buildings on neighborhood development,
retail facilities,

403
00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:05.890
healthcare facilities,
uh,
commercial interiors and homes.

404
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.530
Sorry,
I've got a couple of duplicate slides here.

405
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:18.110
So I'd like you to think about sustainable sites.
Uh,
credits that,
uh,

406
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.640
credits can be awarded a four,
building a previously developed land.

407
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.420
Uh,

408
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.650
they give additional credits for minimizing impacts on ecosystems and waterways,

409
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.480
uh,
for promoting a landscaping that is regionally appropriate.
Uh,
so if,

410
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:35.330
for example,
in the slide that I showed in Arizona,
uh,

411
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.180
if you were trying to get leed certification for a new project,

412
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.840
you would need to be very careful about the kind of landscaping that you put in

413
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.890
making certain that it wasn't a,
uh,
water dependent.
Uh,

414
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.280
the whether or not the building site encourages,
uh,

415
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.320
access to public transportation.
So proximity say to a rail station,
uh,

416
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:57.900
would,
uh,
include the number of points,
uh,

417
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.310
the control of storm water runoff and erosion.
So as an example,
there,

418
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.460
coon hall has a very large gutter that overhangs the south side and a funnel's

419
00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:12.570
watered down into that,
a a watered garden that is on the eastern side of the,

420
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:13.890
uh,
of the structure.

421
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.690
And then that water moves through a filtration plant,
uh,

422
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:23.691
inside the building and then is recycled into two gray water so that it is used

423
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:28.630
for removal of human waste in the bathrooms.
Uh,

424
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.120
also here's an example of,
of how that building a,
achieve certain points by,
uh,

425
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.270
uh,
the restoration program,
digging out the old contaminated lands,
uh,

426
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.110
and,
uh,
uh,
rebuilding.
So four,
for each of these categories.

427
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:45.260
I'm not going to spend much time on this.
Uh,

428
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.840
but for each of the categories you can achieve points in different directions.

429
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.170
And you can imagine that the way that these points are allocated category by

430
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:57.090
category could have a,
a pretty significant implication for,
for,
uh,

431
00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:58.950
providing encouragement.
By the way,

432
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:02.940
why would a developer want to be lead certified anyway?
You know,
what's the,
uh,

433
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.740
what's the value?
Well,
I mean,
I,
I mentioned one value,
uh,
uh,
that,

434
00:28:07.741 --> 00:28:12.120
uh,
would be to the,
uh,
the building industry,
uh,
uh,
at large,

435
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:17.130
but,
uh,
uh,
which is,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
uh,
creating an incentive for,

436
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.080
for,
uh,
uh,
a new line of products and a new,
uh,
of,
uh,

437
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:26.900
approach to building design,
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,
would create a jobs and,

438
00:28:26.901 --> 00:28:31.480
and,
uh,
cause the industry to grow.
Uh,
generally.
Uh,
but,
but,
uh,

439
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.100
most developers are in this because they know that if they achieve certification

440
00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:39.990
than the property value is higher,
they can demand a premium,
uh,
for,
uh,

441
00:28:39.991 --> 00:28:44.820
the,
uh,
the structure or the,
the complex.
So that,
uh,
in this case,
uh,

442
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.680
the sustainable sites category,
uh,
uh,
allows one to,
to,

443
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:54.330
uh,
seek about 23% of the total number of credits that are possible.

444
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:59.820
Uh,
so that,
uh,
these can be awarded for Brownfield redevelopment for alternative

445
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:04.260
transportation.
The,
uh,
the bike storage area that you find,
uh,
on,

446
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.840
uh,
behind,
uh,
uh,
Osborne Laboratory,
uh,

447
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.600
caused fes to gain additional points.
Uh,
the,
the,
uh,

448
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.860
management of,
of,
uh,
uh,
storm water,
uh,
uh,

449
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.660
trying to,
uh,
manage,
uh,
a heat island effect,
reduce that,
uh,
uh,

450
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:26.100
intensity of heat absorption by creating green roofs.
Uh,
they also,

451
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.640
uh,
there was a green roof that's on part of that site.
Uh,

452
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:33.000
water efficiency also is a source of possible points,

453
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.320
about 9% of the total.
Uh,
and so that,
uh,

454
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.800
within this category,
appliance efficiency,

455
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.430
our fixtures and fittings are good examples of different ways of saving water,

456
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.850
uh,
as well as the landscaping that I mentioned earlier.

457
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.030
I wanted to mention a couple of,
uh,

458
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.900
kind of relatively recent technological designs.
Uh,
one is,
is,
uh,

459
00:29:55.901 --> 00:30:00.460
these,
uh,
levelness faucets,
uh,
that,
uh,

460
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.710
uh,
since your,
your presence either by,
uh,
an electronic high or,

461
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:10.600
or,
uh,
sensing,
uh,
uh,
heat,
uh,
that causes them to turn on and off.

462
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.880
And it's,
it's kind of interesting.
You know,
I,
I,
uh,
become,
uh,

463
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.600
curious more curious about this and watch people's,
uh,
uh,
hand washing behavior,

464
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.560
uh,
particularly in places like airports.
And it's really common to have a whole,

465
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.070
uh,
uh,
array of these things on a countertop.
Uh,

466
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.340
and people often have to move from one to the other to get one to work.

467
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.500
And after that happens,
a number of times,
people I think are more likely just to,

468
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.420
to not wash their hands.

469
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.080
So there's a sanitation problem that a is potentially associated with it.

470
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:46.090
If you go into the men's rooms a and look at the flush lists,
a urinals,
uh,

471
00:30:46.091 --> 00:30:49.610
you will immediately recognize that there is a serious problem in [inaudible].

472
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.960
And it,
uh,
it's a,
uh,
led many due to argue that,
uh,

473
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.680
uh,
they really would rather make the trade off between the,
uh,
the,

474
00:30:58.681 --> 00:31:02.370
the odor in the bathroom.
Uh,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

475
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.050
that might otherwise be managed by,
uh,

476
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.220
improving the heating and ventilation system so that,
uh,
right now,
uh,

477
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:11.050
no water is used in this toilet.
Uh,

478
00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:16.051
only a synthetic compound is put in to try to maintain it's a sanitation,

479
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:23.140
but,
uh,
uh,
it often is not as effective as as it is promoted to be,

480
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.350
so that a water efficiency,
uh,
uh,

481
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.120
can be achieved in a variety of ways.
Uh,
the,
uh,

482
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:36.270
the faucets themselves are often fitted with the restrictions in a flow,

483
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:40.830
uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,
uh,
the,

484
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.130
the need to,
uh,
if you're,
if you're interested in,
uh,
uh,

485
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.720
taking a more powerful shower,

486
00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:50.290
you'll need to figure out how to get the flow restrictor out.
Uh,

487
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:53.080
which many people do try,
do,
try.

488
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.700
The flow restrictor itself is governed by local and state building codes.

489
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:02.500
Uh,
and it was kind of interesting to me.
It was that an education for me,
uh,

490
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:06.730
when I wondered last a plumber who was installing a new faucet in my sink and I

491
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:11.200
said,
you know,
I really would like a larger rate of flow in this sink.
Uh,
so that,

492
00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:16.120
uh,
you know,
I could be more effective in washing dishes or whatever.
And he said,

493
00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:20.180
well,
you know,
uh,
you really don't understand the energy implications of,
of uh,

494
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.240
uh,
not restricting the flow.
And,
uh,
if,
if,

495
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:29.320
uh,
if you thought about it,
then you'd realize that,
uh,
uh,

496
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.120
the energy costs are really quite high to move the water to your home.
I said,

497
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:37.350
well,
I've got my own.
Well,
he said,
well,
think about where,
uh,

498
00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.580
where the energy is coming from,
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

499
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.990
causes your pump to lift the water 600 feet.
And then also think about,
uh,

500
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.470
the more,
uh,
what are the CI use,
the more waste you create,

501
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.760
so you're likely to disperse a biological and chemical contaminants more
broadly.

502
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
So my plumber gave me a lesson in environmental behavior that I thought was

503
00:32:58.461 --> 00:33:02.330
quite valuable.
So the majority,
not the majority,

504
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:06.290
but the highest proportion of points or credits are awarded under the lead

505
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:10.940
program,
uh,
for energy,
uh,
and atmospheric concerns,

506
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:15.050
uh,
so that,
uh,
new buildings can,
uh,
obtain points by,

507
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.860
by a monitoring energy consumption.
And this is being pretty carefully done.

508
00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:23.370
And in coon hall as an example,
uh,
and the,
uh,

509
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:28.370
orientation of the building at Croon,
it's,
it's facing east to west,
uh,
so that,

510
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:29.610
uh,
it has,
uh,

511
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:34.370
more window space on the south side to absorb more solar radiation,
radiation.

512
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.230
It also has solar panels that run a clock across the south side,
uh,
and,

513
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:44.690
uh,
a variety of other,
uh,
saving,
uh,
techniques so that,
uh,

514
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.750
uh,
the dominance of,
of energy and energy conservation in,

515
00:33:49.751 --> 00:33:50.584
in,
uh,

516
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.950
the Leed certification and credit program relative to these other categories is,

517
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.540
uh,
quite interesting,
uh,
with respect to materials and resources.

518
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.430
Uh,
the,
the,
uh,
management of waste is also a more intensely monitored,

519
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.880
uh,
within a leed certified building.
Uh,
and,
uh,

520
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.690
when a building is actually certified,
uh,

521
00:34:10.691 --> 00:34:15.440
it's not certified for forever.
It's certified for a fixed period of time,

522
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.720
um,
often only a single year.

523
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.860
And a building is not certified until it can demonstrate that a,

524
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.980
it is performed at a level of ex,
uh,
uh,
during that year.

525
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.570
So it's kind of an interesting idea.
Uh,
if,
uh,
uh,
buildings,

526
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:33.370
heating and ventilation system malfunctions,
uh,
then,
uh,
uh,

527
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.750
a year or two down the road,
it's not going to be recertified.
Uh,

528
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.690
indoor environmental quality,
uh,
is,
uh,

529
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.750
increasingly a concern and only 15 points compared to about 34 points in the

530
00:34:47.991 --> 00:34:52.610
energy category.
Only 15 points are allocated for indoor environmental quality.

531
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.680
Now what does,
what does,
uh,
what does that mean?
It generally means a concern for,

532
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.660
for,
uh,
the chemical content of the indoor environment.
Uh,

533
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.750
but it also includes the opportunity to,

534
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:09.790
to gain points for a natural daylight and views and also for,

535
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.750
uh,
a acoustical control noise control.
Um,
so that,
uh,
uh,

536
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.370
the situation that we're experiencing here might be avoided.
Now,
you know,
uh,

537
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:18.801
again,

538
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:23.600
think about the importance of this in terms of a human chemical exposure,

539
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:28.560
uh,
given the fact that we spend so much time indoors.
You know,

540
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.510
this diagram is now a couple of years old.
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
in the,
uh,

541
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.690
uh,
latter part of,
of,
uh,

542
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.300
the 1990s was estimating that about 86,

543
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:41.310
87% of time was spent indoors,

544
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.580
about 5% of time was spent in a vehicle.

545
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.560
So thinking about the chemical content of the indoor environment is important,

546
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:52.900
especially for certain subgroups like kids.
Uh,

547
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.440
this can be managed in a variety of ways.
And you could,
you could think,
well,
the,

548
00:35:56.441 --> 00:36:00.060
the ventilation rate or the air exchange rate indoor and outdoors is one way of

549
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:04.140
doing that depending upon where your building is.
Uh,
so in general,

550
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:07.350
outdoor air quality is better than indoor air quality,
you know,

551
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:11.880
unless you live in proximity to an industrial area or,
or,
uh,
to a highway.
Uh,

552
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:16.110
so that,
uh,
uh,
being able to mechanically and individually control,
uh,

553
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:20.100
windows is an important strategy for,
for managing air quality,

554
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.390
but also thinking about a variety of different,
uh,

555
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.470
materials and compounds that are brought into the built environment so that some

556
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:33.000
compounds are,
and some products are discouraged under this program.
Uh,

557
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:35.160
so that,
uh,
uh,
paints for example,

558
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:39.390
that emit a high level of volatile organic compounds are discouraged.

559
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:41.120
So low emitting,
uh,

560
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:45.750
paints a varnishes polyurethanes are now designated,
uh,

561
00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:48.450
so that,
uh,
if,
uh,

562
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.590
if you look at the cannabis oil based paint,
you'll find that that uh,

563
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:57.650
roughly two and a half pounds of volatile organic compounds are contained,

564
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.383
whereas,
uh,

565
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:04.140
a certain paints are now manufactured with no volatile organic compounds.

566
00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:08.310
You might also think about the compact fluorescence that pose a kind of an

567
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:12.360
interesting problem,
uh,
in that,
uh,
they contain mercury.
Uh,

568
00:37:12.361 --> 00:37:16.950
and so that,
uh,
this is,
uh,
a piece of personal advice for you.

569
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.300
Uh,
as you install or remove compact fluorescents,

570
00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.170
be really careful about them because if the break in your room,

571
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.730
it's gonna scatter mercury around and the Mercury will vaporize.
Uh,

572
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:34.370
if it gets into a rug and you vacuum the rug,
the rug is going to do,
uh,
uh,
uh,

573
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:39.570
uh,
give off the mercury vapors and it will increase the validation rate.

574
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.470
Uh,

575
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.800
and it will be just about impossible to completely remove the mercury from the

576
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:48.540
room.
So this is a,
this is a problem associated with a compact fluorescence,

577
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.600
uh,
that,
uh,
is turning into a,
a,

578
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:55.080
a rather interesting and a serious dilemma for,

579
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.910
for a waste management.
So not many people really want to take a,

580
00:37:58.911 --> 00:38:03.720
an old burned out,
a light pole back to,
to a recycling center.
Uh,

581
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.920
in fact,
uh,
uh,
the probability of getting it there without breaking it is,
is,
uh,

582
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.270
probably not too great.
And also think about,
uh,
uh,
again,

583
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:16.440
plastics and landfill and increasing proportion of the interior built

584
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:20.220
environment is made up of a variety of plastics at we've talked about in the

585
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:21.720
past.
Uh,
but the,

586
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:26.670
the extremely low chance that plastics are going to be a recycled,
uh,

587
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.370
is,
uh,
uh,
a logic to,

588
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.270
to rethink the way that points are allocated.
A,

589
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:36.330
there was an interesting debate inside the Green Building Council about a

590
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.280
polyvinyl chloride plastics.
And whether or not the PVCs ought to be,
uh,

591
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.940
either band,
uh,

592
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.280
or whether or not you would have credits removed if you use PVC as opposed to a

593
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.850
more recyclable product like polyethylene,
uh,
that,
uh,
you know,

594
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:56.830
the most soda bottles are made out of a,
but they decided not to do that,

595
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.860
which is quite curious.
Uh,
so thinking about,
uh,

596
00:39:00.861 --> 00:39:05.710
the kinds of materials that are put down on a floors,
uh,
the,
the sealants also,

597
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:09.470
this is a encouraged credits can be gained if you choose a,

598
00:39:09.471 --> 00:39:13.080
not just the low voc paints,
but also the clear finishes.
Also,

599
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:18.020
you'll find a variety of products including this type of a vinyl flooring,
uh,

600
00:39:18.021 --> 00:39:22.510
that you could see in coon hall,
particularly in the stairwells,
uh,
that,
um,
uh,

601
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:27.090
gives off a volatile compounds that,
that,
uh,
I haven't been able to identify and,

602
00:39:27.091 --> 00:39:31.410
and the manufacturers are not required two to label.
So thank you.

603
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.610
Think about the variety of different,
uh,

604
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.660
products that go into purchasing a or go go into the construction of a building.

605
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:45.550
And how these products may change the chemical content of,
of that environment.

606
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.220
So that,
uh,
uh,
the,

607
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:53.170
the quality of the air exchange system is,
is really critical,
uh,

608
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.030
to,
uh,
to govern the,
the,
uh,
uh,
uh,
chemical exposures that occur.

609
00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:02.620
And this is particularly the case in a new building.
Uh,
as an example,

610
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.603
a rugs,

611
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.930
rugs maybe made out of a natural products,

612
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:12.430
natural fibers,
uh,
such as a wool or cotton or,

613
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:17.390
or,
uh,
uh,
some,
uh,
uh,
now it's increasingly some,
um,
uh,

614
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.790
read material from,
uh,
South America,
but,
uh,
uh,

615
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.490
rugs that are made out of synthetic compounds and they're backing,

616
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:29.650
many are recommending that those be aired out in a warehouse or,
or,
uh,
uh,

617
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.440
in a garage for a period of time,
uh,
you know,

618
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.420
up to a couple of weeks before they're installed so that,
uh,
I,

619
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.710
occupants of new buildings would not be exposed to those fumes.

620
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.080
A couple of other examples that are not managed by lead a certain golf courses

621
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:50.460
have been been a certified.
Uh,
whereas,
uh,

622
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.920
the expectation on the part of the Green Building Council is that the chemicals

623
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:57.700
that are used are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Uh,
and,

624
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:59.830
and,
uh,
uh,

625
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:04.750
the chemicals that are used on golf courses are commonly,
uh,
uh,

626
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.400
uh,
quite a,
uh,
a complex mixture.
Uh,
and,
uh,

627
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.250
as you remember from the pesticide section of the course of many of these have

628
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:17.020
not been fully tested.
A variety of insulating materials also,
uh,
uh,

629
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.880
can expose workers,
uh,

630
00:41:18.881 --> 00:41:23.620
at levels that are potentially hazardous to their health.
Uh,

631
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:28.480
so that,
uh,
uh,
some,
uh,
acrylics,
uh,
for example,

632
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:33.160
uh,
that,
uh,
play an important role in increasing the,
the,
uh,
uh,

633
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.640
uh,
energy efficiency,
the building,
uh,

634
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.080
but they can lead to a worker exposure situations.
So thinking about,
uh,

635
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.270
whether or not lead should get involved in,
in,
uh,
concern about,
uh,
uh,

636
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.260
the production of the chemical and its application and the way that it's

637
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:52.490
actually used it to build the building is interesting.
Lead is also certified,
uh,

638
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.330
a bottling plant raising kind of an interesting question.
Well,
what if a,

639
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.330
say a dupont corporation,
uh,
uh,

640
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.540
wanted to build a plant to produce a variety of chemicals that were extremely

641
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:06.570
hazardous and perhaps they,
uh,
they got into water or air,
soil,

642
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.850
uh,

643
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.380
should they be allowed to get a platinum or a lead certification for,

644
00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:16.220
for that structure shouldn't necessarily be allowed to,
to,
uh,

645
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.570
gain certification,
uh,
for,
uh,
marketing,
uh,

646
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.380
products that,
uh,
are not likely to be recycled.
Ah,

647
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.940
here's another example of a,
uh,
a project that was certified in,

648
00:42:27.941 --> 00:42:32.941
in Florida a and you remember the lecture last week about a barrier islands.

649
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.260
Uh,
well,
this owner a,
owns the track of land,
uh,

650
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:42.510
slicing across a barrier island from the bay to the shoreline.
Uh,

651
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:45.740
and obviously has quite intensively developed it.
You know,

652
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:50.510
seeing the amount of square footage,
uh,
in,
in homes and the low occupancy rates,

653
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:51.490
uh,
is,
is,
uh,

654
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.740
led me to wonder about whether or not government might think about regulating a

655
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.530
square foot per person or a cubic foot per person.
Uh,
I mean,

656
00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:02.450
how much space do we really need per person?

657
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.160
So I'm going to run through just a few summary of,

658
00:43:05.161 --> 00:43:09.480
of findings here before I close today.
Uh,

659
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:12.320
that should give you a sense of,
of,
uh,
you know,

660
00:43:12.321 --> 00:43:15.260
what's working and what's not working too well with the lead program.

661
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:20.840
These standards have been designed by,
uh,
uh,

662
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.310
a voluntary nonprofit organization,
uh,

663
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.310
but they've been adopted increasingly at all levels of government,
uh,
in law.

664
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.720
So they've been added to a Connecticut's laws for,
for example,

665
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:36.250
to the Connecticut now requires that new buildings,
uh,
that,
uh,

666
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:41.420
are going to cost more than $5 million,
need Leed Leed certification.
Uh,

667
00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.650
many of the Department of Energy's programs are now designed to encourage,
uh,

668
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.630
giving of grants to two projects that,
uh,
uh,

669
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.070
gain lead certification or would gain lean leed certification and meet many

670
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:58.630
local governments are now adopting these standards so that,
uh,

671
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:02.120
well what's happening here is that the standards are being developed by a

672
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:06.800
voluntary,
a nonprofit organization really to promote a new form of,

673
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:08.300
of growth and development.
Uh,

674
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.320
but they're being incorporated wholesale into a variety of different levels of

675
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:16.370
government,
uh,
without really thinking critically about what's working well.

676
00:44:16.371 --> 00:44:18.240
And what's not a,

677
00:44:18.241 --> 00:44:22.970
there's no now no federal definition of what a green building standard,

678
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.950
uh,
should be.
Uh,

679
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:30.050
clearly this program gives a higher priority to energy efficiency over a indoor

680
00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:34.790
environmental quality or,
or human health.
Uh,
and,
uh,
if I were going to design a,

681
00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:39.000
a statute that,
uh,
uh,
would encourage green building,

682
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:43.950
it would certainly give increased precedence,
uh,
uh,
to,
uh,

683
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:47.990
to public health concerns and,
and,
uh,
the chemical content of buildings.
Uh,

684
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.460
the Green Building Council has very little expertise in,

685
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.010
in a human health and that in part explains why these standards are,
are uh,

686
00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.240
uh,
not well developed in that area.
Still the green certification program,

687
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:03.370
the lead program,
uh,
it gives a false impression of,

688
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.550
of healthy buildings and tighter buildings are,
are more energy efficient,

689
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.350
but tighter buildings also more effectively contain chemicals that get into

690
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:17.360
indoor air so that,
uh,
uh,

691
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.370
no level of certification,
uh,
even the highest level.

692
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.700
The platinum rating assures health protection.
I'll lead,

693
00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:28.020
also neglects drinking water,
uh,
so that,
uh,
drinking water supplies,

694
00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.790
uh,
are managed in,
in the nation predominantly by the safe drinking water act.

695
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.400
And the maximum contaminant level standards.

696
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:40.520
So there is no requirement under lead to certify,
uh,

697
00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:45.540
two,
excuse me,
to a,
to filter water
despite the fact that,

698
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:49.470
uh,
uh,
many waterlines are capable of transmitting,
uh,

699
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:54.060
not just metals,
but also,
uh,
uh,
some of the components of plastics.

700
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.290
So that the,
uh,
the core problem with respect to managing,
uh,
chemicals,
uh,

701
00:45:59.590 --> 00:45:59.880
uh,

702
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:04.320
in the indoor environment and the ultimate life cycle cycle of chemicals I has

703
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:07.600
to do with,
uh,
congresses,
inactivity.

704
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:12.180
It's failure to demand that the chemicals that are used in the building
industry,

705
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.800
uh,
be labeled a,
that they be tested before they're used.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

706
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:21.150
it's creating a pattern of exposure that a really,
uh,
we don't understand.
Well,

707
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.990
we know we're being exposed,
uh,
to a,
a brand new mixture of compounds.

708
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:29.460
So what kinds of recommendations might you think about to improve this system?

709
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.860
Well,
one would be to simplify the scoring system so that,
uh,
uh,

710
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.840
the,
uh,
rather than using the,
uh,
the platinum,
the gold standards,

711
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:44.040
I would prefer to see a scale that was simply a zero to a 100 scale.

712
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.070
So that people would,
would,
uh,
uh,

713
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:52.110
not have the incentive just to get to 80 points so that,
that,
uh,
uh,

714
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.620
would ensure that they would be awarded that the,
uh,
the platinum certification,

715
00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.770
I think that,
uh,
the,
the categories of certification,
uh,
uh,

716
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.560
need to be diversified.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

717
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.170
if the Green Building Council judged and scored a project's performance and

718
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:12.060
separate categories,
uh,

719
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.560
developers would have an incentive to score a higher in all those categories.

720
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.400
In other words,

721
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.400
set up a separate a scoring system for indoor environmental quality and human

722
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:26.250
health set up,
set up a separate system for energy efficiency,

723
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.420
set up a separate system for,
for water supply.
Uh,

724
00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:33.090
but whether or not we want to have this system managed by,
uh,
uh,

725
00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:37.920
a nonprofit organization that is run by the board of directors,
uh,

726
00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.320
that to have predominantly for profit organizations.
Uh,

727
00:47:41.321 --> 00:47:45.220
that's another basic question.
So should the federal government take this over?

728
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.220
So this system is not designed in its current form to encourage the use of

729
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:55.190
safety,
safer chemicals in the building industry,
so that,
uh,
uh,

730
00:47:55.210 --> 00:48:00.110
what kinds of innovations might encourage a builders to,

731
00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.093
uh,

732
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.240
want to buy buildings or buy a building products that contain safer products.

733
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.730
While they would certainly need to know what the chemicals a war in the product,

734
00:48:10.731 --> 00:48:13.840
so that a,
there's a labeling issue that needs to be confronted,

735
00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:17.840
but also there's a testing issue,
uh,
as well.
Uh,

736
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.280
the Green Building Council also has the opportunity not to disclose,
uh,

737
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:24.940
the results of,

738
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.640
of it's a building performance tests so that the public really has a,

739
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.360
excuse me.
The public has no,
uh,
uh,

740
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:38.520
opportunity to,
to,
uh,
hold,
uh,

741
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.820
the Green Building Council accountable for its declaration of a performance in

742
00:48:42.821 --> 00:48:47.770
different categories.
So I think I'll close with a thought that,
uh,
uh,

743
00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:51.280
this is a very interesting historical example of how,
uh,

744
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:56.490
certification standards evolved in a nonprofit organization that really is

745
00:48:57.191 --> 00:49:01.870
representing a for profit industries.
The,
the large,
uh,

746
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.010
uh,
building products industry,
uh,
the major building companies,

747
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.170
large architectural firms and engineering firms.
Uh,

748
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.110
and this program has no accountability at all to the United States public,
uh,

749
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:18.490
at the same time that it's being built into law at all levels of government.

750
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:23.740
So something seems really,
uh,
very much out of whack a and a,
it demands,
I think,

751
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:28.270
a,
a pretty careful review.
One critical,
uh,

752
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:33.280
improvement could be made if minimum performance criteria were set within each

753
00:49:33.281 --> 00:49:37.990
of the specified categories,
sustainable sites,
energy,
uh,
the,

754
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:41.140
the,
uh,
the category for indoor environmental quality,

755
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.930
so that if there were minimum,
uh,
and protective,
uh,

756
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.960
standard set inside those categories,

757
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.460
it would go a long way to meeting some of the objections I just raised.
Okay.

758
00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:52.091
Thank you very much.

759
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:55.210
We'll come back to a larger questions of community design on Thursday.
