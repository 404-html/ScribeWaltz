1
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.310
Well at this course has a long history and a,

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:05.461
the,

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:07.080
the purpose is really to,

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.820
to a wonder with you,

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.361
uh,

6
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:09.960
about,

7
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.051
uh,

8
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.630
the potential effectiveness of environmental law.

9
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.390
And I really want you to imagine that,

10
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:15.990
uh,

11
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.411
uh,

12
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:18.000
we have no environmental law,

13
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.690
uh,

14
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.770
by the end of the course.

15
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.911
Uh,

16
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.140
I may ask you on a final exam to,

17
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:22.570
uh,

18
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.890
uh,

19
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.290
to design a new system of environmental law,

20
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.920
uh,

21
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.040
that would protect us against the problems that I'm going to run through with

22
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:29.640
you.

23
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.220
This is a,

24
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.700
an unusual course in that most law courses,

25
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:32.821
uh,

26
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:33.654
do not,

27
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.890
uh,

28
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.250
uh,

29
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.740
go through case histories the way that we will hear,

30
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.341
uh,

31
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:38.851
so that,

32
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:38.971
uh,

33
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.421
we will,

34
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:44.421
we will be reviewing perhaps a 12 or 14 different case histories of specific

35
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.594
problems.

36
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.530
We'll be taking a look at the statutes that evolved in an attempt to manage

37
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:50.364
those problems.

38
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.091
Uh,

39
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:55.650
and I will give you my impressions about how effectiveness might be judged,

40
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:57.120
how efficiency might be judged,

41
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.781
uh,

42
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.720
and also really answer the basic question,

43
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:02.160
which is what's worked,

44
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.240
what has not,

45
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.210
and why as a way of thinking about how we're going to respond to,

46
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.701
to a,

47
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:07.830
a,

48
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.850
a very new world,

49
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.481
uh,

50
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.460
in which you will face your,

51
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.630
your children will face a,

52
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:13.830
your grandkids will face,

53
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.461
uh,

54
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.370
approximately 12,

55
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.950
10 to 12 billion people,

56
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.790
uh,

57
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.720
creating a more demand on resources,

58
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.200
uh,

59
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.160
more pollution,

60
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.880
uh,

61
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.680
rising rates of consumption,

62
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.690
a rising rates of waste.

63
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.000
How are we going to manage these types of problems?

64
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.630
That's,

65
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.210
that's the really the essential purpose of the course.

66
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.040
You'll see on the syllabus that a,

67
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.840
I want to run through quickly with you,

68
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.680
uh,

69
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.320
that,

70
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.460
uh,

71
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.510
today I'll give you a,

72
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:40.510
an overview of,

73
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.100
of,

74
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.610
uh,

75
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.160
the material that will cover over the next several months.

76
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.791
Uh,

77
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:48.720
on Thursday we'll review principles and strategies and environmental law and

78
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.490
I'll give you a quick cook's tour of a variety of different statutes as well as

79
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:54.040
the,

80
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.330
uh,

81
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.970
decision standards that are embedded in those statutes.

82
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.601
Uh,

83
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:02.310
then we will take a look over several weeks at the problem of national security

84
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.144
in the environment.

85
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.280
And really what happens when,

86
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.241
when,

87
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:06.840
uh,

88
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.231
uh,

89
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:08.100
the military,

90
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.660
uh,

91
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.240
uh,

92
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.240
spends trillions of dollars per year,

93
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.720
uh,

94
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.553
in the world.

95
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.891
Uh,

96
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:14.091
what,

97
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:18.900
what happens to a environmental quality and the public sector is not been the

98
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.210
target of 20th century environmental law.

99
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.690
Uh,

100
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.430
but it has been a very important force in shaping the environment that,

101
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:25.601
uh,

102
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:25.850
we,

103
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.360
we now are coping with.

104
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.370
We'll look at nuclear experimentation and I've come to believe that a,

105
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.560
the atmospheric weapons testing program,

106
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.960
uh,

107
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.380
of the 1940s and 1950s,

108
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.490
really is a,

109
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.960
it's one,

110
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.930
it demonstrates one of the greatest success stories that we have in

111
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:43.920
environmental law.

112
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.640
Uh,

113
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.200
following the recognition that,

114
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:46.710
uh,

115
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.700
the radionuclides that were created and,

116
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.041
and,

117
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:50.550
uh,

118
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.820
uh,

119
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.200
blown into the atmosphere,

120
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.501
uh,

121
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.300
work their way into the stratosphere.

122
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.670
Uh,

123
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.100
they encircled the globe.

124
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.661
Uh,

125
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.740
and when they intersected rain clouds,

126
00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.710
they would to earth,

127
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.371
uh,

128
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.750
they contaminated the soil.

129
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.270
They contaminated the water supplies.

130
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.680
They contaminated also,

131
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.910
uh,

132
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.211
uh,

133
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:07.620
food,

134
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.840
uh,

135
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.651
food supplies,

136
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.760
agricultural crops,

137
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.190
uh,

138
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.450
and made their way to the dinner tables of everybody on the earth.

139
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.201
Uh,

140
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:18.670
the radionuclides eventually became embedded in human tissue depending on the

141
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.960
new Clyde to it would vary between bone or fat tissue,

142
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.580
perhaps the liver,

143
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.020
uh,

144
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.320
and pose a very well known threats so that we'll review that story because there

145
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.510
are really fundamental lessons of ecology,

146
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.020
a fundamental lessons of,

147
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:34.180
of environmental health,

148
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.751
uh,

149
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.111
that,

150
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.261
uh,

151
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:36.340
we've really forgotten.

152
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.541
We've forgotten this.

153
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.400
We've attempted to manage air,

154
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.881
water,

155
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:40.714
food,

156
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.111
uh,

157
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:45.610
as well as consumer product safety or large tracks of land.

158
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.211
Uh,

159
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:46.751
so that,

160
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:46.960
uh,

161
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.500
why,

162
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.200
why had these lessons that a,

163
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.220
we're very clear by 1963.

164
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.310
Why have we forgotten those lessons that just the purpose of that segment.

165
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.130
And for each of these case histories,

166
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.010
I'll be reviewing the specific statutes that,

167
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.670
uh,

168
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.000
that,

169
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.400
uh,

170
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.830
applied at the time,

171
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.290
uh,

172
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.440
and talk about how they evolved and,

173
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:05.560
uh,

174
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.250
give you a sense of how you would evaluate whether or not they worked,

175
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.760
uh,

176
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.870
how effective they were.

177
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.120
Uh,

178
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.890
we'll take a look too at a preparation for warfare.

179
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.340
It's not only the waging of war that creates a great environmental destruction.

180
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.500
It's also the preparation for warfare,

181
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:21.070
the training,

182
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.810
the production of weapons,

183
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.520
the enrichment of uranium.

184
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.211
Uh,

185
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:30.211
so that if you look at the 25 to 30,000 different military bases and

186
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:32.530
installations around the world,

187
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.230
you'll see extremely severe contamination.

188
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.810
Uh,

189
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.050
so thinking about how that should be managed,

190
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:39.160
how it might be prevented,

191
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.641
uh,

192
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.020
will also be the subject of,

193
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.070
of several lectures,

194
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.700
uh,

195
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.290
as well as sight restoration.

196
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.760
And so we'll be looking at a predominantly public sector issues in this first

197
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:49.630
segment of the course.

198
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.850
And then we'll take a look at the private sector,

199
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:53.410
which has been the target of most,

200
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:53.620
uh,

201
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.300
20th century environmental law.

202
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.961
Uh,

203
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:59.440
we'll take a look at global markets and the challenge that they pose a and

204
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.120
managing chemicals and,

205
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:01.330
uh,

206
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.670
the management of chemicals is a very tricky business.

207
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:04.504
And that,

208
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.901
that,

209
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:05.061
uh,

210
00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:09.310
it demands a high degree of sensitivity about,

211
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:09.840
uh,

212
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.940
uh,

213
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.730
where chemicals are released to the environment.

214
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.240
Uh,

215
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.140
where do they go?

216
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:14.951
How do they move?

217
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:15.880
Are they persistent?

218
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.481
Uh,

219
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:17.500
where do they end up?

220
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.161
Uh,

221
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:19.570
and how are people exposed?

222
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.770
Uh,

223
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.700
calculating the magnitude of exposure is really fundamental to understanding

224
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.260
what the risk is in most environmental laws are structured to manage chemicals,

225
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.620
uh,

226
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.210
based on this idea of risk.

227
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.640
So to understand the risk and to manage it,

228
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:35.410
you have to understand all of these,

229
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.980
uh,

230
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.100
intermediate issues such as where it was it released,

231
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:39.761
where does it go,

232
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:41.230
how does it get into your environment?

233
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.780
Uh,

234
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.570
and what are the likely health effects?

235
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.490
And the word likely is very important because it implies that we need to be

236
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.080
thinking probabilistically,

237
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.950
uh,

238
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.420
what's the probability of a damage damage occurring down the road,

239
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.130
whether or not it's ecological or,

240
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.520
or human health related,

241
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.330
so that it,

242
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.880
uh,

243
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.250
uh,

244
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.540
we'll be thinking about the different forms of law that I have evolved to try to

245
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.980
deal with this kind of a problem.

246
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.490
Uh,

247
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.260
some set risk only standards,

248
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.240
some are risk benefit balancing,

249
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.380
some or cost benefit balancing and more utilitarian in their structure.

250
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.011
Uh,

251
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:18.920
so what is the right standard to apply for?

252
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.210
Very specific problems.

253
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.321
Uh,

254
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.390
we will then take a look at a variety of,

255
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.640
of the issue areas,

256
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:28.760
including what I think of as industrial agriculture.

257
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.270
Uh,

258
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.090
the majority of our food is highly processed.

259
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.570
Uh,

260
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.280
it is chemically dependent,

261
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.060
uh,

262
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.860
particularly on fertilizers and pesticides and preservatives and dyes and

263
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:40.694
different sorts.

264
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.391
So,

265
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:41.540
uh,

266
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.410
what does that mean?

267
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.130
Uh,

268
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.540
the food packaging industry is,

269
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.030
is increasingly of interest to me in my own research.

270
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.480
Uh,

271
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.650
so I'll share with you,

272
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.040
uh,

273
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.190
uh,

274
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.023
several,

275
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.243
uh,

276
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.380
ideas about Tao plastics make their way into your life.

277
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.731
Right now.

278
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.150
The synthetic chemical industry is dominated by the plastics industry.

279
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:03.890
It constitutes 70% of the synthetic chemical industry in the United States.

280
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.761
In each year,

281
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:09.140
a hundred billion pounds of chemicals are produced and released to the

282
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:11.360
environment and among all plastics,

283
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.100
among those hundred billion pounds,

284
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.060
uh,

285
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.830
only 5% are recycled.

286
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.230
So we are building up a waste stream that is coming back to haunt us.

287
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.860
Uh,

288
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.530
if I took tissue samples from each of you,

289
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.800
probably 95% of you would have a residues of ballet or [inaudible],

290
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.880
which are plasticizers in your body.

291
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.260
And scientists,

292
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:37.970
including Hugh Taylor right here at the Yale medical school is now recognizing

293
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:39.770
that these are very effective chemicals,

294
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.300
that exceptionally low doses,

295
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:46.301
part per trillion doses in sending a signal to cells that estrogen has arrived

296
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.160
or another hormone has arrived,

297
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:49.630
uh,

298
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.720
so that they are triggers or hormonal activity in many different species of

299
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:54.460
animals,

300
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:54.640
uh,

301
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.700
as well as humans.

302
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.930
So what does this mean?

303
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.530
Uh,

304
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.300
in one way it means that we're conducting quite a chemical experiment on

305
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.134
ourselves,

306
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.381
uh,

307
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:04.220
but also,

308
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.391
uh,

309
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:05.660
on future generations.

310
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.640
So what should we be doing about it?

311
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:08.960
How should we be managing,

312
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:09.450
uh,

313
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.680
uh,

314
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.230
the chemical universe is chemical universe,

315
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:13.010
by the way,

316
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.880
in international commerce includes about 80,000 different compounds at present.

317
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.340
Two to 3000 new chemicals are produced and released to the environment each

318
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:22.970
year.

319
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.271
And,

320
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:23.360
uh,

321
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.220
they take many different forms.

322
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:26.260
Pharmaceuticals,

323
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.810
uh,

324
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.980
plasticizers,

325
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.190
a different metal compounds in a millions and millions of different products,

326
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:33.840
uh,

327
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.431
so that,

328
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:34.581
uh,

329
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.490
these chemicals have no mechanism in law,

330
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.780
even in the United States,

331
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.290
uh,

332
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.470
to test what their effect is and what the risk is.

333
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.120
The risk might be too,

334
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:44.240
uh,

335
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.960
either,

336
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.290
uh,

337
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.460
environmental quality or,

338
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:47.480
or to human health.

339
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.500
So what should we do about problems like that?

340
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.210
We'll take a look at air quality law and particularly the concentration of the

341
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:00.300
clean air act on a really very few chemicals.

342
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.880
Uh,

343
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.340
there are six chemicals that became the target of national air quality,

344
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.350
a law and regulation.

345
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.850
This is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and they decide

346
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.460
which chemicals will appear on their radar screen.

347
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.143
They decide,

348
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.800
uh,

349
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.240
what monitoring programs are necessary in order to detect where they go,

350
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:21.931
how they move,

351
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.160
how they behave in the environment,

352
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.660
and how dangerous they are.

353
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.220
Uh,

354
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.820
who might be at risk.

355
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.301
Uh,

356
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.820
one good example of that might be diesel exhaust.

357
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:30.481
And,

358
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:30.591
uh,

359
00:09:30.591 --> 00:09:30.851
you,

360
00:09:30.851 --> 00:09:31.780
you may know that,

361
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:32.050
uh,

362
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.910
the older trucks,

363
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:34.650
the less efficient diesel vehicles,

364
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.281
uh,

365
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:39.210
tends to spew large particulate matter from their,

366
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:39.611
their,

367
00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:39.990
uh,

368
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.823
tailpipes.

369
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.401
And,

370
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:41.820
uh,

371
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.271
this,

372
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:44.220
these larger protect particulate,

373
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.480
uh,

374
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.290
particularly,

375
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.690
uh,

376
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.390
10 microns in size and larger are visible.

377
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.970
It's one of the chemical threats that is visible.

378
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:51.241
It's a,

379
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:53.070
it's one of the easier ones to identify.

380
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:53.781
In fact,

381
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:54.660
with diesel exhaust,

382
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:55.770
you can not only see it,

383
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.250
uh,

384
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.120
you can taste it,

385
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:57.540
uh,

386
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:57.830
you,

387
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.450
you can feel it burning in the back of your throat.

388
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.890
Uh,

389
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.260
so most people understand when they are exposed to diesel exhaust.

390
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.921
Well,

391
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:05.431
one of the,

392
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:05.710
uh,

393
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.850
uh,

394
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.683
interesting,

395
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.200
intensive EPA was to reduce the particle size,

396
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:10.950
uh,

397
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.820
to reduce the,

398
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.110
the larger particles.

399
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.630
And what happened when the engine's became more efficient,

400
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.200
uh,

401
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.820
to accomplish that was they produced more but smaller particles.

402
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.320
So the finer particles,

403
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.000
less than one micron in size,

404
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.170
not thinking that these finer particles can be more deeply inhaled into the

405
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:29.004
lung.

406
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.660
They reside there,

407
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:33.210
they get stuck to the sides of the airways,

408
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.350
particularly in those that have background illnesses such as asthma,

409
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.873
Emphysema,

410
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.170
lung cancer,

411
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.680
uh,

412
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.350
so that these particles don't get expired.

413
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.020
Uh,

414
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.410
so that exposure becomes more persistent.

415
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.021
Uh,

416
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.360
the danger to health is,

417
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:49.194
is increasing.

418
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.770
There's an interesting correlation and I'm not saying that it's a causal

419
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:57.771
relationship and an interesting correlation between the increasing number of

420
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:02.850
these finer particles with rising rates of respiratory illness in the United

421
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.090
States and in different parts of,

422
00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:04.440
of,

423
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.710
uh,

424
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.750
the industrial eyes,

425
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.190
uh,

426
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.080
a world.

427
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.581
So that,

428
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:08.970
uh,

429
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.331
uh,

430
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:10.380
why might that be?

431
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.011
Well,

432
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:12.300
let me give you one analogy.

433
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.290
If you a,

434
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:18.000
if you thought about an aquarium and you fill that aquarium up regardless of its

435
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:20.370
size with softballs and then you,

436
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.520
you calculate the surface area of those softballs,

437
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.480
uh,

438
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.400
and then you took the softballs out and you fill the aquarium up with say peas

439
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.950
and you calculated the surface area of the peace,

440
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.700
uh,

441
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.890
being analogous to the finer particle size,

442
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:35.460
uh,

443
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.370
you'd find a,

444
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.420
a many fold increase in the surface area,

445
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.440
uh,

446
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.191
of the peas.

447
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:44.910
Then you would have the softballs and because the carbon particles that are

448
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:47.970
these core elements of particulates,

449
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:48.541
uh,

450
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.680
because they're sticky,

451
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:55.090
they tend to lock on to a variety of different organic compounds called volatile

452
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:55.990
organic compounds,

453
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:57.670
which are also regulated by EPA.

454
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.601
So that,

455
00:11:58.601 --> 00:11:58.911
uh,

456
00:11:58.911 --> 00:12:03.670
the carbon core becomes the vehicle for bringing a whole array of different

457
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:04.930
chemicals into your lung.

458
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.771
Very,

459
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:07.840
very fine particles in size.

460
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.371
So that,

461
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:09.611
uh,

462
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:10.444
there,

463
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.210
uh,

464
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.070
many times,

465
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:12.590
uh,

466
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.810
the absence of excellent scientific information can lead the government into

467
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:18.280
making decisions that are,

468
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.850
uh,

469
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.260
actually not health protective,

470
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.790
uh,

471
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.330
or environmentally protective.

472
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.951
Uh,

473
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:27.760
so we need to be very conscious about the importance of doing excellent science,

474
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.330
uh,

475
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:28.991
not just,

476
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:29.470
uh,

477
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.340
a science about,

478
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.551
uh,

479
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:32.590
where chemicals move in the environment,

480
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.420
but their effects on human health.

481
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.720
If you went to eps website and you look for the purpose of the Environmental

482
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:40.900
Protection Agency,

483
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.920
the number one purchase purpose that you see on their website is to protect

484
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.970
human health from dangerous elements in the environment.

485
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.260
Uh,

486
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.280
that's kind of curious.

487
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:53.920
Many people think of the environment is not being that,

488
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.900
that closely associated with human health.

489
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.220
Uh,

490
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.490
we'll look at food safety issues and we'll look at the rise of the organic food

491
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:01.300
industry,

492
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.540
which I believe is a very important success story in the 20th century,

493
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:06.430
particularly the result,

494
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.730
uh,

495
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.563
of the,

496
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:07.930
uh,

497
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:08.261
the,

498
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:08.530
uh,

499
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:08.860
uh,

500
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.780
food production act of 1990,

501
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:11.381
uh,

502
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:12.820
although there was a delay in,

503
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.200
in,

504
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:13.361
uh,

505
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:17.530
adopting standards for organic foods until not until the year 2000,

506
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.040
but the organic sector in the food market now is the largest growing of any

507
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:25.930
other sector besides bottle of water.

508
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.320
If you include water in,

509
00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:28.840
in the food industry.

510
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.801
And this is a,

511
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:30.850
this is very interesting.

512
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.990
So the idea of,

513
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.290
of certification of government sponsors certification,

514
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:35.831
uh,

515
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:40.831
as potentially creating new markets for products that are health friendly or

516
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:42.580
environmentally friendly.

517
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.020
Uh,

518
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.640
we'll look at the strengths and weaknesses of the certification scheme.

519
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.221
Uh,

520
00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:48.190
not just related to food,

521
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:49.170
but also to,

522
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.200
to paper and forest products and a variety of other areas,

523
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:53.620
uh,

524
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.240
especially related to buildings.

525
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.660
Uh,

526
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.890
we'll take a look at the history of tobacco regulation and there's a special

527
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:01.870
legal paradigm that applies to tobacco.

528
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:02.501
Uh,

529
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:02.921
but again,

530
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:07.750
it's one of these types of threats to human health and environmental quality.

531
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.530
That was really a very lightly treated,

532
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:14.110
very lightly regulated during the 20th century.

533
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:15.340
And only now are we seeing,

534
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:15.920
uh,

535
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.590
the food and Drug Administration being empowered to take a tighter control over

536
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:22.030
the way that products are marketed.

537
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.940
Uh,

538
00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.940
and we'll take a look at the advertising strategies of tobacco companies and see

539
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:31.720
a variety of similarities to other products such as toys or,

540
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.231
uh,

541
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:35.260
or candy or different kinds of foods,

542
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:35.680
uh,

543
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.513
toward children,

544
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.061
uh,

545
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:37.651
so that,

546
00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:37.901
that,

547
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:38.110
uh,

548
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.940
hooking children early on,

549
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:40.690
uh,

550
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.120
to,

551
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.610
uh,

552
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.443
uh,

553
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.420
try to,

554
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.950
to cultivate their taste,

555
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.400
uh,

556
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.730
toward foods that are high in salt and sugar and fat.

557
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.140
Uh,

558
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.440
there,

559
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.670
there's some very interesting similarities between the way that the tobacco

560
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:56.240
industry was very anxious to encourage the youngest in society,

561
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:56.721
uh,

562
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:59.150
to try tobacco products knowing that exposures,

563
00:14:59.390 --> 00:14:59.690
uh,

564
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.400
for very short periods of time could,

565
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.690
could become addictive.

566
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.490
We'll take a look after a spring break at land use issues,

567
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:11.420
we'll switch from chemical problems and pollution problems to land use issues.

568
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.470
And we'll put,

569
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.470
be a particularly interested in legal strategies for conservation.

570
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.950
Uh,

571
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.431
different,

572
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:19.551
uh,

573
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:23.690
approaches to set aside lands to protect biological diversity,

574
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:24.140
uh,

575
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.430
to protect watersheds,

576
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.861
uh,

577
00:15:25.861 --> 00:15:26.694
in an effort,

578
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:27.890
uh,

579
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.281
to,

580
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:28.780
uh,

581
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:28.970
uh,

582
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.290
improve environmental quality.

583
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.170
We'll look also at wilderness and National Park Law,

584
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:33.711
uh,

585
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:34.071
and a,

586
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:38.870
a variety of other statutes that apply to the u s forest National Forest Lands,

587
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.230
uh,

588
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.460
the bureau of land management.

589
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.710
And we'll also look at conflicts between a land use and development and,

590
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:45.950
uh,

591
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.920
the important value that we,

592
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.980
we hold for private property rights in our society.

593
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:52.801
Uh,

594
00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:55.020
we'll also think about urbanism and sprawl and,

595
00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:55.310
and,

596
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.490
uh,

597
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.040
different smart growth techniques to try to control,

598
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:58.790
uh,

599
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.201
the,

600
00:15:59.201 --> 00:15:59.601
the,

601
00:15:59.601 --> 00:15:59.960
uh,

602
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.170
uh,

603
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.100
rate of development,

604
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.670
uh,

605
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.090
in,

606
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.320
in suburban areas.

607
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:03.950
Uh,

608
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.650
we'll also look at the idea of environmental justice,

609
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:11.480
which really grows from a recognition of different groups,

610
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.530
different areas,

611
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.603
uh,

612
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.553
uh,

613
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.500
uh,

614
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.740
receiving or being exposed at a higher level to,

615
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.990
to either chemicals or,

616
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:21.350
or,

617
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.830
uh,

618
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:22.340
uh,

619
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.320
different kinds of environmental insults.

620
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.041
Uh,

621
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:25.581
so that,

622
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:25.791
uh,

623
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:26.061
we'll,

624
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:30.440
we'll run through a variety of cases where groups claim that they are more

625
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:30.981
exposed,

626
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:32.570
more at risk than others.

627
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.440
They're bearing a disproportionate burden of,

628
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.980
of harm or threat.

629
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:37.840
Uh,

630
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.510
and we'll also look at the rising interest,

631
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:41.991
uh,

632
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:45.170
and rising incorporation of Leed certification,

633
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.620
uh,

634
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.710
into us a national and state law.

635
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.200
So buildings are certified now to,

636
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:51.680
uh,

637
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.011
to,

638
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:52.300
uh,

639
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.870
be green at different levels.

640
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.350
Uh,

641
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.780
the school of Forestry and environmental studies building,

642
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:57.650
the new crew building,

643
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.484
for example,

644
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.940
uh,

645
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.910
is applying for the highest level of Leed certification.

646
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:02.870
It's called platinum.

647
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:03.800
Uh,

648
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.261
so we'll,

649
00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:07.430
we'll look at the evolution of that certification scheme.

650
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.720
And A,

651
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.550
I'll be actually quite critical of,

652
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:11.600
of,

653
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:11.750
uh,

654
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.610
the scheme and the way that the standards are being adopted by different

655
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:17.430
governments,

656
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:17.750
uh,

657
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.890
that become the foundation for the allocation of property tax breaks.

658
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:22.400
Uh,

659
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.900
but also direct subsidies,

660
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.310
uh,

661
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:25.671
from,

662
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:25.900
uh,

663
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.330
uh,

664
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:26.661
uh,

665
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:28.850
both the federal government and state governments.

666
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.631
Uh,

667
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:31.970
we'll take a look then near the end of the term at,

668
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.420
at,

669
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:32.780
uh,

670
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.150
past the past and future of nuclear power,

671
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:35.841
uh,

672
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:39.680
and the statutes and regulations that surround a nuclear power,

673
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.890
particularly the statutes that provided a really large subsidies when compared

674
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.960
to subsidies allocated to renewable energy sources.

675
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:48.531
Uh,

676
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:52.770
we'll take a look at a variety of different emissions trading schemes and a

677
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.360
renewable energy policies,

678
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:54.860
uh,

679
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.980
and then end the course with way reflection across these different cases about

680
00:17:58.981 --> 00:17:59.814
what we've learned.

681
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.440
So that's the game plan.

682
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.700
And I wanted to spend just a couple minutes talking about course requirements.

683
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.601
Uh,

684
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:09.840
the course is structured to have a final examination,

685
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.411
uh,

686
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:12.000
with 40% of your grade,

687
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:12.600
uh,

688
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.433
but also,

689
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.273
uh,

690
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.620
there is a paper or midterm auction,

691
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.401
uh,

692
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:19.590
that would constitute 50% of your grade.

693
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.360
And then a discussion section will be held each week for 50 minutes.

694
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.930
So everybody will need to sign up for discussion section and that would be worth

695
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:28.950
10% of your grade.

696
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.420
I'll talk more as we move through the term about the term paper option.

697
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.200
Uh,

698
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.790
there are four books that have been ordered.

699
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.631
A and a,

700
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:40.590
I believe are all in if there was one that was shipped yesterday and should be

701
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:41.430
in this afternoon.

702
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.710
David Kessler is a question of intent,

703
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.720
which provides a,

704
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.980
a really wonderful review of the history of tobacco law and regulation.

705
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:50.610
Uh,

706
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:51.610
Michael Poland,

707
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.070
the Omnivore's dilemma.

708
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.420
A good part of my career has been spent thinking about food quality and food

709
00:18:57.421 --> 00:18:58.254
safety.

710
00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:58.531
Uh,

711
00:18:58.531 --> 00:18:59.640
so we'll,

712
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:00.790
we'll take a look at,

713
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.200
at,

714
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.680
uh,

715
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.520
Poland's work,

716
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.420
uh,

717
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.231
will read Dell.

718
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:08.670
So a book that I published just a few months ago called green intelligence,

719
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.150
uh,

720
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.730
that we'll run through a variety of these cases that,

721
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.151
that,

722
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:12.690
uh,

723
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:13.051
uh,

724
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:13.680
we'll,

725
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.290
we'll examine during the class and then we will take a look at,

726
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.930
uh,

727
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:18.180
uh,

728
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.300
Weinberg and Riley's book called Understanding Environmental Law.

729
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:22.911
So,

730
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:23.281
of course,

731
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:23.911
themes that,

732
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:24.150
uh,

733
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.920
I intend to draw through.

734
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:30.210
These cases include those that are on the back of page two are,

735
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.890
are the bottom of page two.

736
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.933
Uh,

737
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.060
how is law related to science and uncertainty?

738
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:36.780
Uh,

739
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.480
what causes environmental damage and health loss?

740
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.141
Uh,

741
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:42.510
where should the burden of proof of causality lie,

742
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:43.130
uh,

743
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.220
on the public sector,

744
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:44.690
uh,

745
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:45.870
or on the private sector,

746
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.920
on the individual?

747
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:47.641
Uh,

748
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:48.181
so that,

749
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:48.361
uh,

750
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:49.194
understanding,

751
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:49.681
uh,

752
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:52.650
the idea of burden of proof is a fundamental aspect of,

753
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.420
of understanding environmental law.

754
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.080
Uh,

755
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.860
we'll also take a look at the importance of secrecy,

756
00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.490
uh,

757
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.120
and the control over information or knowledge.

758
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:03.930
Uh,

759
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.830
so I think of this as being a really a,

760
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:08.230
a,

761
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.431
a,

762
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:12.630
an analogy between the public sector and the private sector and the private

763
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.350
sector.

764
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.420
A secrecy is a very important component,

765
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.990
uh,

766
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.570
in that trade secrecy protects,

767
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:18.920
uh,

768
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.680
companies,

769
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:19.980
uh,

770
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.670
understanding of product ingredients or perhaps how it's,

771
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.180
uh,

772
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.030
uh,

773
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.410
processed or produced a or shipped a,

774
00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:31.680
whereas classified information in the public sector,

775
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.430
uh,

776
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.920
protects sensitive information.

777
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.481
In both cases.

778
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:41.220
The idea is to protect competitive advantage either in international affairs or

779
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:42.150
in the marketplace.

780
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.190
So we'll see how that plays out in,

781
00:20:44.191 --> 00:20:45.570
in many of these cases.

782
00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.130
We'll also think about,

783
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.301
uh,

784
00:20:47.301 --> 00:20:52.301
the principle of democracy and how participation rates vary depending upon which

785
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:52.830
law we're,

786
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:53.663
we're looking at.

787
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.580
Uh,

788
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.380
and as participation rights expand,

789
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.510
decision making becomes more complicated.

790
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.950
And what that means is that it often slows down and it's,

791
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:03.940
it's harder to,

792
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.571
uh,

793
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:07.120
it's harder to reach a mission of,

794
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.800
of improved environmental quality.

795
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:09.741
Uh,

796
00:21:09.741 --> 00:21:11.080
we'll look at property rights,

797
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:11.771
uh,

798
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:12.131
and,

799
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:12.490
uh,

800
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:12.710
uh,

801
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.370
rights in law or an essential component,

802
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.850
uh,

803
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.090
but also obligations are an essential component.

804
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.080
So I,

805
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.130
I think about law,

806
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:21.881
I think about,

807
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:22.450
uh,

808
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:22.720
uh,

809
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.100
how rights are specified,

810
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.960
how obligations are specified.

811
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.411
You know,

812
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.840
what are the sanctions applied for for deviance,

813
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.311
uh,

814
00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:32.830
and where does the perception of legitimacy for that law come from?

815
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.790
So we'll be asking those set of questions for each you the laws that we review.

816
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.590
We'll take a look too at the principles of equality and justice,

817
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.311
uh,

818
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:42.581
and,

819
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:42.941
and,

820
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:43.480
uh,

821
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:43.840
uh,

822
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.070
spend a lot of attention.

823
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:45.760
Uh,

824
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.760
looking at a disproportionate allocation of burdens or damages or pollution,

825
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.030
uh,

826
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.660
were,

827
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.070
uh,

828
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.440
uh,

829
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.300
dangerous facilities are located.

830
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.540
I will also take a look at the idea of risk and precaution.

831
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.550
So what is acceptable risk,

832
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:00.970
uh,

833
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.140
once it's calculated,

834
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.920
uh,

835
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.750
how do you determine what is acceptable?

836
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.760
If you look across the laws,

837
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.510
uh,

838
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.760
uh,

839
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.830
the different statutes have very different definitions of what acceptable risk

840
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:12.610
is.

841
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.000
Uh,

842
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.490
we'll also think a lot about the idea of precautionary law as opposed to UTA

843
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.730
utilitarian law.

844
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.330
Uh,

845
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.330
so law that builds in safety margins or buffer zones to protect against a

846
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.740
miscalculations of risk.

847
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.730
Uh,

848
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.300
we did not do that when we built nuclear power plants and we've had several

849
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.680
severe accidents in the world,

850
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.380
and those notably Chernobyl that we'll take a look at.

851
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.100
Uh,

852
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.990
when we look at the nuclear power plant case,

853
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:38.770
uh,

854
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.281
so that,

855
00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:39.490
uh,

856
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:40.210
thinking about,

857
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:40.331
uh,

858
00:22:40.331 --> 00:22:45.331
when should the government be allowed to balance risks or costs against benefits

859
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.980
and when should a fixed standard of allowable risk a drive a decision.

860
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.510
Those are very difficult questions.

861
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.150
So that said,

862
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.481
uh,

863
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:57.810
I'd like to just briefly run through some of,

864
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.071
uh,

865
00:22:58.071 --> 00:23:00.880
a set of slides here that I think are,

866
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:01.860
uh,

867
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.340
uh,

868
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.140
reflective of the material that we'll be reviewing.

869
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.480
And I wanted to start with this image,

870
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.520
the set of images from Thomas Cole,

871
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.480
a a well known landscape artists from the 19th century,

872
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.090
one of the Hudson River school painters.

873
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:16.631
Uh,

874
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:18.670
just to give you a sense of where I came from,

875
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.340
uh,

876
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.630
my background as an undergraduate was in history.

877
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.240
I had a fascination for English literature,

878
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:25.571
but,

879
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:25.711
uh,

880
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:27.070
also the history of art,

881
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:27.640
uh,

882
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.980
but a very specialized form of art,

883
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:34.090
which was a 19th and early 20th century landscape art.

884
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:39.160
And I was always fascinated by this series called the course of Empire by Thomas

885
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.640
Cole.

886
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.120
Uh,

887
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.911
and in the,

888
00:23:40.911 --> 00:23:42.880
in the very first painting on the lower left,

889
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.460
you see what's thought of as the savage state and,

890
00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:46.910
uh,

891
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.090
uh,

892
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.190
this is Thomas Kohl's,

893
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.100
a obvious interpretation of the evolution of civilization.

894
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:52.971
Uh,

895
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:54.110
so the savage state,

896
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:54.500
uh,

897
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.333
is wild.

898
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:55.921
Uh,

899
00:23:55.921 --> 00:23:56.754
it's hostile.

900
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.261
Uh,

901
00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:00.310
I think of it in a way as being a wild lands.

902
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.860
And I've always had a strong fascination for wild lands,

903
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:04.670
uh,

904
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:09.670
when I was a child and my dad always took me camping or hiking up in the white

905
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:10.670
mountains in New Hampshire,

906
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:12.770
or the Adirondacks are up in,

907
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:12.981
uh,

908
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:13.814
up in Vermont.

909
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.023
And I always,

910
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.500
I,

911
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.740
it really caused me to,

912
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.603
to have a,

913
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.130
not just a fascination with it,

914
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:19.431
but,

915
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:19.640
uh,

916
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.840
also a love of it.

917
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.980
Thinking about,

918
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.280
uh,

919
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.850
how society might move from the savage or the wild state,

920
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.120
uh,

921
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.870
to,

922
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.260
uh,

923
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.120
the pastoral or the Arcadian state,

924
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:29.840
uh,

925
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.673
is,

926
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:31.850
is well depicted,

927
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.420
uh,

928
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:32.661
in,

929
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:33.021
in,

930
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:33.350
uh,

931
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:34.183
in this painting.

932
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.620
And many people,

933
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:36.740
uh,

934
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.220
when they're,

935
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.260
they're showing a variety of different landscapes,

936
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:39.940
uh,

937
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:40.350
and,

938
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:40.731
and,

939
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:41.230
uh,

940
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.870
uh,

941
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:42.371
if the,

942
00:24:42.371 --> 00:24:44.030
the landscape's very between the,

943
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.073
uh,

944
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.890
highly dense urban environment all the way to the wild environment.

945
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:49.411
Uh,

946
00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:50.030
they,

947
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:50.360
uh,

948
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.710
they prefer the pastoral,

949
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.311
uh,

950
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:53.600
the agrarian,

951
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.020
uh,

952
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.853
landscape.

953
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.401
Uh,

954
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:57.180
the consummation of empire is the,

955
00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:58.014
the,

956
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.440
uh,

957
00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:58.740
the,

958
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.430
the next slide in the series a,

959
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:01.781
the,

960
00:25:01.781 --> 00:25:02.660
the urban setting.

961
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:03.240
Uh,

962
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.410
and,

963
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:03.851
and,

964
00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:04.100
uh,

965
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.050
I also have had a fascination with,

966
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.310
with urban areas,

967
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.040
uh,

968
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.980
and have lived in Philadelphia.

969
00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:10.970
I've lived in new haven.

970
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.470
I've lived in San Paulo,

971
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:13.131
in Brazil,

972
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:14.270
and in San Francisco,

973
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.050
uh,

974
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.970
and eventually settled here in Connecticut.

975
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.870
Uh,

976
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.201
but,

977
00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:18.710
uh,

978
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.180
it's this juxtaposition that,

979
00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:20.410
uh,

980
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:20.710
uh,

981
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.550
I find so interesting,

982
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.150
uh,

983
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.720
love for the wild as well as a love for a vibrant urban core.

984
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:27.620
Um,

985
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:27.951
and,

986
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:28.071
uh,

987
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:32.140
what happens in between in terms of suburban sprawl will become a central to,

988
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.190
to several of the cases that we look at.

989
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.400
Coal then went on to think about,

990
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.200
well,

991
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.580
what happens if,

992
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:41.780
if markets are completely unregulated,

993
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.590
uh,

994
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.640
destruction damage.

995
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:47.870
So we'll spend a good amount of time thinking about how to predict damage and

996
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:51.290
how important this is and the structure of environmental standards.

997
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.730
And then desolation.

998
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.660
And many today had this image of desolation a hundred,

999
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:58.070
200 years down the road,

1000
00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:58.490
uh,

1001
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.800
in response to a global climate change.

1002
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.260
So really,

1003
00:26:02.261 --> 00:26:02.560
uh,

1004
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:02.990
uh,

1005
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.550
this,

1006
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:08.450
this set of paintings a structured my thinking in a variety of different ways.

1007
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:09.291
Uh,

1008
00:26:09.291 --> 00:26:12.740
it made me wonder about what the potential of law is.

1009
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:13.580
Uh,

1010
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.580
what capacity do we have to understand serious threats to the environment and to

1011
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.503
human health?

1012
00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:20.781
Uh,

1013
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:22.700
particularly over long periods of time.

1014
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.451
Uh,

1015
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:25.400
what demands on science does that make?

1016
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.770
And how can we use law to effectively reshape human behavior in a way that would

1017
00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:31.700
be more sensitive,

1018
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.361
uh,

1019
00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:32.891
that would,

1020
00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:33.060
uh,

1021
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:33.950
ensure that,

1022
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:34.190
uh,

1023
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.320
when we have 12 billion people in the world,

1024
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:36.740
uh,

1025
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.660
that we will have adequate food supplies,

1026
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.280
we will have sufficient water.

1027
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.611
Uh,

1028
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:42.290
it will be equitably distributed.

1029
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.861
Uh,

1030
00:26:42.861 --> 00:26:45.540
we will have clean air and children,

1031
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.980
grandchildren,

1032
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.690
future generations.

1033
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.321
Uh,

1034
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:50.130
we'll have,

1035
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:50.461
uh,

1036
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:51.680
an environment that a,

1037
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.740
they can be proud of.

1038
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.550
I'm certainly not proud of the environment that my generation is leading to your

1039
00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:57.384
generation.

1040
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.560
And that really is a,

1041
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:01.140
that's the reason that I'm standing here in front of you today.

1042
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:01.921
Uh,

1043
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:03.900
I've decided to in my career that,

1044
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:04.470
uh,

1045
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.890
uh,

1046
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.161
you know,

1047
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:08.190
rather than working for government rather than working in the private sector,

1048
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.701
uh,

1049
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:10.680
that I would spend my life,

1050
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.430
uh,

1051
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.980
the bulk of my career training of future leaders,

1052
00:27:13.981 --> 00:27:16.320
whether or not you move on into the public sector,

1053
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:17.160
the private sector,

1054
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.210
nonprofit world,

1055
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.870
uh,

1056
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.470
to think I hope differently about a environmental quality and,

1057
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.370
and how you might,

1058
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.660
how you might shape it.

1059
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.290
So the central questions here that we'll be looking at,

1060
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.810
what's our capacity to manage environmental quality?

1061
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:31.381
Uh,

1062
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:35.700
what role has and could law play in determining the future of environmental

1063
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:36.500
quality,

1064
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:36.720
uh,

1065
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.920
and what's worked well,

1066
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.020
what's failed and why?

1067
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.240
If we can't answer these questions,

1068
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.710
uh,

1069
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.461
I would,

1070
00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:43.800
uh,

1071
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.520
uh,

1072
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.630
hazard to say that,

1073
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.261
that,

1074
00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:46.531
uh,

1075
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:50.520
we don't have much hope of making a dent in the kinds of problems that we'll be

1076
00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:52.590
facing over the next century.

1077
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.160
So the problem is considered in the course national security land use,

1078
00:27:56.161 --> 00:27:56.911
food safety,

1079
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:57.744
plastics,

1080
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.471
green building,

1081
00:27:58.471 --> 00:27:59.131
pesticides,

1082
00:27:59.131 --> 00:27:59.791
air pollution,

1083
00:27:59.791 --> 00:28:00.624
tobacco,

1084
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.590
wildlands,

1085
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.371
national parks,

1086
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:03.270
coastal development,

1087
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.920
conservation policies,

1088
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.270
urban and suburban growth,

1089
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.201
transport,

1090
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:08.760
energy and drinking water.

1091
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.630
In my mind what's worked well and why?

1092
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.710
Well,

1093
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.260
the nuclear weapons history I think is quite fascinating.

1094
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:19.920
There's some wonderful lessons there about how we used a state of the art

1095
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:22.050
science in the 1950s,

1096
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:22.530
uh,

1097
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.290
to recognize a serious threat to human health and how we intervened and,

1098
00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:27.661
and,

1099
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:27.751
uh,

1100
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:28.584
eventually,

1101
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.130
uh,

1102
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.570
how John F.

1103
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.240
Kennedy decided to ban the use of,

1104
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:33.990
uh,

1105
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.990
the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere that was resulting in strontium

1106
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:39.360
90.

1107
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.193
And the bones,

1108
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.770
uh,

1109
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.940
at high concentrations,

1110
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:43.350
particularly among the youngest,

1111
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:43.861
uh,

1112
00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:48.861
the children population control has been a success compared to the projections

1113
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:53.310
of the 1970s by Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon and others.

1114
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.230
It's quite striking,

1115
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:55.831
uh,

1116
00:28:55.831 --> 00:28:56.371
that the,

1117
00:28:56.371 --> 00:28:56.791
the,

1118
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:57.170
uh,

1119
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.220
a geometric progression projections,

1120
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.610
uh,

1121
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.900
have diminished substantially,

1122
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.860
uh,

1123
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.930
particularly in developing parts of the world.

1124
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.500
Uh,

1125
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.810
the phase out of chlorinated hydrocarbons,

1126
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.990
including DDT and Alderman and chlordane and Dieldrin have to Clore back in the

1127
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.800
1970s,

1128
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:14.520
uh,

1129
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.580
these became one of the very first targets of the environmental protection

1130
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:18.390
agency.

1131
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.610
And because they are fat loving,

1132
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:21.540
there are Lipophilic,

1133
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.280
they persisted.

1134
00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:24.630
They move through the food chain.

1135
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.291
Uh,

1136
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:26.600
they moved into a,

1137
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.600
into our bodies.

1138
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.171
Uh,

1139
00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:29.020
and uh,

1140
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.760
you and I are still carrying around residues and many of these chlorinated

1141
00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:33.594
hydrocarbons,

1142
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:33.960
uh,

1143
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.110
your concentrations are lower than mine are a,

1144
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:41.850
but your concentration is predominantly came from your mother via breastmilk.

1145
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:42.370
Uh,

1146
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:42.971
that's the,

1147
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:43.140
uh,

1148
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:43.291
the,

1149
00:29:43.291 --> 00:29:47.470
the mechanism of transfer across generations for some of these compounds.

1150
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.150
Uh,

1151
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.530
so phasing them out was a very important thing to do.

1152
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.950
Lead in gasoline and paint a were phased out as well.

1153
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.680
Chlorinated fluorocarbons,

1154
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:57.490
uh,

1155
00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.290
that were,

1156
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:58.690
uh,

1157
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:03.690
and are responsible for diminishing the ozone layer that exists in the upper

1158
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:05.224
stratosphere.

1159
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.800
Uh,

1160
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.371
so that,

1161
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:06.740
uh,

1162
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:06.910
uh,

1163
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.890
reducing CFCs and similar ozone Goblin compounds has been a success story.

1164
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.430
Uh,

1165
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.980
at least at the rate of loss has been stabilized.

1166
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.880
Poly chlorinated by fenal reduction.

1167
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:23.881
These are chemicals originally thought to be beneficial because they acted as a,

1168
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.380
a refrigerant and flame retardant for electronic,

1169
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:29.960
uh,

1170
00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.800
uh,

1171
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.330
technologies such as electrical transformers.

1172
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:39.690
So that that phasing out PCBs that were building up in the tissues of wildlife,

1173
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.150
a particularly large mammals as well as birds,

1174
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:43.590
uh,

1175
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.540
and also in human tissues has been a very important success story.

1176
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:47.110
Uh,

1177
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.410
recognizing the threat of as best bestest and producing a very rare form of

1178
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:52.350
cancer called Ma Measle Thilia Oma,

1179
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.050
uh,

1180
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.940
was a very important step as well as the increasing restriction on tobacco,

1181
00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:58.661
uh,

1182
00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:01.950
so that we're seeing a decline in,

1183
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.853
uh,

1184
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:03.780
uh,

1185
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.380
some forms of lung cancer,

1186
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:05.700
uh,

1187
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.870
in response to the tobacco restrictions.

1188
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:13.170
And we're also seeing very interesting declines and the rate of addiction in

1189
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.350
those parts of the country,

1190
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:14.800
uh,

1191
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.600
where advertising has been most heavily restricted and a public service

1192
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:22.720
campaigns had been mounted to a warn people about,

1193
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.250
about the dangers of tobacco.

1194
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.120
Uh,

1195
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.360
we've also made some great strides in the area of food safety,

1196
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:29.194
particularly,

1197
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.680
uh,

1198
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.070
in,

1199
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.940
in terms of reducing microbial contamination and also the,

1200
00:31:33.941 --> 00:31:34.360
uh,

1201
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:34.820
uh,

1202
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.830
the stellar success story about the rise of organic food.

1203
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:39.390
Uh,

1204
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.140
I think is,

1205
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.540
is something to take note of and to learn from.

1206
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:44.471
Uh,

1207
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:46.360
so what are the most persistent problems?

1208
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.340
The ones that have been hardest to deal with,

1209
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:48.750
uh,

1210
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.950
and why fossil fuel consumption,

1211
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:51.490
uh,

1212
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.110
renewable energy innovation in part to,

1213
00:31:54.111 --> 00:31:56.530
due to our lack of subsidies,

1214
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.010
uh,

1215
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:57.970
relative to,

1216
00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.120
to subsidizing fossil fuels as well as nuclear power,

1217
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.100
a radioactive materials,

1218
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.840
the concentration of,

1219
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:06.430
of radioactive materials,

1220
00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:06.970
uh,

1221
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.910
particularly for the production of weapons,

1222
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.570
has created some of the most hazardous sites in the world.

1223
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.171
So,

1224
00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:14.651
Hanford,

1225
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:15.484
Washington,

1226
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.560
uh,

1227
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:21.570
the Hanford works in Washington as well as the Oak Ridge laboratory or a Savanna

1228
00:32:22.511 --> 00:32:23.860
river in Georgia.

1229
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.230
These are seriously contaminated sites.

1230
00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.490
A waste management has also been a persistent problem.

1231
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.950
Our recycling efforts of clearly failed us.

1232
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.970
Most people don't know the difference between a plastic that is stamped with a

1233
00:32:36.971 --> 00:32:39.830
number six and a plastic that is stamped with a three.

1234
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.461
And,

1235
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:41.010
uh,

1236
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:41.341
uh,

1237
00:32:41.341 --> 00:32:42.021
I'll be,

1238
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:42.410
uh,

1239
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:42.741
in fact,

1240
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:42.951
I'll,

1241
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:43.430
I'll,

1242
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.821
I'll,

1243
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:44.330
uh,

1244
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:48.140
challenge you right now to go through one week of this term without buying any

1245
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:48.974
plastic,

1246
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.490
uh,

1247
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.851
and,

1248
00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:50.110
uh,

1249
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.120
if anybody is capable of doing that by the end of the term,

1250
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.080
um,

1251
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.610
I will take you out for lunch.

1252
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.241
Uh,

1253
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:56.750
I've,

1254
00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.030
I've made that offer for the past five years and,

1255
00:33:00.031 --> 00:33:00.380
uh,

1256
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.090
I've not spent one dime on lunch.

1257
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.103
Uh,

1258
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.980
uh,

1259
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.813
as a result,

1260
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:11.090
transport to a personal transport as opposed to a public transit facilities is a

1261
00:33:11.091 --> 00:33:12.740
persistent and growing problem.

1262
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.371
Uh,

1263
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:17.150
we now have one vehicle in the United States for every person who is eligible to

1264
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:17.960
drive.

1265
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.690
That's nearly 250 million vehicles.

1266
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.590
We have more vehicles per capita in the United States than any other place in

1267
00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:25.424
the world.

1268
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.910
And we ma,

1269
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.760
we drive more miles per person than any place in the world.

1270
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.421
Uh,

1271
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:29.930
the,

1272
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:30.321
the,

1273
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:30.530
uh,

1274
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.890
failure to develop public transit facilities is quite striking,

1275
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:34.750
uh,

1276
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.080
parks and protected areas.

1277
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.460
And we are not protecting areas the way that we were back in the 1970s in the

1278
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:41.294
1980s.

1279
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.950
So why are we slowed down?

1280
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.300
Why was the government,

1281
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.020
uh,

1282
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.290
in the process of acquiring lands in the 1960s,

1283
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:49.280
70s and 80s,

1284
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.940
uh,

1285
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.360
and,

1286
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:50.600
uh,

1287
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.600
building parks and building large corridors for wildlife to conserve biological

1288
00:33:55.851 --> 00:33:56.331
diversity,

1289
00:33:56.331 --> 00:33:59.390
but also to provide widescale recreational opportunities.

1290
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:04.340
So why of the why of land acquisition efforts been installed?

1291
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:05.390
Uh,

1292
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.920
biological diversity loss,

1293
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:07.350
uh,

1294
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:12.350
is also growing in part because of the chemical threats that I described earlier

1295
00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:13.514
in the lecture.

1296
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.560
There are nearly 450 million acres of the United StatesStates' landscape that

1297
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:20.840
are routinely sprayed by biocides,

1298
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:21.973
pesticides,

1299
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:22.420
uh,

1300
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.110
of one sort or another.

1301
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.640
There are a thousand different biocides that are each licensed independently.

1302
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.600
Uh,

1303
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.950
so at that scale,

1304
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:31.580
uh,

1305
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:36.140
how could we not think that we would be threatening different species?

1306
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.521
Also,

1307
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:38.354
agriculture,

1308
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:38.750
uh,

1309
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.230
one of the great drivers of loss of biological diversity in the world is

1310
00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:43.340
agricultural development.

1311
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.080
Uh,

1312
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.370
and you can see this in the Amazon,

1313
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.060
uh,

1314
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.170
where tropical rain forests that are some of the richest and most biologically

1315
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:56.171
diverse ecosystems in the world are being ripped up and planted with soybeans,

1316
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:57.200
uh,

1317
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.110
for either food or fuel production.

1318
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.731
So we'll,

1319
00:35:01.731 --> 00:35:02.600
we'll take a look at,

1320
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:02.810
uh,

1321
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.120
some of the key drivers behind biodiversity loss,

1322
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.430
a marine species exploitation.

1323
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.320
Uh,

1324
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:08.571
we'll,

1325
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:12.950
we'll take a look at the decline of a variety of commercial fish.

1326
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.761
Uh,

1327
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:15.130
we'll also be taking a look at,

1328
00:35:15.131 --> 00:35:15.370
uh,

1329
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.070
the,

1330
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:16.371
the,

1331
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:16.760
uh,

1332
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.990
tendency about large,

1333
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.760
the tendency of large predatory fish to absorb mercury.

1334
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.270
Uh,

1335
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.700
so mercury is emitted from power plants.

1336
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.800
It's also emitted from incinerators.

1337
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.870
It goes into global circulation,

1338
00:35:29.871 --> 00:35:31.900
just like a DVT would.

1339
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.090
It also rains down on the earth,

1340
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:35.640
uh,

1341
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.980
and it bioaccumulates,

1342
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.410
uh,

1343
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.000
in large predatory fish,

1344
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:39.660
uh,

1345
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.670
by the end of the term you'll understand which fish,

1346
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:42.100
uh,

1347
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.950
are safe and which are not and why.

1348
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:45.620
And,

1349
00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:45.810
uh,

1350
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.250
you'll also questioned the,

1351
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:47.341
uh,

1352
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:49.050
the Bush administration's decision,

1353
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:49.740
uh,

1354
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.610
to lighten the regulation on mercury emissions,

1355
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.160
uh,

1356
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.720
and how dangerous that,

1357
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:55.250
uh,

1358
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.530
uh,

1359
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.363
has become,

1360
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.780
particularly for the youngest.

1361
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:00.600
And Society will take a look at indoor air quality.

1362
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.070
And a one aspect of,

1363
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:02.460
of,

1364
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:02.950
uh,

1365
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:03.150
uh,

1366
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.380
this issue that I'm quite,

1367
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.100
uh,

1368
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.690
quite interested in is,

1369
00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:07.950
uh,

1370
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.950
the environmental protection agency spends probably 95 to 98% of its time and

1371
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:14.280
budget.

1372
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.520
Thinking about the environment as being the outdoor environment,

1373
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.390
whereas we in the United States now spend on average,

1374
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.880
more than 90% of our time indoors.

1375
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.253
And as somebody that,

1376
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:26.010
uh,

1377
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:26.870
is a dad and,

1378
00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:29.400
and cares about the future of,

1379
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.530
of the environment and human health,

1380
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:31.990
uh,

1381
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.180
that,

1382
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.240
that's got me worried.

1383
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.720
People are spending less time outside,

1384
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.140
uh,

1385
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.060
there experiencing nature,

1386
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:39.600
uh,

1387
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.990
at a lower rate than ever before.

1388
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:43.470
Uh,

1389
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.990
they are spending more time in front of computers,

1390
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.060
in indoor environments than ever before.

1391
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:48.750
Uh,

1392
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.750
and EPA does not do much to regulate the environmental quality of indoor

1393
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:54.714
environments.

1394
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.410
Uh,

1395
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.390
so the,

1396
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.530
the reasons for that are,

1397
00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:57.871
are,

1398
00:36:57.871 --> 00:36:58.260
uh,

1399
00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.590
uh,

1400
00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.340
sometimes,

1401
00:36:59.340 --> 00:36:59.660
uh,

1402
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:04.660
obvious and sometimes not a one clearly is a respect for privacy and private

1403
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:07.134
property rights,

1404
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.920
uh,

1405
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.480
but it means that that,

1406
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:09.750
uh,

1407
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.470
anybody is allowed to carry a chemicals into the indoor environment,

1408
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:18.471
including cleansers or pesticides or plastics that can get into their bodies.

1409
00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:19.361
Uh,

1410
00:37:19.361 --> 00:37:22.590
and there is basically no regulation to prevent that,

1411
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:24.380
a hazardous sites.

1412
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.661
The,

1413
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:24.801
uh,

1414
00:37:24.801 --> 00:37:25.021
the,

1415
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:29.250
the number of hazardous sites now in the United States is,

1416
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:29.641
is,

1417
00:37:29.641 --> 00:37:29.910
uh,

1418
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.790
more than 350,000 on EPA list.

1419
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.500
There are 50,000 different hazardous sites that have been severely contaminated,

1420
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.021
uh,

1421
00:37:38.021 --> 00:37:39.480
that are under the jurisdiction,

1422
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.510
meaning the responsibility of the Department of Defense,

1423
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.010
the Department of Energy,

1424
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.500
and the Department of the interior.

1425
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.630
There are 340,000 sites that are owned in the private sector that had been

1426
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:54.000
classified by EPA as hazardous.

1427
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.850
So the rate of cleanup of these sites,

1428
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:57.510
uh,

1429
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.100
is,

1430
00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.570
is not even a 1% of,

1431
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:00.960
uh,

1432
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.750
the rate of discovery of new hazardous sites.

1433
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.370
So this problem,

1434
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:05.611
uh,

1435
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:05.850
uh,

1436
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.660
basically,

1437
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.050
uh,

1438
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.380
disregarding the chemical abuse of the landscape,

1439
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:10.920
uh,

1440
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.920
feeling comfortable to throw a chemical mixtures out out the back door,

1441
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.221
uh,

1442
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:20.540
without concern for their persistence and movement.

1443
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.980
Uh,

1444
00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.010
this is something that a,

1445
00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.730
your generation will have to deal with.

1446
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.400
A product labeling will also be a subject that we'll take on.

1447
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.300
Uh,

1448
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.350
basically if,

1449
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.350
if you look carefully at product labels,

1450
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:34.810
uh,

1451
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.810
you'll claims of product effectiveness,

1452
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:38.973
uh,

1453
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:39.851
product,

1454
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:40.420
uh,

1455
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:40.631
uh,

1456
00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:42.550
appeal a associated with,

1457
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:42.970
with,

1458
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:43.540
uh,

1459
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.440
color or,

1460
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.060
or a functionality,

1461
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:46.630
uh,

1462
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.990
you will not see much in the way of claims or,

1463
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:50.250
uh,

1464
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:50.710
uh,

1465
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.740
a demonstration of hazard or,

1466
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.170
or guidance about how you might manage the hazards.

1467
00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:56.950
Uh,

1468
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.510
so that,

1469
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.640
uh,

1470
00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.330
product labeling could be an effective way of conveying information to the

1471
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:05.980
public to inform consumers to make choices that are more responsible.

1472
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.120
So how should we adjust product labeling law in a way that makes sense?

1473
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:14.440
I asked this question with respect to pesticides several years ago and found

1474
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:15.400
something quite interesting.

1475
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.230
You look at a pesticide bag,

1476
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:18.064
for example,

1477
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.830
a fertilizer bag in a,

1478
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.080
say a home depot,

1479
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.070
a you'll see the green lawn with the children playing on the lawn in bright

1480
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:31.050
colors on the front of the bag and in the back of the bag and in print that,

1481
00:39:31.051 --> 00:39:31.310
uh,

1482
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.530
maybe a eight point,

1483
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:37.150
it may be six point in size print that I have to take my glasses off and get

1484
00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:38.650
very close to you to be able to read.

1485
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.280
The warnings are elead,

1486
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.183
illegible,

1487
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:42.730
uh,

1488
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.090
and unintelligible to a very large proportion of society.

1489
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.350
And there are some 12% of the u s population,

1490
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.880
not an insignificant number in a population of 350,

1491
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.930
310 million people.

1492
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.510
So 10%,

1493
00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.050
uh,

1494
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:04.050
that have no capacity to read type that is less than a 10 point and fun.

1495
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.800
That means that those warning labels could never be effective for that

1496
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:09.634
population.

1497
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.250
If you add onto the,

1498
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:11.770
uh,

1499
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:12.730
that percentage,

1500
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.320
the group that is illiterate,

1501
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:14.900
uh,

1502
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:19.420
the group that does not have enough education in order to understand how they

1503
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:19.830
might,

1504
00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:20.400
uh,

1505
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:20.710
uh,

1506
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.720
what the risk is and how they might manage the risk.

1507
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.380
Uh,

1508
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.850
gradually you get up to a percentage as close to 40% of the US population does

1509
00:40:27.851 --> 00:40:32.851
not have the capacity to understand a message of hazard or the capacity to

1510
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:38.590
interpret how to manage that hazard in a way that would cause the environment to

1511
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:40.840
be protected or human health to be protected.

1512
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:43.250
So the statutes we'll look at,

1513
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.740
I'm not going to go through all of these now,

1514
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:44.981
but,

1515
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:45.130
uh,

1516
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.891
we'll go through the,

1517
00:40:45.891 --> 00:40:46.051
the,

1518
00:40:46.051 --> 00:40:47.170
the major statutes,

1519
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:47.681
uh,

1520
00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:48.401
and the,

1521
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:48.551
uh,

1522
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:52.120
the book Weinberg and Riley will give you a very concise,

1523
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:54.700
quick overview of the key provision of these statutes.

1524
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.301
Uh,

1525
00:40:55.301 --> 00:40:59.590
and I will show you how the statutes apply individually to the,

1526
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.280
to the very,

1527
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:00.810
uh,

1528
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:01.750
the various cases.

1529
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.870
Take a look not just at the chemical management statutes,

1530
00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:08.500
but also the federal land and Resource Management Statutes such as the

1531
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:08.760
Wilderness Act,

1532
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.030
the endangered species act,

1533
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.410
the National Parks Service,

1534
00:41:11.411 --> 00:41:12.161
Organic Act,

1535
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:13.420
and several others.

1536
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.350
Additional crucial statutes that you might not think about as being

1537
00:41:17.351 --> 00:41:18.430
environmental in nature,

1538
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:18.911
uh,

1539
00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:20.080
include patent law,

1540
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.270
governing trade secrecy,

1541
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:22.840
uh,

1542
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.280
the freedom of Information Act.

1543
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:24.640
Uh,

1544
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.630
that gives you the right to,

1545
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.750
to request from the government information,

1546
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.200
uh,

1547
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.930
about public policy or about,

1548
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:31.660
uh,

1549
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.493
the environment.

1550
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.190
And I'll pause here and just ask,

1551
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:38.480
how many of you have made requests under the freedom of Information Act to a

1552
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:39.314
government agency?

1553
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.743
It's very interesting.

1554
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.720
The majority of people that do that in society,

1555
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.290
uh,

1556
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:46.520
are highly specialized.

1557
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.340
They work in the private sector or their lawyers.

1558
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.050
They're using MS basis for lawsuits.

1559
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:51.880
Uh,

1560
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.210
so the freedom of information act was intended to democratize information,

1561
00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:56.790
uh,

1562
00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:00.740
that was held inside a libraries and in government agencies.

1563
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.620
But it's been highly ineffective in a variety of ways.

1564
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.480
The National Security Act,

1565
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.830
the war powers act,

1566
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.480
the administrative procedures act,

1567
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.680
Homeland Security,

1568
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:10.520
the Patriot Act,

1569
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:11.690
and different budget,

1570
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.200
uh,

1571
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.470
statutes as for ranging from subsidies to,

1572
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.491
to,

1573
00:42:16.491 --> 00:42:17.090
uh,

1574
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:17.271
uh,

1575
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:19.610
authorizations for funding for EPA.

1576
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.140
And these statutes are,

1577
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.270
are absolutely crucial.

1578
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.500
So you can imagine the,

1579
00:42:24.501 --> 00:42:24.890
uh,

1580
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.100
uh,

1581
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.120
law being passed,

1582
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.720
uh,

1583
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.090
that,

1584
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:27.870
uh,

1585
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:28.270
say,

1586
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.720
let's say the law had the intent,

1587
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:30.290
uh,

1588
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.041
to protect,

1589
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:31.670
uh,

1590
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:32.503
uh,

1591
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.200
the environment from a,

1592
00:42:34.201 --> 00:42:36.950
a new plastic compound so that,

1593
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:37.400
uh,

1594
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:37.700
uh,

1595
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.930
that law might be plastic,

1596
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.270
but might be passing that might demand a,

1597
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:42.140
that the chemical,

1598
00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.440
uh,

1599
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.460
be tested thoroughly.

1600
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.060
Uh,

1601
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.740
it might demand that it be labeled in a way that,

1602
00:42:46.741 --> 00:42:46.980
uh,

1603
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.390
uh,

1604
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.590
would ensure that,

1605
00:42:48.591 --> 00:42:49.070
uh,

1606
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.640
uh,

1607
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.100
it would be managed more effectively.

1608
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.700
It,

1609
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.391
it might be,

1610
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:54.220
uh,

1611
00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:54.820
uh,

1612
00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:55.131
uh,

1613
00:42:55.131 --> 00:42:56.390
it might've signed penalties,

1614
00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:56.841
uh,

1615
00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:57.674
for deviance.

1616
00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.690
But in Congress,

1617
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.020
if Congress doesn't allocate the money to EPA,

1618
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.520
the program will fail.

1619
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:10.100
So the industry recognizes this quite clearly,

1620
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.990
that they have not lost the battle.

1621
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.620
Uh,

1622
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.480
if a law is passed,

1623
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:15.020
uh,

1624
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.500
they will have an opportunity year after year to go back to Congress and try to

1625
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:21.500
block allocation for monitoring that issue.

1626
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:21.891
Uh,

1627
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:23.180
foreign forcing that issue.

1628
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.641
Uh,

1629
00:43:23.641 --> 00:43:27.410
and that explains a lot of the ineffectiveness of 20th century environmental

1630
00:43:27.411 --> 00:43:28.244
law.

1631
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:33.790
So on Thursday we'll come back to a discussion about different types of

1632
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:36.290
strategies to,

1633
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:37.730
to protect the environment,

1634
00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:38.451
different decisions,

1635
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:41.320
standards that are embedded in a different statutes.

1636
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:42.070
Uh,

1637
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:46.190
and we'll particularly take up this issue of distributional effects,

1638
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.110
how some chemicals,

1639
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.080
uh,

1640
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:49.400
uh,

1641
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.630
behave differently than others.

1642
00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:53.900
They result in exposures to some groups that are higher than others.

1643
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:54.560
Uh,

1644
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.393
and also,

1645
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.180
uh,

1646
00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.040
thinking about how a costs,

1647
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.440
uh,

1648
00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.330
as well as benefits are allocated quite differently in society by environmental

1649
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:03.164
laws.

1650
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.440
So I'm going to pause there and,

1651
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:06.860
uh,

1652
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.620
just take a couple of minutes for any questions that you got.

1653
00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:13.143
<v 1>Yes.</v>

1654
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.010
<v 0>Could you repeat that please?</v>

1655
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:23.963
Yes.

1656
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:24.570
Uh,

1657
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:24.810
the,

1658
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:26.310
after the lecture each day,

1659
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:26.701
uh,

1660
00:44:26.701 --> 00:44:28.980
the lecture slides will be posted online.

1661
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:29.941
Also,

1662
00:44:29.941 --> 00:44:31.050
I will use the,

1663
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.210
the classes server quite regularly.

1664
00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:33.901
Uh,

1665
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:37.500
some of the readings that you will have assigned to you will be on the class of

1666
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:38.334
server.

1667
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:38.821
Uh,

1668
00:44:38.821 --> 00:44:41.090
so that some of the discussion sections as well May,

1669
00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:42.870
may I use strategies to,

1670
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:43.460
uh,

1671
00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.140
uh,

1672
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:44.370
uh,

1673
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.510
pose questions and,

1674
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:46.130
uh,

1675
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.290
uh,

1676
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.930
require your responses on the class of server as well.

1677
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:49.883
Yes.

1678
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:51.691
Well,

1679
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:52.530
I hold office hours.

1680
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:55.020
I will hold office hours and I will announce those on Thursday.

1681
00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.920
Anything else?

1682
00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.071
Well,

1683
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:00.450
thank you very much for joining me.
