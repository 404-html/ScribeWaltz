1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.100
A couple updates it,

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:06.590
I thought you might be interested in a US District Court in San Juan,
uh,

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.400
just dismissed the case of 7,000,
uh,
via Kenzie who had,

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.130
uh,
filed a suit against the federal government,
the,
uh,

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.830
department of the Navy,
uh,
seeking compensation for damages to their island,
uh,

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.070
and their health.
So that,
uh,

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.080
the suit has been in the making for about seven years.
And,
uh,

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.700
it will be appealed.
A,
also the Evelyn Case that,
uh,

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.950
you may have read about in green intelligence,
uh,

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.150
the two young children that,
uh,
uh,

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.130
claimed exposure to pesticides,
uh,

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.830
at a very young age,
uh,

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.050
that is going to trial in August now.
It was just announced,
uh,

14
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.640
after 10 years.
Uh,
so this should give you a pause to think about the,
uh,

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.900
effect.
Uh,

16
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:59.150
and costs of litigation in terms of Tosca reform.
Uh,

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.210
Tosca reform was just introduced into both the house and the Senate and the

18
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:07.500
Senate by a Senator Lautenberg and the house by a Henry Waxman,

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
a and a for the first time in nearly 25 years.

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.060
There's some anticipation that there will be serious reform of the way that

21
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.560
commercial chemicals are regulated in the country.
Uh,
chemical company,

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.220
chemical companies,
curiously,

23
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.300
are motivated to see changes in this law because if products that they make in

24
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:29.280
this country,
you're not tested to the same standard as products,

25
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.780
a product testing requirements in Europe than us,

26
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.980
chemicals will not be allowed to be sold in Europe.

27
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.050
So the chemical companies are,
are extremely concerned about,
uh,

28
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.770
the idea of harmonizing law,
uh,
between the u s uh,
in the European Union.

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.250
Cape Wind,
uh,
is not been decided.
Uh,
but,
uh,

30
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.550
they're really appears to be no clear direction on the,

31
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.790
on the part of Ken Salazar at this point.
Should,
uh,
keep your eyes open for that.

32
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:58.420
Over the next week or so in a diesel update,
we talked about diesel exhaust and,

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.700
and we talked about the health consequences of particulate matter,
but,
uh,

34
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.350
there was new evidence that was released quite recently,
uh,
by,
uh,
uh,

35
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:08.340
needing Unger,

36
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.660
who is going to be a new assistant professor here next year and who has worked

37
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.580
with,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,
Columbia University.
And,
uh,
uh,
NASA,

38
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.440
uh,
on the effect of particles.
And it's kind of a curious effect,
uh,
that,
uh,

39
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.910
particles of one form,
especially those that,
uh,

40
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.840
uh,

41
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.840
are attached to organic matter tend to have a reflective of effect to radiation.

42
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.400
So it basically,
uh,
uh,
may have a cooling effect,
whereas black carbon itself,

43
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.490
uh,
tends to absorb the radiation which would have a warming effect.

44
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.320
So it's interesting.
Diesel exhaust has been,
uh,
fingered as,
as,
uh,

45
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.310
identified as one of the,
the,
uh,
uh,
uh,

46
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.050
key sources of black carbon in the atmosphere that we need to pay much more

47
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:59.620
attention to a four.
It's warming effect on climate happy Earth Day,

48
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.180
40 years ago today,
a Earth Day,
uh,

49
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.950
occurred and,
uh,
your parents and,
uh,
and I probably remember it pretty well.

50
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.970
I was in Philadelphia at the time.
And,
uh,
it was a really a,
an interesting and,

51
00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:18.070
and a highly confused time,
uh,
to be a college student.

52
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.410
And what was interesting about it to is it was a period of collision,
uh,
between,

53
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.510
uh,
different,
uh,
social movements that,

54
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.160
that really had a core base in universities.
And the,
uh,
the,

55
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.950
the collision was among the,
the anti war movement,

56
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.570
the civil rights movement as well as the environmental movement.

57
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.450
Nobody really knew what that meant at the time.
But,
uh,
you know,

58
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.820
sitting in Philadelphia and living in Philadelphia,

59
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:47.170
watching the yellow sunsets that,
uh,
occurred every evening,
uh,

60
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:52.150
because of the,
the filthy air and a rowing on the school kill river with the,

61
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.950
uh,
the crew team,
uh,

62
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.070
having to scrape the globules of a slime and material chemical waste that were

63
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.710
deposited legally into the school kill river,
uh,
really was,
uh,

64
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.460
an unhappy experience.
So it really,
it was also the dawn of,
of,
uh,

65
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.390
the modern era of environmental law in the nation.
And,
uh,
the clean air act,

66
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.460
a revisions,
the clean water act revisions,
uh,

67
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:23.410
the 1970s were really a time when a great energy was put into the,
the,

68
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.920
uh,
design of,
of environmental law.
And there was,

69
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.160
there was great expectation on the part of,
of,
uh,
people that,
uh,

70
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.720
had had worked in these movements to that,
uh,
that,
uh,

71
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.330
environmental quality would,
would change quite radically.

72
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.950
So I wanted to reflect with you today,
uh,
about,
uh,
you know,
imagining a,

73
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:46.750
an ideal society.
Uh,
we,
we think that we're facing many very severe problems,

74
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:48.640
but,
uh,
uh,
and that,
uh,

75
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.090
one of the themes of this course has been to try to help you judge the

76
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:55.720
effectiveness and potential of environmental law to shape behavior so that

77
00:04:55.721 --> 00:05:00.550
people will behave more responsibly toward the environment and protect human

78
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:05.470
health and protect a,
a scarce,
natural resources.
So for,
for a moment,

79
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.950
I'd like you to kind of step back away from your perception of,

80
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.360
of all the problems that we face and,
uh,
instead,
uh,

81
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.540
to have you imagine an ideal society.
Uh,
so what would it look like?

82
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.190
Well,
you know,
environmental law really targets itself toward damages.

83
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.140
So knowledge is really a critical element of it and the knowledge that's

84
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:29.200
necessary in order for it to be effective as is quite complex.

85
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.430
So in the ideal world,
you would want to have perfect knowledge of externalities,

86
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.770
perfect predictive capacity.
What's the effect of my behavior going to be?

87
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.760
You'd want to have an efficient system for compensation,
for damages,

88
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.850
because all damages could never be avoided.

89
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.970
You'd also want to have a literate public,
uh,

90
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:53.290
public that was capable of understanding the technical information at a level of

91
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.740
detail that would make them potentially effective participants in decision

92
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:59.450
making.
Uh,
so literacy,
uh,

93
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:03.860
the capacity to learn is a really important component of this.
Uh,

94
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.490
you would want to have governmental authority and the resources,
uh,

95
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.060
to regulate.
So not only the,
uh,

96
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:16.061
the right to regulate that would be authorized by a congress or a parliament,

97
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.440
but also the resources to regulate.
And,

98
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.910
and those don't normally go hand in hand so that you often get the passage of a

99
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:27.110
law,
but you don't get the allocation of resources.
So there's the,
uh,

100
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.500
authorization a of money that's necessary.

101
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:33.080
Then there's the appropriation of money that's necessary.

102
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.120
And then EPA or whoever the agency is,

103
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.470
have to actually expend the money in order to,
uh,

104
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.650
have an effective response.
In an ideal society.

105
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.110
I'd say also that we need to pay.

106
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.370
We would be paying attention to the most vulnerable.
Uh,
they would be identified.

107
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.620
Uh,
and they would be protected by statute.
Uh,

108
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.680
there would be equal protection for all.

109
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.510
And I'll talk more about to inequality and environmental law in a few moments.

110
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.960
And we would have figured out how to manage natural resources such as our

111
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:10.640
forests,
our soils are wildlife,
uh,
in,
in a sustainable way.

112
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.950
Uh,
and it's quite interesting when we use the word sustainability.
Um,
I,

113
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.630
I tend to cringe.
It's not my favorite word.

114
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:21.040
I think it's ambiguous and I think it is,
uh,
uh,

115
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.720
used way too loosely.
Uh,
but we're,

116
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:28.721
it seems to be clearest and have provided a model for effective law has been

117
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.640
with respect to managing resources such as forced,

118
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.520
uh,
fisheries where you can monitor a population,

119
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.800
you can monitor its rate of growth,
it's reproductive success.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

120
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.010
uh,
thinking about,
uh,
sustainable management of natural resources has been,
uh,

121
00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:50.540
in,
in some instances a success story.
We,

122
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.540
I think I would imagine a stable climate as well.

123
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.250
So I want it to have you think with me also about what's been successful.

124
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:02.180
What can we point to as success stories.
And I think that a number of the cases,

125
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:04.430
I chose the cases quite deliberately,
uh,

126
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:08.940
for this course and a number of them demonstrate the potential of law,
uh,

127
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.640
to control behavior to achieve some of these objectives.
But I think clearly the,

128
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:16.730
uh,
the wilderness protection system and the national park system that we have in

129
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.820
the United States really is the envy of many nations in the world,

130
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.510
so that we have effectively set aside lands and we've offered,
uh,
uh,

131
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.800
we've restricted,
uh,
uh,
human access and,
and,
uh,

132
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.810
certain behaviors and extraction rights in these areas.
And,

133
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.790
and that really has been quite a bit of a successful policy.
Uh,

134
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.790
our national seashores I think represent a,
a really far approach,
uh,
that,

135
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:45.110
uh,
uh,
we're meant to provide recreational opportunities in the coastal zone.
Uh,

136
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:49.060
but as,
as I mentioned in the lecture on,
uh,
uh,

137
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.980
looking at Cape Cod and fire island and Padre Island and in point raise,
uh,

138
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.320
the fact that the government went into those areas and bought them or

139
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:03.321
consolidated federal ownership is going to restrict future development in a way,

140
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:04.600
uh,

141
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.570
that will reduce longterm costs associated with sea level rise and,

142
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:11.820
uh,
uh,
increased storm damage.
Uh,

143
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.010
the Adirondack park strikes me as also being a real success story in,

144
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.150
in many ways.
For me,

145
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:23.130
it really represents a model for regulating privately and use,
uh,

146
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:26.410
in the vicinity of highly valuable public lands.
Uh,

147
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.410
and remember this park was set aside back in the 1870s.
So that the,

148
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.260
the Adirondack park agency concept was really,
uh,

149
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.290
designed initially to protect what they thought of as biological diversity,

150
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.700
ecological,
uh,
uh,
diversity as well as integrity.
Uh,

151
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.500
whatever that meant.
Uh,
uh,
at the time back in 1972,
uh,
when the,

152
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:53.240
the park agency statute was passed,
but,
uh,
eh,

153
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.630
almost inadvertently,

154
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:58.230
they had designed and energy conservation plan that really was right.

155
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.450
Quite remarkable member,
this idea that,
that you,
you,
uh,
regulate,
uh,

156
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.910
in demand,
very large lot sizes in the remote areas.

157
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.960
And then you basically take away the density requirements in the,

158
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.840
in the towns and villages.
They're really no,
uh,
urban centers in the Adirondacks,

159
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.501
but,
uh,

160
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:18.501
this open space preservation and incentive to increase density in the existing

161
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.310
areas that a already are developed and have infrastructure,
have roads,

162
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.850
have electric lines,
etc. It really is remarkable.

163
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.670
So in terms of an energy conservation strategy strategy,
uh,

164
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.820
uh,
that one might embed into a,
a land use plan,
it really was very innovative.
Uh,

165
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.140
they also use the idea of transferable development rights in the Adirondacks.

166
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.830
That,
uh,
I think is a very cool idea.

167
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.390
And there's a parallel here to,
uh,
the idea of,
of uh,
uh,

168
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.470
setting up these ecosystem service banks.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

169
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.170
I wanted to give you the example of,
uh,
a windmill.

170
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:58.470
We talked about to wind energy the other day,
or to give you the,
uh,

171
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.110
the idea that,
uh,
you know,

172
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.120
supposing you had property next to a windmill and you thought that you were

173
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:09.690
being a adversely effected by that,
uh,
is there a way that you might be,
uh,

174
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.770
compensated,
uh,
that would prevent you from litigating?
That might,

175
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:18.540
you might make you more accepting of the windmill LSL you know,
imagine that,

176
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:22.450
uh,
uh,
you,
you set up up a,
uh,

177
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.710
a square around a windmill or a,
uh,

178
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.500
a wind turbine and you basically use a,
uh,
the,
uh,

179
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.360
the thousand foot,
uh,

180
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.470
or the 300 meter distance from any property boundary that's been recommended,
uh,

181
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.310
to,
uh,
you know,
due to adverse effects.
So that,

182
00:11:40.311 --> 00:11:43.410
that would constitute roughly about a hundred acres was supposing you had a

183
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:48.060
patch of people that lived,
uh,
adjacent to that land,
what could you do for them?

184
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.190
Uh,
that might make them more accepting of it.

185
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.760
But one thing you could do would be to provide them with development rights.
Uh,

186
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.750
but maybe they didn't want it.

187
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.960
They may not want to develop on their own property,
uh,

188
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.480
so that you could set up a bank,
uh,

189
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:06.481
whereby they could deposit these development rights in that bank and then

190
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.010
somebody who lived in a receiving zone or purchased property and in receiving

191
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:15.580
zone,
uh,
the receiving zone designed to increase density,

192
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:17.490
say in one of these urban centers that we,

193
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.580
I just mentioned then the developer that a one or to increase the density,

194
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.903
uh,
of,

195
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.510
of land that he owned or would buy in that urban zone would go to the bank and

196
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:31.630
purchase the credit so that the adjacent landowner to the turbine would be

197
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:35.260
compensated and development would be encouraged to,
to,
uh,

198
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.020
to grow near existing infrastructure.

199
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.240
So the ecosystem service banks that have grown up,
uh,

200
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:46.000
associated with wetlands,
a deg degradation,

201
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:50.890
also with a stream mitigation banking,
they present,
I think a,

202
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.940
uh,
a real model for us to follow in the future.
Uh,

203
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:58.450
the [inaudible] cap and trade program was clearly a success in reducing sulfur

204
00:12:58.451 --> 00:13:03.451
dioxide and acid precipitation and a variety of other cases that we went through

205
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:06.334
in the course.

206
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.310
I think also demonstrate the potential effectiveness of law.

207
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.210
The nuclear weapons testing ban back in 1963 a population control.

208
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.590
Uh,
if,
if this were Earth Day back in 1970,
uh,
I remember,
uh,

209
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.131
uh,
the,

210
00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:29.920
the lectures on Earth Day back in 1970 and they were about population control.

211
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.040
Uh,
population was thought to be the,
uh,
the source of,
uh,

212
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.710
environmental degradation.
Uh,
particularly in the developing world.

213
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.320
And population control efforts have been really quite successful.
We haven't,
uh,

214
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.560
we haven't discussed population control.

215
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.400
And I'm actually a little embarrassed to be a running an environmental studies

216
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:53.170
major without a,
a,
a,
uh,
a demography element to it.
Uh,

217
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:56.740
but,
uh,
it really is a very important,
uh,
aspect of,

218
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.510
of environmental degradation in,
in terms of,
and I'm a,

219
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.900
as a father of children,
uh,
I could think of myself as a,
you know,
having,
uh,

220
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.350
created with my wife,
a beautiful young children.
Uh,

221
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.050
I could also think of it as creating future consumers,
uh,

222
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.690
that are going to be spending millions of dollars buying goods and services and

223
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.910
the developing land,
uh,
and,
uh,
doing whatever,
uh,
that,
uh,

224
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.730
would have an adverse effect on the environment.
So that a,

225
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.740
the mantra back in 1970 was population control is the primary approach that we

226
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:36.880
should be taking to,
to control environmental damage.

227
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.170
Uh,
the success in pesticides associated with a chlorinated heart,
hydrocarbons,

228
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:44.710
DDT,
Alderman,
dieldrin chemicals that would bio accumulate.

229
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.040
We really learned the bioaccumulation story predominantly from,

230
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.880
from a strontium 90,
uh,
back in,
in,
uh,
the weapons testing year.

231
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.650
Uh,
but then it was repeated in the 1960s in 1970 and these compounds were

232
00:14:57.651 --> 00:14:58.910
successfully phased out.

233
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.080
It was one of the first objectives of William Ruckelshaus,
uh,

234
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.240
when he became the first administrator to the environmental protection agency.

235
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:10.400
Uh,
and you can see in the graphs,
uh,
the steady decline and concentrations,

236
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.080
uh,
not just in,
in birds,
uh,

237
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.150
but in fish and other wildlife as well as in human tissues.

238
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.470
A great success story.

239
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.700
And that also was modeled in the history of lead and has led,

240
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:27.260
was taken out of gasoline,
is led,
was taken out of paint.
You can see the,
uh,

241
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.400
the concentrations declining and the nation's children,
uh,
in,

242
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:35.840
in other nations where we're led was removed.
Uh,
it's,
it's really,
uh,
uh,

243
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:37.550
a very striking success story.

244
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.250
A chlorinated fluorocarbons known to adversely affect the,
uh,

245
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.950
the stratospheric ozone layer.
Uh,
we'll remove from aerosols.
Uh,

246
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.710
PCBs were removed from,
from,
uh,
transmission,
uh,

247
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.590
tower coolers and other electronics.
Uh,
they also had built up in,

248
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.570
in a bio accumulated in,
in a wildlife as well as human tissues.
Uh,
the,
the,

249
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:02.720
uh,
prevention of use of,
of a Spanish as a building material.

250
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.150
Our tobacco regulations,
we have a,

251
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:09.340
one of the lower lowest adoption rates now that,
uh,
uh,

252
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:14.060
then has existed at any other point,
uh,
uh,
previous and the in the 20th century.

253
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.680
Uh,
and food safety,
uh,
you may think of food safety is kind of an odd topic.
Uh,

254
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.070
but,
uh,
you know,
in low income parts of the world,
food safety,
is it,

255
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.740
is it a major source of illness?
Uh,

256
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.090
and even in this country or the estimate by the Centers for disease control of

257
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:33.500
the number of illnesses per year experienced by contaminated food,

258
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.590
he's 76 million.
That's an enormous issue.

259
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.350
It has to do with the availability of water and the control of,

260
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.790
of microbes and a,
the way that that food is handled and Washington stored,

261
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.330
uh,
as well as how it's cooked.
Uh,
the organic food movement,
uh,

262
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.440
has been successful.
Uh,
it's,
it's a,
as I mentioned earlier,

263
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.190
the most rapidly growing sector in the food industry,
uh,

264
00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.630
and drinking water quality,

265
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.310
poor drinking water quality in low income parts of the world is a major killer.

266
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.170
Uh,
the World Health Organization estimates that,
uh,
uh,

267
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.530
well more than a million children die from contaminated water each year.

268
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.580
We also suffer much less from a respiratory infections.

269
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.720
So forgive me the,
as the computer

270
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.890
for some reason is running through each one very slowly.

271
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.643
<v 1>Come on.</v>

272
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.900
<v 0>So in contrast to a wearable laws work well,
where is it not work?
Well,</v>

273
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.360
I think fossil fuel policy,
uh,
has been disastrous.
Um,

274
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.590
especially the kinds of subsidies that we've allowed the industry to,
to receive.

275
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.970
And I mentioned that it's simply the,
uh,
uh,
the,
the absence of,

276
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.830
of investment in,
in public transit,
uh,

277
00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:04.110
and the enormity of the public investment in a highway development in highway

278
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:07.680
maintenance.
Our renewable energy policy has also been a disaster.

279
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.080
And despite the,
uh,

280
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.810
the improvements in the increase in funding that's going into renewable energy,

281
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:18.020
it's nowhere near sufficient in order to increase the proportion of renewable

282
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.160
energy that is necessary to,
to deal with the,

283
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.300
the co two problem that we face.
Personal consumption,
uh,

284
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.230
individual consumption,
individual purchasing is going up,
uh,

285
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.240
as are the number of people in the country or at about a 310 million people were

286
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:40.440
projected to go to,
to 350,
and about,
uh,
the next,
uh,

287
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.770
40 years,
uh,
and perhaps a reach 400 million people in,

288
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.650
in the nation.
So you multiply,
uh,
consumption,
uh,
of,
of,

289
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.160
uh,
each individual times,
uh,
that scale.
Uh,
you know,

290
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:57.630
that we're sitting in a nation now where we have roughly 250 million

291
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.960
automobiles.
Uh,
and we're likely to,
uh,

292
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.860
to see that rise quite substantially,
uh,
so that,
uh,

293
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.360
people have fled to the suburbs.
Now they can't sell the property in the suburbs,

294
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:11.640
even if they wanted to live in an urban area.
Uh,

295
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:14.800
because of the declining a land value,
uh,

296
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.140
parks and protected areas are not being created any longer.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

297
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.650
the rate of adoption of parks and protected areas,
uh,

298
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:25.440
even though I just claimed that they were a great success where they were

299
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:26.400
created,
uh,

300
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:29.700
the rate of establishing parks and protected areas has fallen off quite

301
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:32.160
dramatically.
Uh,
since that time.
Uh,

302
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:35.910
the park services land acquisition acquisition efforts have declined.

303
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.220
A biological diversity loss is also increasing,
uh,

304
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:46.200
as a,
as a function of habitat loss as a function of chemical applications,

305
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.750
pesticide applications,
a marine species exploitation is,

306
00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:53.320
is increasing the rate of extinction a is increasing in,

307
00:19:53.321 --> 00:19:56.250
in the world's oceans driven in part by,

308
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.040
by changing water quality and the coastal zone,

309
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:02.790
but driven also by unregulated fishing.
Uh,

310
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:05.850
particularly beyond the 200 mile limit.
Uh,

311
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.920
the indoor as opposed to a or the outdoor as opposed to indoor focus of the

312
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:13.350
environmental protection agency has been a serious problem.

313
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.340
If you gave me a sample of your blood,
of your urine,
of your hair,

314
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.740
and we went down to CDC and had it tested,

315
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.650
we would find a variety of chemicals,
uh,
that,
uh,
come from the built environment.

316
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.160
So that,
that,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
absence of attention to a,

317
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.690
where we spend our time,
which is indoors is important.
Uh,

318
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.860
there is a new study that was just released that a announced that,
uh,

319
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.280
the average amount of time spent by the nation's children outdoors is now 42

320
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:46.770
minutes per week.
The average amount of time that,
uh,

321
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:51.870
children now spend in front of electronic media is now 52 hours per week.

322
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.630
So that there's something to that statistic that,
uh,
uh,

323
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.670
is worth paying a lot of attention to.

324
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.480
I'm here because my dad took me hiking when I was a kid.
Uh,

325
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.090
he took me to parks.
Uh,
we'd hang out by streams.
Uh,
he take me down to,

326
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.660
uh,
the beach.
Uh,
but,
uh,
this is,
uh,
uh,

327
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:14.980
an increasingly rare experience as people are spending more time indoors and

328
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:19.750
more time staring at a electronic equipment,
hazardous sites.
Uh,

329
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.850
we are adding the number of hazardous sites to the,
uh,
uh,

330
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.670
list maintained by the government and the federal government and state

331
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:28.810
governments,
uh,

332
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.460
every year so that we're not restoring more than we're adding a,

333
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:38.280
and this is a very serious problem and the lessons of,
of,
uh,
a VA case,

334
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.790
the,
uh,

335
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.790
the long amount of time that the enormous resources necessary to clean these

336
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.430
facilities up.
And you should think about that if once you,
uh,
in,

337
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.320
in five years and six years as you think about where you want to live,

338
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:53.620
where you're going to rent a house or an apartment,
you think about a,

339
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.440
where you want to buy a house or buy land,

340
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.670
you should pay a lot of attention to the land use history in these areas.
Uh,

341
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.370
so that,
uh,
you can be sure that that,
uh,

342
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.880
you're buying land that was not formally a disposal site.

343
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.810
Chemicals in commerce,
plastics in our bodies and product labeling a,

344
00:22:11.811 --> 00:22:15.370
our product labeling is,
is uh,
uh,
really,
uh,

345
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.020
one of the weakest among the higher income nations,
uh,
in,
in,
uh,
the world.

346
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.140
Another key issue that,
uh,

347
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:27.250
I'll talk about a little bit more in a minute is what I call narrative
advantage.

348
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.750
Uh,
and if you think of,
uh,
the,
the variety of,
of different,

349
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:37.280
uh,
sources of our confusion about what to buy,
how to behave,
uh,
you know,

350
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:42.100
what energy consumption is associated with a purchase of an apple as opposed to

351
00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:45.650
a hamburger,
a,
as you think about how much we don't know.
Uh,

352
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.750
I think also about,
uh,
how much,
uh,

353
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.070
what we do know and how our impressions are created,
uh,

354
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.770
by the narrative advantage of the powerful than written narrative advantage of

355
00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:59.260
the corporate corporations as well as government.

356
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.700
So that they are basically framing the issue about what's worth worrying about.

357
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.480
I wanted to also say that,
that,
uh,
we did not have a chance to,

358
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.990
to talk much about,
uh,
uh,
CO2 trading programs.
Uh,

359
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:18.630
but we have a very active in and a important one ongoing right here in,
in,
uh,

360
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.250
Connecticut as we're part of a,
a 10 state,
uh,
uh,

361
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.220
plan to reduce co two emissions from the power plants in this region.

362
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.250
Uh,
and this was adopted as law in,
uh,

363
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.060
nine of these states,
but not in New York.

364
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:36.190
And it's interesting that a one energy company,

365
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.220
the indeck energy company sued the state of New York for creating cap and trade

366
00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:45.000
regulations with no statutory authority.
So it could New York,
uh,

367
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.810
establish a cap and trade regulations and impose it on the utilities and its

368
00:23:48.811 --> 00:23:53.120
state,
uh,
without statutory authority.
So this case is still pending.

369
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.180
The other states have adopted this approach.
And uh,

370
00:23:56.181 --> 00:24:00.440
so that for all the utilities are for the largest utilities,
uh,
that,
that,
uh,

371
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.510
contributes CO2 in this region.
Uh,

372
00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:07.280
there has been a ceiling that has been established and,
uh,
uh,

373
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.400
between now and 2000 was,
excuse me,

374
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:15.401
2012 the ceiling will be stable and then it will decline.

375
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:20.390
As total a amount of co two emitted,
uh,
that's allowable.

376
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.900
Uh,
we'll,
we'll,
uh,
be reduced and they will have to retrofit,

377
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.740
they will have to fuel switch,
uh,

378
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.890
in order to figure out how they're gonna meet that ceiling.

379
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.570
It's a very important approach.

380
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.690
So if you think back on what are the key problems with our broad body of

381
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:39.680
environmental law?
Well,
it's fractured.
It's fractured by problem,

382
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.330
it's fractured by media,
by air,
water,
food,

383
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.310
consumer products.

384
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.540
And often these problems have evolved a case by case and a motivated political

385
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:53.714
action,
uh,

386
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:58.280
in individual states or motivated the legislators in those individual states to

387
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:01.270
approach Congress and suggest that,
you know,
this is a,
this is a,

388
00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:03.560
an example of a problem that exists in every state.

389
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.480
We should pass national law to address it,

390
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.450
but each law is set up very differently.

391
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:13.100
It was not set up based upon a certain set of overriding,
guiding principles,

392
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.980
uh,
such as exist in the European Union.

393
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:18.800
And I'm going to make a few comparisons in a few moments to European

394
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.220
environmental law.
Uh,
by contrast,

395
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.530
it's fractured by level of government.
So we have,
uh,
uh,
uh,
law that,

396
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:30.590
uh,
uh,
is established by local governments,
state governments,

397
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.060
and the federal government that is often incompatible.
Uh,

398
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:38.840
and it's extremely confusing for,
for those that want to develop,
such as,
uh,
the,

399
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.570
uh,
the wind turbine farm,
Cape Wind up in Massachusetts.

400
00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:46.190
It's a classic example of,
of a regulatory confusion and,
uh,
the,
uh,

401
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:51.040
the litigation and,
and delay and cost,
uh,
that,
uh,
that,
that,
uh,
in,
in,

402
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.840
uh,
uh,
that ensues.
Uh,

403
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:57.110
we have little surveillance at the scale that's relevant to the individual.

404
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.610
And something that we have not spoken about that's really important is that,
uh,

405
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.520
environmental monitoring responsibilities and surveillance responsibilities have

406
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.350
largely been delegated to those that are regulated over the past several decades

407
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:13.310
by the environmental protection agency.
So that's an interesting idea.
I mean,

408
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:18.050
if you are,
say,
uh,
uh,
the,
the maker of,
um,
uh,

409
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.090
benzene,
uh,

410
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:25.480
you are responsible to report your benzene emissions from your smokestacks,
uh,

411
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.870
to the environmental protection agency.

412
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.300
There's no one else that is independent that,
uh,
monitors,
uh,
or is there no,
uh,

413
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.550
monitoring equipment that reports directly to the environmental protection

414
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:36.520
agency.
So thinking about,
uh,
the,

415
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.390
the way that the surveillance system is set up is really critical to the long

416
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:42.230
term effectiveness of,
of environmental law.

417
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:48.780
The next point is the pace of regulation.
And I just,
uh,

418
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.560
I mentioned the pace of litigation a few moments ago.
Uh,

419
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:57.150
the pace of regulation,
uh,
is,
is often slower than,

420
00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.730
than a litigation.
So that,
that,
uh,
uh,

421
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.800
you wouldn't want a system ideally to be responsive to new found evidence of

422
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:08.980
risk.
So supposing I found that,
uh,
you know,
chemical x,
uh,
uh,

423
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.860
in the food supply is exceptionally dangerous and people are highly exposed and

424
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:16.100
they've got in their tissues well,
uh,

425
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.100
following that discovery and following a consensus amongst scientists that that

426
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:24.720
is a significant threat.
It normally takes 10 to 15,

427
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.830
and I've seen 20 years with respect to pesticides before the government responds

428
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.860
and then changes the regulation to,

429
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:35.490
to lower the allowable use of the chemical or sets a different ceiling on it.

430
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.400
In this basically a la law has the effect then a providing a,

431
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.130
a false sense of security when you think,
oh my gosh,

432
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:46.230
we have three dozen statutes in place,
uh,

433
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:49.290
we must be reasonably well protected as a society.
Well,

434
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.650
I think after this course you will be more skeptical.

435
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.230
It's difficult and costly to measure effectiveness and uh,
when,
uh,

436
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.140
ineffectiveness is found,
agencies are not happy about that.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
uh,

437
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.850
that's why we have a government accountability office that commonly we'll,

438
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:10.750
we'll look at,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
uh,
behavior of agencies and whether or not,
uh,

439
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.680
the,
the statute is,
is achieving the,
the,

440
00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:16.710
a congressionally mandated intent.

441
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.210
Our law system is highly specialized in the sciences,
uh,

442
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:24.710
and it often takes a scientific training,
uh,

443
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:29.020
at a graduate level in order to be able to debate about the appropriateness of

444
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.040
certain standards.
Uh,
similarly,
if you're arguing about,
uh,
uh,
the,

445
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.190
the effect of human development on an endangered species habitat,

446
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.740
it takes expertise in biology often at the graduate level too,

447
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.880
to get a seat at the table.
So,
so think about that.

448
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.800
If you're considering a future in environmental management of one sort or

449
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:53.700
another,
uh,
think about how you might shore up your technical capacity.

450
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.900
Uh,
it's highly centralized and decision making.
It's a really difficult,

451
00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.560
in order to participate in decision making at the federal level of government,

452
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.620
there are action channels and there are uh,

453
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.540
groups of people that are well known to the regulators that,
uh,

454
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.180
play a disproportionate role in making choices that,
that have,
uh,
a much,

455
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.420
uh,
highly more highly distributed a effect.

456
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:20.700
So I'm not going to go through all these different kinds of decision standards,

457
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.121
uh,

458
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:25.200
but we've touched on a variety of different approaches to setting standards in

459
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:26.034
different laws.

460
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:30.480
Remember the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide rodenticide act at

461
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:35.460
the top here,
it was a risk benefit balancing law.
Uh,
think about the food,

462
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:38.020
drug and cosmetic act as it applies to drugs.
Oh,

463
00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:42.730
that's a risk risk trade off law so that a doctor prescribes a drug to you

464
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.030
because the doctor thinks that,
uh,
uh,

465
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.190
although there may be a risk of a side effect,

466
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.160
that the benefit to you is better is,
is a higher,

467
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:53.110
it's more significant than the side effect.

468
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:57.090
Risk cost benefit analysis is another form that,

469
00:29:57.091 --> 00:30:01.240
a form of a decision making.
The analysis that is often demanded in,

470
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:06.340
in environmental law,
risk ceilings,
acceptable acceptable risk levels.

471
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.893
Now that,
uh,

472
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:13.020
I've seen the acceptable risk levels for cancer causing agents in the

473
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:16.690
environment that vary between one excess cancer,
uh,

474
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:19.860
is allowable per thousand people exposed,
uh,

475
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.280
as opposed to a standard that would allow a California standard,
uh,

476
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:28.740
one excess risk in a million people exposed.
And,
uh,
I've,
I've seen,
uh,

477
00:30:28.741 --> 00:30:33.520
other proposals for one in 10 million so that the idea of acceptable risk,
uh,
is,

478
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.100
is quite variable and that can have an enormous effect on the,

479
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.520
the allowable concentration of a,
of a compound out there in the environment.
Uh,

480
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.120
the sustainable yield definition,

481
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.020
there's the multiple use and sustainable yield act that applies to the u s

482
00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:50.230
forest service.
And this is a really interesting idea as well,
but it's,
it's,

483
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.400
it's technical,

484
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:55.420
so that one would have to look at a national forest and figure out how much

485
00:30:55.421 --> 00:31:00.100
timber it normally produces,
how much could be harvested,
uh,

486
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.600
and without adversely affecting,
uh,
the sustained yield at that level.

487
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.930
So being able to identify,
uh,

488
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.690
the sustained yield and develop an understanding of,

489
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.920
of how you go into an area and you get the timber out without depleting the soil

490
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:18.670
resources,
say of organic matter and water holding capacity.

491
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.500
That's a technical issue.
A density restrictions,
land use segregation,

492
00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.260
a disclosure and transparency requirements,

493
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.120
certification requirements inside the food production act or the reasonable

494
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:35.200
certainty of no harm standard in the food quality protection act is the most

495
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:39.130
rigid,
rigid,
uh,
health protective standard that we've gotten.
The United States.

496
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.190
It's as health protective as any statute,
uh,

497
00:31:42.191 --> 00:31:46.780
also in the European Union and also technological feasibility.

498
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:52.050
So what's feasible now as opposed to a technology forcing a standards that would

499
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:56.860
demand that a industry say lower their a auto emissions down to a level that's

500
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:57.940
not possible now,

501
00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.250
but you give them a ceiling and say that you've got five years to reach that,

502
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.250
that a reduced ceiling,
uh,
restricting false claims,

503
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:09.460
a benefit or demanding,
uh,
expression of risk.

504
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.930
So product labeling and then restoration standards that exist inside the

505
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:17.710
resource conservation and Recovery Act and a,
the superfund law,

506
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.140
so that there are different forms of standards,

507
00:32:20.141 --> 00:32:25.110
a different decision making criteria and analysis across these laws.
Uh,

508
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.760
I wanted to compare for just a couple of minutes,
some key principles,
a loft.

509
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.770
So I just said that that US law has evolved in incrementally in a patchwork

510
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:35.430
quilt fashion,
uh,

511
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.170
with a variety of these different standards that were in the last slide.

512
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.820
How about European law?
Well,

513
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:46.150
European law evolved based upon a collection of,
uh,
principles,

514
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.040
uh,
principles that are not embedded in all of our laws.

515
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.830
So we have no law in our country that,
uh,

516
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.610
that basically forces the,
the,
uh,
uh,

517
00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.180
statute to comply with principles such as exist in the EU law.
Uh,

518
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.150
one is a high level of protection,
uh,
is demanded but not the highest.

519
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.930
Uh,
and this would force,
uh,
the definition of what high means.
Uh,

520
00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.200
and it has,
and it's produced litigation.
Uh,

521
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:17.030
the precautionary principle that despite uncertainty in the effect of,

522
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.490
of a timber harvesting on an endangered species habitat or of a chemical on

523
00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:26.860
human health,
despite the uncertainty,
uh,
it is a better idea,
uh,

524
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.220
to be precautionary,
to set a standard that would be a protective,

525
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.430
and this is quite similar to another principal that they call the prevention

526
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:38.220
principle that a prevention is better than the cure.
Uh,

527
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.540
and they also have the source principle,
uh,

528
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:45.440
that a problem should be managed at its source,
uh,
rather than down the road.
So,

529
00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.160
you know,
if you've got a,
a,
if you have a nasty,
a pesticide,
uh,

530
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.460
are you going to manage that pesticide by,
uh,
uh,

531
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:54.830
allowing farmers to use it and,
uh,

532
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:59.180
then going out and monitoring its presence in the water supply or in the foods

533
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:00.740
that you eat?
Uh,
that's,

534
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.090
that's managing at the downstream level as opposed to at the,
at the source.

535
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:10.030
So a nip it in the bud if it's a really dangerous chemical prohibited,
uh,

536
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.650
or don't allow it to be used under certain circumstances.

537
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.090
The polluter pays principle,
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

538
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:21.130
dictates that a polluters are financially responsible for the pollution that

539
00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:26.300
they emit from their smokestacks.
From there,
uh,
from there,
uh,
uh,

540
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.260
pipe,
there waterline just discharge points,
uh,

541
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.200
and that they are also responsible for damages and they're responsible for

542
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:35.690
coming up to solutions to the problem that,
uh,

543
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:40.670
that they're creating a and also that they are open to liability claims.

544
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.130
Uh,
and finally the safeguard principle,
uh,
that,
uh,

545
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.770
member states in the European Union,
uh,
have the authority to adopt tougher laws,

546
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.740
uh,
given,
uh,
their particular conditions.
Now,
when I say that,
um,

547
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.710
I know that these seem like they're kind of dry principles,
but when I see that,

548
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:58.090
uh,
the,

549
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:02.790
the bell that should be going off in your head is a bell about a preemption and

550
00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:06.710
to how important it is to think carefully about when,

551
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.070
under what circumstance do you want to preempt a lower level of government,

552
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:11.143
say France,

553
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.320
from adopting a tougher level of regulation than the European Union?

554
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.050
Or when do you want to have California,
uh,

555
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.330
be given the authority to adopt tougher air quality regs as opposed to,
uh,

556
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.430
those that are established by EPA.
So the safeguard principle,
uh,

557
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.510
cuts across all European law,
uh,

558
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.270
that gives the member nations the authority to set standards that are tougher

559
00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:33.104
than,
uh,

560
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.000
the unions want to talk just a couple minutes about a poverty,
uh,

561
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.820
and the environment.
And we haven't spent much time on that during the course.
Uh,

562
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:42.990
but,
uh,
uh,

563
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.280
the impoverished in the world generally face degraded environmental conditions

564
00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:52.200
compared to the more wealthy.
Uh,
and these are often ignored by governments.

565
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.820
Uh,
exposures to hazards are normally hire a,

566
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.440
the poorest are left to the most marginal lands.

567
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.550
It's kind of interesting to watch what happens in a town even in Connecticut,
uh,

568
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:06.720
when,
uh,
developers have built on all of the really nice lands.

569
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.090
And then you have the old town dump,

570
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.320
the landfill that nobody wanted to live near,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

571
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.710
remained undeveloped.
Uh,
but as the town's reached build out,

572
00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:20.840
meaning that all the other lands had been developed to the zoning density limit,

573
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.770
uh,
then increasingly you see,
uh,
uh,

574
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.100
lower income people moving into those areas.
There was the,
uh,

575
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:33.990
the Bhopal India chemical release back in 1984 that,

576
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:34.710
uh,
uh,

577
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.460
killed tens of thousands of people and injured hundreds of thousands of others.

578
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.300
Uh,
those people had,
uh,
uh,
basically migrated,
uh,

579
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.530
next to the chemical company,
uh,
and,
and set up camps,
uh,
that,
uh,

580
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:52.320
made them immediately adjacent to the,
to the edge of the chemical company.
And,

581
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:57.110
uh,
that,
uh,
that history,
uh,
I encourage you to take a look at it.
Uh,
the,

582
00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.690
the chemical release of a methyl isocyanate,
uh,
uh,

583
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:06.830
killed or injured people in a matter of several hours because they were so close

584
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:11.000
to the plant.
There was no,
there's no buffer zone to it.
So the,

585
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.540
the poor tend not to have,
uh,
access to capital.
They tend not to have insurance.

586
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.770
Uh,
they tend not to have the capacity to understand and to manage risk.

587
00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:23.400
The way that the wealthy do a healthcare surveillance is something that they

588
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:24.960
cannot afford.
Uh,

589
00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.980
and litigation is really an opportunity.

590
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.620
So as you think about,
uh,
uh,

591
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:38.580
the relationship between environmental problems and,
uh,
the,
the,

592
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:42.650
uh,
uh,
fascination and the drive that,
uh,

593
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:47.790
our nation has to,
to grow,
uh,
to produce more,
to consume more,

594
00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.160
uh,
to,
uh,
to become wealthier.
Uh,

595
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.270
I want you to think more carefully about this.
Uh,

596
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:59.100
I want you to think about whether or not this fascination with growth,

597
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.460
uh,
of,
of a bigger is better,
uh,

598
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:06.670
really is something that we need to confront a more directly,
uh,

599
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:11.400
the ethical affects of pursuing more,
uh,
more wealth.

600
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:16.020
Uh,
uh,
really have a variety of,
of,
uh,
dimensions.

601
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.320
Uh,
so that,
uh,
as you think about your own behavior,

602
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:21.900
your own pattern of consumption,
if you think about,
uh,

603
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.120
whether or not you really need that next iPod,

604
00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:28.250
the next iPhone or the next iPhone,
uh,
APP,
uh,

605
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.590
if you think about the kinds of foods you want to buy in the marketplace,

606
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.860
you can start thinking about these as ethical choices,
uh,

607
00:38:34.861 --> 00:38:38.320
and about to how they may cause a distributional pattern of,

608
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.940
of costs and benefits out in ways that that may not be easily identified.

609
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.110
So as wealth increases,
uh,

610
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.500
the opposite argument might go,
uh,
so to the following,

611
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:54.200
a control over modes of production control over,
uh,

612
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.060
labor and providing a labor with certain rights that they might not have had.

613
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.450
So wealthier nations tend to have higher protective standards for Labor,

614
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:05.170
or they have higher standards for the control of materials.

615
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:09.210
There's another mode of production component of the motor production,
uh,

616
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.990
as well as regulations on the use of capital.
Uh,

617
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:18.050
and the wealthier nations in the world also have more control and accountability

618
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:23.170
that's demanded of government.
Uh,
they have a higher education,

619
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.700
a higher capacity to identify risk.
Uh,
and as wealth increases,

620
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:32.140
environmental controls regulations become more sophisticated,
uh,

621
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.170
as does the capacity to buy insurance,
uh,

622
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:39.820
access to healthcare and the capacities to select risks.
And I,
and,
uh,
avoid them.

623
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.300
So,
you know,
one idea,
uh,
thinking about,
uh,

624
00:39:43.301 --> 00:39:46.050
whether or not there is a trickle down effect,
uh,

625
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.380
so as the world becomes wealthier,
uh,

626
00:39:48.381 --> 00:39:51.860
as the high income nations become wealthier,
uh,
is it,
is,

627
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.320
is there going to be a trickle down effect or should we systematically think

628
00:39:56.321 --> 00:40:00.070
about how we might redistribute wealth,
knowledge,

629
00:40:00.071 --> 00:40:04.850
authority in a sense of a collective ethic?
Uh,
and will this be a,
uh,

630
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:09.380
a stairway to improve environmental quality and human health?
Uh,

631
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.230
I want it to just a mention to and emphasize,
uh,

632
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:19.180
this idea once more of,
of narrative advantage,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

633
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:24.210
how critical it is given the scale of money that's being put into advertising.

634
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.960
So a half a trillion dollars per year in the world going into advertising,

635
00:40:28.961 --> 00:40:33.400
promoting products,
uh,
promoting,
uh,
economic growth and,

636
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.760
uh,
making claims about a product,

637
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:41.761
benefits and normally not fully disclosing what product risks or a product a

638
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:48.580
longterm,
uh,
damages might be.
Uh,
we talked,
uh,

639
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.580
on many occasions in the course about the idea of,

640
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:56.560
of ignorance as being an underlying source for environmental problems.
Uh,

641
00:40:56.561 --> 00:41:00.670
so I don't mean ignorance in a demeaning way at all.
I mean,

642
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:04.660
it's simply the absence.
I don't mean it to,
to infer the absence of capacity.

643
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.750
I mean,
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,

644
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:11.790
in for the absence of knowledge or the incapacity to develop that knowledge.
Uh,

645
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:16.840
but for no,
no reason of a personal problem.
Personal incapacity.

646
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.440
So what are the underlying sources?
Well,
illiteracy is clearly one of them.

647
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.630
A secrecy is another.
Deception is another privacies and other language barriers.

648
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:30.590
Uh,
but,
uh,
I'm increasingly fascinated by the idea that,
that,
uh,
uh,

649
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:34.750
legal control of knowledge in the form of trade secrecy,
uh,

650
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.210
in classified information or really critical targets,
uh,

651
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:42.050
that we need to manage more effectively in order to create a literate society

652
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:46.280
that might be able to participate in markets as well as in government decision

653
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.510
making in ways that will lead us to a,
a,
a,

654
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.710
a more health protective,
environmentally responsible future.

655
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.400
So secrecy has a,

656
00:41:56.401 --> 00:42:01.220
a very insidious and negative effect and we've seen it in a variety of cases.
Uh,

657
00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.130
it concentrates knowledge among those with authority and power.

658
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.110
It actually is a form of social control.
Uh,

659
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.210
so if I have knowledge and I kit withhold it for you because it,

660
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.070
it basically will prevent you from,
uh,
uh,
being able to compete with me.

661
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.060
Uh,
then,
uh,
that basically is a form of,
of,
uh,
its authority,

662
00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:21.980
its power for me to be able to control you.

663
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.160
A secrecy inhibits public intelligence on,

664
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:28.250
it enhances the persuasive power of elites,
again,

665
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:31.890
providing narrative advantage throughout the course,
uh,

666
00:42:31.891 --> 00:42:33.770
across all of these cases.
Uh,

667
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.800
I had mentioned the importance of looking at distributional effects and avoiding

668
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:41.140
what I call here,
the veil of averages.
If,

669
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:46.110
if you allow yourself to be convinced of arguments,
uh,
based upon,
uh,

670
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:50.720
statistical claims of,
of,
uh,
the effect on average is going to be x,

671
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.640
uh,
or even the benefits on average are going to be y,
uh,
then,

672
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.830
uh,
you should not do that.

673
00:42:57.831 --> 00:43:01.580
You should think much more carefully and deeply about distributional patterns in

674
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:05.890
society.
How is risk distributed?
How are benefits distributed?
Uh,

675
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.380
is there an overlap among the risks and the benefits?
Uh,

676
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.390
do we want to structure law in a way that encourages that to be transparent and

677
00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:19.020
overlapped?
So I'm going to close here and I'm going to,
uh,
uh,
just take a,

678
00:43:19.021 --> 00:43:21.900
a little bit of licensed,
and I apologize for this because you,

679
00:43:21.901 --> 00:43:25.700
you may think of me as being a paternal,
but,
uh,
uh,

680
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:29.920
this class represents,
uh,
uh,
uh,
I believe,
uh,
uh,

681
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:34.430
a class where I've now taught a about 2,500 Yale students.

682
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.350
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,
this,
this has given me a perspective on,
uh,
on,
uh,

683
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:44.330
success,
uh,
of my students as I watched them,
uh,
down the road,

684
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:49.580
uh,
what careers they take,
uh,
what,
uh,
how they come back.
And,
uh,
uh,
you know,

685
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:54.230
uh,
what recommendations,
uh,
but,
but also,
uh,
you know,
want to,
uh,
uh,

686
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.340
let me know that,
uh,
uh,
they're taking some ideas into their,
into their future.

687
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.150
Uh,
so,
you know,
what advice could I give you?
Well,
you know,

688
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.620
I would encourage you to think really carefully about what drives you morally.

689
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.360
Uh,
what,
what are your dominant moral values?
And A,

690
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:14.150
I've got kids your age,
uh,
and I say that to them.

691
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:18.810
Give me your top five dominant moral values,
uh,
and learn to,
uh,

692
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:23.030
understand,
uh,
how those values might guide your behaviors.

693
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.020
Uh,
and you know,
in my life,
I've often result,

694
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:31.070
I've often concluded that,
boy,
you know,
if I just listened to that inner voice,

695
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.730
a would told me,
uh,
that would have told me what the right thing to do,
uh,

696
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.680
was and it would have been a better decision.
So learn to,
uh,

697
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.760
learn to trust your instincts about what's really important in your life.

698
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.230
It's not just about getting Richard,
uh,
uh,

699
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.800
learn yourself and then teach others a year at one of the most prestigious and

700
00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:55.730
one of the best educational institutions in the world.
Uh,

701
00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.250
and it's just such an incredible privilege for you to be here.
Uh,

702
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:03.720
but I think now about it,
uh,
the educational experience that you're getting.
Uh,

703
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.880
you know,
not,
not in my course,
but in better courses,
uh,
as,
as a privilege,

704
00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:14.060
as,
as something that,
that really,
you have an obligation to carry on,
to,

705
00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.060
to expand,
uh,
the knowledge of other people.
Lead by example.

706
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.730
Don't just tell people what to do.
People see you,
uh,

707
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.680
being focused and disciplined and taking on the toughest and meanest,
nastiest,

708
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:28.620
and dirtiest jobs.
They're going to respect that and they're going to follow you.

709
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.820
So focus and discipline is really a key to success.
Uh,

710
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.130
I would encourage you to reduce your access to your,

711
00:45:36.131 --> 00:45:39.780
you're a reliance on electronic media.
Uh,
I,

712
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.420
I see students walking down the road,
um,
you know,
holding their,
their,
uh,

713
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.050
their,
uh,
cell phones in front of them.
Uh,
no conversations at all.
I mean,
uh,
the,

714
00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.670
the value of conversation is,

715
00:45:51.671 --> 00:45:56.400
is enormous compared to the value of communication via electronic media.
Uh,

716
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:59.340
body language,
uh,
understanding,
uh,
uh,

717
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.510
how emotion and rationality,
uh,
uh,
are,
uh,

718
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.380
are mixed up.
And in a language you don't get that from Twitter.

719
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:10.530
You don't get that from,
uh,
uh,
emailing people.

720
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.550
So I encourage you to think carefully about the amount of time that you spend

721
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.990
your life in that way.

722
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.430
I worry a lot about what's going to happen in future generations because of the

723
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:25.040
way that,
that your generation and those younger are spending their time,
uh,

724
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:29.280
not going out and not experiencing the wild,
not experiencing the natural.
I mean,

725
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:32.370
I can't imagine that people would have the passion to care about the wild and

726
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:36.760
the natural,
uh,
or the pure,
the chemical free,
uh,
if,
if,
uh,

727
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.810
they had not experienced it themselves.
So,
uh,
and,

728
00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:43.860
and that's the reason that I take my classes out to the Adirondacks are I've

729
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:48.750
taken them to,
uh,
uh,
uh,
Wyoming or to other places because,
uh,

730
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.230
they,
many people just don't,
don't have that experience.

731
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:56.550
They were not a lucky enough to have the experience.
I had one when I was a kid,

732
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:02.310
uh,
consume what you need,
think really carefully about what you need,
um,
and,

733
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.820
and,
uh,
you know,
how much space do you need?
Uh,
you know,

734
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:07.590
my argument with Croon Hall,
you know,

735
00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:11.040
how much cubic feet of space do you really need per person in coon hall?

736
00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:14.580
Is I look up at that 40 foot high ceiling.
Yes,
it's grant architecturally,

737
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:17.640
it's a wonderful,
uh,
aesthetic experience.
Uh,

738
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:22.090
but in the new age of being concerned about energy consumption,
uh,
and,
uh,

739
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:27.000
renewables,
is that a luxury that we can really afford?
Uh,
no.

740
00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:28.740
What you're consuming,
you know,
if anything,

741
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:33.310
you should walk away from this course,
uh,
uh,
being skeptical about this issue.

742
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:37.060
Uh,
it's hard to do what's in your environment.
Uh,
you know,
what,

743
00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:40.490
what do you need to protect yourself against a drive less?
Uh,

744
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:45.380
self propel yourself more.
It's uh,
not only good for the climate.
Uh,

745
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.780
it's great for your health.

746
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.310
And you remember the design of that Centers for Disease Control building a

747
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.200
specifically designed with that staircase that has,
is beautiful,

748
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:58.090
beautiful staircase with white glass panes going up the side of the stairwell

749
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.180
that encourages everybody to get to their office up on the seventh or eighth

750
00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:05.340
floor by walking up the steps as opposed to to,
uh,
uh,

751
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.600
taking the elevator that's in the back of the building,

752
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.950
become politically active regardless of your party.
Uh,
show up.

753
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.350
It's really pretty remarkable.
And I,
you know,

754
00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:17.650
I hesitate to say this in a class where,
you know,
I know a bunch of,
bunch of,

755
00:48:17.651 --> 00:48:19.870
you have a,
uh,
not shown up all the time,

756
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:23.790
but a lot of successes is involved in the social relationships that you've

757
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:27.800
developed just by showing up and paying attention.
Uh,
you know,
I,

758
00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.620
I have thought long and hard,
uh,
uh,

759
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.820
whether or not I wanted to adopt a Harvard law school's a prohibition of the use

760
00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:38.680
of,
of,
uh,
laptops in the classroom.
And I decided not to do that.
So I mean,
I,

761
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.610
it,
I figured that if I can't engage you a in a,

762
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:46.620
in a lecture and if I regulate your use of laptop and I also then I shouldn't,

763
00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:51.370
I shouldn't regulate it.
But I also feel that that,
uh,
uh,

764
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.640
those of you that,
uh,
uh,
uh,
are not paying attention,
uh,
you know,
there,

765
00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.440
there are probably some pretty good reasons for it.
Uh,

766
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:03.250
and the most important lesson I think I have for you is to be confident about

767
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:08.130
yourself.
And a,
I want you to think about this one,
uh,
uh,
really carefully,
uh,

768
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.080
because,
uh,
my belief is,
is really that

769
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.230
you wouldn't be here

770
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:20.290
at Yale if you did not have the capacity to change the world.

771
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:21.371
And you know,

772
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:25.960
how many yell leaders have had enormous influence in corporations,

773
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:29.470
in government,
in the nonprofit community.
Uh,

774
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.590
so that capacity is a,
it's an enormous gift.

775
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:38.200
And I'll leave you with one final reflection is that you may think it's really

776
00:49:38.201 --> 00:49:43.030
hard to induce change in the world,
but it's not,
it's really not.
You know,

777
00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:45.930
he demonstrate your passion,
you develop the knowledge,
uh,

778
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:50.440
you develop a coalition.
You can make change at any level of government.

779
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.270
So be confident about yourself and,
uh,
and,
uh,
go,
go in peace.

780
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.430
So thank you very much for a great term.

781
00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:01.350
