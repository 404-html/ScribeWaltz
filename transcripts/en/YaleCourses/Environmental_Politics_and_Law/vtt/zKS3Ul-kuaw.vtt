1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.600
Today,
we're going to turn our attention to the problem of recognizing and,

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.540
uh,
restoring hazardous sites.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.850
And you may think that this is a rather minor environmental issue compared to,

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.890
uh,
some of the others that are more prominent in your thinking.
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.891
uncovering the diversity of sites that have been contaminated in our,

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
uh,
history of success and failure of restoring them,
uh,

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.700
reveals that,
uh,
within the private sector alone,

8
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:37.701
there are some 300,000 sites that have been designated by the Environmental

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Protection Agency now as requiring restoration within the public sector.

10
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.800
If you look at only three organizations,

11
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.140
the Department of energy that we looked at last week,

12
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.260
formerly the Atomic Energy Commission,
uh,

13
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.790
the Department of Defense and the Department of the interior,

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.620
those three departments alone are responsible for 50,000 sites that have been

15
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.670
contaminated
next week.
When we look at agriculture,

16
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:07.671
we'll see that the repeated application of biocides are pesticides to the same

17
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.700
track of land for the purpose of,
uh,

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.420
protecting plants or killing a competitive species that,
uh,

19
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.280
these applications are leaving residues in the soil that under many conditions

20
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.290
would classify them.

21
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
We're justify classification to also be hazardous sites.

22
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.060
So the idea that simply because their agricultural lands that they're exempt

23
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.820
from the designation is quite interesting,

24
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.740
especially thinking about land conversion,

25
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.130
how easy it is to convert agricultural land to other kinds of more intense land

26
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:43.220
uses.
That explains a lot of the way that,
uh,

27
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.200
our rural areas have grown over the past century.

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.420
So today we're going to take a look at lessons from the Defense Department and

29
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.560
why the Defense Department,

30
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.610
while the Defense Department is pretty interesting to me and that most people

31
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:01.611
are paying most attention to the problem of private site contamination.

32
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.080
Most of the stories that,

33
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.590
that you may have heard of private sites might include love canal,
uh,

34
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.140
in New York.
Uh,

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.160
but every state has its set of private sites that are on a cleanup list.

36
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.010
And every state also has a,
a,
a collection of public sites.

37
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.290
So today we're going to look at the way that environmental law has evolved,

38
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.880
uh,
to identify and to manage these sites,

39
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.500
uh,
with a particular eye to what do we do with them in the future.
Uh,

40
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:36.420
what kinds of uses should we allow?

41
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.280
And that question often relies upon a subordinate question,

42
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.820
which is how risky should the site remain?

43
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:48.270
How clean should the site be cleaned up?
Uh,
what standard of,

44
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:52.140
of risks should be applied?
One statute that we'll look at,

45
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:56.100
we'll include the national environmental policy act of 1969.
Uh,

46
00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:00.760
really a vanguard statute,
uh,
that,
uh,
was adopted,

47
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.700
uh,
uh,
really at the,
uh,
uh,

48
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.560
the pinnacle of public concern about a loss of environmental quality,
uh,

49
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.670
the,
uh,
riding the,
a,

50
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.100
the beginning of the wave of the environmental movement or the second,
uh,

51
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.640
the second wave really of the environmental movement in the nation.
Uh,

52
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.620
the endangered species act is also relevant often to hazardous site management,

53
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.020
especially on federal lands.
Uh,
why?

54
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:27.400
Because federal facilities are often in fairly remote areas,
uh,

55
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.600
and those areas often include large amounts of acreage,
uh,
that,
uh,

56
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.860
provide habitat for a real diverse set of,
of,
of,
uh,
species.

57
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.480
The clean water act,

58
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.440
also known as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is often at play in the

59
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.220
identification of these sites in their cleanup because the chemicals that were

60
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:48.200
released run off into surface waters.
Uh,

61
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.490
the safe drinking water act can also apply,
but we will,

62
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.200
we'll address that later in the,
uh,

63
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.640
in the course as we deal with agricultural chemicals,
uh,
as,
as,
uh,

64
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.730
water is either taken from surface supplies and,

65
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.470
and provided for a municipal or community,
uh,
uh,

66
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.220
facilities to distribute out to,
uh,
for consumption.
Uh,
uh,

67
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.210
but,
uh,
uh,
also the contamination of underground aquifers is,

68
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:18.000
is extremely important and we'll touch on that this week.
Uh,
particularly,
uh,

69
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.350
looking at a case on Cape Cod in Massachusetts,

70
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.360
the Massachusetts military reservation,

71
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.210
the resource conservation and Recovery Act,
also known as Rick Rhe Rcra,
uh,

72
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.430
is also at play.
Uh,
that really is a,

73
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:35.431
a statute designed to monitor chemical release and movement if it is classified

74
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.400
as a hazardous chemical from cradle to grave.

75
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.490
That phrase cradle the grave is important,
uh,

76
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.830
thinking that once you lose track anywhere in the cycle,
uh,

77
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.370
it's going to be extremely hard to figure out how you might,
uh,

78
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.940
identify which sites are contaminated and how you,

79
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.460
how you might need to clean it up.
Uh,

80
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.580
the statute today that will concentrate most on will be the Comprehensive

81
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.550
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act,

82
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.230
also known as the superfund law.
Uh,
and in this case,
uh,

83
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:09.660
also,
uh,
the case of Puerto Rico that we'll look at today,
uh,

84
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.010
the Wilderness Act is also at play,
uh,

85
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.960
as well as the underlying authorizing statute for the creation of fish and

86
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:21.660
wildlife refugees.
Now,
why would that be?
Well,
it's a,
it's a,
a quirk in,

87
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:24.600
in federal environmental law that that many former,
uh,

88
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.780
highly contaminated facilities,
uh,

89
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.970
by the Defense Department a especially have been transferred to the jurisdiction

90
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.900
of the fish and wildlife service.
Uh,
they become the holders and the,

91
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.970
and the managers of these facilities,
uh,

92
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:40.300
in part because they tend to be biologically diverse,
uh,

93
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.410
but also for other reasons.
So let's just,
uh,

94
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.230
pause for a minute and take a look at circle.

95
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.200
A comprehensive environmental response.

96
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:52.201
Compensation and liability act passed in 1980 and then amended in 1986.

97
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.130
It contains certain principles including the polluter pays principle,

98
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.310
the idea that a,

99
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.480
those parties that were responsible should be identified and they should be held

100
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.790
accountable for the cost of cleanup.

101
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.890
So this statute was designed to clean up hazardous waste sites into respond to

102
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:14.891
hazardous spills and includes mechanisms to clean up abandoned sites or sites

103
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.530
owned by bankrupt parties.
So in many cases,
you find these old factories that,
uh,

104
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.760
have simply moved on,
the corporations have dissolved or they become bankrupt.
Uh,

105
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.080
so who's going to clean them up?
Well,

106
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:31.520
the Environmental Protection Agency had a fund that was created by circler,
uh,

107
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:35.450
that,
uh,
was generated by attacks on major polluting industries.

108
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.370
So the power industry,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,
the coal industry,

109
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.520
the oil industry,
uh,
chipped in to create this trust fund,
uh,

110
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.080
that was then used to,
to pay for cleanup in,

111
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.850
in cases where the responsible parties could not be identified.
So first of all,

112
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.810
the sites have to be identified.
Uh,
second of all,
uh,

113
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:01.010
an investigation takes place in which the government is really the detective

114
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.350
trying to figure out who did what,
when and how serious it was.
So,

115
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.940
uh,
uh,

116
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.470
this statute also includes a provision for what is known as joint and several

117
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:13.790
liability,
uh,

118
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.510
which means that any one responsible party can be held liable for the entire

119
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:20.460
amount of the cleanup.
So if you put a,
if you contribute,

120
00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:23.390
contributed only 5% of the hazardous chemicals to a site,

121
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.680
then you could still be held accountable for all cleanup costs.
Uh,

122
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.431
but then again,

123
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:33.431
it would put the onus on how the no one responsible party to track down who

124
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.280
else,
uh,
contributed the other 95%.
So it,
it,

125
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.590
it shifts the burden of,
of,
uh,
the detective work,
uh,

126
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.110
to the known responsible party.
Uh,

127
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.070
the statute created something known as a national priorities list.

128
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.230
So you can imagine if we're facing 300,000 private sector sites,
uh,

129
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.850
50,000 known public sector sites under the jurisdiction of only three agencies,

130
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.510
how in the world are we going to figure out which ones we should we need to

131
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:06.730
concentrate trade on?
Well,
this statute,
uh,

132
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.100
decided that it was going to create a list and I think of this as a listing

133
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:11.760
statute,
meaning that uh,
uh,

134
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.980
nothing gets attention and let's it unless it gets put on a list.
And by the way,

135
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.090
this is very similar to the safe drinking water act and that uh,
uh,

136
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:22.040
a chemical will not get any attention.

137
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.990
It won't be monitored by anybody unless it gets on the safe drinking water list

138
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.520
of,
of contaminants in early 93 chemicals on that list.
Uh,

139
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.320
and the endangered species species act is also a listing statute in a sense.

140
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.150
So the species has to be listed.

141
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.490
So in any case where you are identifying a problem and you were putting it on

142
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:47.750
list,
you're going to have a lot of political resistance,
uh,
to the edition,

143
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.840
the edition to list a,

144
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.360
because it means that someone is going to have to change their behavior either

145
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:58.080
to,
uh,
pay for restoration or in the case of endangered species,
uh,

146
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.430
to be sure that they use the landscape in a way that does not harm the potential

147
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:07.350
viability,
uh,
reproductive success,
uh,
of the species in question.

148
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.720
So these,
these listing statutes,
Safe Drinking Water Act,
endangered species act,

149
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:14.290
and in this case,
the,
uh,
uh,

150
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.260
circla npls lisc national priorities list that they operate by the second same

151
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.250
mechanism,
there's always a fight about whether or not the,
uh,

152
00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:26.460
the problem gets listed.
There's always a fight over who,
uh,
other,
uh,

153
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.750
which other responsible parties,
uh,
should be pulled into,
uh,

154
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.550
uh,
established accountability.
Uh,
and,
uh,

155
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.330
basically,
uh,
the lists themselves contain far,

156
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.540
far fewer problems than,
than are actually out there.

157
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.371
Right now.

158
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:49.371
There are about 3000 potential national priority list sites and a EPA is looking

159
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:53.430
at about 200 more.
They're likely to be listed.
Uh,

160
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.420
and there are 1200 roughly on the list.

161
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.540
And among those,
since the statute was enacted,

162
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.780
only 773 I had been restored.
And,
and,
uh,
you need to think about,
uh,
uh,

163
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.960
the word restore and very carefully because it implies that that,
uh,

164
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.730
the site was tested,
uh,
after the effort was made to,
uh,
uh,

165
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.760
to clean it up and whatever residual chemicals remained a posed an unacceptable

166
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:24.870
level of risk.
So the idea that,
uh,
you know,
the,
the contaminants could,
could,
uh,

167
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.270
still be on the site.
They could still be in the water,

168
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.180
but they pose an unacceptable level of risk.

169
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.170
This is an important concept and it's a highly debatable concept that,
uh,
uh,

170
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:39.171
is often defined by both a subjective and quantitative metrics.

171
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.330
So 70% of listed sites being restored,
uh,

172
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.270
are being restored by the original polluters.

173
00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:50.550
So that meaning that the responsible parties were identifiable and the remaining

174
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:55.050
30% account for roughly 50% of the federal funds right now,

175
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:56.730
because the trust fund,
uh,

176
00:10:56.731 --> 00:11:01.230
that was derived from the tax on industry has gone dry,
went dry in 1995,

177
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.070
and a congress never,
never a restored that fund.
So now,
uh,

178
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.440
the costs have been shifted to the taxpayers,
uh,
in the general fund.

179
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.080
So EPA is cost recovery right now,

180
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:16.980
ranges year to year between about a hundred and $400 million,

181
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.610
but 2000 defense department facilities are,
are exceptionally contaminated.

182
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.960
And among these,
there are certain types of facilities,
uh,
including the,

183
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.360
the,
uh,
training facilities,
uh,
where,
where,
uh,
uh,

184
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.670
different branches of the military would convene to,

185
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.900
to carry out exercises in preparation for warfare.
Uh,

186
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.690
particularly those that used a live ordinance ordinance means munitions or,

187
00:11:43.691 --> 00:11:48.610
or ammunition.
So that a about 750 training facilities,
uh,

188
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.650
exist in the nation and they cover an area which is quite,
uh,

189
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.560
quite large,
about 15 million acres.
So Connecticut,

190
00:11:56.561 --> 00:12:01.360
it's about a 6 million acres in size or maybe actually 3 million acres in size.

191
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.430
Uh,
to give you a sense of the scale of,
of area,
uh,
that,
uh,

192
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.760
he's under the jurisdiction of the Defense Department where there is very,

193
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:11.830
very little doubt about the extent of,

194
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.250
of a cleanup that's necessary on these sites.

195
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:18.790
It's expected cost more than $20 billion to clean them up,
uh,

196
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.720
and restorations not expected for about 70 years.
Basically,

197
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:27.700
it's being constrained predominantly by funding.
So for any of these sites,

198
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.260
uh,

199
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.060
and in this case we'll be looking at the defense department and particularly the

200
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:33.550
navy as the responsible party.
Uh,

201
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:37.480
there are serious problems of historical reconstruction,
uh,

202
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:39.140
that are compounded,
uh,

203
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.220
particularly by the authority of the Defense Department to maintain classified

204
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:48.700
information so they don't have to tell us what chemicals they used,

205
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.900
what chemicals they released.

206
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.200
They don't have to tell us the details of the military ordinance that were

207
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:56.780
dropped,
uh,
or,
or a buried,
uh,

208
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.220
so that they can claim that,

209
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.530
that it would compromise national security objectives if this information were

210
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:06.940
released.
Uh,
so it's often,
it's often a very difficult to find it out.

211
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.360
How certain is the evidence,
uh,
what's the standard approved?
It's necessary.
Uh,

212
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.430
does the site itself justify environmental restoration?
Uh,

213
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.430
does it justify individual compensation for people that live near it or worked

214
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:24.490
on it?
A,
say,
people that,
uh,
uh,
worked on,

215
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.510
on firing ranges or people that,
uh,
uh,
conducted exercises,
the,
uh,
uh,

216
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.530
gis that would storm the beaches a under live fire.

217
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.380
So are they eligible for compensation?
Uh,

218
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.980
what's the value of property that's lost or,
or jobs that were lost in the,

219
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:43.200
in an area.
So oftentimes when these facilities are,
are,
uh,

220
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.710
located,
uh,

221
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:49.240
they create a boom in the economy and the local economy,
uh,

222
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:53.710
for example,
in the Roosevelt roads facility was created in Puerto Rico.
Uh,

223
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.390
by the year 2000,

224
00:13:55.391 --> 00:14:00.391
it was generating about $300 million a year in revenue for the Commonwealth of

225
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:02.044
Puerto Rico.

226
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.680
The base realignment and closure statute that was passed by Congress in 1990,

227
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.570
uh,
designed to really take a careful look and see whether or not,
uh,
uh,
it,

228
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:17.140
it really made sense for us to continue having all of these training facilities

229
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:20.680
all the basis that,
uh,
are sprinkled around the world,
uh,

230
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.500
began a process of closing these bases down,

231
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.520
a realigning military activities,
concentrating them,
uh,

232
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:32.521
at a time when the electronic nature of warfare had evolved to the point where

233
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.450
where weapons guidance and weapons delivery often made,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

234
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:41.860
the practicing of,
of firing live ammunition,
a really unnecessary,

235
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.790
the precision of the guidance systems really,
uh,
diminished the,
uh,

236
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:49.630
the need for certain kinds of training and the release of certain chemicals.

237
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.900
So the,
uh,
the upshot was in this case that,
uh,

238
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.940
the Roosevelt roads base was closed in Puerto Rico and like that $300 million

239
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:00.200
was taken out of the economy.

240
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.770
So there is a property value loss also associated with these facilities.

241
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.240
Uh,
being recognized to a,
to pose a nuisance and different forms,

242
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.310
uh,
not just in terms of chemical,
uh,
uh,
released to the environment,

243
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:20.480
but also in terms of contaminating groundwater or,

244
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.430
or Jason Agricultural lands or the effect of,
of noise.
Uh,
I mean,

245
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:29.630
have you ever lived next to a,
an army base or an airport,
you know,
that,
uh,
uh,

246
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.640
the plane's taking off and Landing Creek,
uh,
quite,
quite a nuisance and a,

247
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.230
in this case,
a,
I had a call from a gentleman on Puerto Rico,
uh,

248
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.660
who told me that he was at a training site.
Uh,
just yesterday afternoon.

249
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.230
He was at a training site and,
uh,
he'd worked there for a,

250
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.050
the year between 1968 and 1969 on VA case.
And,
uh,

251
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.560
uh,
for often 12,
15 hours a day,
uh,

252
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.090
planes would fly over this site and vomit.
And,
uh,
as far as five,

253
00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:02.360
six miles away,
buildings would shake.
He said his quonset hut,

254
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:06.290
where his job was to prepare food for four Marines who are training on the

255
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:10.520
island.
The quonset hut would shake,
the cans would shake.
Uh,
and uh,
it was,

256
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.720
it's quite a,
it's quite disturbing.
So is there a psychological effect there?

257
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.570
So where should the burden of proof of causation lie?

258
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.390
Who should own the knowledge of hazards that are found on the island?

259
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.520
Should this be public or private information?

260
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:26.120
Many of these questions are similar to the questions that we asked a relative to

261
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:27.770
the nuclear weapons case.
Uh,

262
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.210
what level environmental restoration should be required and how should national

263
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:36.550
security interests be balanced against environment,
environmental quality or,

264
00:16:36.551 --> 00:16:39.710
or human health interests,
uh,
uh,
over the long run.

265
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:45.560
Now also you have to recognize that the United States has been in the business

266
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:50.480
of training troops for,
for,
uh,
its entire history.
Uh,
so that,

267
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:53.900
uh,
the,
the imposition of,
of,
uh,
you know,

268
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:58.760
dozens of environmental laws,
uh,
between 1969 in the present,

269
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.120
uh,
on that pattern of behavior is quite interesting to follow.
Uh,

270
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.730
how do you think the Defense Department would react to a new clean air act?
Uh,

271
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:11.460
that might restrict there.
Dropping a bomb said,
uh,

272
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.210
of course cause air pollution,
when you drop a bomb,
what happens?
Uh,

273
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.790
on the surface you get an explosion,

274
00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:20.240
you get movement of the dust and whatever is on the ground,
the plants,
uh,

275
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.330
the rocks,
the water into the atmosphere.
And,
uh,
you know,

276
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:27.650
just like the stunt team 90 story,
it goes someplace.
So trying to figure out,
uh,

277
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:32.120
uh,
uh,
where it goes and uh,
uh,
how to,

278
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.710
how to manage that in a way that,

279
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.540
that protects these additional values of environmental quality and human health

280
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.930
that the defense department really never had to worry about.
So,
you know,

281
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:45.430
from their perspective,
uh,
the concerns of,

282
00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:48.710
of the environment and health are getting in the way of their pursuit of their

283
00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:52.860
mission.
So under,
under situations like that,
you might wonder,
well,

284
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:56.730
what would they do?
How would that affect your behavior now?
What would it do to,

285
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:57.630
uh,
uh,

286
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.720
their willingness to disclose what they'd done in the past or to take part in

287
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:05.440
surveillance to figure out what happened to the,

288
00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:07.800
the chemicals that were released?
Well,

289
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:09.870
it's going to make them not very happy about it.

290
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:13.770
And not want to spend a whole lot of money on detecting problems that they are

291
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:16.320
going to have to deal with.
Basically the,
uh,
the,

292
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:20.300
the process of environmental monitoring and health surveillance is create,

293
00:18:20.301 --> 00:18:22.740
would create serious problems for them.
Uh,

294
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:27.120
just as the atomic energy commission realized back in the 1950s in 1960s,

295
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.450
the effect being,
uh,
that,
uh,

296
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.610
monitoring and surveillance surveillance often are diminished,

297
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.380
making historical reconstruction or really difficult process to follow.

298
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.960
So that's all with just an introduction to a one case.
And I,
I,

299
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:47.460
in my career,
I've worked on a variety of,
of,
uh,
military sites,
uh,

300
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.080
sprinkled around,
uh,
uh,
US territories and,
and,
uh,
thought about,
uh,

301
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.830
uh,
the,
uh,
the relative contamination among the sites.
And,
uh,
this site is,

302
00:18:56.831 --> 00:19:01.350
is particularly interesting because it is a lies off the east coast of Puerto

303
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.610
Rico.
It's biologically,
uh,
uh,
enormously rich.
It has some of the,

304
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:10.611
the most diverse a cluster of coral species in,

305
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:15.450
uh,
uh,
in the US territories.
Uh,
it also has a,
a variety of,

306
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.790
of different,
uh,
uh,
endangered,
uh,
uh,

307
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.270
species that,
uh,
are terrestrial and marine.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

308
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.690
thinking about,
uh,
the way that these laws apply to this site,
uh,

309
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.830
may help you understand some of the problems we face in restoration.
I want to,

310
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.813
I want to actually,
uh,

311
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.880
have you think about what this island was like back in 1939 when the military

312
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:39.420
decided that they were going to create it.

313
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.620
And when they were actually exploring different bases in the Atlantic.
And,
uh,

314
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:47.400
they,
they waited until,
uh,
uh,
Pearl Harbor,
uh,

315
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.390
when the Japanese bombed and,
and,
uh,
you know,
routed the u s navy and,

316
00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:56.430
and many,
many ships,
many lives were lost,
uh,
in 1941.

317
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.650
And they realize that concentration of their troops and their,
their facilities,

318
00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:04.050
their ships in one area was extremely dangerous.

319
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:08.310
So that they decided they wanted to have an Atlantic basin counterpart,
uh,
to,

320
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.920
to Pearl Harbor.
Uh,
they decided on the eastern coast of Puerto Rico.
And,

321
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:18.460
uh,
what you can see here is a,
the Roosevelt roads at the head of the,
uh,

322
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:23.040
head of the era,
which was the core of the base,
a VA case,
and Ku Labor island.

323
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.670
Uh,
so the,
the Roosevelt Road Station,
uh,
is,
uh,

324
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.760
a fairly large point that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean and a was highly

325
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:38.420
suitable for,
for uh,
uh,
birthing aircraft carriers and destroyers.

326
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.010
Uh,
VA case became an island,

327
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.810
a repository for a variety of different weapons systems,
uh,

328
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:50.690
and they built a perhaps 200 different Walmarts size bunkers,
uh,

329
00:20:50.691 --> 00:20:53.600
into the side of the mountains and the hillsides,
uh,

330
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.940
and stored just about every imaginable kind of weapon.
Uh,

331
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.720
at last count,
the last,

332
00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.820
the Defense Department a released the information more than 200 different kinds

333
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:08.821
of munitions ranging from land mines to 500 pounds to 2000 pound bombs that are

334
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:14.281
about as long as this stage is wide and perhaps about that wide in diameter were

335
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:16.870
stored there as well as nuclear weapons.

336
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:21.430
It was one of the largest nuclear weapons repositories,
uh,
in,
in the nation,

337
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.580
uh,
during the period of the Cold War leading up to the,

338
00:21:26.581 --> 00:21:29.850
the sites closure in 2003.
So the,

339
00:21:29.851 --> 00:21:33.430
the process of land acquisition is also interesting because it raises legal

340
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:37.120
questions that,
uh,
uh,
are also a constitutional,

341
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:42.480
and you can imagine that this island was a owned predominantly by,
uh,

342
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.260
uh,
several sugar plantations.
So that,
uh,
uh,

343
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.490
23,000 acres of land,
uh,

344
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.070
was purchased by the Defense Department.
And,
uh,
although the,
uh,
the,

345
00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:58.260
the land itself was,
was owned by only four parties,
uh,

346
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.680
they had fee simple in the land.

347
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:04.440
It also was the home to several thousand workers who,

348
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.600
who basically lived in agrarian lifestyle.

349
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.350
They were allowed to live on the land.
They had no fee,
right?

350
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:16.070
They had no legal title to the land.
Uh,
but,
uh,
they had built their houses and,

351
00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:17.800
and sometimes they had three,
five,

352
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:21.580
eight acres of land and they planted their own vegetable gardens,

353
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:25.480
a graze their cows or their,
their pigs or their sheep.

354
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.900
They had chickens.
Uh,
and,
uh,
they would,
uh,

355
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.410
take their horses down to the coast and,
uh,
they would fish.

356
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.360
So they were extremely poor,
making often,
uh,
uh,
less than 50,

357
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:40.480
$60 a year per person.

358
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.680
And all of a sudden the military decided they were going to take over this base.

359
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.980
And,
and these families were told that they had to leave their land.

360
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.290
They had to leave their houses often with only a 24 or 48 hour notice.

361
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.130
And with very minor compensation for loss of their facilities,
uh,

362
00:22:57.131 --> 00:23:01.780
each family was given a tag.
They were given a tag with a number on it,

363
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.170
uh,
and they were put on the back of a,

364
00:23:04.171 --> 00:23:08.470
a military truck and taken to the center part of the island that is called in

365
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:11.240
this shot the civilian sector sector.
Uh,

366
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.640
and they were told they should go out into the field and find their new
property,

367
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.210
uh,
that had a stake in the ground with a matching number on their ticket.

368
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.380
So the one of the leaders of the military resistance told me the story that a is

369
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:30.760
also in the book green intelligence that I,
uh,
I commend to you,
uh,

370
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.130
what it was like to be,
uh,
put out into a field and to,

371
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.200
to sleep through tropical downpours,
uh,
with literally no shelter.

372
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.250
So moving from,
uh,
an area that had roads that had water supply,

373
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:46.950
that had sewage facilities to one that had none of institutional,
uh,
uh,

374
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:51.470
facilities was,
was quite,
uh,
quite wrenching for the society.

375
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:57.110
So I wondered what it was like,
uh,
back in 1938 and 1940,

376
00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.730
uh,
before the navy got there.

377
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:03.460
Wondering if we could establish a baseline on this site to figure out,
uh,

378
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.180
you know,
what had happened to it,
how,
how the ecology might have changed,
uh,
as a,

379
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.610
as a way of thinking about,
uh,
uh,

380
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:14.130
what the landscape might be restored to and,
uh,
the,

381
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.470
the area of restoration ecology,
those of you that,
that,
uh,
uh,
study this,

382
00:24:18.471 --> 00:24:19.710
know that it's,

383
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.740
it's quite interesting and it's quite a perplexing and trying to figure out what

384
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:29.330
exactly it is that your restoration,
uh,
that is your restoration goal.

385
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:34.070
Do you want to restore a,
the species diversity,
the,
the soil quality,

386
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:37.190
the air quality as it was back in 1940?

387
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.060
Or do you want to try to bring it back to 1900?
Uh,
so that,
uh,
you know,

388
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:44.880
what your target is,
is,
is difficult.
So,
uh,
I was fortunate enough to,

389
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:50.000
to obtain a complete set of air photos at,
at a very high resolution,
uh,

390
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:54.320
that,
uh,
you can't see from this shot.
But,
uh,
uh,
if you,

391
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:55.190
if you wanted to,

392
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.630
you could go onto a website that I put together with the map librarian,

393
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.580
a parish here,

394
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.870
work with me for a period of two years collecting all of the imagery of the

395
00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:08.760
island,
uh,
over a period of,
of uh,

396
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.700
between 1940 and 19 and 2000 and in 2008,

397
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.440
uh,
so that now we have this,

398
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.420
this really rich ability to overlay a all the air photographs,

399
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.410
all of the satellite imagery on all the data files that are called geographic

400
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:29.411
information system overlays on top of one another as a way of thinking about the

401
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:32.240
ecology of the island,
uh,
how water moves,

402
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.150
how biological diversity has changed and what the,

403
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:38.570
at least the visible influence of the military might been.

404
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.790
Then we were also lucky enough that a,

405
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:45.650
the National Oceanic and Admin and atmospheric administration had put together a

406
00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:49.850
gis system for underwater,
for the underwater,
uh,

407
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.210
uh,
areas as well.
And,
uh,

408
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:56.900
then we found that the defense department had mapped with great precision,

409
00:25:56.901 --> 00:26:00.440
the ocean bottom predominantly so that they could navigate among the coral
reefs,

410
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.570
uh,
using,
uh,
vessels,

411
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.520
subsurface and also so that they could figure out a trajectories for firing

412
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.800
torpedoes from submarines or other projectiles.
So that a,

413
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:15.740
the quality of the data for this island is,
is just,

414
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.640
it's a spectacular for anybody that is interested in,

415
00:26:18.641 --> 00:26:23.330
in doing additional research that that might want it historically reconstruct

416
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:28.460
what was there or what happened to the environment in this site to,
and,
uh,

417
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:31.820
on the eastern part of the island that became the focus of the training

418
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:32.990
activities.
Uh,

419
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.920
could I get the lights dimmed a little bit in the back and actually just on the,

420
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:40.500
on the podium here,
if you look,
uh,
if you look very carefully,
uh,

421
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.610
you can see here is the,
the Caribbean coastline.
Uh,

422
00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.170
the north side of the island,
which is only a mile,
uh,
of,
of landscape,
uh,

423
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:54.060
is the Atlantic Ocean.
Uh,
but it's,
it's very,
uh,
low in elevation.

424
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.410
So you can see a lagoon stretching in this direction.
Another lagoon,

425
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:02.370
a over here and a third over here and a fourth over there.

426
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:04.580
So it's a very low lying area.
Uh,

427
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.220
so what's really quite striking is thinking about,
uh,
how,
uh,

428
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.770
when they were choosing this site as a,
as a bombing range,
uh,

429
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.600
they were not thinking at all about chemical movement or chemical fate.

430
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.450
So what would happen if you drop bombs on this area?

431
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:23.640
What would happen if you lobbed artillery shells onto it?
Uh,
where would they go?

432
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.890
So these questions were not even close to their thinking.
The island also,

433
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.400
uh,
this,

434
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.300
this is a shot looking back at the western end of the island where the weapon

435
00:27:34.301 --> 00:27:36.000
storage bunkers are a,

436
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.310
and they originally had thought that they would join the island to the mainland,

437
00:27:40.311 --> 00:27:42.240
to Puerto Rico using this long pier.

438
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.320
Here's another shot of the beaches along the island.

439
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:51.480
A really spectacular beaches on the south side that,
uh,
are,
are clean.
They're,

440
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:55.140
uh,
uh,
they're not chemically damaged.
Uh,
but you know,

441
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:58.740
occasionally as you dive in these coves or,
or in the bays,

442
00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:03.180
you'll see wreckage of a,
a plane that was down,
uh,
or,
or,
uh,

443
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.670
old,
uh,
unexploded bombs that are lying on beneath the surface.

444
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.130
So here's just an example of the kind of,

445
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.310
of a comparative analysis that a you could do over time.

446
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:19.311
Kind of wondering a how the landscape changed from 1939 over here,

447
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:24.120
uh,
to 1970 to 1985 and,
uh,

448
00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:29.060
into the 1990s,
uh,
where you can see up on the top here a runway.

449
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.960
Uh,
you can see,
uh,
different,
uh,
areas where the vegetation has been,

450
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.460
uh,
restricted and,
um,
uh,
either bombed out.

451
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.620
And this shot is a little bit higher in resolution.
Uh,

452
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:47.220
and you could see that there was a little star here,

453
00:28:47.221 --> 00:28:50.940
which has a surface to air missile site that became a target.
Uh,
and,
uh,

454
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.900
ships would launch their missiles from offshore.
Actually,
historically,
uh,
the,

455
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.540
the,
uh,
closer to the present,

456
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.080
you find a that the ships would park further and further off shore,
uh,

457
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.300
as the electronic guidance systems became better.
And,
uh,

458
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.690
more and more of the weapons would actually reach the mainland.
Uh,

459
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.620
the military argued quite vehemently that,
that,
uh,

460
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:15.030
you know,
we should,
uh,

461
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:18.030
the nation should accept the ordinance that missed the island.

462
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:21.660
It was a training ground.
People make errors,
and that's the idea is to,
to,
uh,

463
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.270
to help the pilots and help the,
the,
uh,

464
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:27.750
the navy and the marines become more precise in their,
their effort to,
uh,

465
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:32.370
to reach the targets.
They set tanks up on a,
on the hillsides,
the,

466
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.570
they also set tanks and aircraft,
uh,
along runways to become targets.

467
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.960
So this was not a,
uh,
this was not a minor,
uh,

468
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.630
intensity of UB target practice and training.
Uh,

469
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.530
I'm going to jump ahead here for a minute.

470
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.620
One example back from 1950 taken out of the New York Times,
uh,

471
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.710
demonstrates that a,
there were 80,000 servicemen that converged on the island,

472
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.420
uh,
in March.
It was a,
a,
a,
a group that consisted of the army,

473
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:06.220
the air force,
so the,
uh,
the,
the navy,
the marines from the United States,

474
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:10.780
but also from Great Britain,
from other allied nations.
So that,
uh,
uh,

475
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.510
allies would,
uh,
get together and try to coordinate,
uh,
land assaults,

476
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.320
era salts and subsurface assaults,
uh,
using live weapons.

477
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.100
They stopped using the adjacent island Culebra and they concentrated additional,

478
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:32.050
uh,
efforts on VA case,
uh,
which further contaminated the island,
uh,

479
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.600
beginning in 1971.
Uh,

480
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:38.200
one other point I wanted to make about this is that that,
uh,

481
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.340
if the public is trying to figure out and rebuild an image of,

482
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:46.480
of what it was like and also to understand what the government did,
uh,

483
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.170
it's extremely difficult because the military,
the Defense Department,
uh,

484
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.740
we'll restrict access.
Uh,
their,

485
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:58.510
their first response would be to,
a request for,
for access would be,
well,

486
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:03.310
you know,
it really is too dangerous.
Uh,
you,
you can't go on this site.
Uh,
because,

487
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.520
uh,
you know,
there,
there are unexploded weapons,
uh,

488
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:11.521
and we are the only ones that are trained to identify those and basically to,

489
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:16.830
uh,
uh,
uh,
figure out,
uh,
you know,
what the chemical risk is a,

490
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.520
so you basically need to trust us.

491
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.180
They would work with their own consulting firms.
Uh,
in fact,

492
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:26.730
the same consulting firms tend to work at the same kinds of sites around the

493
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:31.540
nation and they would basically provide reports to people that would be

494
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.550
unverifiable.
So the,

495
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:36.250
the level of accountability on a site like this is quite low.

496
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.270
The fence that you see here is really symbolic,
uh,
of,

497
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:45.230
of a limited public access.
How much,
uh,

498
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.080
how much weaponry was dropped on the island?
Well,

499
00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:51.260
this was a basic question and we still don't have a really good answer.
Uh,

500
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.190
we do know that about 200 different types of weapons were released onto the

501
00:31:55.191 --> 00:31:59.780
island.
Uh,
and during the period between 1983 in 1998,

502
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:04.010
uh,
the Defense Department admitted that about 80 million pounds of,
of,
uh,

503
00:32:04.011 --> 00:32:06.580
ordinance had been dropped on VA case,
uh,

504
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:11.590
so that if you extrapolate a roughly over time and correlate it with their

505
00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:12.710
disclosure of,

506
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:17.720
of a number of troops and types of exercises that were conducted,
uh,

507
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:18.981
conservatively,

508
00:32:18.981 --> 00:32:23.981
you could estimate that 150 million pounds of bombs and munitions were dropped.

509
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.100
Destroyers would sit off shore and they would lob these artillery shells onto

510
00:32:32.101 --> 00:32:36.490
the island.
Here is the USS Saratoga sitting off of a VA case,
uh,

511
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:41.530
practicing softening up the island is the,
a,
the phrase that they use,
uh,

512
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.580
and this would be followed shortly thereafter by troops that would launch a

513
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:50.880
amphibious vehicles from the holds of large transport ships,
uh,

514
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.290
that would crawl up onto the beach and a release the troops that would then

515
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:59.140
storm across the island firing machine guns at each other from,
uh,
at,
uh,

516
00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.960
uh,
uh,
troops that had invaded the island on its opposite side.

517
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.530
So what's in these weapons?
What was released?
Uh,

518
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.180
what we do know is that a napalm was released and if you've not heard of napalm,

519
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:13.490
it's a,
it's a horrific weapon.

520
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.240
It's basically gasoline and gel form so that when it's dropped it,

521
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.500
it will ignite and,
uh,
you know,
burn anything that a is near it.

522
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.590
A Agent Orange is another,
uh,
chemical.

523
00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:28.970
It's a combination of two herbicides that became infamous during the Vietnam
War.

524
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:33.800
Transport planes would fly over Vietnam and they would drop agent orange,

525
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:38.100
which is a two,
four d and herbicide and two,
four,
five t,
uh,

526
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.720
and the combination wood,
wood,
wood,
defoliate,
uh,

527
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.140
thousands of square miles of tropical forest in,
in,
uh,
uh,

528
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.640
both north and South Vietnam.
Agent Orange was also used on this island.

529
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.110
Also chaff.

530
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.610
Chaff is interesting and that chaff is designed to jam radar.
Uh,

531
00:33:55.630 --> 00:34:00.440
so chaff is,
is a,
a very small thread.
Uh,
it's a filament,

532
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.300
maybe several millimeters in thickness and to it formerly was wound with a lead

533
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.540
wire,
uh,
in the led would basically reflect radar.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

534
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:16.100
there were many instances where the San Juan,
Puerto Rico,
uh,

535
00:34:16.101 --> 00:34:20.150
weather stations would be reporting a thunder storms over a VA case,

536
00:34:20.151 --> 00:34:24.660
when in fact,
it was simply a,
uh,
a misread of,
of,
uh,
uh,

537
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.830
their radar that was bouncing off of the led chaff,
uh,

538
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:31.820
that would be dropped from these bundles out of the cargo bays over the island.

539
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.960
So led Schaff would eventually just kind of rain down onto the landscape.

540
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:41.120
So tens of thousands of tons of,
of,
uh,
led chaff would be dropped,

541
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.550
uh,
during Ariel,
uh,
air force training exercises in,
in a,

542
00:34:45.551 --> 00:34:48.860
in an attempt to disarm and disorient.

543
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:55.420
So as one example of the intensity of the attacks during 1978,

544
00:34:56.181 --> 00:34:59.090
about 1500 hours of air to ground bombing occurred,

545
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:02.120
a hundred thousand missiles were fired onto the island,

546
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.060
a thousand hours of ship to shore bombing.

547
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:10.270
So in one single year of 5 million pounds of ordinance give you a quick view of,

548
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.820
of an amphibious craft going up over the beach.

549
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.640
This is a small craft of the larger craft,
uh,
could,

550
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:21.670
could transport 50 to a hundred troops and their hole and they go up over the

551
00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:22.820
beaches,
uh,

552
00:35:22.821 --> 00:35:26.480
raising really interesting questions about the application of the endangered

553
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:30.560
species act.
Now,
the military argued that,
uh,

554
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:34.850
the marine amphibious training is much more important than worrying about,
uh,
uh,

555
00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.200
the endangered species,
uh,
that included manatees and Pelicans.
The,

556
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:44.130
the hawksbill,
the green and the,
uh,
the loggerhead turtle and the turtles.

557
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.970
We're very interesting in this history and that it's long been a site for four

558
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:53.640
turtles to crawl up onto the beach and dig holes into the sand right at the

559
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.200
right of the base of the dunes.

560
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.090
And the holes that they would dig would be between 18 inches and maybe 36 inches

561
00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:04.020
in depth and they'd lay their eggs in those holes and then they'd crawl off back

562
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:07.110
to back to the ocean.
It's pretty remarkable in the way that they,

563
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.740
they come back to the same island a year after year and,
uh,

564
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.520
between six and uh,
uh,
uh,

565
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.290
about 24 weeks later and the eggs hatch,

566
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.120
the little turtles a crawl up to the surface and they wander down to the water's

567
00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:26.850
edge and swim away.
Really quite remarkable.

568
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.730
These three species of turtle,
the hawksbill,

569
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:33.680
the green and the loggerhead are protected by the endangered species act.
Uh,

570
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.970
at the same time,
the military was a landing.

571
00:36:38.971 --> 00:36:41.290
Their craft on the beach troops would get out.
Uh,

572
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.560
people would be assigned to dig holes,

573
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.280
Berry landmines or a very munitions in the beach.
And,
uh,

574
00:36:48.281 --> 00:36:51.510
in one case,
a former marine told me that yes,

575
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:55.820
they had varied munitions in the beach and they really didn't have time,
uh,

576
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.560
to pick them up on the way out because they were,

577
00:36:57.561 --> 00:37:02.110
were late for their next assignment.
So they left the munitions,
uh,
uh,
uh,

578
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.240
buried beneath the beach.

579
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.660
Some of these were detected in 2004 when the fish and wildlife service took over

580
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:12.030
the area,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,
demanded that,

581
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.790
that the most sensitive screening of the beaches,

582
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.160
a curb before they would be opened up to the public.

583
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:23.120
One other interesting association between the case of nuclear testing and a,

584
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:28.260
in this case that was purely coincidental,
uh,

585
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.800
was this history of the u s has Killen commissioned in 1944.

586
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.180
So I action in the Pacific in World War II,
particularly in the Philippines.

587
00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:40.390
And it was eventually part of,
uh,

588
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.360
the operation hardtack,
uh,
including,
uh,

589
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.870
an operation in Wahoo and umbrella in the Marshall Islands in the new attack,

590
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.900
a toll in 1958 where it was one of those ships that were pulled together,

591
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.110
uh,
and,
and being tested for its resilience.
Well,
you know,

592
00:37:58.111 --> 00:37:59.640
as I mentioned with the,

593
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:04.160
the case of ships being sprayed by water and that didn't take the radiation out

594
00:38:04.161 --> 00:38:08.170
of the ship,
uh,
than being dragged back to Hunter's point in San Francisco,
uh,

595
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.520
for sandblasting,
uh,
they didn't really know what to do with all the ships.

596
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:15.300
And this one happened to be dragged by barge all the way across the Pacific to

597
00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:19.200
the Panama Canal,
through the Panama Canal up into the Caribbean basin,

598
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.210
and then anchored off of the shore of,
of a VA case for target practice.

599
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.900
So sitting about three quarters of a mile off of the shoreline.

600
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.490
So right now you can see the,

601
00:38:30.491 --> 00:38:34.110
the military base in the background and that Sam missile site I referred to

602
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:38.260
earlier and the u s has Killen,
he's buried right here.

603
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.100
It really is quite striking.
I,
I'd taken some students down to this site and,

604
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.730
and uh,
uh,
diving beneath it,
you see the hall of the ship,
uh,
you see,
uh,

605
00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:51.490
a bombs scattered around it.
You see many old barrels to,
uh,

606
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.120
and uh,
uh,
the,
the military is not released.
Uh,
what the,

607
00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.250
the content of the barrels is a,
but it's a bit worrisome knowing that the,
the,

608
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:03.280
uh,
uh,
the sand,
uh,
that,
uh,
is now in,

609
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:07.300
it came from the Marshall Islands area.
Uh,
but,
uh,

610
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.260
also it's quite striking that a,

611
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.850
the biological diversity and the region is enormous.

612
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.090
So there was one gun turret that,
uh,
uh,

613
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.730
my students and I looked into,

614
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:23.100
or Barracuda popped his head out of the gun turret tiger sharks that are

615
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.040
sleeping on the,
on the bottom of the,
uh,
the broken up call,

616
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.260
a parrot fish,
Angel Fish,
uh,

617
00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:35.110
just to really alive with,
with different marine species.

618
00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.560
It's quite interesting to hear the arguments on the part of the military and

619
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:41.630
other people that are trying to figure out what to do with,
with uh,

620
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.430
especially in metallic waste.
Uh,
and,
and uh,
uh,

621
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.640
many who have that problem are quite anxious just to go out and use the,

622
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.600
the,
uh,
the ocean as their dump.

623
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.370
And they can demonstrate pretty well that if they build a reef out of an old

624
00:39:57.371 --> 00:40:02.371
ship or old cars that it will serve as a pretty effective habitat for a wide

625
00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:06.760
range of,
of,
uh,
marine species.
Uh,

626
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.030
now this is an interesting example looking off the,
uh,
the coast.
Uh,

627
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:16.300
the several people wondered,
including a colleague of mine,
Jim Porter,

628
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.290
who's at the University of Georgia.
Uh,

629
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.360
Jim is an ecologist who was trained here at Yale and he's been working on VA

630
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:26.170
case as well for a number of years.
And the,
the,
uh,

631
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.200
navy tried to explain these circles beneath the surface of the water as being

632
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.860
created by hurricanes,
uh,

633
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:38.910
rather than being created by a bombs that had been dropped to creating these

634
00:40:39.011 --> 00:40:41.020
craters in the ocean floor.

635
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.950
So their argument was holes in the Va via the can coral reef are caused by

636
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.060
hurricanes.
Well,
you know,
it,
it's really quite apparent that,
uh,

637
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:55.060
this is not the case.
You see similarly sized holes that are in the landscape.

638
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.930
Uh,
but also,
uh,
Jim went out and,
uh,
uh,

639
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.770
constructed a robot that would,

640
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.260
would wander through these areas that had a live ordinance,
uh,

641
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.530
lying either within them or next to them.
Uh,

642
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.300
and we took take samples from inside,
uh,
the,

643
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.640
the craters and then from a various distances outside the creator.

644
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:18.370
I think I have a shot of this.
Yes.

645
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:23.370
And he actually mapped out the distribution of,
of some heavy metals,
uh,

646
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:28.060
that,
uh,
clearly demonstrated that,
uh,
these were not caused by hurricanes.

647
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.110
Uh,
the navy also claimed that higher levels of lead in the soil or,

648
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.800
or other metals.
Uh,
we're,

649
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:38.540
we're the cause of dust storms that a blue over from Africa,
uh,
so that,

650
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:43.190
uh,
the,
the island does experience dust storms during certain parts of the year.

651
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:47.780
In fact,
aircraft navigation is interrupted.
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
they,

652
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.210
they attempted to confuse the,
the,
uh,

653
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:54.970
their contribution with natural contribution to the level of,
uh,

654
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.810
uh,
chemical residue on the island.

655
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.470
There's one shot,
uh,
looking at,
uh,

656
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:05.960
the old barrels inside the rusting hulk of the killing and,
uh,
with,
with,
uh,

657
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.930
extremely healthy coral reefs growing right nearby.

658
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.210
An example of napalm,
uh,
being dropped on the island and what that looks like.

659
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.090
Also,
the,
the United States leased out bombing rights and think about the idea of

660
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.960
potentially responsible parties here.
Uh,

661
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.540
if the United States leased out bombing rights to NATO countries and other

662
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:31.300
allies,
does that infer that they are similarly responsible,
uh,

663
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.390
for restoration costs?
So Canada,
Germany,
France,
Britain,
Chile,

664
00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:39.500
and Argentina all participated on,
on several occasions in,

665
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:44.180
in coming to the island and,
uh,
joining with the training exercises.
Uh,

666
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:47.550
there was a website that the military had up,
uh,
for,
uh,

667
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.870
a good part of the late 1990s.
Uh,
and they proclaimed a,

668
00:42:51.871 --> 00:42:56.330
that this was a great site for one stop shopping,
so that,
uh,
companies,

669
00:42:56.331 --> 00:43:00.950
US companies,
multinational companies,
including a Raytheon,
General Electric,

670
00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:05.830
Lockheed Martin,
would supply and sell diverse weapon systems on VA case.
Uh,

671
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:10.610
and it was advertised quite heavily and it,
uh,

672
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.900
uh,
had many attractions.
Uh,
these are quotes that it was suitable,

673
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.750
a suitable area for over the beach and Ariel troop movement,

674
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.900
Wifi capability for most nonconventional weapons,

675
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:24.800
simultaneous conduct of gunnery missile firing.
Uh,

676
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:28.160
I don't even know what ATG ordinance delivery is.
Amphibious small art,

677
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.960
arms mining and underwater operations,
a missile firing operations,
air to air,

678
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.300
air to surface,
surface to air,
and serves to service.
Uh,

679
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.150
so that by the middle of the 1990s,

680
00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:43.151
the United States was securing about $85 million per year in payments from other

681
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:47.720
nations,
uh,
to,
to,
uh,
gain the right to,
to try these weapons.

682
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.100
So the representatives from Raytheon and,
and uh,
uh,

683
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:53.960
these other corporations would,

684
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.160
would meet the navy or the air force from other nations and,
and,
uh,

685
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.000
ask them if they would like to try out different kinds of weapons systems.
Uh,

686
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.590
and this further increase the intensity of,
of exercises.

687
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.340
Here's a shot of the weapon storage bunkers that I mentioned that,
uh,
uh,

688
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.080
we're designed to,
to basically maintain storage.
These were,

689
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.910
were really interestingly designed.

690
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:21.100
They were built into the hillside and then they were planted over the top with a

691
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.450
green roofs.
Uh,

692
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.130
you wouldn't think that the Defense Department might have been the first

693
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:29.210
designer of a green roof,
but in this case,

694
00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:31.980
back in the 1940s in 1950s,

695
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:36.000
they were building green roofs basically to,
to provide cover so that,

696
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:41.430
that,
uh,
uh,
satellites from the Soviet Union,
uh,
or other nations would,

697
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:46.150
would,
uh,
be fooled into thinking that these were just a small grazing plots,
uh,

698
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:46.950
so that,
uh,

699
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:51.420
they would lease these lands out to local farmers to graze cattle or goats on

700
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:53.150
the top of,
of these,
uh,
uh,

701
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:57.720
concrete structures that housed a weapons of all sorts.
The,

702
00:44:57.721 --> 00:45:02.460
the intensity of fire produced a,
an extraordinary mess.
Uh,

703
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.790
and if you look at the surface now of some of these craters,

704
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.750
you see that they tend to fill up with water and you need to imagine what

705
00:45:09.751 --> 00:45:13.330
happens when a bomb explodes on the land and it creates a crater.
It,

706
00:45:13.331 --> 00:45:18.331
it will break itself up into literally billions of microscopic pieces,

707
00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.700
uh,
pieces of what pieces of lead,
mercury,
cadmium,

708
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.380
aluminum,
different kinds of explosives,
including,
uh,

709
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:32.760
uh,
RDX,
Hdx,
t and t would be more familiar to you.

710
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:37.410
But it basically,
uh,
impregnates these chemicals into the side of the crater.

711
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:42.030
Tropical storms come along and they,
they,
uh,
we'll dump a six,
eight,

712
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:44.700
10 inches of rain.
On one occasion.

713
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:48.330
I was there after storm gene hit the island in 2004,

714
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.390
and in a matter of about 48 hours,

715
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.060
nearly two feet of rain had dropped on the island.
Creating those,
those,
uh,

716
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.880
low lying areas,
those lagoons that I had pointed out earlier in the lecture,

717
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.960
basically clearly creating a massive lake in the region.

718
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.520
So here's an example of the edge of one of these craters and you can see the

719
00:46:08.521 --> 00:46:13.020
vegetation growing quite,
uh,
quite well.
Um,

720
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:16.950
once you get up,
uh,
out of the,
the,
uh,
uh,
above the water table area,

721
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.150
and that is in part a function of the fact that that,
uh,

722
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.940
bombs often contain a fairly high level of nitrogen and phosphorous.

723
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.830
So in 2003,

724
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.030
when the base relocation commission close the site down,
uh,

725
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.920
and they stop exploding the vegetation,
uh,

726
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.920
it really has come back in full bloom and many different species are now quite

727
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:40.920
abundant.
And they're growing in these thickets,
uh,

728
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:45.030
basically making it almost impossible to see what the ordinance would be on the

729
00:46:45.031 --> 00:46:49.470
surface.
So it's more dangerous than it ever was before.
I was standing with a,

730
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.333
uh,

731
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:55.430
a representative from the house overlooking the site one day,
uh,

732
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.890
and he was exclaimed exclaiming how it was coming back,
how it was,
uh,

733
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.190
the site was restoring itself because it appeared to be so green and lush

734
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:05.700
because of this effect of,
of the fertilizers that were in the,
in the,

735
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:09.930
in the bonds.
I turned to him and I shook my head,
my head and said,
no,

736
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.470
you completely misunderstand.
It's not restoring itself itself.

737
00:47:13.471 --> 00:47:18.430
The bombs are still beneath the surface,
beneath the vegetation and a,

738
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.110
it needs to be cleaned up.
If you dive beneath the surface,

739
00:47:22.111 --> 00:47:26.310
you can see weapons such as this 2000 pound bomb,
uh,
being a,
uh,

740
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:31.050
measured by a Dr. Porter.
And He's also measured,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

741
00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:34.050
the leakage of the chemicals and the,
the,
uh,

742
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:39.240
explosives from the bomb into the environment and demonstrated the coral.

743
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.700
The coral are very important and excellent historical records of the chemical

744
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:50.140
diversity of the area and how it's shifted over time.
So as the coral grows,
uh,

745
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:53.830
you could test different,
uh,
uh,
uh,
depths from its surface,

746
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.380
and you can come up with a,
a,
a,

747
00:47:55.381 --> 00:48:00.010
a chemical matrix that will give you some idea of what's happened,

748
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.350
uh,
give you a sense as well of what the site looks like after the bombs were

749
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:10.080
dropped.
Uh,
the vegetation is literally obliterated,
uh,
and,
uh,

750
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.590
uh,
today,
uh,
it looks quite different than this.

751
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.820
So I'll pause there and we'll come back and take a look at several statutes on

752
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:21.910
Thursday that are particularly relevant.
Thank you.
