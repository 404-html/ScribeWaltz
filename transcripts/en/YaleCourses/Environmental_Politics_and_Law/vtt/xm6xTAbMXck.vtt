1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.600
Student,
a former student of mine emailed me last night from a Lake Tahoe,

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.970
Eh,
where they had received six feet of snow in the past four days.

3
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.170
Can you imagine that compared to a,
what seems like a,
a,
uh,

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.580
interesting day outside here.
The,
uh,
the,

5
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.600
the western storms are really quite terrific this year.
Uh,

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.560
if any of you are outdoor enthusiasts,
uh,

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.530
so mammoth mountain in southern California received eight feet of snow last
week,

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.110
squab six,
uh,

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.880
Jackson hole between a six and seven.
It's really quite remarkable.

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.400
One storm after another is pummeling the west coast.

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.360
So today I want to continue and conclude the discussion about nuclear

12
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:53.361
experimentation and have you think a bit more with me about guidelines for

13
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.670
experimentation and how those might be embedded into law.

14
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.580
And I also want to start out by having you consider the central challenges that

15
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.890
were faced by the president,
uh,

16
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.730
the Defense Department and the Atomic Energy Commission.
Uh,
so that,
uh,
it,

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
imagine yourself in the position of trying to figure out how rapidly to develop

18
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.380
the nuclear testing program and how you might guide it and what the central

19
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.730
purposes were.
So underlying,
uh,
the plan and the,

20
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.410
and the research was really the need to understand what our resilience would be

21
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:36.090
in the face of an attack.
The construction of weaponry that,
uh,

22
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.070
would be deliverable was one problem with that.

23
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.290
That was it more of a technical problem compared to wondering about how we might

24
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:44.610
survive an attack.

25
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.690
A central question associated with that is how to minimize human exposure for

26
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:54.200
what periods of time were necessary,
uh,

27
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.260
to prevent long term illness and how to decontaminate and restore the

28
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:00.360
environment.
Also,

29
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:04.580
how to convince the public of the need for continued testing as evidence,
uh,

30
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.130
kept leaking out,
uh,
into the,
uh,
into the press,
uh,

31
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.750
in a variety of ways,
uh,
but not,
not,
uh,
uh,

32
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.290
in small part because of the availability of detection equipment.

33
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.860
So Geiger counters were not,
uh,
uh,
they were not,
uh,
uh,

34
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.170
a technology that was required to be licensed or under the control of the

35
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.350
government.
Uh,
also the x ray film,
as I described,

36
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.960
being over exposed when it arrived at hospitals,

37
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.880
led people to understand that something was going on.
Uh,

38
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.740
they also face the challenge of how to maintain their secrets.

39
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.550
And they established a,
a,
a,

40
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:46.410
a very large element within their bureaucracy,
uh,
to work on,

41
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.980
on different processes to,
to,
uh,

42
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.670
encourage workers to change their behavior in a way that would minimize the

43
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.430
opportunity for,
for leaking of secrets.

44
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.700
And then the central question that we'll look at today is if you have a

45
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.830
population that's been seriously exposed,
uh,
how do you manage,

46
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.860
how do you manage their complaints?
Uh,

47
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.860
what kind of provisions would you make for them in terms of longterm care or

48
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.100
compensation?
So,
in example,

49
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.900
after example among the 2000 tests that were conducted during this period,

50
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.393
uh,

51
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.350
you find workers and military officials being intensely exposed,
uh,

52
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.460
those closest to the site experience,
the highest degrees of radiation,

53
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.850
often without recognition of what they'd experienced or without,
uh,

54
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.780
understanding.
Uh,

55
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.440
and something that was really quite remarkable following the test and the Bikini

56
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:46.360
atoll when you had a hundred ships that were lined up in circling the blast
site,

57
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.111
uh,

58
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:52.111
was that almost instantaneously they created a massive amount of hazardous waste

59
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.650
and they had no understanding of what the implications might be for dealing with

60
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.430
that waste.
And a,

61
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.730
if you step back and you think about the location of the testing site in the

62
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.430
middle of the Pacific Ocean,

63
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.780
they were very conscious of what really is become a fundamental principle of

64
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.040
managing the environment and a producing environmental quality,

65
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.540
which is the idea that dilution is the solution to pollution.

66
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.960
So that a,
the expectation that,
uh,
the,

67
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.810
the technological danger will somehow dissipate,
uh,
and a,

68
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.260
as it moves further and further away from the point of release across space and

69
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:35.530
time to pose no danger and eventually go away.

70
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.690
And one interesting idea behind this idea behind that the presumption that

71
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:45.691
pollution is just going to go away is that it's pretty easy to conclude that if

72
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:50.330
you don't have sensitive detection tech technology.
So if you don't,
uh,

73
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.880
if you can't see a pollutant,
you can't,
uh,
uh,
taste it.

74
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.820
You can't smell it,
you can't feel it.

75
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.160
If you don't have a technologically sophisticated surveillance system in place,

76
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.140
people presume that it's gone away.
Uh,

77
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.630
so gradually they realize that they needed to understand this,

78
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.100
this distributional pattern more carefully.
Uh,

79
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.300
but the assumption was that the atmosphere and the oceans provided almost an

80
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.920
infinite sync,
uh,
an opportunity for diluting pollution.

81
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.930
Interesting idea.
So they looked at,
uh,
uh,

82
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.670
billions of pounds of hazardous waste in the form of the ships and wondered,

83
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.770
well,
what are we going to do with them?

84
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.480
It was kind of curious what they did initially.

85
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.670
They decided they were just going to spray them with water.

86
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.460
So they brought a boats alongside the ships and they started hosing them off,

87
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.740
uh,
assuming that a,
the radionuclides would somehow a wash off into the seat.

88
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.390
Uh,
the sailors on the ship started scrubbing them with soap.
Uh,

89
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.020
then they found that the new Clyde's didn't dissipate.
Uh,
they use solvents.

90
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.010
Uh,
they started bombing them with a ground up coconut shells.
Uh,

91
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.650
and nothing seemed to work.
It's kind of interesting here thinking to that,
that,

92
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.240
uh,
the sailors are standing on the deck of an irradiated destroyer,
uh,

93
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.000
with no protection gear.
Absolutely none.

94
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.690
Actually in 1987,
uh,

95
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.410
and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion,
uh,

96
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.900
you see a similar degree of disregard for worker safety among those that were

97
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:34.280
brought in to put the fire out.
Uh,
and also to,
to,
uh,
clean up the mess,

98
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.730
dramatic misunderstanding on the part of those exposed,

99
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.060
uh,
despite the fact that,
uh,
the technical knowledge,

100
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.840
understanding the danger was pretty well understood among the people that were

101
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.860
giving the orders to,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,
the Gis here.

102
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.520
So one of the solutions was,
well,
let's bury,

103
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:58.580
some of it will just sync some of the boats that are in the worst shape,

104
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.670
or we'll find out what parts of the ship or most irradiated,

105
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.240
and figure out what to do with those pieces.
Kind of an interesting thought.

106
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.070
So you've got this atoll,

107
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.180
which is basically the crater of an old volcano poking out of the Pacific Ocean

108
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.920
with a few strands of beach.
Uh,
ringing it a,

109
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.740
you put a hundred ships in there,
you,
you explode a bomb underwater.

110
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.560
Uh,
and Michael Oppenheimer,

111
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:27.920
who was the first director of the Los Alamos Laboratory,
uh,

112
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:30.910
responsible for the design of the first atomic bomb,
uh,

113
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.020
that was tested at Los Alamos in New Mexico.

114
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.760
Uh,
Michael Oppenheimer warned,
uh,

115
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.890
very vigorously against exploding a nuclear device underwater,

116
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.520
especially within an a tool because it would create,
in his words,

117
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.850
a toxic soup that would persist and contaminate the coral.

118
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.610
It would contaminate the underlying sands and it would contaminate the water and

119
00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:02.540
marine marine life,
uh,
for decades,
but basically make that fisheries,

120
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.420
uh,
no longer suitable for human consumption.
Quite interesting to see the,
uh,

121
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.780
uh,
the moral and ethical arguments among the physicists who were responsible for

122
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:14.000
the design of these weapons back at that point in time.

123
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.160
Very compelling arguments not to use,
uh,
not to use these weapons,

124
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.820
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,
we're above a specific size.

125
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.800
Oppenheimer and his close colleagues and friends were branded as communists,

126
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.280
uh,
and,
and communist sympathizers.
There was some legitimacy for that.
He,

127
00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:36.830
he was a socialist in his own political thinking,
uh,
but it was quite,

128
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.420
quite curious to see the way the Atomic Energy Commission,
uh,
attacked him and,

129
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:45.620
uh,
set up spies to follow him and see who he was associating with.

130
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.280
You can now find this out by going back into this declassified documents

131
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:53.930
database.
Uh,
and then the trials that eventually were held,
uh,
to,

132
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.510
to,
uh,
remove him from the Atomic Energy Commission.

133
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.580
So they've got this waste,
uh,
they,
they don't really know what to do with it.

134
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.660
Uh,

135
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.420
they began to take some of the ships and drag them back across the Pacific to us

136
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.263
ports.

137
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.160
So here is an example of an aircraft carrier that was dragged into the port at

138
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:18.300
San Francisco called Hunter's point.
Anybody here from San Francisco?

139
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.050
Well,
uh,
you may know this area next to the Bayview community.

140
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.300
It's quite an interesting area.
Well,

141
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:26.200
they didn't really know what to do there and this was a,

142
00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:30.090
an experiment in progress and experiment largely without controls.

143
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.160
But imagine bringing the radioactive waste into one of the largest cities on the

144
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:39.940
west coast,
uh,
that was,
uh,
surrounded by people.
And then,
uh,

145
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.080
trying to remove the radioactive material from the ship,
uh,

146
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.380
by sandblasting it.
And sandblasting is a,

147
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.220
a notorious technology for simply a grinding of the way at,
uh,

148
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.280
at hard surfaces to remove the residues and what happens to it?
Well,

149
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.150
basically it just goes up into the air or if it's foggy or if it's raining,

150
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:03.210
it will rain down and then wash into eventually the,
the,

151
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:05.520
the bay hunter's point sits on the bed.

152
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.280
So you can see Hunter's point in this,
uh,
in this map from Google Earth,

153
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.470
uh,
over here.
And you see the Bayview district right now,
uh,
only,
uh,
uh,

154
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.350
probably less than a mile from a highway 101,

155
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.360
and like many other ports in the United States,
uh,
the port at Long Beach,

156
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.420
port a at Newport News,
Virginia,

157
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.810
up and down the east coast and the west coast and the Gulf coast.

158
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.920
You really find a,
a,
a contaminated soup of a variety of,

159
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.660
of different toxic substances,

160
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.390
often in rather close proximity to very densely populated areas.

161
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.490
So in this case,
it's also quite curious that,
uh,
uh,

162
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.860
this is now the site of a very active protest.
Uh,

163
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.060
many people that live adjacent to these military sites are quite concerned about

164
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:57.880
their exposures.
Uh,
and it also is the,
the subject,
uh,

165
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.690
the target of renewal effort in San Francisco.

166
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.330
The San Francisco Redevelopment Authority,
uh,

167
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:07.560
hopes to take a 1400 acre track of land and redevelop.

168
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:12.520
It is also happens to be a center,
uh,

169
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.310
of,
of,
uh,
uh,
uh,
ethnic minorities in San Francisco,

170
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:19.980
especially African Americans.
And,
uh,

171
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.840
these people are quite concerned that the same redevelopment effects,
uh,

172
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.620
will occur at Bayview as occurred in the Fillmore district.
Uh,

173
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.410
when the government came in,
took over property,

174
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.340
basically forced out tenants and the poorest and the community,
uh,

175
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:37.910
and gentrified it,
uh,
uh,

176
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.420
dramatically changing the socio and demographic characteristics of the area.

177
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.810
So gradually by,
uh,
uh,
the,
the late 1990s,

178
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:52.340
we had a pretty good image of what happened to all of these,
uh,

179
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.260
radionuclides at least in the lower 48.

180
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.700
So the surveillance was best in the 48 states,
uh,

181
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:05.701
also in Alaska because Alaska was the site of a variety of underground tests by

182
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:11.440
the u s but it also was a recipient of much of the fallout that came across from

183
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:16.040
Siberia where a number of the Soviet tests were conducted.
So that,
uh,
the,

184
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.660
the understanding of the distribution of risk,
uh,

185
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:21.400
was really quite sophisticated.

186
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.230
I'd say probably more so than any other chemical that has been studied or

187
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:27.970
regulated in us history,

188
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.440
so that these data were aggregated by the National Cancer Institute,
uh,

189
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.540
county by county.
And you can see the,
uh,

190
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.490
the red pattern indicating areas that,
uh,
uh,

191
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:44.140
residents received the highest exposure,
uh,
measured in millisieverts.
And,

192
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:49.030
uh,
uh,
you also see kind of unusual patterns developing in the,
uh,

193
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.860
northern rocky region,
but also as far away as a,
uh,
Indiana,

194
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:58.580
Illinois.
And then,
uh,
as I showed you the other day,
uh,
as the,
uh,
uh,

195
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.130
the cloud had squirreled down from Canada and met her rainstorm in New England,

196
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.960
uh,
the Vermont New York border as well.
So this became the,
uh,

197
00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:12.250
the foundation for a rather interesting compensation scheme on the part of the

198
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:16.410
government.
So if you lived in specific states,
uh,

199
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.890
or in specific counties,

200
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:23.130
you are presumed to have a certain dose of radiation that made you eligible for

201
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.660
compensation at specified levels,

202
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.140
depending upon the illness that you could demonstrate.

203
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.620
So you needed a physician's diagnosis of a particular illness.

204
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.760
It might be a thyroid disease,
it could be a thyroid cancer,

205
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:41.740
it could be a leukemia,
it could be bone cancer.
Uh,
it could be,

206
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:46.270
uh,
uh,
different types of blood disorders.
It could be genetic mutations.

207
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.950
But if you could demonstrate that you had an illness that was plausibly related

208
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.820
to exposure to an array of radionuclides,
uh,

209
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.640
it was matched up against this map.
Uh,
so that,

210
00:13:57.641 --> 00:14:01.030
that became the formula for a level of compensation.

211
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.630
The people that lived,
uh,

212
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.260
downwind are called the downwinders and $50,000 became eligible,

213
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:13.150
uh,
became available to those that met the criteria that were physically present,

214
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:16.700
could demonstrate that they had a residency,
uh,

215
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.360
in these areas for specific periods of time.

216
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.980
The radiation exposure compensation act of 1990,
uh,

217
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.820
provided for compassionate,
uh,

218
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.480
payments to individuals who contracted these cancers and other diseases as a

219
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:35.440
result of exposure,
uh,
during the testing period.

220
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:39.250
And also for those that were mining uranium,
the became the,
the,
uh,

221
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.610
the predominant fuel,
uh,
that was enriched,
uh,
to,
uh,

222
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.660
uh,
produce the,
uh,
uh,
nuclear fuels,
uh,

223
00:14:48.661 --> 00:14:52.650
those,
that a mine,
the uranium,
but also those that,
that,
uh,

224
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.150
transport it so that the,
the miners and the transporters,
uh,

225
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:58.830
we're well recognized as another occupational group,
uh,

226
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.190
that experienced high levels of exposure as well as elevated incidents of,

227
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:08.370
of disease when compared to a occupation or excuse me,
uh,
individuals that,
that,

228
00:15:08.371 --> 00:15:11.480
uh,
had received lower doses of radiation.

229
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:17.140
So a payment of 75,000 was available to people that were onsite participants.

230
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:22.470
In other words,
they were actually stationed there.
The,

231
00:15:22.471 --> 00:15:26.330
the military officials that you saw with the goggles and the sitting in the lawn

232
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:27.810
chairs with the shorts on a,

233
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.970
or those on the decks of the cruisers are those that actually were involved in

234
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.100
and moving into,
uh,
uh,
uh,
the region and,
uh,

235
00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:39.750
working on the boats and trying to figure out what to do with a mass.
So the,

236
00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:44.090
those that had participated in restoration efforts also are eligible.

237
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.320
Here's an example of a uranium mine worker spending a good amount of time

238
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:53.180
underground,
uh,
and being dosed at a fairly significant level on a routine basis.

239
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.680
So $100,000 was available to those that,
that,
uh,

240
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.090
had had been employed either above ground or below ground.
Uh,

241
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.070
if the mines were located in certain states,
uh,

242
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:09.110
and if they had worked at any time during the period beginning in 1942 and then

243
00:16:09.111 --> 00:16:13.400
ending in 1971.
So this is kind of interesting to me because it,

244
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.000
it really is an example of the government saying,
well,
here's a trade off.

245
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.670
You know,
we really need to conduct this test.
Uh,

246
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.480
we know that these damages are likely to accrue a,

247
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:27.550
let's develop a scientific foundation for understanding the probability of the

248
00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:34.361
link between a causal link between the exposure and the adverse health effect.

249
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.860
And A,
we've got to figure out a way of compensating these people,
uh,
that this,

250
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.680
this is an approach.
Congress thought would,
uh,
uh,

251
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.540
subvert a class action lawsuits.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

252
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.560
they were largely right.

253
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.970
My nephew is an example of works for the Justice Department and he works on a

254
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:56.270
native American claims.
Uh,
uh,

255
00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.430
for those native American communities that,
uh,
uh,
uh,

256
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.370
were believed to be intensely exposed.
So he,
he goes to the community,
uh,

257
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.970
he interviews people,
uh,
using,
uh,
a fairly extensive survey form.
Uh,

258
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.120
he tries to figure out,
uh,
uh,

259
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.890
their medical condition and this is especially problematic.

260
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:20.570
You can imagine for impoverished groups because they do not have adequate

261
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:24.900
medical care so that they,
they all also,
uh,

262
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.950
given the absence of,
of a,
you know,
routine care,

263
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.930
it's very common for the poorest in society to develop illnesses,
uh,
that,
uh,

264
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.080
progress until they're quite serious before they are diagnosed.

265
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.880
So the wealthier in most societies have access to medical care,
uh,
that,
uh,

266
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.140
allows for early diagnosis,
early treatment,
uh,
so that,
uh,
the,

267
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.290
the ultimate damage is often less among the wealthy.

268
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.300
It was a political science professor,
uh,
uh,
who,
uh,

269
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.680
was trained at Yale and,
uh,

270
00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.690
argued a in an article that a being richer is being safer in the world quite

271
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:04.380
generally,
so that a,
the richer have higher educations,

272
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:06.870
they have a higher capacity to understand risk.

273
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.080
They have also a higher capacity to take action to manage risk and the,

274
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.920
in the event of damage,
uh,
they either are able to,
uh,

275
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.580
receive compensation from insurance policies that they paid for or they have the

276
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:23.640
opportunity to go out and seek a high quality medical care.

277
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.780
It's an interesting kind of an argument.
So Richard is safer,
uh,

278
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:31.410
written by Aaron will [inaudible] who was a rather famous,

279
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.110
a political science professor at the University of California.

280
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.900
So what's happened in terms of these compensation efforts?

281
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.410
The downwinders,
those that simply lived in the area,
uh,

282
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.640
have now received about $600,000,
excuse me,
$600 million.

283
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.670
About 12,000 different claims had been approved.

284
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.020
The onsite participants have been awarded about $91 million.
Uh,

285
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.820
the uranium miners and,
uh,
uh,

286
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.870
the millers have received about a $600 million in the or transporters about $24

287
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.920
million.

288
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.920
So a total of about 20,000 people have been compensated at a level of one point

289
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:16.590
$3 billion.
Now back up and think,
well,

290
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:21.150
how many people actually were exposed to during this period of time?
Well,

291
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:25.920
the cancer institute did an estimate,
which was rather revealing,

292
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.880
uh,
by studying tissue samples from around the world.
Their estimate,
uh,

293
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.430
by the mid 1990s,

294
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:37.410
when the total world population was roughly 5.6,

295
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.180
5.7 billion people,

296
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.400
their estimate of those exposed was 5 billion people in the world exposed.

297
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.710
So any sort of compensatory scheme such as this,

298
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.530
uh,
would have to set boundaries,
would have to set limits.
Uh,

299
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.390
and our limits were set at our national border despite the fact that we

300
00:19:57.391 --> 00:20:01.500
contaminated,
uh,
tracks of land,
uh,
in different parts of the world.

301
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.180
And it was not as easily,
uh,
easily predicted.

302
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.260
As you might imagine,
given the,
the,

303
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.270
the role that climate played a relative to the intersection of the rainstorms,

304
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.691
uh,

305
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:16.770
with the dust clouds and also the long residency time of the other radionuclides

306
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:21.300
in the atmosphere.
So that Mexico,
Canada,
parts of Europe,

307
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.910
we're very heavily exposed.
Uh,

308
00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:26.520
but they did not have any compensation scheme in place.

309
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.940
Now I'd like to switch gears for a moment and talk briefly about medical

310
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:39.570
experimentation.
And you may recall from earlier history courses that,
that,

311
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.500
uh,
uh,

312
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.560
the Nuremberg trial in 1946 produced eventually consensus about ethical for

313
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.080
human error experimentation.
Uh,
well,
the Nazis were,
were,

314
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:53.950
uh,
uh,

315
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.650
quite active at experimenting on humans and violating,
uh,

316
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.750
most principals that now have been adopted by a nations or among nations and

317
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:09.160
also principals that have adopted by medical associations around the world.

318
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.180
So the,
the,
the Nuremberg trial was,
uh,
was,
uh,

319
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.920
conducted in reaction to a horrific experimentation,

320
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.070
uh,
without seeking consent,
uh,

321
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.900
without providing knowledge about what the purpose was.
Uh,
what the,

322
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:30.820
uh,
uh,
risks might be a without anesthesia.
Uh,
so that,
uh,

323
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.440
uh,
there was no sense of what the humanitarian benefit might be.

324
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.140
Uh,
and also kind of raising a rather interesting question.
Uh,

325
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.580
when you think about medical experimentation,

326
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.880
how should you conceive of the locus of the balancing that would go on?

327
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.300
No fundamental principle of medicine is at first,
uh,

328
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.400
the first principle is do no harm.
Well,
experimentation may do harm.

329
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.020
If you conduct a clinical trial using a new drug or you wonder about a new

330
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:07.021
technology such as a nuclear weapon or exposure to waste from a nuclear reactor

331
00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.690
a then you need to think about,
uh,
you know,

332
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.030
what the net benefit to the person might be.

333
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.420
Is it okay to think about this question,
uh,

334
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.170
as one where the individual that is exposed,
uh,

335
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.300
deliberately in the experiment,
uh,

336
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:27.570
whether or not the net benefit should be balanced against the individual damage.

337
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.803
In other words,

338
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.500
is it ethically responsible to think that a collective benefit in terms of,

339
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.410
of making the world safer?
If you believe that by,
uh,
uh,

340
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.510
experimenting with nuclear weapons and trying to figure out what our resigns,

341
00:22:41.511 --> 00:22:46.450
he would be a,
does it make sense to balance that against harm that would,
would,

342
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.050
uh,
be accrued by the individual?
So that now when we,

343
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.180
when we think about,
uh,
the,
uh,
design and license of a new drug,
uh,

344
00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:59.600
we construct the calculus of,
of good versus harm,
uh,

345
00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:03.460
at the level of the individual as opposed to at the level of society.

346
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.320
So for years I debated with chemical,
uh,
industry,
uh,

347
00:23:08.321 --> 00:23:13.120
officials about,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
uh,
ethical nature of planning.

348
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:15.890
But it's okay for us to be exposed to pesticides,
uh,

349
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.680
in food and drinking water or the farm workers breathing the fumes in the air as

350
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:24.220
a plane flies over.
It's a case and we'll talk about more next,
uh,
uh,

351
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:26.530
over the next couple of weeks.
Is it okay to,

352
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:30.640
to justify that based on the claim that,
well,
you know,

353
00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:32.240
if you use pesticides a,

354
00:23:32.241 --> 00:23:34.600
then we're going to produce a lot more food in the world.
Uh,

355
00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:37.120
so that will avoid starvation.
We'll avoid diseases.

356
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.510
So that's an example where you conduct the calculus at a,

357
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:43.180
at a very gross scale saying,
yes,

358
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:47.420
the population is exposed to these chemicals at a relatively low levels in

359
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:50.810
drinking water and food occupationally at a higher level.
Uh,

360
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:54.440
but it's really worth it because we want to balance that over the net collective

361
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:59.420
benefit of having an nutritious and sufficient food supply so that these are the

362
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:03.650
basic questions,
uh,
that were,
uh,
uh,
uh,

363
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:05.780
addressed in the Nuremberg trial,

364
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.990
but also surround the question about how to manage a compensation efforts.

365
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.250
So 23 medical doctors were on trial for murder,
torture,
and other atrocities,
uh,

366
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.470
uh,
performed in the broad name,
uh,

367
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.740
in their testimony of medical science in concentration camps.

368
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.750
Now,
in response to this,

369
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:29.840
the American Medical Association eventually adopted guidelines.

370
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:34.550
It included these voluntary and understanding consent of the subject,

371
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.760
prior animal experimentation,
appropriate medical supervision,

372
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.800
those treated we're expected to accrue some benefit or there should be some

373
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:48.771
overwhelming,

374
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:53.240
huge humanitarian purpose that served if the benefit would not be accrued by the

375
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:54.074
individual.

376
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.000
So thinking about these guidelines and then thinking about the atomic energy

377
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:03.020
commissions,
uh,
approach themselves to,
uh,

378
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.080
experimenting with humans is an interesting topic.

379
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.870
And if you go back and take a look at the Department of Energy Files,
uh,

380
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.540
which you can do on their website.
If you,
if you simply take a look at,

381
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.910
uh,
uh,
the release of documents that occurred during the 1990s,

382
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.800
uh,
many of which had been classified,
just see a whole array of experiments.
Uh,

383
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.340
here's an example of isotope injections at Brookhaven national lab.
Uh,

384
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.740
where the individual being injected had no knowledge of what he was being

385
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:37.310
injected with no understanding of the,
uh,

386
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.340
the radioactive tracers that were being used to understand how these compounds

387
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:45.620
get distributed in the body.
So,
I mean,
one of the,

388
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.090
one of the concerns at that point in time was we're releasing this technology.

389
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.940
We're creating all these new,
uh,
radionuclides.

390
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.990
How do they behave inside the human body?
Well,

391
00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.890
we all know that a radioactive tracers now are,
are,

392
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.810
are used to track the movement of,

393
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.230
of different to pharmaceuticals to the body to make sure that they can reach the

394
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:10.860
target or Oregon,
uh,
and,
and actually,
uh,
uh,
cure an illness or,

395
00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:15.560
or,
uh,
uh,
particular problems such as a bacterial infection.

396
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.670
So that,
uh,
being able to understand,
uh,

397
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.580
the movement of chemicals through the body,
where they reside,

398
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.670
what their persistence is,
what their metabolic rate is,

399
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.650
how they break down into other products and whether or not those,
uh,

400
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.510
are likely to be greeted,
uh,

401
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.900
excluded by urine and feces or excluded by a water vapor from your breath.

402
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.040
So these are all questions that are circulating in their minds and provided in

403
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:44.874
their thinking,

404
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:50.100
a rationale for experimenting on humans without asking for their permission,

405
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:55.230
without telling them the logic behind it and with no presumption that the

406
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:57.750
individual would benefit from that exposure.

407
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.530
So 81 studies were conducted that involve children's participation or

408
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:07.680
participation by pregnant women in radiation research.

409
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.360
21 of these were supported by federal funds determined to be non therapeutic.

410
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.320
In other words,
no benefit would accrue to the individual that participated.

411
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.640
Now also think about this and think about,

412
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:26.270
think about the logic of employing children and uh,

413
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.970
whether or not it is reasonable to assume that a child would have the capacity

414
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:34.230
to understand the nature of the risk,

415
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.180
to understand the perceived humanitarian benefit of participating in the

416
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:42.870
research,
uh,
and also to,
uh,
uh,

417
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:48.110
be capable of self monitoring for physiological effects that might be associated

418
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:53.330
with the exposures.
So by the way,
we,
we,
uh,

419
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.860
we fall down in this expectation that children's somehow,
uh,

420
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.280
should be capable of,

421
00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:03.990
of understanding risks by education or via product labeling,

422
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.810
whereas there are 80 million children in the United States today that really

423
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.070
have quite limited capacity to understand the nature of the kinds of

424
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:17.790
environmental threats or environmental health threats that we've been discussing

425
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:21.750
so far in the course.
Now that to me is,
is quite interesting.

426
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.560
[inaudible] if you choose to,
uh,

427
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.580
to educate or to label as a management strategy to contain risk or to manage a

428
00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:33.740
technological hazard or pollution that,
uh,

429
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.160
another good example of that would be,
uh,
uh,
the way we manage mercury in fish,

430
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.300
we don't set a limit for mercury in fish and then take mercury,

431
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.960
partake the fish that are contaminated beyond the limit out of the marketplace.

432
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.700
Instead,
what do we do?

433
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.500
We post signs on the side of a riverbank or on the side of a lake and assume

434
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:55.440
that that sign is going to be sufficient as a,
as a warning device,

435
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.860
do not consume more than x amount of fish taken from this river.

436
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.560
The logic being too to contain their mercury exposure.
So the,
the idea that,
uh,

437
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.300
you've got a large proportion of the public that is either illiterate,
uh,
that,

438
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:14.160
uh,
is not a technically competent and in order to understand that the technical

439
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:19.161
nature of the warning or not capable of managing their own health,

440
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:25.670
uh,
in,
in response to an adverse event.
So here are a couple of,

441
00:29:25.671 --> 00:29:26.500
uh,
uh,

442
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.090
examples of the way that the atomic energy commission was thinking about this.

443
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.400
Uh,
here,

444
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:36.420
the AEC medical advisor is recommending the suppression of evidence of plutonium

445
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:41.410
injection injections.
So not informing people that are part of experiments.

446
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:46.150
There are a large number of papers he argued that do not violate national

447
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:50.590
security but do cause considerable concern papers referring to levels of soil

448
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:53.440
and water contamination surrounding ADC installations.

449
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.360
Idle speculation on the future.

450
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:59.920
Genetic effects of radiation and papers dealing with potential process hazards

451
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:03.640
to employees are definitely prejudicial to the best interest to the government.

452
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.810
Every such release is reflected in an increase in insurance claims,

453
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:12.790
increased difficulty in labor relations and adverse public sentiment.
Very,

454
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:16.440
very curious.
So,
you know,
they're arguing that uh,
uh,

455
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:17.980
a logic for secrecy,

456
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:23.550
a logic for not seeking informed consent is that it's gonna make their life

457
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.700
tougher.
You could use the same argument to,
uh,

458
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.760
basically scuttle a surveillance system.
So basically argue,

459
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:34.150
well that's not monitor where this stuff goes because if we do,

460
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.210
then somebody is going to find out about it and it can be used against us.

461
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.980
It could foster public opinion that would,
would,
uh,
uh,
because Congress to,

462
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.520
to,
uh,
react to their constituency and argue,
gee,
you know,

463
00:30:45.521 --> 00:30:47.500
we shouldn't continue with this testing program.

464
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.640
So they're very deeply into this line of logic trying to figure out how they can

465
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:53.580
maintain public support.
Uh,

466
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:58.590
but how the very act of conducting a surveillance or environmental monitoring

467
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.300
could undermine their longterm plans.
In another example,

468
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.380
at Vanderbilt hospital between 1945 and 1947,

469
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.850
829 pregnant women were fed a radioactive tracer cocktails,

470
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.790
another at the University of Tennessee at the College of Medicine and the John

471
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:19.240
Gaston Hospital,
uh,

472
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.240
two African American Women Ages 22 and 33 or administered iodine one 31.

473
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.530
While they were nursing infants,

474
00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:30.730
four months of age and both mothers had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

475
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.560
This is curious.
I mean,

476
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:37.300
you take mothers that had thyroid cancer and you would dose them with iodine,

477
00:31:37.301 --> 00:31:41.680
which lodges in the thyroid,
thyroid,
uh,
that had been irradiated

478
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.080
infants continued to nurse and the levels of iodine,

479
00:31:46.081 --> 00:31:50.830
one 31 were monitored in the mother's breast milk and thyroid and the infant's

480
00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:55.220
firearm on the infant's accumulation of item one 31 in their thyroids with

481
00:31:55.221 --> 00:31:58.990
significant prompting the researchers to warn against administration of Ida and

482
00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:03.520
one 31 to lactating women.
So the thinking here that,
uh,

483
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:09.130
they understood clearly that,
that the,
the new Clyde mood from mom to,

484
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:14.380
uh,
the young to the kids,
uh,
via breastmilk,
uh,
but,

485
00:32:14.381 --> 00:32:16.750
uh,
they,
they really had no,
uh,

486
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.230
they had no concerns about what the long term health effects might be on the

487
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:24.790
women at Harvard Boston University in Massachusetts General Hospital.
Uh,

488
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.960
there was an experiment conducted on what they then called mentally retarded

489
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.320
children,
uh,
in 1961 at the Wrentham state school.

490
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.460
And it was designed to understand whether written on radioactive iodine could

491
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:41.090
block thyroid uptake of radioactive,
uh,
iodine,
or I had on one 31,

492
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.780
the National Institute of Health or the Atomic Energy Commission and the Quaker

493
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:51.430
Oats Company,
uh,
uh,

494
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.060
also conducted a similar study at the Walter Fernald School in Massachusetts,

495
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.280
also described by the AEC as being a school for the mentally retarded.

496
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.510
And the children were fed breakfast food containing radioactive iron and calcium

497
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.780
Quaker oats company.
Now that's interesting.

498
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:14.270
A Quaker oats was extremely concerned about contaminants moving into their

499
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:17.810
processed foods.
Uh,
and they were also worried about,
uh,

500
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:22.520
whether or not they might be able to block the uptake of some radionuclides by

501
00:33:22.521 --> 00:33:25.160
four to find some of their foods,
whether the other nutrients.

502
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.410
So could you put God calcium,
uh,
in oatmeal and a,
would that have an effect?

503
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.850
Well,
uh,
you know,
perhaps,
uh,
that,
that's an interesting study.
Uh,

504
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.060
perhaps you would want to carry that study out,
uh,
uh,

505
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:42.920
on animals before you conducted on,
on children.
And,
and why would you choose,

506
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:47.600
uh,
uh,
the Wrentham school or the,
the Fernald school as,
as a locus of,

507
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.720
um,
uh,
uh,
this type of,
of study.

508
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:55.460
So nine boys between 10 and 15 years in age and one a 21 year old served as

509
00:33:55.461 --> 00:33:57.980
subjects.
Uh,
and they were divided into two groups.

510
00:33:57.981 --> 00:34:01.430
So one receiving intravenous injections of calcium,
45,

511
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:04.100
and the others received it orally and the breakfast cereals.

512
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.150
And they were trying to figure out where this went in the human body.
Uh,

513
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:13.100
and what role it played in,
in,
uh,
blocking a uptake of,

514
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:14.690
uh,
uh,
other nuclides.

515
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:17.810
And several letters were sent to the parents of the students,
uh,

516
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.260
who would become members of the science club if they agreed to participate.

517
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.130
So the first appeal was made to,
to,
uh,
the students.

518
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:29.220
Would you like to participate?
And,
uh,
it's kind of interesting to think about,
uh,

519
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.120
the letter that was sent to the parents.
So I'm going to read this to you.

520
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.810
It gives you some insight into their,
their thinking and their,
their methods.

521
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.910
Do your parent in previous years.

522
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:41.720
We have done some examination and connection with the Nutritional Department of

523
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:45.620
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the purposes of helping to

524
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:50.270
improve the nutrition of our children and to help them in general and for

525
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:52.120
checking up on the children.
Uh,

526
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:56.060
we occasionally need to take some blood samples which are then analyze the blood

527
00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:58.820
samples are taken after one test meal,

528
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.240
which consists of a special breakfast meal containing a certain amount of

529
00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:05.040
calcium,
no mention of the radio knew Clyde.

530
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.670
We have asked for volunteers to give,
uh,

531
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.470
a a sample of blood once a month for three months and your son has agreed to

532
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:13.470
volunteer,
uh,

533
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.760
because the boys who belonged to the science club have many additional

534
00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:20.570
privileges.
They get a quarter milk daily during that time.

535
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.370
They're taken to a baseball game,

536
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.510
a to the beach and to some outside dinners and they enjoy it greatly.

537
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.710
I hope that you have no objection that your son is voluntarily participating in

538
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:33.920
this study.
The first study,
we'll start on Monday,
June 8th.

539
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.500
And if you've not expressed any objections,

540
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:41.880
we will assume that your son may participate.
Interesting.
So,

541
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.260
uh,
first the presumption that that,
uh,
uh,
they would,

542
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.240
they would,
uh,
uh,
legitimately ask the child before the parent,

543
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.140
uh,
the presumption that if they heard nothing back from the parent who might be

544
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:59.490
traveling or whatever,
uh,
that,
uh,
they would go ahead with the experiment.

545
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.620
Uh,
so
this,
uh,
these studies studies,

546
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:08.400
once they were released and came to the attention of the Department of Energy,

547
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.220
uh,
uh,
and,
uh,
President Clinton,
uh,

548
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.880
in 1995,
uh,

549
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.050
led the administration to issue an executive order on declassification.

550
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.690
So during the 1990s,
uh,

551
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.620
the Clinton administration was responsible for declassifying,
uh,

552
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.620
almost 400 million pages of material,

553
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:34.590
20% or so,
a reduction in the total backlog.

554
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.840
Uh,
but the new new cla declassification programs,
uh,
I have been,
uh,

555
00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:43.590
excuse me,
new classification programs had been initiated by the CIA,

556
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:46.860
the national security agency,
and the national reconnaissance office.

557
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.220
So that this period between 1990 and 2000 was a period where we were

558
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:56.250
declassifying more than we were classifying.
And a following,

559
00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.960
a 2001 September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.

560
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.870
Uh,
we've clearly gone in the opposite direction.

561
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.540
The Department of Energy,
uh,

562
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.730
was extremely embarrassed by the release of these studies.
And,
and,
uh,

563
00:37:11.731 --> 00:37:14.850
the former secretary,
Hazel O'Leary,

564
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.020
undertook what she called an openness initiative in 1993.
Uh,

565
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.920
and I went back through all of her records of the Atomic Energy Commission,
uh,

566
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.760
and once that was transformed into the Department of Energy,

567
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.140
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and,
and,
uh,

568
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.690
declassified a large amount of information,

569
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.040
the National Security Administration is now the largest intelligence agency in

570
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:42.390
the world.
And,
uh,

571
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:47.391
it is important to know that they have a power to classify at all levels,

572
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:52.020
uh,
and they also are exempt from the federal freedom of Information Act,

573
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:57.340
which means that you can not request any information from them,
or they have a,

574
00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:02.160
they have the ability to make the judgment to decline any request,

575
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:07.470
uh,
and not give you any reason for that.
So last year we spent,

576
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:10.510
uh,
uh,
this is actually a year and a half old now.
Uh,

577
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.910
we spent almost $25 billion,
uh,
on secret programs,

578
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.580
uh,
secret programs for surveillance,

579
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.190
for containment technologies to,
uh,
uh,

580
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:25.420
eavesdrop via computer reading emails.
Uh,

581
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.800
also watching the way that people surf the Internet.
Uh,

582
00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.740
so that the surveillance efforts on the part of the government that remain

583
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:34.680
classified,
I'll have never been higher in human history.

584
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.190
So,
uh,
let's,
uh,

585
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.280
pause and reflect over the past couple of lectures and think about some of the

586
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:45.630
key lessons,
one lesson that,
uh,

587
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:49.390
is extremely important and I hope five years down the road,

588
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:54.100
if you have,
if I have any hope of you remember anything about this course,

589
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.500
I want you to think about one issue.

590
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.660
And that is if you want to manage the environment,

591
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.770
you've got to think a lot about the principle of persistence.

592
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.870
How long does a danger persist,
how is it distributed?

593
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.460
Uh,
how does it move through the environment,
the atmosphere of the water,

594
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.140
the soils,
and the food?
And I'm struck,
uh,
I'm,
I'm really struck by the,

595
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.520
uh,

596
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.900
importance of food as being a primary route of exposure to many of the

597
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:24.850
radionuclides in this case.
Uh,

598
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:29.450
but it's also the primary routes of exposure to many pollutants and a other

599
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:31.480
synthetic chemicals in the food supply.
Today,

600
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.710
I gave a lecture yesterday afternoon on,
on,
uh,
uh,

601
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.290
regulation of food in the United States.

602
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.850
And I came to the conclusion that,
uh,
uh,

603
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:47.130
food is often the predominant route of exposure and you often need to think

604
00:39:47.171 --> 00:39:50.650
about controlling air pollution because of how it might get into the food
supply.

605
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.890
So really,
uh,
the strontium 90 story,

606
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.330
the had I won 31 story and,
uh,
uh,

607
00:39:58.331 --> 00:40:02.500
also the CCM story as well is one about air pollution.

608
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.080
It's about,
uh,
having,
uh,
uh,

609
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.560
the idea that it's okay to release this material to the environment and that

610
00:40:08.561 --> 00:40:11.770
it's not going to come back to haunt us in the form of water pollution or air

611
00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:12.604
pollution.

612
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:17.740
But where it seems to pose the greatest amount of threat where it concentrates

613
00:40:17.741 --> 00:40:21.430
the most is in the food chain.
So if,
uh,

614
00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:22.750
if it gets into the atmosphere,

615
00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:27.751
it's likely to get into every other compartment of the environment and then it's

616
00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:32.800
likely to boomerang back to us,
uh,
in the form of a food contaminant.

617
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:38.440
This case demonstrated also,
uh,
the length of time,

618
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:42.220
the enormous amount of science that needed to be conducted in order to figure

619
00:40:42.221 --> 00:40:45.610
out what happens to these chemicals in the human body.
Yes,

620
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:49.150
you could think from a medical researchers perspective that it was legitimate to

621
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.930
two.
I think about the need for human experimentation to figure out where these

622
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.990
compounds go in the human body.
Uh,
and,

623
00:40:55.991 --> 00:41:00.850
and also to think about the need for long term medical surveillance to figure

624
00:41:00.851 --> 00:41:05.530
out what the effects of exposure at different doses might be.
Uh,
but,
uh,

625
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:08.240
there are experimental guidelines that a,

626
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:13.260
you could now imagine that you would want in place before the government would

627
00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:18.460
have authority to conduct those,
those types of tests.
Uh,
this is a case,
uh,

628
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:23.080
probably the best case in the history that we've got.
Uh,

629
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.820
the history of environmental science,

630
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.620
about expert understanding of a dose response relationship,
uh,

631
00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.200
understanding what dose posed a specific threat.

632
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.020
And also it is pro perhaps the first case,
uh,

633
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.930
in the United States at least,
uh,

634
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:42.630
where we had an understanding that these chemicals behave very differently,
uh,

635
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.450
in the fetus.
Uh,
they behave very differently in people that,
uh,
uh,

636
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.180
have a different genetic characteristics.
Uh,

637
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:53.160
they'd behave differently in the young compared to the old,
uh,

638
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:57.110
and that they concentrate in different parts of the body,
uh,
at different ages.

639
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.890
So this idea of susceptibility that now has become a hallmark of a US

640
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.380
environmental law and really a fundamental principle of European environmental

641
00:42:06.381 --> 00:42:10.640
law.
Looking and thinking about,
uh,
everybody is not being average,

642
00:42:10.641 --> 00:42:13.970
but looking at differences in physiology and these other characteristics,

643
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.530
susceptibility is,
is now an extremely important,
uh,
uh,
factor in,

644
00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:23.531
in thinking about risk and therefore becomes a critical foundation for thinking

645
00:42:25.341 --> 00:42:29.780
about different risk management strategies like setting levels for allowable

646
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:32.090
contamination in air,
food and water.

647
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.470
Don't forget in this case as well,
that uh,
uh,

648
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:40.940
this entire history took place between 46,

649
00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:46.010
1945 actually the first test and 1963 when the atmospheric testing stopped by

650
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:53.180
the limited test ban treaty.
So in this compressed 18 year period,

651
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.190
what environmental law is,
did we have in place,
uh,
to control exposure.

652
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:02.960
We had nothing.
We had no clean air act.
We had no safe drinking water act.

653
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.120
We had no toxic substance control act.

654
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:09.050
We had no superfund act too to try to figure out what to do with these highly

655
00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:11.630
contaminated sites.
We had no food,

656
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:16.130
drug and cosmetic act that looked at radionuclides levels in different foods.
Uh,

657
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.360
we had no food and Drug Administration that,
uh,
uh,

658
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:24.110
might be responsible for looking for radionuclides in different types of foods.

659
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.300
Uh,
we had no understanding of whether or not the,

660
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:32.330
the chemicals bio concentrated during the process of,
of,

661
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:36.620
uh,
taking a,
a,
a,
a raw corn and turning it into corn oil,

662
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.120
or extracting the water out of a grape to make a reason so that,
uh,

663
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.560
none of this regulatory authority existed during this 18 year period.

664
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.820
So,
uh,
at the same time,
uh,

665
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.630
what we'll see over the next several weeks is that,
uh,

666
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:58.850
this history is extremely important and providing a paradigm for understanding

667
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:01.700
environmental quality,
uh,
and the,
uh,

668
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:06.440
distribution of pollution that was picked up and was dropped into food safety

669
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:08.570
law,
dropped into air quality law,

670
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.870
dropped into thinking about hazardous materials management.

671
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:16.430
So it's become a very important component of environmental law,

672
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.380
also a leader in the term when we think about the current status and the future

673
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:26.060
of,
of nuclear power.
Uh,
we're not going to,

674
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.030
we're not going to move into this discussion too deeply today,

675
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:34.420
but I want you to think about the similarity between what we learned,
uh,
in,
in,

676
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.790
uh,
uh,
by 1963 and then what we learned from the Chernobyl event.

677
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:43.770
Uh,
so Chernobyl,
uh,
is a nuclear reactor located in,
in,
uh,

678
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.560
just outside of Kiev and a little village called Pripyat.
Uh,

679
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.220
and it exploded and it caught on fire.
And the,
the,
uh,

680
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:57.420
the roof blew off of it back in 1986 and I don't know,
uh,
let's see.

681
00:44:57.421 --> 00:44:59.970
1986,
I,
I suppose that you would not,

682
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:03.750
most of you would not have been alive in 1986,
uh,
but your parents would,
uh,

683
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:08.700
would remember this and you are walking around probably still with radionuclides

684
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:10.320
in your body that,
uh,
uh,

685
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:15.321
resulted from your intake of foods that were contaminated as the amount of,

686
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.770
of a material that reach the atmosphere.
Also went into global circulation,

687
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:23.940
also rained down around the world,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

688
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.270
exposed to almost everyone,
uh,

689
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.030
at a lower level than it was experienced during the atomic weapons testing.

690
00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.990
A couple of key points of comparison here.

691
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.740
One is that the expectation on the part of the Soviet government,
uh,

692
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.760
then responsible for managing this site was that they needed to manage and test

693
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:48.150
for contamination in close proximity to that site.

694
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.350
They were most worried about getting people out of that zone by evacuating them

695
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:56.070
out,
uh,
within roughly about a 10 to 15 kilometer radius.

696
00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.580
If you remember that donut,

697
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.150
remember the donut that I had up there surrounding the map,
uh,

698
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.140
in Nevada that demonstrated the way that the atomic energy commission had

699
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:11.260
similarly underestimated,
uh,
the movement of radionuclides.
Uh,

700
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.420
the same happened here gradually after they expanded their testing,

701
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:20.421
they found that the eventual distributional pattern is designated by the red on

702
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:24.870
this map is the most intensely contaminated zone.

703
00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.310
So a few,
uh,
look,
uh,
look at this.

704
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:33.580
You see that a certain of these zones were confiscated,
some were confiscated,
uh,

705
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.610
even more than 150 miles away from the site of,
of,
of the fire.

706
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:43.550
Uh,
there is a very important story here about the absence of surveillance,
uh,

707
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:46.800
leading to a perception of,
of,
uh,
environmental purity.

708
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.920
So that gradually over a period of time,
you know,

709
00:46:49.921 --> 00:46:53.520
as a Soviet Union collapsed in the amount of surveillance expanded,

710
00:46:53.521 --> 00:46:55.800
the quality of the testing got better.

711
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.910
They realize that these new Clyde's had a seriously contaminated,

712
00:46:59.911 --> 00:47:01.020
a huge track of,

713
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:05.040
of landscape in the eastern European nations.

714
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.440
And they,
they basically made to agricultural productivity impossible.

715
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.710
Uh,
they made future forestry in this area.
Impossible.

716
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:19.080
The forests surrounding a Kia of now have taken up the radionuclides.

717
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.940
Uh,
so if you,
uh,
if you cut those down and you build a house out of the material,

718
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.010
uh,
you basically would be exposing your,

719
00:47:26.011 --> 00:47:30.580
you yourself or your family to the material or if there is a serious forest fire

720
00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:31.600
in that region today,

721
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.420
and there's been about a six or seven year drought and Eastern Europe.

722
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:38.650
So this is a serious concern at forest fire would basically cause the,

723
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:41.140
these radionuclides to go back up into circulation.

724
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:43.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

725
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.180
<v 0>Just as on Bikini atoll where they decided,
well,
you know,</v>

726
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.340
let's restore the site,

727
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.870
let's take off the top meter or two of soil and we'll bring in fresh soil that

728
00:47:52.871 --> 00:47:56.800
so that they can,
they can grow crops again.
They still thought that,
uh,

729
00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:01.360
this would be the effective,
uh,
restoration technique,
uh,

730
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.900
in the,
uh,
uh,
Ukraine.
But they found that,
uh,

731
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.590
it was an overwhelming area that had been contaminated.

732
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.940
3,200 square kilometers,
uh,

733
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.400
76,000 square kilometers,

734
00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.950
had a detectable levels of,
of,
uh,
uh,

735
00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.570
radiation and 3 million people lived in these zones.
So what do you do with it?

736
00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.050
What do you,
what do you do with,
uh,
uh,
the,

737
00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.180
the structures that have been contaminated?

738
00:48:32.181 --> 00:48:35.900
What do you do with the equipment that's been contaminated?
Uh,
in this case,

739
00:48:35.901 --> 00:48:38.010
they decided they were going to bury it.
Uh,

740
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.820
so they dug deep trenches and they'd buried,
uh,
uh,

741
00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:44.000
the military equipment they built and they dug,
dug trenches.
The,

742
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:48.890
the drove the fire trucks into them and buried the firetrucks.
They buried cars.

743
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.940
Uh,
so that they basically figured,
well,
this is one solution to the problem.

744
00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.600
In a slight aside,
it was kind of interesting that,
uh,

745
00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.250
when they would vary the cars,

746
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.270
people would be watching as they buried the cars and then they would go and dig

747
00:49:02.271 --> 00:49:05.210
up the cars and take the car parts out at night,
uh,

748
00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.340
and then sell the car parts on the black market.

749
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:12.300
There's really quite a similarity here between,
uh,
the problem of,

750
00:49:12.301 --> 00:49:17.301
of creating a hazardous waste such as this that's been contaminated by a nuclear

751
00:49:17.661 --> 00:49:19.560
debris in Chernobyl.
And the,

752
00:49:19.561 --> 00:49:23.870
the idea of creating a radiated hulks of ships,

753
00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:28.370
uh,
and wondering what to do about it so that,
uh,
uh,
you know,

754
00:49:28.371 --> 00:49:32.420
once again we'll see a kind of a pattern of denial followed by a pattern of

755
00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:36.680
gradually increased sophistication and surveillance leading to a recognition

756
00:49:36.681 --> 00:49:39.920
that,
oh my gosh,
this problem is much bigger than we thought it was.

757
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:41.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

758
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.660
<v 0>So a few concluding thoughts about this section.
Uh,</v>

759
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.800
one is that a secrecy is a very important form of social control or regulation.

760
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.560
So if we give the government the right to maintain secrets,

761
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.330
we're giving them the right to control our knowledge to control our
intelligence.

762
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:59.080
Uh,

763
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.070
in this case demonstrates that a secrecy concentrated knowledge among those with

764
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:04.820
authority and power.
Uh,

765
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:09.370
it basically inhibits broad public literacy and intelligence.

766
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.510
It undermines democracy because if you don't understand these issues,

767
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:17.200
you certainly are not going to be an effective participant in decision making

768
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:21.550
about how to manage risks.
And these are often pretty technical decisions.
Uh,

769
00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.200
it prevents accountability.

770
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.280
So the bureaucrats inside the Atomic Energy Commission and the defense like this

771
00:50:28.281 --> 00:50:29.870
part about it very much.

772
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:34.550
It basically means that they're not accountable to anybody except to those that

773
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.770
also have security clearances.

774
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
It may restrict individual liberty as it has a restricting rights of a nine 11

775
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.350
detainees.
It can enhance the persuasive power of elites.

776
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:52.340
It provides them with narrative advantage to give their interpretation of the

777
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:56.240
story.
So if you don't have the evidence to,
uh,
uh,
to,
to task,

778
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:59.820
to or to contest a,
their conclusions,
uh,

779
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.310
you have no political power.

780
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.390
And also it turns secrets,
uh,

781
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:09.230
into extremely valuable commodities.
Uh,

782
00:51:09.231 --> 00:51:14.180
so in a sense,
a secrecy creates intellectual property.
Uh,

783
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:18.500
the more valuable that property is,
uh,
the shorter it's half life is.

784
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.190
I'll leave you with one thought,
uh,
from Albert Einstein.

785
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:26.870
It's not enough for a handful of experts to attempt the solution of a problem to

786
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:28.490
solve it and then to apply it.

787
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:33.110
The restriction of knowledge to an elite group destroys the spirit of society

788
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:38.270
and leads to its intellectual impoverishment.
Okay.
Thank you.
Have a good weekend.
