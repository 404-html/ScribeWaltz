WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.200
Good morning.
Uh,
so yeah.

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.980
Got To the end of Karl Marx today.
Um,

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.410
and after,
um,

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.620
along the tour we are finally at the marks you are probably the most familiar

5
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.200
with or the kind of marks you have heard the most about.

6
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.930
Uh,
the major am I measure aim.
Uh,

7
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.980
so far in this course was to shake a little the stereotypes are,

8
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.020
which was in your head about marks to show you that Max was a much more complex

9
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:49.450
thinker,
uh,
full with contradictions.
Um,

10
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.260
uh,
and uh,
and uh,
uh,

11
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:56.420
search for truths rather he arrived at through,

12
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:59.550
that's another question,
but he was desperately searching for it.

13
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.370
So we went around different,
uh,
uh,

14
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.210
box of marks.
All right.
Um,

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.050
yeah and uh,
the berries,
manuscripts,
the first set them to rather big work,

16
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.860
right?
We saw him as a,
hey galleon the central cancer,

17
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.170
there's still alienation.
I,

18
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:25.890
he galleon concept than he breaks away.
Right.

19
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.980
He turns into a historical materialist and the German ideology allergy but

20
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.510
does not quite get it yet.
Right.

21
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.540
Too much under the influence of Adam Smith's.

22
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.000
The division of Labor is so important and a private property does not get the

23
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.740
sensuality of the analysis,

24
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:51.430
what it supposed to have for the theory.
Uh,

25
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.430
then,
uh,

26
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.470
you read the ground I in which he kind of now private property is in the central

27
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:03.810
place,
but he tries to bring back,
um,
um,
uh,

28
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.710
the idea of um,
uh,

29
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.840
alienation and he,
oh,
so,
uh,
uh,

30
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.550
considers that in the German ideology he became too deterministic history is

31
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.130
more open than,
uh,
he may have believed.

32
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.350
Um,
and then finally he finishes the book,

33
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.110
at least are forced to,
first of all,
you of the book.

34
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:33.111
He always wanted to ride the scabby Itar and in the capitol only the first

35
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:37.320
volume was right,
uh,

36
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.660
was finished by him and it was the only first volume,

37
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.670
what clue what his was ready for publication and came out in 1867.

38
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.880
Um,
he offers a very coherent,
very cogent argument.

39
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.240
It's not a messy text.
Uh,

40
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.270
like the Paris manuscript or the ideology or the grown there is a marsh val.

41
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.720
This is ready to be printed.

42
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.570
And it was ready to be printed for sure.

43
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.390
And this is now his major contribution.
Um,
uh,

44
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.830
the,
uh,
the theory of exploitation,
um,
uh,

45
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.700
that is,
uh,

46
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.780
undoubtedly Mark's major contribution to social theory better.

47
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:29.920
It is right or wrong.
This is another question.
Um,
I think,
uh,

48
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.690
that are few people who would accept his theory of exploitation the way how it

49
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:35.890
was formulated,

50
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.670
but there are still quite a few theorists around here who are attracted to the

51
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:47.491
idea of exploitation and try to reconceptualize the notion of Elliot

52
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.900
exploitation in one way or another.

53
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.410
And it's also something which is very much entered the public discourse.

54
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.000
You yourself use it or occasional you feel I have been explored,

55
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.040
exploited and it actually has quite a bit to do with what Marx thought about

56
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:13.300
exploitation.
Then you say this is an exploitative relationship,

57
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.430
right?
So the term is with us.
Um,

58
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.230
okay.
And then,
uh,
of course,
uh,
in order to have the theory of,

59
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.530
of exploitation,

60
00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:29.531
and this is necessary for marks to have diet conception of the theory of

61
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.580
classes.
And the test I asked you to read for,

62
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.880
he has a theory of classes,
uh,
is an old decks,

63
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.970
much precedes that theory of exploitation.
Uh,

64
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.700
the communist manifesto.

65
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.090
It's also only a pamphlet that is a political pamphlet.

66
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.610
It's not aimed for as a scholar and the audience,

67
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.310
it does not argue his case in the scholarly Levey as most of the argument is put

68
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:08.821
for Vod in the Chapter I asked you to read from capital,

69
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.560
right.
But it's,

70
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.880
it has a very important to your ethical insights.

71
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.170
Um,
uh,
in fact,
Domar exists,

72
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:21.610
does not have the theory of exploitation.

73
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.070
He still comes very close to a mature class to Uri.

74
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.870
But it's interesting though,

75
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.240
the today the identify marks a certain Yvonne of the great,

76
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.020
uh,
tourist who created the idea of class.

77
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.020
The other one is by the way,
Max Faber,

78
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.780
but is also interesting about both of them that they never wrote any coherent

79
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.330
analysis.

80
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.250
What class is well in the communist manifesto,

81
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:58.550
marks and angles,
right of fair deal about clash,

82
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.300
but they don't have the,
um,

83
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.060
concept Schaller barritas yet to really to do it right.

84
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.820
And by the time he has,

85
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.970
after he finished the first volume of capital,

86
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.540
he actually makes sense then what eventually was published by Ngos as the third

87
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.970
volume of capital.

88
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.720
And here in chapter 52 he said,

89
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:27.170
now this is time to write my theory of class.

90
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.400
He writes a page and a half and then he abandons it.

91
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.990
It's not going to do it too difficult.
Right?

92
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.450
So it believes to you.
Right.

93
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.840
And the next Dext a test in this course to figure out what the right theory of

94
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.730
classes are and was wrong about it.
Right.

95
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.590
Um,
you know,
the fact that Labor is pretty much in the same bind,

96
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.130
he rides a little more than one and a half page,
but not much more.

97
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.470
We were talking about this and we get outcome to Max Labor,

98
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.590
but classes certainly still do haunt us,
right?

99
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.900
We cannot get to the idea of class out of our hair,

100
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.080
even in the United States.

101
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.900
And the notion is around us though,

102
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.990
there is no other modern society,

103
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.350
which is so free from the idea of class and exploitation as the u s o Fay.

104
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.900
But even in the u s Ofa,
we use Theo dark,

105
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.960
at least a bog during middle class.

106
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.790
So the term is not completely alien from us.
Okay,

107
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:48.791
so let's jump into this and let's do it this time in a reverse order that I

108
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.480
start with the mature theory,

109
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.220
1867,
and then informed by this theory,

110
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.320
I go back to 1848 they're communist manifesto,

111
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.480
um,
and deal with this.
So,
uh,
the major themes,

112
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:09.980
um,
uh,

113
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.980
for the lecture today is I want to elaborate on the theory of exploitation in

114
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:20.310
marks,
um,
uh,
his,
uh,
uh,

115
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.420
idea of classes in history.

116
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.360
And finally to ask the question,

117
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.140
how many classes are there?
Uh,

118
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.850
March seems to have contradictory answers to this question.

119
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.540
And this is certainly a question which still fascinates people who are studying,

120
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.000
uh,
so sad.
These social stratification or class structure.

121
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.550
Of course the answer is,
seems to be obvious probably to most of you.
Yeah.

122
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.910
In the United States there is one class,
the middle class,

123
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.190
the are all middle class.

124
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.340
That's a typical American answer to this.

125
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.530
But for an analyst,

126
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:08.570
it's a bit dubious answer if that our classes,

127
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.550
how owners that is only one.
Anyway,
video talking about this ingredient.

128
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.220
So let's smooth through the question of theory of exploitation and Ivy and have

129
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.900
to start this,
uh,
we,

130
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.950
the labor theory of value and to go back to Adam Smith and to see how is

131
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:35.150
proceeding.
Uh,
then,
um,

132
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.520
I want to make a step further,

133
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.510
a March distinction,
uh,
uh,

134
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.700
between commodity production and capitalist mode of production.

135
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.430
This is again,
uh,

136
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.550
taking his point of departure as Adam Smith,

137
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.770
Adam Smith's rd of commercial society and what Marx does,

138
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.780
val that are different type of commercial societies.

139
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.441
One,

140
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:09.441
he calls the Betty commodity production and the other one capitalist mode of

141
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.960
production.
As we all know,

142
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.650
he never used the term capitalism.

143
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.430
He comes to closest to this concept by using the term capitalist mode of

144
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:24.234
production.

145
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.600
Neither Smith's nor marks had the concept of capitalism as such.

146
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.160
Uh,
uh,
then,
uh,

147
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:40.020
in order to understand what is unique about the capitalist mode of production,

148
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:40.830
uh,

149
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.830
we have to understand Marcy theory of Libor power as a commodity.

150
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.000
And IVL explained to you why this is so central to mark.

151
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:55.410
Serious effects partition and then Marcy theory of class.
Okay.

152
00:10:55.411 --> 00:11:00.030
So that's about it.
And now the labor theory of value,

153
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.550
uh,
the point of departure is,
uh,
uh,

154
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.340
John Locke and that I'm Smith's right.

155
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.850
As you recall,
uh,

156
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.790
or any John Locke as suggested,
uh,

157
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.880
that all value is created by labor or I mean he's a little more cautious.

158
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.643
Uh,

159
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.330
at least 90% of all value is created by labor.

160
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.650
Uh,

161
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.650
how nervous he comes up with this figure is not very accurate about this.

162
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.690
Not very forced coming,
right?

163
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.740
A social scientists today would be a bit upset vibe.

164
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.270
Do you get this number from right?
I,
he doesn't tell us,

165
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.350
but the bottom line is well taken,
right?
You remember clearly,

166
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.130
right?
Uh,
his wonderful,
uh,
proposition,

167
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.730
<v 1>um,
uh,</v>

168
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.320
<v 0>the water in the val belongs to everybody,</v>

169
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.030
but who doubts that those who fetch it's out,

170
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.003
the water,

171
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:15.410
that water belongs to him or her because it is his or her,

172
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.820
ah,
product,
labor,

173
00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:21.600
product and what is the value of that water?

174
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.460
But you are caddying go VA,
uh,

175
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.570
from the veil of what you did fetch from the val at exactly the amount of labor

176
00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:34.821
you had to put in in order to fetch that clear right and my studio of property

177
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.393
right.

178
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.850
And the Nice Labor theory of value though it's not what God is way by John

179
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.950
Locke,
but soy is by Adam Smith.
And as you recall,

180
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:55.010
right than Smith's claim set 1.0 value is created by labor.

181
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.700
<v 1>Uh,
uh,</v>

182
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.540
<v 0>val about of course,</v>

183
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.810
<v 1>uh,
uh,</v>

184
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.450
<v 0>Adam Smith van,</v>

185
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.460
he comes to explaining the distribution of barrels a day,

186
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.890
takes a step back from this proposition and they discuss that.

187
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.790
Then we discuss Adam Smith.
Let me just remind you what the step back forward.

188
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.060
I had the tension right in,
um,

189
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.820
Adam Smith's was on one hand he claims all value is created by labor and then

190
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:39.900
it,
when it comes to the question,

191
00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:44.700
but how is thou sort InComm distributed?
He said,

192
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.970
thou it ought to be a distributed between industry factors of production,

193
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.460
right?
Labor,

194
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.240
capital and land.

195
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.360
They ages profit and rents and they have to be a fully distributed and adjust

196
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.570
fee between these three factors of production.
Right.

197
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:16.260
And I think you'll remember be clarified that this is not a contradiction in

198
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:17.880
Adam Smith.

199
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.570
He somehow then he's claiming that's all value is created by labor.

200
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.070
He almost has a theory of human nature,
right?

201
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.410
That in the state of nature then that is no private property of land and where

202
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:37.680
they is,
no accumulation of capital,

203
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.360
that all value is created by labor.
Bob,

204
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:45.810
this is just in this imagined,
right?

205
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.390
<v 1>Um,
uh,
um,</v>

206
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.840
<v 0>natural conditions of existence in all complex societies.</v>

207
00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.260
Uh,
private ownership exists and drive it,
uh,

208
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.230
uh,
uh,
and capital is being accumulated.
And then,
you know,

209
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:09.260
in order to get production going,
uh,

210
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.890
the capitalist has to rent a,

211
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.220
give a capitol advance capitol to the worker Bee Sal,

212
00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:20.330
the advancement of capital,
the Labor would not work.

213
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.900
And therefore the owner of capital has jewel claim for part of the value of

214
00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:33.481
which is created in the process of production because he took risks right by a

215
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.720
offering capital and it had to supervise the labor process.

216
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.720
And wants to have compensated what it's three staking and uh,

217
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.490
it's super visual and you could not operate without lamb.

218
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.370
He's at the site,
all activities,
neither site.

219
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.830
And if somebody owns that site,

220
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.220
they'll have to be compensated that you are on the site and that his rent,

221
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.170
well this is a little more problematic in Adam Smith's,
you know,

222
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:12.170
for capital,
he makes a pretty strong case.

223
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.920
You know why it is fair for the capitol.

224
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:20.690
This stool collect profit for the owner of the land.
He,

225
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.190
they are collecting rent.
That's a little more problematic.

226
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.880
Whether rent is also something adjust in the car and the all have a little

227
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:34.280
unease,
right?

228
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.350
Then we are talking about rent or then VR talking about fun instance,

229
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.590
rent seeking behavior,
right?

230
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.040
That sounds a bad behavior if somebody is seeking rent,

231
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.873
right?

232
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.590
The reason is simple because of associate in our mind,

233
00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:00.020
rent seeking behavior with monopoly,
right?

234
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.840
Rent seeking behavior comes from monopolistic ownership and we don't

235
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:08.840
particularly like monopolies,
right?

236
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.640
Evonte competition,
free competition,
right?

237
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.410
Free markets and not mauler police,
right?

238
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.980
Monopolies are bad word.
Anyway,
this is a little bit of a problem,

239
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.650
but nevertheless,

240
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.960
I think is fundamental point in Adam Smith's that that is some fair

241
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:32.070
distribution,
uh,
uh,

242
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.420
income between the three factors of production because they are all necessary,

243
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.360
uh,
for,
um,
the,
uh,
for,
uh,
uh,

244
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.970
the production of a production process.

245
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.130
Uh,
I,

246
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.340
I just suggested that in fact that are still,
uh,
uh,

247
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:59.410
uh,
people scholars who are seriously interested,
um,

248
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.720
in,
uh,
uh,
in,
in,
in theory of exploitation today,

249
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.380
they usually abandoned the labor theory of value.

250
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:13.010
I have not met yet and economists or political economist or even a sociologist

251
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:19.230
or political scientist who still believes in the labor theory of value,

252
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.990
right?
So now,
therefore,

253
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:25.200
when they tried to construct a theory of exploitation,

254
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.620
it is more around the theory of friends rather than labor theory of value.

255
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.300
Okay.
Then let's move further then that started to figure it out how,

256
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:41.301
what Marx does do Adam Smith's and how he radicalizes Adam Smith's,

257
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.390
uh,
Mark's does not want to go,
uh,

258
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.050
the Adam Smith's young bay.

259
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.460
How to say that is a fear distribution of vows between the three factors of

260
00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:58.920
production.
First of all,
he asked her question,
okay,

261
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.290
what is value?
And he defines value of it.

262
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:09.220
This very simple equation,
uh,
uh,
uh,

263
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.860
see his constant capital,
right?
Constant capital,

264
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:18.480
darn means the capitol,
which is advanced by the capitalist.

265
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.490
In order to make the labor process possible,
uh,

266
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.040
constant capital,
Ken of course,

267
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.100
involve the improvement on the land,

268
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.400
on the site of what you are using for your production process.

269
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.890
Right?
There is a building put up on his side.

270
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.110
The cost of the building.

271
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.760
We will have to be recurrent in the process of production,
right?

272
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:50.030
And therefore it feels also contribute to the value of the product.

273
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:56.060
The is very able to capital variable capital on means wages and s is what he

274
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:04.590
calls surplus.
Uh,
product.
Uh,
this is uh,
uh,

275
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.640
you,
you produce a product,
you sell it.
Uh,

276
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.700
it is not enough for you in order to be and stay in business if all what you

277
00:20:15.601 --> 00:20:19.590
call act and he turn of the Capitol,

278
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.790
you advanced for the production and the vgs,

279
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.830
but you played to your laborers,
uh,
to complete the process.

280
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.660
If you will do that,
you've would be done,
right?

281
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.320
All smart entrepreneurs want to generate some surplus.

282
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.640
They want to get a little more than they started with it.
Otherwise,

283
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.150
why owners would they be their time on this?
Right?

284
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.060
Why on Earth would they take risks?

285
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.350
Why would they spend their time supervising the process?

286
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.840
Why would they start worrying whether this we're very account or not?

287
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.880
They need a surplus.

288
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.800
So therefore that is the value of the product.
Now,

289
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.483
uh,

290
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:15.930
and here is [inaudible] some capital is investment and here that is an

291
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:21.430
agreement,
right fit Adam Smith's,
right?
You have right,
uh,

292
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.140
factors of production.
But Mark's most to be consistent,

293
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.950
consistent in saying that all value is being created by labored.

294
00:21:32.501 --> 00:21:35.430
And he said,
but what is constant capital?

295
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.830
There dos constant cap it talk come from,

296
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.770
he said it is coming from Labor.

297
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.650
It is accumulated labor.

298
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:50.250
It is Labor which was actually performed before capital accumulation was

299
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:54.790
appropriated by the capitalists.

300
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.720
And it is being now used as constant capital.

301
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:03.050
So that is one argument is all capital.

302
00:22:03.051 --> 00:22:07.120
It was at one point and product of labor.

303
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.600
Um,
and that is what is your investment.

304
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.290
So as I shared variable capital,
our wages,

305
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.670
and then that is surplus product,
uh,

306
00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:22.180
and that surplus product we are mark Mark's argue is also,

307
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.080
uh,

308
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:28.080
the outcome of the labor process and the product of the Labor as such.

309
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.880
So mark strasse too shy Ovi from the idea that that is a kind of thin air

310
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:41.710
distribution,
uh,
between,
uh,
capital,
uh,

311
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.970
land and labor.
He said no,

312
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.350
I mean all value is being created,
uh,
by uh,

313
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.583
labor.

314
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.040
So this is his kind of reconstruction of the Labor theory of value and leads us

315
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.940
into the idea of exploitation,
right?

316
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:06.210
We Will Ivo Labor on this in a minute to try to put more meat on it,

317
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.820
but the essence of exploitation is that what the capital is a real advance,

318
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.000
um,
is actually labor,

319
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:21.001
which was appropriated from the workers in an earlier cycle of the production.

320
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.720
And then the capitalists will pocket the surplus,

321
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.120
will not give any to the worker.

322
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.000
A worker bee will be satisfied with the wages.

323
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:36.100
And this is that exploitation comes from,
right?
Yeah.

324
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:41.190
Exploitation somehow has to do with what the capitalists had to put into the

325
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:43.420
production process,
right?

326
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:48.421
Constant capital and variable capital and how much he pocketed after the process

327
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.540
was Ooh over.
So that is no,

328
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.160
nothing fair about this.
In Mark's view,
this is right.

329
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:03.161
The big difference between social democratic trade unions who wants to keep the

330
00:24:05.421 --> 00:24:07.130
capitalist system going,

331
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:12.430
they just want to have collective bargaining and negotiation right with the

332
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:13.970
employers.

333
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:19.210
So to have a reasonable level of profit to the capitalist and the reasonably

334
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.620
high level of wages for the very curse mark said,

335
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:28.130
well that is nothing reasonable.
This is a system,

336
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.350
an exploitative system.
Um,
well,

337
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.900
and this is what I said,
the rate of profit,

338
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.600
there'll be the surplus divided by,
uh,

339
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.950
the expenditures.
Okay,

340
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:47.120
let's move a little further and makes,
and let's have a,

341
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.610
it is important contribution,

342
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.530
but Mark's makes between petty commodity production and capitalist mode of

343
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:59.330
production,
right?
The trying sort of break up,
um,

344
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.310
um,
uh,

345
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.820
Adam Smith's idea of commercial society or market economy or capitalism,

346
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.930
uh,
mark seemed to have a more complex notion.
Now,
he said,

347
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:16.910
this is petty commodity production and he again offers us a little activation

348
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:19.410
here.
He said,
um,

349
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.960
Betty Comodo production begins,
surveyed a commodity.

350
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.290
Uh,
and then,
uh,

351
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.940
you go to the market place Saudi's commodity for money,

352
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.110
uh,
in order to purchase a commodity.

353
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.000
Uh,
this itself is commercial society.

354
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:46.310
This is commodity production,
but it is not capitalism.

355
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.120
Huh?
Ah,
this is why Mars for instance,

356
00:25:50.121 --> 00:25:53.240
was a bit uncertain.
Um,

357
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:58.290
and he was rambling about this other hall is the United States in the early 19th

358
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:03.540
century,
really a capitalist economy.
And he,

359
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:08.570
he was puzzled by this because the overwhelming majority of Americans were

360
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:12.770
actually involved in self employment.

361
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.820
It was a highly commercialized society,

362
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.790
a highly developed the market economy,

363
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.860
but there was relatively little private capital accumulation.

364
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.640
Most people over farmers or self employed artisans or merchants.

365
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.740
And what did they do?
They did produce commodities.

366
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.230
You've heard a shoemaker,
you produce the show,

367
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.970
but we're specializing in shoe shoe and you did not bother.

368
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.680
You try to also raise chickens and to have x.

369
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.310
So you needed x.
So you brought shoes on the market,

370
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:01.850
you sold a shoe for money and then your van to the farmer and you bought egg.

371
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.260
So you could have your scramble that right.

372
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:13.770
Okay.
That is petty commodity production.
All right.
Um,

373
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.840
and the purpose of production,

374
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:20.870
this is a very important proposition by Marx is satisfaction of needs,

375
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.010
right?
You are operating,

376
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:29.340
you are producing stuff because you have certain needs.

377
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:34.341
What you want to satisfy and the production of some good well in excess of what

378
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:41.130
you need has the purpose to satisfy other needs.

379
00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:46.131
What you have and money is simply a mediator to make sure that different types

380
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:52.371
of needs are being properly exchanged on the market place right now works here

381
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:57.090
is very beyond mark.
So the Paris manuscripts,
right?

382
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.570
Well who try to identify markets and commodity exchange as the shores of

383
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.600
alienation.
That is nothing,
uh,
Eliana,

384
00:28:07.601 --> 00:28:12.100
anything about this assess right
now.

385
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.940
But then he said,
well capitalism is a different ballgame.

386
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.990
We are talking about the capitalist economy.

387
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.960
Then the cycle starts with money.
Uh,

388
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.140
and though,
I mean the chapters,
you have red marks,

389
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.180
tries to discipline himself.

390
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.650
He tries to really behave and to be a scholar,
right?

391
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.450
But he can't resist,
right?
His emotions,
right?

392
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:45.130
And his values are too strong.
So he said,

393
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.650
your money bag,

394
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.780
talking about the capitalist,
it should not have said so,
right?

395
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:58.110
They could have done these cool objectively simply to say,

396
00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.190
well,
we have a not an economic system in which we have,

397
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:08.220
right people who accumulated capital and they are entering the marketplace.

398
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.600
And what do they do?
They produce commodities.

399
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:19.330
Um,
and why do they do so because they want to have more money.

400
00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.910
That's it.
And I would say this is Bingo,
right?
I mean,

401
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:30.330
the comparison between the two is really capturing in a very powerful,

402
00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:34.660
they,
right?
The emergence,

403
00:29:34.661 --> 00:29:38.280
what we understand of capitalist economy,
right?

404
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.610
As distinct simply from a commercial society.

405
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.500
I think this is a very,
very important and very insightful,

406
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.360
very simple,
very precise and very persuasive argument.

407
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.800
Um,
now let me just,
uh,
uh,
uh,

408
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.510
say a few more words about this.
Why is this?
So,
uh,

409
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.940
uh,
why does the capitalists,

410
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.620
the need more money than it started the process and live?

411
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:13.150
You'll get into a bit later in,
in more,

412
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.750
uh,
details.
Uh,

413
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.960
now that are very good reasons for it.

414
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.020
One reason we already mentioned why should the capitol is butter,

415
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.643
right?

416
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:31.890
Add advancing capital and taking risks unless it is compensated by more money.

417
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.980
And that's in itself a good enough reason.

418
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.950
But that is an even more important reason.

419
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.910
Be out on a competitive market place in a competitive marketplace.

420
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.320
In a capitalist economy,

421
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.570
which in marks on a bird is the most dynamic economy in human history.

422
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.780
That is improvement in technologies.

423
00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:01.650
The capitalists will create more money because it will have to reinvest this

424
00:31:02.831 --> 00:31:07.720
money in the production process.
It has to improve its technology.

425
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.000
If it will stop the [inaudible],
the competition with Vipe it out.

426
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.790
So the capital is has to collect,
right more money.

427
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.730
Then it started the production process.

428
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:27.060
Even the most altruistic capitalism has to collect more money at the end of the

429
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:30.130
process.
Even the capitalist who said,

430
00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:35.340
I'm such a good man all the time doing is to creating jobs for the sport.

431
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:40.480
Poor people that they can have a decent living and the nice suburban home.

432
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.380
And I don't want anything in exchange for it.
I do it out of altruism.

433
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.233
Okay,

434
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:50.530
let's imaging are altruistic moneybag right?

435
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.640
Still the poor guy does not have a chance.

436
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.880
It has to collect more money because otherwise next year he vault will not be

437
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:01.360
around any longer.

438
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.600
He cannot be altruistic any longer because the competition of your vibe him out,

439
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.490
right?
That's the argument.
Okay,

440
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.960
so we'll now here,
I'm smart.

441
00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:18.250
She said this is a big change because now the purpose of production is not

442
00:32:18.251 --> 00:32:21.100
Satish flection of needs.
Uh,

443
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.820
but it is really a generation of profit,

444
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.360
which is inevitable because competition among capitalists now comes the big

445
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:34.540
puzzle there on earth.

446
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.050
The more money comes from
how,

447
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:44.210
how is it possible that the capitalists goes out,
uh,

448
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.690
with money,
buys commodities and gets more money?

449
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:51.380
At the end is the capitol is cheating us,

450
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.140
buys cheap and sell dear.
Uh,
he said,
thou,

451
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.640
this is impossible.

452
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.690
If there would be a capitalist who would buy cheap and sell deer and we'll

453
00:33:03.691 --> 00:33:06.730
pocket a profit this way,
that'd be a reorder.

454
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.770
Who've you say they'll ivo compete and IVL Sally less expensively.

455
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:17.280
And I've,
you'll sell more and dive.
You create more profit than veal Bush,
right?

456
00:33:17.281 --> 00:33:21.440
These are deficiently high prices down.
That is supply and demand,

457
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.720
which sets the prices.
So the,

458
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.950
the more money cannot come out of cheating,
right?

459
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.050
Uh,
it simply cannot come out simply for circulation.

460
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.110
It somehow has to come out from the production.

461
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.130
Now how can it happen that more money is created?

462
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.390
Now this is where the idea of labor power,
uh,

463
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.900
as a commodity comes here,
but the capital is,
does,

464
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.100
is bias on the market place.

465
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.460
A specific commodity and this specific commodity is labor market and labor

466
00:33:56.481 --> 00:33:56.971
market.

467
00:33:56.971 --> 00:34:01.971
So mark argues is that commodity the only commodity which actually can produce a

468
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:08.930
higher value when it is consumed,
that eats own value

469
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.660
in every other input that I'd be a raw material,

470
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.520
the amount of labor which was put into that room at the Ariel,

471
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.280
but in our production process,
you consume it.

472
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.640
That is being transferred into the value of the new product.
Uh,

473
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:31.340
so are you are producing a refrigerator,

474
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.910
you need steel or aluminum to produce it.

475
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.450
The value which was put into the production of steel or aluminum will be carried

476
00:34:41.781 --> 00:34:45.920
over exactly the same amount into uh,

477
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.990
the refrigerator you plug use.
So if cannot create more value,

478
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.470
right?

479
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:56.470
What can create the only commodity which produces more is labor power as such?

480
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:04.790
Well,
and this is also important that mark suggests,
therefore,

481
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.840
but the Labor has to sell.
It cannot be labor.

482
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:13.760
It must be labor power.
Now it's,

483
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:18.410
you may be talmudist stick stuff,
right?
This stressing words,
but it isn't,

484
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:21.440
I think there's an important idea.
He said,
he said,

485
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:26.070
if you would sell labor then,
and it,
if we,
if you,

486
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.210
if a John Locke vase,
right,
right.

487
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.500
And all value is created by the Labor and belongs to the Labor,

488
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.100
then the capitalist would have to cheat you,

489
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:42.000
write would not be able to sell,
give you the price of your labor,

490
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.260
could not have a surplus value or a profit on their bikes.

491
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.830
Therefore the capitalists will have to buy labor power,

492
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.740
the capacity of work.
And,

493
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.800
and Mark's insist they have to think about a system in which the capitalist

494
00:35:58.711 --> 00:36:02.730
surprise based the proper price,
the exit price,

495
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:07.440
the market price,
the right market price for labor power.
Uh,

496
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:10.610
the word good is not cheated.

497
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.190
The Vercher is exploited,
but that's not cheating,
right?

498
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.490
So why,
what is so unique about the labor power,
right?

499
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.900
And let me just emphasize this very,
very important for the chapters.

500
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:26.580
What you have read that it,

501
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.700
those are all of us EC divalence which have to exchange each other at the,

502
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.760
at the,
at the marketplace.
No cheating though.

503
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.230
The worker is not being cheated.
It gets you a proper pressure.

504
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:43.620
Claude is labor power.
So what,

505
00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:46.710
what is the price after Labor power?

506
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:51.630
It's exactly like the price of any other commodity,

507
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.750
the price of its reproduction,
right?

508
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.670
How much labor is necessary to reproduce that,
uh,
uh,

509
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.940
uh,
uh,
uh,

510
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.120
a commodity for labor power is a commodity.

511
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:11.330
The price of the labor power is exactly how much is necessary to reproduce that

512
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:16.590
labor power.
It involves,
right?
The cost of your housing,

513
00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:21.591
the cost of your living and the extended reproduction of labor power involves

514
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:27.300
that you have to raise children.
It involves education kept me,
you know,

515
00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:28.860
human capital investment.

516
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.430
This all will have to be compensated for the labor,

517
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.260
but if it is compensated,

518
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.560
then the laborer is compensated for his Labor in capacities,

519
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:41.040
labor,
power,

520
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:46.020
the work under the supervision of the capitalists and the capitalists will make

521
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:51.021
sure that the labor after the cost of the reproduction of labor power are

522
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:57.801
covered the work and order three or four or five hours under the supervision of

523
00:37:59.101 --> 00:38:04.101
the capitalists and start producing surplus value for the capitalist or profit

524
00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:07.680
for the capitalist.
Right?
That is right.

525
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.910
A stroke of the genius.
Right.
That's the big solution.

526
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.450
But he's offering,
and this is,

527
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.190
this is why I said though,
that is a heavy,
of course,

528
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.280
of course he hates capitalism.
Of course he hates exploitation.

529
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.820
But if you look at the logic of the analysis,

530
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:31.821
this is pretty cool headed analysis and does not imply value judgments,

531
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.800
right?
It does not imply judgment.

532
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.810
You can go through of this had to say yes,
five.
Sure.
That's,
that's it.

533
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:44.620
That's how the system works.
He does hate it.
And as I said,

534
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:49.060
he cannot stop and uh,
expressed as it.

535
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.300
Okay,
let me talk about class.
He's very briefly

536
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.950
and now we are back to uh,

537
00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:00.100
the communist manifesto and the,

538
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:05.250
there are really a couple of issues here is talking about classes,

539
00:39:07.221 --> 00:39:07.600
uh,

540
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.600
as a tense historical category which in Ebay is contradictory to the argument of

541
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:14.950
does copy towel.

542
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.000
You start thinking about the bourgeoisie as a new class and there's a

543
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:20.620
progressive class.

544
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.570
Now let's look at this class is as a trans historical category.

545
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.060
Like this is written almost 20 years before does copy Todd [inaudible] theory of

546
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:35.850
exportation and he said the history of all behaviors,

547
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.070
the existing societies is the history of class struggle.

548
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.700
And you remember I said this idea is becoming already in the German ideology

549
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.520
where he tries to develop these cold cause on mechanism and I teach explains

550
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:56.170
evolution in history and this is class struggle all along,
right?

551
00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.460
The struggle of the surface.
Again,
the slaves against the slave owners,

552
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.290
the surfs against their landlord,

553
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.300
and finally it will be the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.

554
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.400
That's the idea,
right?
And this is being used,
you know,

555
00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.640
story historical day.

556
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.900
The trouble is that this is obviously wrong,

557
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.820
it's wrong in terms of Mark's own theory of exploitation and the Intro,

558
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:25.060
it is also empirical.
You're wrong statement.
All right?

559
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.850
Why is wrong in terms of marks?

560
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.730
Because it doesn't fit the theory of exploitation.

561
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:35.850
If exploitation is unique for a capitalist mode of production reasonably,

562
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:41.671
you can talk only about classes in a capitalist mode of production where the

563
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:46.360
labor power is free in the dual sense of the term,

564
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.660
legally free and freed from the means of production,

565
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.600
therefore has to sell his labor power,
right?

566
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.280
If this does not does not exist,
you should not use the term of classes.

567
00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:00.610
So this is a contradiction in Mark's own analysis,

568
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.750
and of course it is empirically wrong because that's true.

569
00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:07.090
There were a class struggles in history,

570
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.750
but vas antiquity,

571
00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:14.650
overthrown by the revote of slave owners.
I gained the slaves.

572
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:15.903
No,

573
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:21.210
it wasn't as we have learned from marks if fell because it was invaded by

574
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:27.400
Germanic tribes did in the south,
uh,

575
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.920
slavery and that,
because the slave level,

576
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.890
did I gains a slaveholder save wondered?
No,

577
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.740
because capital is from their noise,
right.

578
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:41.240
Initiated that I ever wore at games the south.
Right.

579
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.320
Uh,

580
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.320
did the proletariat ever revolt to overthrow the bourgeoisie naturally Yali in

581
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:54.470
countries where we are talking about proletarian revolutions that were hardly

582
00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:56.030
any proletarians,

583
00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.950
how many claims are county answerer that in China,
1949,

584
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.170
obviously an overwhelmingly present economy,
right?

585
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.620
Those were peasant masses would demanded lands who carried out good evolution

586
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.500
under the leadership of Mount set tone.
Russia not much.

587
00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.840
Not much different in 1917.

588
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.110
So it's simply not true.

589
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:25.790
It's also not true that the trustees of ritual or subordinated earlier,

590
00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.270
we will become the new dominant classes.
I mean,

591
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:31.850
the slaves did not became the landlords.

592
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:37.190
The service did not become the grand bourgeoisie and the proletariat circling it

593
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.140
did not become a dominant class in China or in the Soviet Union.
Right.

594
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.390
This is all wrong,
right?
Eh,
Eh,

595
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:51.230
but the argument is,
uh,
uh,
you know,

596
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:55.560
still interesting.
Then most importantly,
write the bourgeoisie.

597
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.430
He sat is Rhea Leah in your class.

598
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:03.431
And probably arguably the first three are class the landlords for not a class

599
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:08.210
because they were not constituted in economic terms,

600
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:10.580
ever constituted legally,
right?

601
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.880
And by customs rather than simply on market exchange and market competition.

602
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.000
Um,
and he also said,
well,

603
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:24.100
these bourgeoisie was an extremely revolutionary force,
right?

604
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.700
Um,
and it actually transformed the whole society.

605
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.680
And here I think that is even in the communist manifesto,

606
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:37.430
he contradicts himself.
He said,
well,
you know what it did,

607
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.730
it transformed occupations,

608
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:45.320
which we are based on honor before into class positions,

609
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.160
right?

610
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.160
It converted the position of a doctor or a lawyer or a priest enter kind of

611
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:55.970
casts like position,
do their power to additional,
it was based on honor.

612
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:59.880
They were honorable positions.
Now they become,
uh,

613
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.670
positions for which an income is being paid.
Alright.

614
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:06.650
And then he writes,

615
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.870
it's very important to appreciate that mark sees that the bourgeoisie did play

616
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:15.680
an extremely important too aggressive role in history,

617
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.360
but he's not on,
he hates the gods of the bourgeoisie for sure,

618
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.580
but he appreciates the contribution of the bourgeoisie for the development of

619
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:28.370
modern society.
Right?
He said,

620
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.800
you're the bourgeoisie cannot exist.

621
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:36.250
Cows Dunkley revolutionizing the instruments of production,

622
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.820
right?

623
00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:42.820
In scarce 100 years has created more massive and more colossal,

624
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.540
productive forces.

625
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:50.690
Then we have all preceding generations together.
Well,

626
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.960
sounds like somebody who loves capitalism,
right?

627
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.520
He of course he doesn't because he thinks it will eventually destroyed stuff.

628
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:05.010
Now the last issue is about how many classes and they all,

629
00:45:05.011 --> 00:45:08.530
what follows from the logic for,
uh,

630
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:13.260
the scabby towel and,
uh,
I think it is also,
uh,
the,
uh,

631
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.030
uh,
point,
uh,
uh,

632
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:18.630
of Marx in the communist manifesto that our two classes,

633
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.850
the bourgeoisie and the proletariat,
right?
Uh,

634
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:27.870
the money bags and their workers and the workers are exploited by the money

635
00:45:28.821 --> 00:45:31.650
bags.
And that's the reason for cross juggle.

636
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.300
And that's what eventually revealed lead to revolution.
But my goodness,

637
00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:39.890
where are the middle classes?
Um,
uh,

638
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:44.990
that were not all that many proletarians in 1867,

639
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.450
there was no society except,
uh,

640
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.500
industrialized Soviet Union and the majority of the population was industrial

641
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:58.980
worker,
but no ruling class.
David would export it at school.

642
00:45:58.981 --> 00:46:01.830
Don't worry about it,
but the very majority,

643
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.700
but it never happened in western societies.
We never reached that point.

644
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:10.350
And then of course the industrial working class has been declining now properly

645
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:12.990
speaking,
industrial working class in the United States,

646
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.470
it's probably not more than 15% of the population.

647
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:21.930
So where is the middle class?
So,

648
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.330
uh,
well I don't have much time.
Let's rush through all of this.
Uh,

649
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.990
well he said that is,
you know,

650
00:46:27.991 --> 00:46:32.700
these elemental confrontation between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat there

651
00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:36.300
he does not have the theory of exploitation and he cannot explain it.

652
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.660
Fly To Vale in,
you can do it by now.

653
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.000
Armed with dust copy tab,
right.

654
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:45.390
This is a contradiction because you know,

655
00:46:45.391 --> 00:46:49.860
the proletariat has no choice but to sell is labor power and be exploited.

656
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.940
And this is of course,
an irreconcilable contradiction.

657
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.430
And what about the middle class?
Well,
Mark said,

658
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:04.300
yeah,
all he,
he is,
uh,
of course even in a political family flat.

659
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.170
He is a good enough scientist,

660
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:11.670
social scientist that he will say no,
I that isn't only middle class.

661
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:13.320
He knows that he's a middle class,

662
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.680
that most people do not belong to the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in 1848.

663
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:23.100
And as I've said,
they never did,
but he said,
well,

664
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:28.110
but look at it historically a what we call middle class is disappearing.

665
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.340
Look at all peasants and small artisans and small merchants.

666
00:47:32.341 --> 00:47:37.210
They've it all disappear and they'd all have to either very few of them will

667
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:42.211
become big capitalists and the overwhelming majority of them will become working

668
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:47.140
very curse.
Now how this is not without insights,
right?

669
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.860
For about a hundred years,
uh,
after,
uh,
the uh,

670
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:57.940
communist manifesto,
the tent was going in this direction,
right?

671
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.040
Self employment for shaking and the wage labor was increasing,

672
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.530
right in league days,

673
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.740
right in the mid 19th century,

674
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:14.070
70 to 90% of the population was working in agriculture cell phone and was self

675
00:48:14.801 --> 00:48:19.000
employed in other businesses are today in the United States.

676
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:20.380
The agriculture population,

677
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:24.640
I don't know exactly their most current figure is somewhere between one to 2%.

678
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.790
Right.
Uh,

679
00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.240
and self employment has been substantially reduced for a very long time.

680
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.610
But things happen what marsh did not foresee.
Right.

681
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:41.050
And what he did not foresee,
uh,
were uh,

682
00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:44.380
and I probably view alleviate here.
There are two things.

683
00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:47.300
What he did not really foresee,
uh,

684
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:52.530
one that actually these trans churn that that is no more reduction of self

685
00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:58.980
employment.
In fact,
that is some increase of self employment.

686
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.370
It varies from countries to countries in Japan.
Big Way.
Right.

687
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.360
And Are you not to say it song improvement in self employment,

688
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:11.110
but self employment is stubborn.
It assistant,
right?

689
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:13.510
You don't have supermarkets but he,

690
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:18.190
all of us do have your corner delis shops and they don't seem to be
disappearing.

691
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.390
Right.
I even take my shoes to a shoemaker.
Have to fix them,
right?

692
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.320
And so,
I mean,
I do not throw my shoes out.

693
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:31.620
I go to a shoemaker then fix it for $25 for me and I don't get shoot for 150

694
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:37.080
bucks bucks.
Right?
So I mean that is mass production has its limits,
right?

695
00:49:37.081 --> 00:49:41.590
It's a quality production right by artisans.
And we want that quality code.

696
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.030
And the more important argument,
in fact,
you know,

697
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:50.230
Maurice conceptualized wage laborers as physical labors,

698
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.790
physical laborers,
as I pointed out,
manual laborers,

699
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.380
at least in advanced countries,

700
00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:01.060
is this minority of the society in the globe.
That's different,
right?

701
00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:06.061
Because manufacturing and industrial activity was kind of decentralizing the

702
00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:10.720
world into the third world body in the United States and in continental Europe.

703
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:11.950
It's a tiny minority,

704
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.960
but there is a baby new middle class and these new middle class are those white

705
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:21.460
collar workers,
right?
Most of you will become and what I am,
right?

706
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:26.320
I'm not white like the color.
I love this story.
You know,

707
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.770
that means in my sense,
I hardly do any work,
right?

708
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.400
What kind of value do I create?
Right?
What does it mean?

709
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:37.320
I am exploitive.

710
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:44.140
I don't think Rick Levine really exploits me and my Amex Spool Tor.

711
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:48.260
No,
I don't think I explored Yo guys.

712
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.810
Or do you explore to me because I have to say up until midnight to grade your

713
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:56.150
assignments.
No,
it's not reality.

714
00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.500
I actually obey occasionally have fun reading your assignments.
Right?

715
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.920
So we have a new middle class and I had to be simply doesn't outfit the analysis

716
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.910
and where the notion of exploitation loses its inside.
Okay.
I leave it here.

717
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.450
Thank you.
