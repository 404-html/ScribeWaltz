WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.610
Okay.
Now let me,
uh,
I actually would like to spend as much time as I can on,

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.020
on Durkheim's methodology.
I have a lots of notes.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.420
Um,
uh,
this is the 24th lecture.
No,

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.660
uh,
uh,
this semester for discourse.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.410
But let me rush through of the desk questions and just to tell you how I would

6
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:31.340
like to,
uh,
deal with them.
I think the first one is,
uh,

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.860
you know,
very obvious,
probably a bit too of years.
Uh,

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.260
and the question is how can you make it interesting?
Uh,

9
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
I hope that the distinction between power and domination is clear,
right?

10
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
Bower means that somebody can impose its will on somebody else,

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.520
even if that other person opposes it.
Uh,

12
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:57.670
there is a strong element of coercion in a war,
right?
Uh,

13
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.900
you can coerce people to obey your command.

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.740
Domination implies that you do not have to use coercion systematically.

15
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.180
Um,
uh,
because people tend to internalize a,

16
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.870
the reasons those who have power,
um,

17
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.120
use in order to legitimate why they should have power.
Right?

18
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.000
And then this brings us to the notion of legitimacy,

19
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.860
right?
Legitimacy,
other claims which are made by those who have power,

20
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.890
which God to justify why it is reasonable that they should issue commands and

21
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.500
other should obey.
Uh,

22
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.590
so far very simple,
right?

23
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.250
Or what is kind of controversial about this?

24
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.120
Uh,
it's Scott reversal the way how labor uses the notion of legitimacy.

25
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.320
Normally we,
in modern democratic theory,

26
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:02.970
we believe that the system is legitimate.
Um,
then,
uh,

27
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.010
um,
it is,
uh,
has a popular consent.

28
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.340
We think about universal suffrage.

29
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
People go to free and fair elections and then they elect leaders and then they

30
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.570
follow those,
you know,

31
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.680
those elected to office this way then power is legitimate.

32
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.680
But I think they,

33
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:30.681
Burt wants to have a broader notion of legitimacy because a free and fair

34
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:36.540
elections operating with universal suffrage,

35
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.930
we'll back 100 years in human history.

36
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:44.670
And in some countries it's still does not exist and VBA does not want to

37
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:49.671
describe the last 10 minutes of human history for human history is 24 hours,

38
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:50.610
right?

39
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.610
He wants to offer some conceptual tools to understand the whole 24 hours.

40
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.400
So that's why he has these interesting of legitimacy,

41
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.030
which it does imply that people have to have a certain degree of belief,

42
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.380
uh,
in,
uh,
the validity of the legitimacy claims.

43
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.110
But it is a rather passive notion of belief.

44
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.280
They don't have to love the person in position of authority.

45
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.910
They do not have to elect it.
And they simply,

46
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.060
it's enough if they think,
well,
um,

47
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.420
I cannot think of a better alternative,
right?
Uh,

48
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.230
and other dictators could be worse than this one.

49
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.660
This is a dictator,
but a reasonable labor will say,

50
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.760
as long as this is happening,

51
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.080
the person in authority will not have to use squash and systematic

52
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:52.050
systematically and therefore if you'd be legitimate.
Right?

53
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.330
Let me also just say,
of course,

54
00:03:55.331 --> 00:04:00.270
the course if element is also in domination,
right?
Um,

55
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.210
uh,
if people these obey the law,

56
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.160
then they will be coerced.

57
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.580
And that is certainly a promise of coercion.
Um,
Eh,
in,
uh,

58
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.520
even in modern free democracies,

59
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.740
people are put in jail.
In this country,
people are even executive,
right?

60
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.960
So there is an element of coercion.

61
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.800
Just the real question is how systematic death caution should be and for vapor.

62
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.740
Um,
pure exercise of authority is relatively rare and marginal.

63
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.340
Um,
uh,
uh,
I would say for instance,
um,

64
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.960
the sort of last year or two or three of,

65
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.910
of Hitler was gravely ill,
legitimate.

66
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.170
He'd not had to use massive coercion.
Um,

67
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.790
certain epox off rule of Stalin in the Soviet Union.

68
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.580
He legitimate not,
Ooh,
the rule of styling during the Second World War,

69
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.440
he established some legitimacy,

70
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.690
but when he had to in prison,
then million people,

71
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:14.770
right?
And to kill tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands,

72
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.530
that is an indication that this is a legitimate,
okay.

73
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.420
So that's the way how I would handle it,
right?
Uh,

74
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.600
to work around these interesting conception of legitimacy and uh,

75
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.080
what is for and against this.

76
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.750
Now this is again,
a very simple question.
Traditional and legal,

77
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.640
rational authority,
right?
Uh,
uh,

78
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.500
uh,
the basic differences,
right?
The traditional authority.

79
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.190
You have a personal master in legal,
rational authority.

80
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.380
You do not have a person master.

81
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.920
You'll be at the laws and the people who are in charge who was barriers.

82
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.130
You'll also have to obey the same laws.
What you are required to do.

83
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.790
And Traditional Authority is legitimated by the sanctity of age old rules.

84
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.330
Here again,
I think the interesting issue if I would write about his VOB val,

85
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.710
this is a big,
you know,
historical distinction,
um,

86
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.790
but VA but also uses it to describe in contemporary society different types of

87
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:24.020
organizations.

88
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.470
So contemporary theory has a big dose of the additional authority in it,

89
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.700
right?
Um,
and I would try to elaborate on this.

90
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.810
They are,
um,
this is,
uh,
uh,

91
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.630
one of the trickier questions.

92
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.390
Why does vapor believe that bureaucracy is efficient?

93
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.150
Um,
uh,
and you may agree or man made does aggravate him.
Uh,

94
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:54.500
so first of all,

95
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.420
I would state why vapor beliefs that bureaucracy is efficient.

96
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.490
I would emphasize that he thinks that bureaucracy is the most efficient in the

97
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.780
technical terms and not necessar role.
The other advise,

98
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.910
uh,
and then of course the way how he defines bureaucracy,
you know,
people are

99
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.260
put into position in terms of that competence.
Um,
there,

100
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.570
that is a rule of law.
It is a predictable environment,

101
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.170
a bureaucratic environment that is,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

102
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.140
hierarchy of appeals.
If somebody makes a mistake,
you know how to appeal.

103
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.030
This,
of course,
all makes it,
um,
uh,
efficient.

104
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.170
Now vino that'd bureaucracies are often inefficient.

105
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.560
So how to reconcile this now there's not that way,

106
00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:51.561
but it was totally insensitive to the problem of inefficiencies of

107
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:53.090
bureaucracies.

108
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.720
And he formulated it how that bureaucracies are caught between formal and

109
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:04.421
substantive rationality as the way how I would probably defend vapor to say he

110
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:09.320
was not that naive to believe that bureaucracies are all as efficient.

111
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.260
They wouldn't be efficient if they view will be purely,

112
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.270
it would be purely for Molly irrational,
but they are not.
Um,

113
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.340
and one good example is welfare bureaucracy's which to establish a kind of clear

114
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.200
up patron client relationships,
right between,
um,
uh,

115
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.630
bureaucracies and clients.

116
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.320
Some people refer to this as Valvia dependency,

117
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.820
which makes it of course,
because of inefficiency.

118
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.240
Now this is a

119
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.390
nice question to answer.
Um,
uh,
Ivy discusses a great deal.

120
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.820
Um,
uh,

121
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.960
we know that charismatic leaders at in times of crisis when are looking for a

122
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:59.910
change,
right?
So,
uh,

123
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.030
Barack Obama during the presidential campaign,

124
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.010
he has read the birth year of 40.
He knew how to frame right?

125
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.390
His message exactly as a cat is matic math message.

126
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.190
It was all about change and it was about hope,
right?

127
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:20.290
In contrast with Hillary Clinton,
um,

128
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.740
or John Mccain,
a boss of them emphasize that we are experienced,

129
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.170
uh,
this is not what people wanted to hear a than they wanted to have change.

130
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.950
So,
yes,
in this respect,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

131
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.860
Barack Obama did have a charismatic appeal and this charismatic appeal did,

132
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.640
um,
uh,
um,
uh,
jail,
right?

133
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.240
People that many people responded to his charisma.

134
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:53.070
He was criticized by his opponent that he's a Rockstar,
right?

135
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.370
Because people got so excited about him so he could appeal to the emotion of

136
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:03.270
people,
right?
He could appeal to them,
not of course,

137
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.590
as we,
again discussed in discussion sections also briefing class.

138
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.060
Barack Obama has a charismatic appeal,
but he operates in a legal,

139
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:16.800
rational authority.
And we just have seen that value recently.

140
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:21.570
Right.
Making a decision about the war.
Afghanistan,
right.
Well,

141
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.820
uh,
he had to deal with realities,
right?
Um,
uh,
uh,

142
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.200
so,

143
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.200
well the bear woods wood in the classical sense,

144
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.480
charisma in vapor is reserve to great religious leaders such as Muhammad or

145
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.880
Jesus or whatever or the grid profits.
Um,

146
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.160
and in this sense I get is my eyes naturally all the applicable to politicians

147
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.670
operating Gidley got national authority so they would have some unease to call a

148
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.310
Barack Obama charismatic leader.

149
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.520
I would think he would go and see that certain in Barack Obama had charismatic

150
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:09.240
features.
Uh,
such a,
the cliff's question,

151
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.760
um,
Durkheim and the study of law.
Why owners?

152
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:19.761
He starts from the study of law in analyzing a society,

153
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.820
um,

154
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.820
because he is a metal dialogical collectivists and because he wants to capture

155
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:28.590
something like the collective conscience,

156
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.900
which is more than the sum total of individual consciousness,

157
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:39.470
but he's also a scientist and I hope I will have little time to talk about the

158
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:41.040
methodology.

159
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.690
He wants to be very rigorous and he doesn't want to start Fatah ideas.

160
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.020
He wants to start with facts.
Well,

161
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.050
he is caught in a contradiction.

162
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.750
So collective conscience is ideas.
Wow.

163
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.850
How a nurse you studied them objectively.
I use,
you know,

164
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.350
why is a great example because law is written down,
right?

165
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.490
That is written law.

166
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.780
You can study it objectively and is not on individual consciousness but God's,

167
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.813
oh,

168
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.350
so I think this is the major reason why he is his point of departure is as an

169
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:22.351
example law because this is what he can rigorous research study can be seen as a

170
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:24.970
social fact,
right?

171
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.300
That this is the law and to understand why this law came into being on the road

172
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:35.110
circumstances and does it influence people?
Um,

173
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.840
bell of course the inspiration comes from Montesquieu.
Alright.

174
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.740
Uh,
well,
agreement and disagreement.
Uh,

175
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.060
I think the real question is whether you buy into methodological call activism

176
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:53.800
or not.
Uh,
some of you may be methodological individualist.

177
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.510
Um,
uh,
especially if you are an econ major,

178
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.890
you tend to be an economic individualists,
a,
a methodological individualists,

179
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.820
right?
You tend to believe that,
you know,

180
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.260
that are rational individual actors who pursue interest.

181
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.990
And you are very skeptical about anything,

182
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.090
which is a assume at the above.
Um,
the individuals.

183
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.890
So in that case,
if you are a methodological individualists,
and in fact,

184
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:28.690
I think the dominant Chinese social sciences today is methodological

185
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:33.691
individualism and a great deal of skepticism about methodological collectivism,

186
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.310
that can be a kind of critical,
uh,
uh,
handle on it.

187
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.710
Or at least you can show this is the way how it can be criticized and you can

188
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.740
show why you actually think that methodological collectivism is reasonable.

189
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.040
Okay.
The sixth question,

190
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.280
organic and mechanical solidarity and how this is related to Weber's die apology

191
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:06.100
for authority.
I mean,
it's,
you know,
British simple,

192
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.390
uh,
um,
uh,
uh,
that are very,

193
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.100
very important distinction.
The differences between Durkheim and Baber.

194
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:20.220
Durkheim looks at what bring society together.
The central concept is,
uh,

195
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.330
um,
uh,
solidarity.
A vapor looks at social conflict,

196
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:29.290
what takes society apart?
So he looks at,
uh,
um,

197
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.720
a struggle had an power,
right?
Um,
uh,

198
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:34.990
uh,

199
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:39.760
Viber is coming from the lineage of five would say hops.

200
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:40.800
And Nicha lie.

201
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.400
That's the rebellion comes from,

202
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.470
uh,
that is,
uh,
of course similarities.
Uh,

203
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.670
mechanic organic solidarity is what legal national authorities for Viber,

204
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:59.650
they tried to capture modernity.
Uh,

205
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.430
it borstar is similar in the sense that the outdoors or social die apologies off

206
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:09.760
societies but also types of social organization.

207
00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:14.360
So in any given society and as such.

208
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.060
So these are some similarities.

209
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.250
<v 1>Uh,
uh,</v>

210
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.040
<v 0>okay.
I think that's probably about it.
Now,</v>

211
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.970
the question of Aml me,
uh,

212
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.703
uh,

213
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.400
I think we covered this recently so I don't have to refresh your memory as much.

214
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.660
Uh,
the notion of anime,
um,
uh,

215
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.760
in Durkheim comes out of the absence of sufficient regulation and this is a

216
00:15:46.421 --> 00:15:50.460
temporary product,
uh,
which emerges because,
um,

217
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.870
<v 1>um,
uh,
yeah,</v>

218
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.430
<v 0>mechanical solidarity is breaking down and organic solidarity has not been</v>

219
00:15:57.431 --> 00:16:01.990
established yet.
And in the transition from mechanical solidarity,

220
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:06.100
traditional society into a modern urban industrial society,

221
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.230
people have a problem of regulation and value systems and that's when they are

222
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.640
animal meek.
But this will go away.
Uh,

223
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.750
what is the theory of human nature behind this?
This can be debated.

224
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.670
Um,
uh,

225
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:27.070
one possible argument is that since he believes that,
you know,
um,

226
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.840
uh,
order,
it has to come from the outside from evolver,

227
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.260
uh,
he tends to believe that we sell to,
uh,
order,
um,

228
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.360
created by associate or level collective conscience.
Um,

229
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.640
we've,
we're the,
uh,
the evo things.
Um,
we,

230
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.120
we need to be regulated,
right?
Uh,

231
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.340
well here of course he knows that we can be over regulated and then that's also

232
00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.560
pathological.
But the main,

233
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.380
the technology at least in the transition from,
um,
uh,
uh,

234
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.560
mechanical to organic solidarity is the absence of triangulation.

235
00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:10.150
And the trouble on that,
you know,
humans may do,
uh,
uh,

236
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.520
um,
uh,
more and more,
uh,
battle logic or,
uh,

237
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.690
or evil act.
So that is a,

238
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:21.350
<v 1>um,
uh,
uh,
notion of uh,
uh,
um,</v>

239
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.400
<v 0>humans be needing
control over them.</v>

240
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.220
Now this is a,
uh,

241
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.740
speaks to the age question on Ami and alienation.

242
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.730
The Oud in many ways,
the opposite to each other,
right?

243
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.180
Aliya nation means that you are over,
that you waited,
you do not,

244
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.400
you are not in control of your own life,
of your own faith.

245
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.220
Um,
that is lot of and nation means,
um,

246
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.950
also marks a is inspired by those.
So,
uh,

247
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.450
it's a kind of loose soil am conception of nature behind that.
Uh,

248
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.620
the problem comes from society.
It doesn't come from the individual,
right.

249
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.120
Um,
uh,
Vr born in society,

250
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:13.920
we are social by nature.
Um,
and uh,
if,

251
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.810
uh,
uh,
modernity and modern capital,
his mood would be removed.

252
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.520
We again,
would act socially and collectively in a good way.

253
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.900
So that's uh,
uh,
uh,

254
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.160
Andean contrast like their camps notion is that the absence of regulation,

255
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.030
that's what goes is pathologies.
Uh,

256
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:40.370
or right man's question.
Uh,
this is uh,
something,
uh,
but uh,

257
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.820
uh,

258
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:45.820
I think you'll find difficulties to deal with it because you did not find a very

259
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:48.300
design chant,
Manta in any of the readings.

260
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.770
And indeed we did not use the word very often.

261
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:54.650
He did use it,
uh,

262
00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.020
most critically in an ass save what he wrote after he was trying to combine his

263
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:04.520
various sociology of religions.
But,
um,

264
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.460
the bird and challenge meant,
um,
uh,

265
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.570
is translated from the German word magic.
Um,

266
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.630
so these and Sean man means a situation in which diverse we thumb roses,

267
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.493
roses,

268
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.120
magic and magic is moved out of life.

269
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:27.450
And this is happening with rationalization,
right?

270
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.900
The big process of historical evolution is vars,

271
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.640
rationalization and the loss of magic and the texts,

272
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.850
what you have to support that is in the Protestant ethic,
they were,

273
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:41.480
makes a big deal out of it.
That's what,

274
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.630
especially Calvinism and the teaching of [inaudible] nation did.

275
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:47.530
It got read of magic,
right?

276
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.060
But though he is in a,
say a rationalist,
uh,

277
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.240
he sees the downside of national is the loss of magic is the price what we have

278
00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:03.170
to pay for rationalization.
Uh,

279
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.320
and he's a bit nostalgic about the van.

280
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.190
It was magic and the relations magical.
Um,

281
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.500
uh,
so,
uh,
uh,
uh,

282
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.760
that is,
uh,
a kind of a permanent conditions of modernity.

283
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:24.930
Things are not getting any better.
That's I think one of them big,

284
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.700
big differences.
Uh,
with the,
uh,
Durkheim's notion of an on me.

285
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.490
Um,
uh,
the loss of magic actually,
uh,
uh,

286
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.450
does mean,
uh,
like,
you know,
there is a marks,
you know,

287
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.600
roots in marks here because the loss of magic means that actually you,

288
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.050
you seem to be more,
more vulnerable to fate,

289
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.200
right?
Magic where,
you know,
you were a magician,

290
00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:58.201
you had these how to make God the omnipotent God to do things for you,

291
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.810
for instance.
Um,
uh,
to save you right now,

292
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.800
you could do it to magic.
We means in a rational as well.
We are,
uh,

293
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.560
less in control of our lives.
So in this sense,

294
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:15.640
I think labor notion of design chairman that is closer to the Marxian notion of

295
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:20.140
alienation rather than the Durkheimian notion of an army.

296
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.120
Now social causes of suicide.
Uh,

297
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.700
well we just covered this,
the uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

298
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.770
last lecture,
uh,
uh,

299
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.920
the argument is right that we believe that suicide is the most individual

300
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:43.210
intimate decision.
He actually does show and demonstrate.

301
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:47.320
This is not the case because there are great differences.
Um,
uh,

302
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:49.750
in suicide rate across countries,

303
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.790
there's differences tend to be very stable that are also strong relationship

304
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:58.930
between suicide and religion and suicide and education.

305
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:04.470
And therefore there are right social determinants of this very individualistic

306
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.170
action.
Um,
as,
as a suicide.

307
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.450
Now there are these two dimensions in which you can conceptualize suicide,

308
00:22:13.451 --> 00:22:16.380
how well integrated you are,
um,

309
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.660
or how they're regulated.
You are,

310
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.430
and they will kind of has this idea that too much integration and too much

311
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:28.690
regulation or Doolittle integration or too little regulation.

312
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.720
Our boss at more and more is for the golden middle road.

313
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:39.490
Um,
uh,
um,
uh,
normality is in the middle of the road,

314
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.240
uh,
sort of and economics.
Uh,

315
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:47.430
so he side happens and then you are not sufficiently regulated.

316
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.940
Um,
egoistic,
suicidal curse.

317
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.850
When you are not sufficiently integrated in society,

318
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:57.200
that's when you are act egoistical.

319
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:02.270
He commits suicide because you don't care how you're yourself killing yourself.

320
00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:06.900
You'll effect,
you'll be loved violence because you don't have,

321
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.650
be the of once you are not integrated in society,
right?

322
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:12.640
Uh,

323
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.410
you do not commit egoistic suicide when you care about the beloved violence and

324
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:21.650
you don't want to cause them pain by killing yourself.
Right?

325
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.980
Um,
and I'm like suicide have man's,
if people are kind of,
uh,
um,

326
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.300
not sufficiently regulated and therefore,
uh,
uh,
they,
uh,

327
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.090
uh,
in this Annemieke situation may make commit suicide.

328
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.000
Okay.
So that's about it.

329
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.570
And let me then move on to,
uh,

330
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.800
Durkheim's methodology.

331
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.480
Yeah.
Non Fancy for,

332
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:22.690
<v 2>yeah.</v>

333
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:27.690
<v 0>So this is the rules of sociological method published in 1995,</v>

334
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.550
uh,

335
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.550
two years after the division of labor and two years before the suicide about a

336
00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:40.630
foreshadow was and combines elements from balls.

337
00:24:40.631 --> 00:24:43.900
I have a lot of stuff still.
Ivo Rush you through.

338
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.150
One question is what he deals at.
Uh,

339
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.740
van is a fact sore shard and can be talking about social facts down.

340
00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:56.140
He asks,
how can the observe sore shoulder vac facts?

341
00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.880
Then he makes a distinction between normal and pathological states.

342
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.440
Um,
uh,

343
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.560
he also writes about nominalism and realism and offers an alternative to

344
00:25:09.401 --> 00:25:14.260
nominalism and realism.
What is she?
System of classifications.

345
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.560
And then he addresses the issue of the question of explanation and causality.

346
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:26.130
Very Bass breaking guy.
The years in his Stein's,
um,

347
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.210
sort of any is a fact social.
Uh,

348
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.230
and the first point is valve.

349
00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:37.231
You have to make a distinction between social and biological or psychological

350
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.590
fair.
My mammo,
uh,
well,
uh,
uh,

351
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.280
and he,
then he also,

352
00:25:45.281 --> 00:25:50.281
I will elaborate on this and then he asked the question,

353
00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:53.530
how objective be social facts?

354
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:57.820
The biological facts are obviously objective,

355
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.260
psychological,
not so obviously the source or the least.

356
00:26:02.261 --> 00:26:05.320
So why are they still objective?

357
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:11.010
And then he labors on what makes her social facts elective as such.

358
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:18.220
And that is of course,
education is a major mechanism.
Okay.

359
00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:21.880
So let's,
uh,
as the question,
you know,

360
00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:26.881
what is the social effect as distinct from biological or psychological?

361
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:34.260
Uh,
he sat val,
if all facts,
a fact human beings,
uh,

362
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:39.040
would be,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
regarded as social.

363
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.070
They'll would be no real discipline.

364
00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:45.700
What he should be called sociology.
That,

365
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.540
as I pointed out before,
and I,

366
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.790
he's the first person who identifies emphatically with the discipline of

367
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.630
sociology.
Uh,

368
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.390
he actually has this notion of life sciences,

369
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.280
interestingly,
right?

370
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.920
And sociology is part of life sciences.

371
00:27:05.921 --> 00:27:09.600
So I that are three live sciences,
sociology,

372
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.060
biology,
I'm psychology.

373
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.540
But these three different life sciences deal with different units of analysis.

374
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.880
There'll be different objects.

375
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.650
And I had a biology dios feed the body.
Uh,
uh,

376
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.860
psychology needs to be the personality,
uh,

377
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.380
while sociology needs,
this is his dick,
right?

378
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:35.420
Uh,

379
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.290
in the US with the collective representations a right,

380
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:44.670
he tries to move beyond the idea of collective consciousness,

381
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:49.160
collective representation,
which somehow objectively,
um,

382
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.040
embodies as a fact the,
uh,

383
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.030
the states of collective consciousness.
Um,

384
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.830
and therefore he said this is indeed the set of phenomena.
Ivy,

385
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.280
we'll be able to distinguish with other,
uh,
uh,

386
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.990
facts.
So when,
when do I act socially?
You know,

387
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.990
as a question I do.
So,
uh,

388
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.290
when I execute my contract,
right,

389
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.060
I perform duties right now,

390
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.250
which are defined externally to me,
right?

391
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.840
If I perform my duties and I have thing socially,

392
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.200
I'm the socially irresponsible person seems to be very street for London.

393
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.400
Obvious.
Okay.

394
00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:40.401
How about how objective they are steady at first?

395
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:40.891
Look,

396
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:45.891
it doesn't look to object to because the sense of obligation seems to be very

397
00:28:45.931 --> 00:28:48.060
subjective,
right?
Uh,

398
00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:51.750
you may occasionally say to your partner,

399
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.430
you are irresponsible,
right?
By which you mean,
you know,

400
00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.530
you don't have enough of a feeling of a Juki door,
watch me.
Right?

401
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.470
Um,
so that is,
uh,
uh,

402
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.570
these subjective element involved in this.
But he said,

403
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.800
nevertheless,
we can see this is still objective.

404
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.413
Um,

405
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.450
and one of the major way how we can understand that is objective and uh,

406
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.260
uh,
in fact,
uh,
um,
uh,

407
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.540
that is some external enforcement,
right?

408
00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.800
These obligations,
if you keep breaking these obligations,

409
00:29:31.801 --> 00:29:35.720
that will be panel this against you,
right?
Well,

410
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.850
not all the time.
Occasionally you can get away with it,

411
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.220
but at one point there may be punishment.

412
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.250
You see others being punished by not fulfilling that UTS or obligations and

413
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.180
therefore,
uh,
uh,

414
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:54.610
or you can see that that is externally and forced.

415
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.080
It's not just subjective thing that you have.
You think you have duties,
right?

416
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.540
It will be externally,
um,
uh,
you know,

417
00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.660
implement it so you have obligations,

418
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:12.790
right?
That's 7:00 PM today to go on the Internet.
Oh,
Lord.

419
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:17.380
Questions,
right.
Um,
uh,
do answer two of them.

420
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.110
Uh,
well,
uh,
uh,
this of course,

421
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.640
you know,
calm as a subjective feelings of a in you.

422
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.080
It's a have enough guilt feelings if you don't do it in a timely manner,

423
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:37.160
if you would be late,
uh,
uh,
it's sufficiently internalized in you,

424
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.910
uh,
about,
uh,
you know,

425
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:44.320
you know that that word locations and people were late written assignments and

426
00:30:44.321 --> 00:30:46.510
there were,
you know,

427
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.890
teaching fellows or professors who the dark right.

428
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.990
Something from their grades.

429
00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:57.880
So therefore you don't want to risk a lower the grade and beyond,

430
00:30:57.881 --> 00:30:58.151
you know,

431
00:30:58.151 --> 00:31:03.151
your deep personal commitment that I want to fulfill my duty in a timely manner

432
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.290
right now is also a concern that if I don't,

433
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.610
I may get some penalty.
Right?
So that's what it makes it social.
All right.

434
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.630
Okay.
Uh,
so,
um,

435
00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:24.240
well it has to be called active.
It cannot be just the individual.
Uh,

436
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:28.400
we have,
uh,
you know,
we have a collective sense of,
uh,
uh,

437
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.120
or obligations.
So,
um,
and he was used the term habits.

438
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.820
It's a very good term.
Uh,
uh,
which,
uh,
um,

439
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.030
I don't think has been used before him.

440
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.510
So forcefully as jury time.

441
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:49.510
Dad became very widely used the,

442
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:50.330
um,

443
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:55.010
more recently following an other great French sociologist,

444
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.030
Pierre Bourdieu,

445
00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:01.060
who churn this turn hobby into a term hubby tools,

446
00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.700
right?
Well,
habit habitus,

447
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.950
Moore's manners,
uh,
ways of life,

448
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.840
right?
Means that we have,
uh,
uh,
something,
uh,
um,

449
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.240
uh,
we,
we know how to navigate in social life,

450
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.260
right?
We know how to deal with situations.
These are habits,

451
00:32:24.261 --> 00:32:28.190
the ways how the behave in social life.
And he said,

452
00:32:28.191 --> 00:32:33.170
where does it come from?
You said,
this is coming from education,
right?

453
00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:38.720
It's uh,
uh,
you are being educated.
You know,
what you are suppose to do.

454
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:44.480
Um,
well,
uh,
that's not exactly right what hops,

455
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:48.830
man hops had this idea right,
of manners and customs,

456
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:54.080
but he believed that these manners and customs simply he could explain from the

457
00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:58.100
individual individual actors,
right?

458
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.400
The individuals act and then they know that that will be an order and alter who

459
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:06.580
will respond,
uh,

460
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.720
the evaluate what the possible onset of the Altera VOB and therefore they will

461
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:18.191
learn ways how to navigate anticipating possible punishment from Arthur's.

462
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.400
Right?
So he hops can do it,
uh,
uh,
by,
uh,

463
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.710
doing a methodological individualists exercise there.
Okay.
Ma'Am?

464
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.740
Exercises.
No,
I mean this is not how we learn it,
uh,

465
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.440
through acting and getting punishment and seeing that as being punished.

466
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.340
It is through the system of education.
Now there's a good,
good point,

467
00:33:40.341 --> 00:33:44.840
an interesting point.
Um,
now,
uh,

468
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.720
and here again,
right?

469
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.410
This is kind of crystallized in these of acting.

470
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.780
That's what habit or a,

471
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:58.780
in the more contemporary version hobby toast,
uh,
is,

472
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.840
is all about,
right.
I think I'm bored.

473
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:05.480
You also means that Habitudes is something what you learned and carry in

474
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:09.890
yourself.
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
depending what your habits are,

475
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:14.891
habits are a veal mean that how you will fit in defense situation.

476
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.370
Um,
uh,
we,

477
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:22.010
we occasionally think that people get into positions where they don't have the

478
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:24.960
appropriate habitus to behave right.

479
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:29.960
And therefore they may not be performing a task very bad because they do not

480
00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:31.370
have the proper habits.

481
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.360
The habits are kind of internalized earlier in life.

482
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.580
And then it helps us to perform different functions in society.
Well,

483
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.840
I have good rush.
So how do we observe social facts?

484
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.800
And now here comes so the social effects are things,

485
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.950
uh,
and what we need as a rigorous discipline,
right?

486
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.020
For a social analysis.

487
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.800
And that also implies that we have to get read of all of our preconceptions.

488
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:08.950
We have to define the objectives of our investigations independently from our

489
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:13.100
values.
Uh,
it's almost a value free science.

490
00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:15.350
What is our use IBC and not quiet.

491
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.830
And we have to get rid of those data.

492
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.370
The cool subjective sort of.

493
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:27.220
So short facts are things,
objects.
Well,

494
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.990
this is a very interesting citation.

495
00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:34.991
What you would not expect from the car to come and reads all slide Karl Marx in

496
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.670
the algae,

497
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:43.020
like the proper science should not be proceed from ideas to things,

498
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.940
but from dings to two ideas,
right?
It's three.

499
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:51.550
It's almost identical to the German ideology,
but the,

500
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.430
of course means something different.
Right?

501
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.030
The things are not property relations,
right?

502
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.800
The things I'd actually collective manifestations,
right?

503
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.820
We're elected by the years.
Uh,
so,
uh,

504
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.640
the notion of thing is used here.

505
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:13.020
You're very in a very unique and very different way.
But what he emphasizes,

506
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:16.470
right?
That they are not the individual ideas,

507
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:19.950
but they are kind of crystallized.
Uh,

508
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.930
and it's out there over us.
Uh,

509
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.180
like things,
uh,
what we cannot change.

510
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.160
Individuals cannot really change.
Um,

511
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.420
and he said,
well,

512
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:38.421
social sciences have ev war just like natural sciences,

513
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:44.040
uh,
by getting red of prejudices,
right?
Um,

514
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.060
uh,

515
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:50.060
dogmas moving beyond dogmas and substitute them with the study of facts.

516
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.120
That's what Bacon,
the philosopher,

517
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:59.530
I think 17th century suggested all scientific investigation should strive,

518
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.800
uh,
from induction,
from the observance of,
um,

519
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.940
sensually observable facts.
So he in walks baker,
right?

520
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.860
That this is the scientific method,
right?
Uh,
um,
well,
it,

521
00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.530
it is not necesarrily sensors and as a,
which is emphasized in,

522
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.280
uh,
in,
in Durkheim,

523
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.240
but moving beyond preconceptions and dogmas.

524
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:25.951
And he said,
well,

525
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:30.951
the theory should be on only introduced when science is sufficiently at advanced

526
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.873
stage.

527
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.540
Now this is a very good advice to people who are graduate students and doing

528
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:43.530
this.
Septations don't start with theory,
right?

529
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.870
Start by analyzing social facts and menu sufficiently advanced.

530
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:50.880
That's when you find the proper theory.

531
00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.910
Now you will be doing your senior thesis.

532
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.880
I think it's a good advice to take,
right?

533
00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.860
Don't start with the big words.
Start with,
uh,

534
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.920
with actual analysis and find,
um,
to Uri van.
Uh,
um,

535
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:07.680
uh,

536
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.680
you already have a scientific idea and here he comes.

537
00:38:13.831 --> 00:38:18.060
I'm a strong critique of economist of his time.

538
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:23.360
A critique what some people will say would apply to economies today and he said,

539
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.580
cannot Mr today principally are occupied how the economy or Hoover Erick rather

540
00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:35.370
than to understanding how the economy actually works.
Right?

541
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.150
Uh,
Paul Krugman,

542
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:42.151
just publish the little piece in New York Times a couple of weeks ago now.

543
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:44.530
Yeah.
Actually accused his own colleagues.

544
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.830
He said you created these mass,
you know,

545
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:52.630
with the financial markets because you were never looking at how the economy

546
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:56.770
really works.
You operated how the economy should be variety,

547
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.010
but we really should be studying how the economy works.

548
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.760
So it's an interesting criticism of economics.
What I mean,

549
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:08.890
not necessarily true for all economies,
then it's,

550
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.250
it can be debated whether a normative science,

551
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:16.590
which describes how something should operate is illegitimate,

552
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:22.050
but he certainly takes the idea that it should not be a normative,

553
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.720
well,
we have to get read of preconceptions.
Right?

554
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.280
And he said they caught and bacon disagreed with each other.
Right.
As I said,

555
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:35.220
bacon was the one who said the analysis should start from,
um,

556
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:39.130
um,
um,
induction observing

557
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:48.190
phenomena of what we can censor sleep study and then moved over his theorizing

558
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:55.330
greeter they cards that was opting for that deducting mattered.

559
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:56.283
He said,
well,

560
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.030
we have to start from general abstractions and then to move the,

561
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.580
the derived hypothesis from these general and then to move to the facts.

562
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.110
These are,
this is the difference between Bake Bacon and Descartes,
but he said,

563
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.450
but they do agri involved thing,

564
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:18.460
namely that no matter that their reasoning is inductive,
right,

565
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:23.140
from observation to theory or deducted from theory to observation,

566
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.320
they agree that we should get rid of the dogmas.
Um,
uh,

567
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.280
no preconceptions.
And he said,

568
00:40:30.281 --> 00:40:35.281
this is particularly difficult in social sciences because we think we know how

569
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:38.440
society works.
We don't,
there's just a real thing.

570
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:43.180
We need social scientists to tell us how society works,
the experience society,

571
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:47.560
and therefore we have an idea how it works.
And we have strong interest.

572
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.960
Harvey would want society to work.
And if,
uh,

573
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:56.650
the conception,
if the findings goes against our interests or beliefs,

574
00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.920
strong sentiments,
we tend to disregard it.

575
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:04.921
So it's very difficult to get read of Dogmas in social sciences because we have

576
00:41:05.351 --> 00:41:09.940
an ordinary knowledge,
right?
Not Scientific,
but ordinary knowledge.

577
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:13.330
How society and the economy operates.
Right.

578
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.570
And he had an interest as well as very enrolled,

579
00:41:16.571 --> 00:41:20.050
so very difficult to get rid of our preconceptions.

580
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.050
Now he said,
well,
yes,

581
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.280
because we have very strong sentiments and that's okay.
Uh,

582
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:32.200
be sure to study the sentiments that centi national study as,

583
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.700
as if they were objects.
The what?

584
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:39.600
They should not be led by sentiments.
Right?
Uh,
uh,
uh,

585
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.660
uh,
we have to proceed,
uh,
uh,
visit,
uh,
passion and be south,

586
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.940
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
prejudices

587
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.140
bell.

588
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.140
We have to define the objects of our investigation independently from our,

589
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.770
our values as such.
Um,
uh,
um,

590
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.290
and therefore he said,

591
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.550
we have to come up with objective definitions of what we are studying.
He said,

592
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.510
what is a crime?
He said,
crime is a social act which,

593
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.780
which are punished.
Therefore,

594
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:18.260
I don't have to make a value judgment in defining crime.

595
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.900
If I see a society in which certain act,
uh,

596
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.720
systematically punished by that society.
I can say in this society,

597
00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:30.380
this is defined as a crime.
I may disagree with this.

598
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:34.970
I may see this should not be a crime,
but in this society it is a crime.

599
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:37.820
In many societies,
for instance,

600
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:41.150
a homosexual acts were defined as a crime.

601
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.270
In those societies,
they were a crime.

602
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.650
You can disagree with it and you should say,
well,

603
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.770
homosexuality should be decriminalized.
That as it was fortunately,

604
00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.920
I mean their lives,
it's not a crime any longer.
Uh,

605
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.580
Rahel smoking and selling Mariajuana is a crime,

606
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:05.960
right?
It is being punished.
You can end up in jail,
had some effect.

607
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.160
You may think that marijuana should be decriminalized,

608
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.580
or the fact that the consumption of marijuana and marketing of marijuana is a

609
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:20.030
crime today in the United States is an objective fact.
Right?

610
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.660
And it can be studied by looking at the law and what on earth judges do in this

611
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:31.460
country.
Right?
So that's uh,
um,
his,
his point,
it's,

612
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.140
it doesn't matter what your values are and what matters for the practices of

613
00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:41.100
society are the St Louis for morality,
he said,
well,
some people will be saved.

614
00:43:41.101 --> 00:43:45.350
How they are immoral because they are differently than I do.
He said,
no,

615
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.730
every society has morality.
You have to understand what their morality is,

616
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:52.670
even if it is a different from your own morality.

617
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:58.040
Now we have to disregard to subjective,
uh,
uh,
uh,

618
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:02.290
uh,
uh,
information.
So,
uh,

619
00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:07.620
this is what scientists do when they use measures and instruments that what,

620
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:10.540
you know,
he's very much attracted to.
Uh,

621
00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:15.590
the scientific reasoning in sociology is a very French idea.

622
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:20.130
And then he makes a distinction between normal and pathologic goals.

623
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.200
So what is the difference between normal and pathological?
Now,

624
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.220
he said normally is the most frequent for a faction,
right?

625
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.610
Uh,
uh,

626
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:36.140
we need our conception for normality because we just cannot operate.

627
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.740
You saw defining,
uh,
uh,
Dora,
but how can we do that?

628
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:45.120
And at the same time remain objective and we can say something is abnormal.

629
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.550
We start us Minka he said,

630
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.760
it's easy because what we shall do that we should regard those as normal,

631
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:58.670
which is sort of the most common way of act and to define the extremes as

632
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.130
abnormal.
And he said,

633
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:08.770
the reason for this is that it would be incomprehensible,
uh,

634
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:13.810
in the most widespread actor will not at the same time the most advantageous,

635
00:45:14.551 --> 00:45:17.610
wrong,
but then he takes it back.
He said,
well,

636
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.720
we can actually see a number of occasions when frequently,

637
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:25.090
<v 1>uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

638
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.390
<v 0>behavior of which is frequently followed is actually not useful.
Uh,</v>

639
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:34.960
in this case,
in it may be inherited,
inherited from the past.

640
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.050
It may have been functional at one point of time,

641
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:43.450
the situation changed and people still keep that habit and they still keep

642
00:45:43.451 --> 00:45:44.620
behaving that way.

643
00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:48.700
And that can be now defined as a normal door.

644
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:53.410
It can be probably quite average behavior,
right?
Uh,

645
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.250
think of racism for instance,
is a good example.

646
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.330
<v 1>All right.
Um,
uh,</v>

647
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:06.360
<v 0>uh,
well that is a very interesting argument about crime.
He said,</v>

648
00:46:06.361 --> 00:46:06.930
well,

649
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:11.470
if crime looks like it is indeed by definition pathological,

650
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:16.350
but is it Neil said,
well,
crime is present in all societies.

651
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.800
Uh,
so,
uh,
when his,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

652
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.380
he makes this very interesting argument and therefore the early,

653
00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:28.620
I think we are crime abnormal,

654
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:32.610
if that are too much crime in society.
Ryan per se,

655
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:36.810
is a normal state as such.
Well,

656
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:41.220
I think I leave these nominalism realism or human out,

657
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:45.620
<v 1>uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
you know,</v>

658
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.090
put it on the Internet

659
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:52.050
<v 0>about causality.
I finish with the idea of causality.
He said,
well,</v>

660
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:57.051
the task of social sciences is to explain and not only to describe,

661
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:02.400
to be able to deal with the causes and causality,

662
00:47:02.401 --> 00:47:06.970
and there are different methods how to do causality.
He says,

663
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.430
in social sciences,
the typical method is competitive,
uh,

664
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.490
rather than expiry mantle.
In natural sciences,

665
00:47:14.491 --> 00:47:18.230
we do experiments in social sciences.
We can't expand.

666
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:23.290
The man does assume that we assign a certain stimuli randomly to a population

667
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:29.160
and then to see how they respond to this stimulus.

668
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.030
We can't do that in society.
And I'm,
as I mentioned about the,

669
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.510
uh,
suicide,
we cannot,
uh,
uh,
uh,

670
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.860
assigned people to get married and others to assign,

671
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:44.930
not to get married and to study later on what the effect of marriage was on

672
00:47:44.931 --> 00:47:47.470
something like suicide.
So therefore,

673
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:52.000
what we can do is the comparative method.
Now,

674
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.920
uh,
I think I am out of time.

675
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:58.750
He makes a distinction between two types of comparative matters.
Uh,

676
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:03.400
the competitive methods,
uh,
uh,
uh,
can be,
uh,

677
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.210
um,
uh,
either the method of agreement,

678
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:12.010
a method of agreement if I compare to similar type of societies,

679
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.590
for instance,
the United States and Canada,

680
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:19.120
and to see whether that is difference between these two countries.
Uh,

681
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:20.860
for instance,
uh,
the lever,

682
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:25.720
I have a theory that a poverty may be related to crime.
People in,

683
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.140
you know,
who are hungry are more,
more likely to steal food,
right?

684
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:32.200
Because they have to feed themselves to put it very simply.

685
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.000
And I can't bear to societies by the level of property above earth.

686
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:40.670
He is the same.
And then I will see that,
uh,
you know,
it is indeed a,
uh,

687
00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:45.100
uh,
where people are more likely to commit certain type of car,

688
00:48:45.101 --> 00:48:49.990
the crimes or I can do the method of difference and the merit of difference.

689
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.210
If I compare two very different countries,

690
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.730
I can't build the United States with Bangladesh.

691
00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.790
That is a very different rate of crime,
right?

692
00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.130
And then I see whether there is a difference,
um,
in,
in,

693
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:06.870
in climate as such.
He said the problem with this method is,
um,
uh,
there,

694
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.990
there is not enough cases and therefore the proper mattered.

695
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.450
Interestingly hard use is correlation,

696
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:18.490
but we have to do is to find what the correlation between two variables.

697
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.690
Now this was guiding contemporary social sciences,

698
00:49:22.691 --> 00:49:27.691
but there came a smarter than most number crunchers in social sciences because

699
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:33.910
here,
here,
I think the last sentence,
what I show you is important.

700
00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.080
Now you have to make sure that,
uh,
the relationship,

701
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:42.160
what the causal relationship shows is really close.
All right?

702
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.880
And therefore we shall investigate by the aid of deduction how one of the two

703
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:53.140
terms has produced the other one.
Right now today we would say,
uh,

704
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.660
what Durkheim is suggesting,

705
00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.420
if you want to establish real causality,

706
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.980
short of the possibility of an expanding mount or metro,

707
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:06.460
you'll have to figure out what is the cause or mechanism.

708
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.700
But relates the two phenomena to gather,

709
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.760
which as statistically correlated to each other,

710
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.620
statistical correlation does not necessarily show that they are,

711
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:22.570
one is causing the other one,
right?
Uh,
there are,
uh,
uh,

712
00:50:22.571 --> 00:50:23.201
that,
you know,

713
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:28.201
you have a theory that the storage brings the baby and then you test this and

714
00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:30.170
you show that,
you know,

715
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:34.730
fertility in Scandinavia is low and there are not many stuartship.

716
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:39.470
So you have a very strong correlation between number of starches and number of

717
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:43.280
babies being born.
This still does not sure that,
right.

718
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:46.550
The storage is bring the babies,
right?
Therefore,

719
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:50.530
you have to look at the causal mechanism,
how babies are being produced.

720
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:51.530
That's basically,

721
00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:56.531
I think a very early insightful are human by your cams methodology.

722
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.700
And that's about it.
Thank you.

723
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:07.970
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
