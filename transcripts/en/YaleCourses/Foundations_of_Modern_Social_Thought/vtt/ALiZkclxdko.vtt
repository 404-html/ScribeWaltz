WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.480
Okay.
Uh,
now,
uh,

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.830
today we move basically if you move into the 20th century,

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
um,
uh,
and there's a lot of similarity between the three.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.300
Auteurist will be discussing a nature,
a fried,
um,

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.090
and,
uh,
uh,
Max Faber.
Um,
uh,

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
you know,
they're kind of,
you'll be of somewhat different kind of study.

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.090
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
all the,
I mean,

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.230
Nicha of course that in 1900,

9
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:38.580
but he was out of action for 10 years because of mental illness.

10
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:43.260
Vallish severe mental illness.
He published all of his work in the 19th century.

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180
Um,
uh,
Freud and,
uh,
uh,

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.040
Weber's started to publish in the 19th century.

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.460
But these three characters in many ways are very important bridges,
uh,

14
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.880
Tovar.
It's a 20th century social theory.
Um,

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.260
and are they,
uh,
they,
uh,
did foreshadow,
uh,
uh,

16
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.110
uh,
a great deal of theorizing,

17
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:11.580
particularly during the second half of the 20th century,

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.860
especially in the last,
uh,
30 or 40 years.
Um,

19
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.230
uh,
I think it also very easy to say the point of departure,

20
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.110
um,
uh,
uh,
from Marx,
uh,
some continuative,

21
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.560
but basic point of departure from marks in the work of nature.

22
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.850
Um,
uh,
fried and,
and a vapor,

23
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.280
um,
uh,
if I can put it very simply,
uh,

24
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.980
the major departure it is,
uh,
uh,
that they all,
uh,

25
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.910
our depart from Mark's,
uh,
economic reductionism,

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.240
right.
Uh,
the emphasis on economic entered us,

27
00:01:55.241 --> 00:02:00.160
which is actually not only marks,
right?
It was a common,
uh,

28
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.590
uh,
in Adam Smith's and Mark's,
uh,
as a,

29
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.970
as val,
they depart from this and uh,
uh,

30
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.710
the,
uh,
um,

31
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.770
emphasize that the problem in modernity is not so much in the economic system

32
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.160
and it is much more,
uh,
in terms of,
um,
uh,

33
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.580
power and consciousness.
Uh,

34
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.960
the problem of modernity is a repression,

35
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.670
uh,
in [inaudible],
um,
uh,
the,

36
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.390
the problem of modern life is,
uh,
uh,

37
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.800
that we internalize a,

38
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.070
the reasons for our own subjugation as such.

39
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.880
Um,
and somehow he,
we have to figure it out.

40
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.881
How to liberate ourselves from these internalize a subjugation.

41
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.670
Um,
why do we obey orders?
Uh,

42
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.900
why do avi actually,
except that we are subjugated,

43
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.740
this is the central question.
Um,
I think,
and each,

44
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.980
a fried and vapor are posing.
Um,

45
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.730
uh,
it's again,
a question which has not been really asked.
Uh,
uh,

46
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:23.620
by,
um,
uh,
the other theorists we discuss so far,
they just,

47
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.830
uh,
um,
had a,
uh,
you know,

48
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.831
cvs of society as a point of reference for the good society.

49
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.940
Uh,
now the problem,
uh,

50
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.020
for Nicha Fried and vapor is in US internally in us.

51
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:45.160
How,
how,
how have you solved the problem and we see in ourselves.

52
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.620
So in a,
this is a kind of,
uh,

53
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.620
introducing the three quarters in some days,
uh,

54
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.190
one can say in each of Freud and Viber,

55
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.700
uh,
not only foreshadows a 20th century social theory,

56
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:05.701
but in some days the order first of postmodern theorist that I had,

57
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.520
the theorist which,
uh,

58
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.700
beginning to come to terms with the uh,
the um,
uh,

59
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.710
um,
or oppressive nature of modernity and try to figure it out,
how to,

60
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.780
uh,
how to transcend that.
Uh,
um,
uh,
now,

61
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.643
um,

62
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.690
I think what I asked you to read for today is probably the most difficult text,

63
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:32.890
uh,
uh,
for the semester,
the genealogy of morals.

64
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.580
And you may have been greatly frustrated by it and probably also irritated by it

65
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:43.810
because he's a very provocative mind.
Um,
uh,

66
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.090
I hook you did what I suggested,

67
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:51.091
namely you had a cursory reading of the text before today and now you can go

68
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:55.620
back to the tax stuff during my lecture notes.
Uh,

69
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.550
and I think that should be,

70
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:02.551
it should help you to find your way out and to see what he is a reality up to.

71
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.700
Now,
what is he up to?

72
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.850
Let me just foreshadow before I get into his life and work and particularly in

73
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:17.260
genealogy of morals.
That is another point in which,
uh,

74
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.660
um,
uh,
um,
uh,

75
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:24.640
nature fried and they burn can be understood,
uh,

76
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.650
um,
uh,
in relationship to a marks.
Uh,

77
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.090
in my very introductory comments,
I emphasize the difference,
right?

78
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.340
The shift of a,
from the economy to the question of power and domination.

79
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.340
But that is a point in which that is a continuities between them and marks,

80
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.270
um,
uh,

81
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.140
nature fried and the dual mainly vapor.
I mean,

82
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:54.610
labor is a somewhat more complicated story,

83
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.280
but certainly niche and fried and critical theorists,

84
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.450
critical theorists in the,
as we defined this earlier,
right?

85
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.360
Critical theorist that they are offering,

86
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.570
get criticism of human consciousness,

87
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.930
what is in our mind and how did it get into our mind and how,

88
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.691
you know,

89
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:19.691
and the problem of our consciousness in relationship to our existence.

90
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.680
And this is very much critical theory as it was defined by Hagar and then the

91
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.831
young Marx.

92
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:31.730
So he galleon marks the marsh of Betty Betty's manuscript,
right?

93
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.800
The marks off of alienation,
right?
Um,
and this is very,

94
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.830
very much coming from this tradition and the central issue is how can we subject

95
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.860
to critical scrutiny and the initials case,
um,

96
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.530
uh,

97
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.450
that is an incredible at them to being made here to try to offer a critical

98
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.284
theory.

99
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.660
We actually does not really have a critical vantage point,

100
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.823
right?

101
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.040
All critical theories of Hagar and marks and 20th century critical theory do

102
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:14.231
have an idea of a good society of an emancipated human existence.

103
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.100
And they criticize the reality,

104
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.550
the society where they are analyzing from the point of view of this critical

105
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:29.000
vantage point.
Nicha is different.
Uh,

106
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:32.960
he is really the most radical of critical theorist.

107
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.510
And in the 20th century,

108
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.780
the theorist which builds the most consistently on it is Michelle Fuoco,

109
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.880
right?
To try to create right a clearly,

110
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.080
which is critical of existence and our consciousness,

111
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.970
but critical without telling you what is good,
right?

112
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.130
But you should be aspiring for and that's exactly what,

113
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:05.900
um,
uh,
may chase trying to do it.
It's sort of the screening of the circle.

114
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.560
Can you be critical of a situation if you cannot tell what is the good outcome?

115
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.413
Right?

116
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.100
Can you actually subject the very notion of the good society,

117
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.530
the good to critical scrutiny?
This is what he's trying to do,

118
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.450
right?
To offer such a theory.
Uh,
well,

119
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.210
uh,
fried is different,
right?

120
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.950
Freud is a critical theorists beyond the,
um,
um,
uh,

121
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.290
Hagle and beyond mark.
He does agree with marks,
uh,
that,
uh,

122
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.170
uh,
we have to find the,

123
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:50.171
some critical analysis which is rooted in our sensors experiences.

124
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.500
And somehow the have to relate the problems of our consciousness to our sensors

125
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:01.290
experiences,
right?
In this respect,

126
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:06.291
Freud is very much in the line of Mark's critique of Hagar.

127
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.840
This is not simply radicalizing your consciousness.

128
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.640
You have to confront your consciousness,
which your sensors experiences,

129
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.530
but is different from Mark's.

130
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.370
Because I pointed this out earlier very briefly because in Mark's,

131
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.470
the sensors activity is production.

132
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.070
It is economic activity.
For Freud,

133
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.640
it is our sexual experiences,
right?

134
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.360
And he offers a criticism of our consciousness by confronting us.

135
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.360
Bit are repressed sexual experiences in our earlier life,

136
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.630
right?
So this is a critical theory,
right?
He said,

137
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:52.140
what you think is in your mind is right.
No,
no,
no,
it isn't.
Right.

138
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.780
You have to think about all of your experiences of your earlier sexual life.

139
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.590
And then when you figure out what you repressed as bad memories,

140
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.720
that's when you will actually,

141
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.280
we'll be able to have a healthier cyclic life,
right?

142
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.170
They'll,
uh,
uh,
vapor is more complicated than be,

143
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:17.320
we'll come back to this Weber's critical theory when we get to vapor and,

144
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.860
and to the question whether he's a critical theorist,

145
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:23.720
that all that has been highly debated.
Okay.
King,
I think not,

146
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:28.530
we are ready for Fridich Nicha and I hope this makes more sense now for you.

147
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.550
Right?
But you were reading,
right?
Right.

148
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:34.830
And let me just emphasize one more time,
right?

149
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.160
The big project in Nicha is to offer a critical scrutiny of human mind,

150
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.150
but not to have any critical vantage point,
right?

151
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.540
To criticize the very principles of good society and good to critical scrutiny.

152
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.750
Where does it come from them?
We have the conception of good,

153
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.890
right?
And good society.
That is his project.

154
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.030
It's an incredible intellectual venture,
right?
As I said,

155
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.300
it is this kind of squaring of the circle,

156
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:17.460
but he does what he does with a great deal of power and he does it extremely

157
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:21.600
provocatively,
ivy or put up a couple of quotations for it.

158
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.370
Each are outrageous.
Don't walk out on it,
right?

159
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.120
They are little.
Hold your breasts.
Listen,

160
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.450
this is the outrageous,
what he's saying.
He's at Provo capture.
Um,

161
00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:39.330
he is likable,
so he's only verse down,
so right.

162
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.130
He provokes us even more than Andrew.
So,
uh,

163
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.930
but you know,
deep down he's a very sensitive,
you know,

164
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.900
very humanistic human being,
right?

165
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.290
He provokes about if you'll listen Tierra 40,
you'll figure it out.

166
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.300
That is a something,

167
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:03.301
but you actually can relate to it when you think what is actually is trying to

168
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:06.650
get at all.
Right.
Here is a niche.

169
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.090
And let me just very briefly,
Russia,
his life.

170
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:15.420
He was born in 1844 and the small city of [inaudible] in Germany near Leipzig.

171
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.360
And this is very important.

172
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:22.870
His father was a Lutheran Minister and the family was,

173
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:27.610
or clergy looked at and clergy and his bringing up a very,

174
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:30.760
in a very religious,
uh,
sentiments,
uh,

175
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.920
a very religious family.
And in many ways a,

176
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.470
his work is a reaction against the father.

177
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.920
And it is a reaction against the kind of a Lutheran Christianity he was deeply

178
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.890
internalized into.
I think this is very important to understand.
I mean,

179
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.900
I,

180
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.900
I know that most of the people in this room have strong feelings of in the Judeo

181
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.110
Christian tradition,
and he had to acts also Judeochristian tradition.

182
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.510
This is a revolt against the father.

183
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.140
This is a vote against what he was brought up to.

184
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.500
It is an attempt to find himself,
right?

185
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.390
That's what he's trying to get at.

186
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.690
And you have to be a little tolerant about him,
you know,
and he's attempting,

187
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.270
you did that as well.

188
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:23.850
Your Verda voting against your parents and you were very revolting against,
uh,

189
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.180
some of the fundamental principles you were born.
And two,

190
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.170
he actually enrolls.

191
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.220
So to the University of Brown to become a Lutheran Minister and himself,

192
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.710
he studies theology as it happens to many people actually who enrolled into a

193
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:45.580
seminary doesn't take him too long to become an atheist.

194
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.840
Uh,
very often,
you know,
the,
uh,
uh,

195
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.910
seminaries are the best training grounds for eight days stride.

196
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.900
You beginning to see somehow the complexity of theological thought.

197
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.080
This is what he experienced.
So he quits after a year.
Here he realized is he,

198
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.130
he's on his way to become an eight days.
Right.
And if you're not,
become,
um,

199
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.600
um,
a,
um,
uh,
a minister,
actually this happened to my,

200
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.580
my brother as well.
Uh,
he actually did not quit.
He did finish,

201
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.230
uh,
uh,
he,
he was also trained as a Lutheran minister,

202
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.460
but by the end,
uh,
uh,
of his theological training,

203
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.530
he was,
I don't think he ever confessed,
but he was actually in eight days.

204
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.690
So I have personal experiences.
Right.
But theology can do through you.

205
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.830
Right.
Um,
uh,
okay.
Uh,
then 68,

206
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.650
there's a very important event in his life.
Uh,

207
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.080
he needs the greatest composers of his time,
rehabbed Wagner,

208
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:55.090
and they become great friends for a time and they become bitter enemies later

209
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:58.680
on.
And this is very important why this happened.
Uh,

210
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.690
he is appointed as professor of classical philosophy at the University of Basel

211
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.380
before he got actually his degree,
but he doesn't do it for too long.
Right?

212
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.640
He's only teaching for eight years in his life.

213
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.850
And then he,
um,
uh,
recreates a,

214
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.570
and he sacrifices his life to scholarly activity.

215
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.650
Spends a lot of time in Italy,
and if he's in Switzerland,

216
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.290
in a small,
beautiful spot sales,
Maria,
uh,

217
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.660
he also meets in the 73.

218
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:37.661
Paul Ray and a German philosopher was a great deal of impact on him.

219
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.430
Who introduces him in 82,
two rules.
Salome uh,
his,

220
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:43.700
uh,

221
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.700
only real but very passionate lover and Ivo say a few verse about this.

222
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:54.710
Later on in 88,
he becomes mentally ill.
The story of his men,

223
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.060
uh,
beginning of his mental illness tells you a lot about him.
Uh,

224
00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:02.090
he is in general,
uh,
in Italy.

225
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.090
And then on he walks on the street and then he sews a carriage driver beating

226
00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:10.190
the horse venge fully,

227
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.010
and then he suddenly cuddles the horse,
uh,

228
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.240
beginning to cry.
And his mind is God,
right?

229
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.890
It falls deeply into mental illness.

230
00:16:22.891 --> 00:16:25.760
He never recovers anymore.
It's,

231
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:30.440
I think there's a lot about who Nicha as a human being was,
right?

232
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.710
And how actually how much compassion he could have been suffering,

233
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.450
right?
Uh,
this work,

234
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:43.451
what you were reading has a lot to do with suffering and gives you a devastating

235
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:49.520
view.
But human suffering means anyway.

236
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:54.470
He is in his care of his mother until she dies.
And,
and,
uh,
um,

237
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:54.630
uh,

238
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:59.630
his care on fortunately for him to his sister Elizabeth,

239
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.270
um,
uh,
and he dies in his home in 1900.

240
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.580
Now,
a bit about Elizabeth Nicha.
Uh,
here she is,

241
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:16.030
she was born two years software.
Um,
uh,
uh,

242
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.300
uh,
nature.
Um,
uh,
and uh,

243
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:25.100
he married a guy whose name was Bernard firster in 80,
85.

244
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.670
And first there was a one of these portal Nazis.

245
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.740
He was a fanatic anti-semite.
Uh,

246
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.200
he was very attracted to this idea of the superior Aryan race and he actually

247
00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:43.961
created an Aryan Colone in Paraguay and moved with Elisabet to Paraguay in a

248
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.370
pure German community.
Uh,
some remains is exist and you know,

249
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:55.030
if you are a devoted now are Nazi,
you may want to visit product vibe because,
uh,

250
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.260
some of these guys,
he'll still hanging out there.

251
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.500
They look like Indians because of course not very pure Aryan nation.

252
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:06.180
They are not blown them,
the blue eyes.

253
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:10.530
And the longer they intermarried with the low cost.
Right.
But anyway,

254
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:14.750
this is what he wanted to do.
It didn't drink that evaluate.
So at one point,
uh,

255
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.760
he committed suicide and Elizabeth are recurrent that to Germany.

256
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.910
Uh,
well I think it's very important that nature,

257
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.210
after she got married,
broke the relationship with,
it's just a,

258
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.110
he just could not stand,
uh,
his,
uh,

259
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.710
brother in law and his antisemitism.
Though you've,

260
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.120
you'll see some of the citations,
which sound very antisemitic.

261
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.170
He was very intolerant about antisemites.
Uh,
uh,

262
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:47.070
this was one of the reasons why he broke his relationship with Richard Wagner.

263
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.240
Um,
but in 94,
uh,

264
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.220
Elizabeth created the niche or archive and nature was insane.
Um,

265
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.970
and uh,
he had a lot of unpublished work manuscripts.

266
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.150
He put it together into an archives and he abused it as much as she could.

267
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.481
Uh,

268
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:11.481
she turned into a right finger and that with the rise of Nazis and now see an

269
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:16.850
admirer of Hitler and he put together a lot of,
uh,
um,

270
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:17.910
um,

271
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:22.910
Nicha test in order to fabricator Nazi ideology out of Nitsa Nature.

272
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.470
And some therefore have been reading for a very long time nature as an ideologue

273
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:29.304
of Nazis.

274
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:34.390
So did other of Hitler who actually even attended the funeral of Elizabeth in

275
00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:39.150
1935 and she died.
Now I think,
uh,
uh,

276
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:44.040
people who read the nature care of fully and to have seen now niches or
original,

277
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.810
um,
uh,
um,
uh,
verche published rather than selections by Elizabeth,

278
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.360
have a great deal of doubt where the niche or has anything to do with
narcissism,

279
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:58.470
though the story's complicated.
Now,
uh,
here we come,
a nice triangle,

280
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.370
Lou Salome,
poultry and Rick nature,

281
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.010
they'll,
I should show this picture of after Freud,
uh,

282
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.890
remember that a watch a watch on it.

283
00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:14.310
It is a very fry Dan kind of presentation.

284
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.290
Louie solo may or ruined the middle and Frederick Nicha,
uh,

285
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.220
uh,
um,
uh,
on the other side of the picture.

286
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.680
Now a loophole and Friedrich,
yeah.
Uh,

287
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.590
for Ray is actually comes from a very varsity Jewish family,

288
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.520
German Jewish family,
uh,

289
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.370
for reasons which is beyond me or occasionally an hid first to him when they

290
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:41.530
already broke up.
Uh,
uh,
as,
uh,
uh,
the,

291
00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:45.540
the English a psychologist,
he was a German philosopher.

292
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.680
And anyway,
he became very good friends.
Uh,
at one point,

293
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.190
I mean,
you know,
initiative was an imbecile block or a son.

294
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:58.810
He Fall in love with people and then he broke just strong glove or struggle,

295
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.890
a strong Keetra.
There was nothing in between.
Uh,
but anyway,

296
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.960
the idea of Janell algae,

297
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:09.961
which is probably the mean bs in niches where it's coming from for Ray,

298
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.400
that he introduced this wonderful young and very smart young lady,

299
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.700
Lou Salome to Nicha and he falls desperately in lover of your 10.

300
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.050
This happened in 82.
She was 21 years old,

301
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.600
as I said,
very beautiful and Vonda food is smart.
Um,

302
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.520
and the veil nature was hoping to marry her.

303
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:38.350
I mean I use was opposed to the idea of marriage,
but,
uh,
you know,

304
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:43.351
he's writing letters to pour a kind of not over there that that is a

305
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:49.051
relationship going on between Corey and Lou that he was to marry her probably

306
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:54.000
for two years or something.
And uh,
anyway,
um,
uh,
I think,
uh,

307
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.040
by all likelihood the daddy's an interesting loft triangle going on here for the

308
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.730
vial,
but then she's impossible.
And Louise,

309
00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:07.731
I seen woman and at one point she just cannot take her his insanity anymore and

310
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:14.521
he moves to Badlin ellipse for Avaya foray and then do,

311
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:18.350
he's also opposed to marriage.
You know,
we are late 19th century.

312
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.780
He Ryan that is adequate or ideas about sexuality and marriage,

313
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.030
but then he's still married a this guy,
linguist on gas.

314
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.050
And if she was also a very smart woman,

315
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.050
she at one point said they wrote a book together,

316
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:36.340
re Nicha and herself and she never published that.
Uh,

317
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.940
she said this one,
I like this,
the spidey man,
the joy in the book by the three,

318
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.240
we never,
you know,
I,
as far as I know,
it never had.

319
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.430
And I don't important person in his life.
Uh,
Rehab Wagner,

320
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.560
uh,
well,
uh,

321
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:55.561
a niche of as a music fanatic in an arena or at the end of his boyhood.

322
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.860
And then he rather,
uh,

323
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:02.950
Wagner's piano landscape of Tristan and Isolde.
Uh,

324
00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:07.210
he just fall in love with that.
That was the music he was looking for.

325
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.020
Um,
he buy,
he was,
he was a hero worshiper.
A,

326
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.470
that's why,
you know,
people,
some people read steel in him,

327
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.530
kind of throttle on us is to you like strong,
beautiful people who are here.

328
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:25.160
Roy,
he can do act,
do heroic act like degree.
Uh,

329
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:29.410
right.
Uh,
a beautiful young man.

330
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:34.070
Powerful.
Right.
And she,
Roy drag the gods,
the Greek gods.

331
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.080
That's what he,
uh,
really,
uh,
empire.

332
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.690
This is what he found in Wagner's music.
Yeah.

333
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.740
A rejection of the roost.
Rosie,

334
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.740
any kind of sentimental ism of Italian music and the,

335
00:23:46.741 --> 00:23:50.440
in fact the classicism and coldness.
So,
um,
um,

336
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.840
and Beth tentious Nash,
uh,

337
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
in the music off of Beethoven and what he found is something,

338
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:02.930
yeah,
I knew in a bag now,
so he was attracted to Vagner.
Um,
and,
uh,

339
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.930
um,
as he was becoming a,

340
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.300
actually increasing the antisemitic,
uh,

341
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.100
under the influence of his last wife,

342
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:18.100
go see mark who was the daughter of France,
lists the composer and,
and laws,

343
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:23.750
a yak 50 evo person.
Um,
uh,
and also,
uh,

344
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:24.920
Ragnar was changing.

345
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:29.950
He was becoming in some ways what kind of more Christian or something,

346
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.600
and he was writing this,

347
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.380
I actually have to contest love the opera Parsifal niche check would not take

348
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.580
it.
You know,
I just was impossible for him.
So then they break,
uh,

349
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:49.630
he could not stand Wagner's antisemitism anti could not stand Barsi fraud and

350
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:52.280
the kind of expression of,

351
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.550
I don't know anybody ever hurt Prosti file.

352
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.823
<v 1>No.</v>

353
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.780
<v 0>A lot on the easy stuff.
Um,
it's a,
it's a sounds like an auto Cory on,</v>

354
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.370
uh,
uh,
it has some Bach Ian kind of elements in it.

355
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.530
Um,
uh,
and uh,
it's about,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

356
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.840
the sacrifice of the lamb of God,

357
00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:19.280
Jesus sacrifice and the performance of the mass.

358
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.420
And the call,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

359
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.540
uh,
uh,
oh Jesus.

360
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.170
Blobbed as such,
I mean,
I,
anyway,

361
00:25:32.171 --> 00:25:36.310
this was certainly a niche of us,
not a buyer for it.
Now,

362
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.560
Justin Brewer at about,
uh,
uh,
his first book,
the burst of the Tatra d,

363
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.470
uh,
bitch,
ah,
um,
uh,
as I said,

364
00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:49.070
he was a great admirer of the Greek civilization.
Um,
and if he,

365
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.360
if he had a,
he,
he,
he,

366
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:56.361
his idea is that the whole human history is given by the struggle between a on

367
00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:01.660
Nizhan and Apollonian principle.
Now you're in Asia and means,
right,

368
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.280
your sentiments,
right,
you act out of your instincts.

369
00:26:06.281 --> 00:26:11.080
And Apollonian means the reason as such,
and the,

370
00:26:11.081 --> 00:26:15.640
you know,
the contrast,
enlightenment,
enlightenment is reason.

371
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.670
It's a big journey of Apollonian principal over the Dionysian tens it ball and

372
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:27.090
he kind of rejected.
This is why he's also kind of postmodern three.

373
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.900
He Rejects Enlightenment and enlightenment,
excessive rationalism.

374
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.720
And this is why actually he liked Wagner because he thought in Vagner,
uh,

375
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.060
the,
uh,
dot.

376
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:43.770
Your nation at the Apollonian components are being combined,
right?

377
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.510
Uh,
passion and reason are put together.
Um,
uh,

378
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.540
and Wagner loved the book.
Then he dies the book.
Uh,

379
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:58.170
1979,
1879,
a human all too human,

380
00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:03.171
which starts from Voltaire and the sort of lay effication of the free thinkers.

381
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.410
Now he's a free thinker.
Uh,

382
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.300
and he also breaks with Romanticism and,
um,
and uh,

383
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.130
for follows ray.
And he said,
well,

384
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:19.131
what we have to do is to subject the Christian idea of good and evil to critical

385
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:24.420
scrutiny and not to accept that there is some general principle of good and

386
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:29.250
therefore he trusts to develop the genealogy of morals.
Now,

387
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.030
as you can see by now that Nicha are on collision course,
right?

388
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.420
A Nicha is now subjecting the very core of Judeo Christian tradition to critical

389
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:44.070
scrutiny.
Uh,
while,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

390
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.220
Ragnar is writing policy fall and,
uh,
being,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

391
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.110
the holy grail and as key disease,
uh,
Wagner,

392
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.620
assuming Leven has not read the book,
uh,
he,
uh,

393
00:27:55.650 --> 00:28:00.510
he heard about it and rejected it.
He did not buy anything about this.
Now,

394
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:04.170
this is a niche,
just housings,
uh,
Sales Maria.

395
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.680
He went there for the first time in 81.

396
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.630
Fell in love with this and spend time there until he became ill.

397
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.700
He also,
the genealogy of morals he wrote to his mother.

398
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:22.510
Finally,
I found a lovely,
you're spot on earth.
And,
um,
he,
uh,

399
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.300
was greatly inspired.
This is about,

400
00:28:24.301 --> 00:28:29.301
he wrote the book also Sprach Zara to star does spokes that are too strong.

401
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.710
Um,
uh,

402
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.980
this is a kind of a book which is a central attack on Jude Judaeo Christian

403
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:41.080
morality,
but he found repressive and wants to get out of it.

404
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.570
His hero is our across Strava,

405
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.730
which is modeled after the Persian prophet Zoroaster.

406
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.120
And he calls him that the first of immortalist dare to be immoral is what you

407
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:55.670
have to do.
That the,

408
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.670
he tries to find the middle way right within the repressive grew,

409
00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:04.430
they were Christian morality.
And Nicholas,
he,
he wants to get a,
uh,

410
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.410
doesn't want to reject everything.
Uh,

411
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:10.780
and that's where he beginning to develop the audio of the Uber.
Man,

412
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.960
I wish we would have more time to talk about this.
Uh,
um,
uh,
the Uber Man,

413
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:20.520
she's basically the person who brings his life under his own control.

414
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.940
It's not quite what you think the Uber Man shares,
right.

415
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.240
The stereotypes about the Uber Manch that this was the kind of Nazi idea of the

416
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:33.020
blown the Germans,
right?
Which are superhuman.
Well,

417
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:37.440
nature has a philosophical notion of the Uber match the Uber Man.

418
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.210
She's the person who achieves south master you who basically the alienated

419
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.680
person,
right.
Who is in control of his own life.
Right.

420
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.910
And can express himself authentically this out or oppressive civilization.

421
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.470
Right.
That's,
that's the Uber match in a vague,
this is a book.

422
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.390
It is an idea of a boat harbor.
Not a passive would,
huh?

423
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.550
He this lie boot highs as much as she like this slide,

424
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:08.010
the Judeo Christian tradition that the problem with the boot,

425
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.760
his boss,
that it is still passive.
He,

426
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.750
he wanted to have an active with his new ride.

427
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.590
Somebody who becomes a master of its life through action,

428
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:22.150
acting out its feelings and its,
uh,
uh,
uh,
even,

429
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.190
uh,
sensual,
uh,
essence in,
in,
in life.

430
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.680
Um,
uh,
and therefore he,
he can overcome what he calls the attorney return,

431
00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:37.480
right?
And he can overcome the island low of these,
you know,

432
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:41.790
this is again comes from almost marks.
Slide reified consciousness.

433
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.690
The lay fired word can be broken.
There are no rules,
right?

434
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.880
You can,
I,

435
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.810
you can realize yourself in the world and you are not ruled by the external.

436
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.430
And now he's ready for the genealogy of morals.

437
00:30:57.431 --> 00:31:00.370
I have some 12 minutes for this.

438
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.340
What are the major contribution?
Well,
he reconstructs the,
the,

439
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.290
the methodology or genealogy,

440
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.690
but he takes from ray and uh,

441
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.690
and he discovers what he calls the origins of morality.
Uh,

442
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.020
and then he introduces a difference.
Okay,

443
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.240
what is the difference between good and bad,

444
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:26.410
where this is coming from and good and evil that this is coming from.

445
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:28.870
And he compares the two ways,

446
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:32.980
how this dichotomy that some behavior is good or there is bad,

447
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:37.030
some behavior is good or that is evil,
that this is coming from.

448
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.090
And this is the essence of the genealogical method,
right?

449
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.730
He does not need that critical vantage point.

450
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.230
The good and the evo distinction can be criticized from the good,

451
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:52.240
bad distinction point of view and the good,
uh,
and,
and vice a versa.

452
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:57.250
You see,
ah,
this is the essence of genealogical mattered.
Um,

453
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.330
as a full core veal interpreted,
give me an ocean,

454
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.360
tell me what is right,
right.
And what I do,

455
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:09.190
I take the same conception back in history and then they'll show what you think

456
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:14.191
is right just or mobile has been at one point of time regarded as evs.

457
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:19.600
What you should fight for and tell me what you think is evo and I go back in

458
00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:24.601
history and I will show you instances that what you think is evil was actually

459
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:28.120
admired and was seen as ethical,
right?

460
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.530
This is the essence,
right,
of the genealogical mattered,
right?

461
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.750
That you compare two ways,

462
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:39.930
how morality is being constructed and you are criticized one from the point of

463
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:41.060
view of the other,

464
00:32:41.061 --> 00:32:46.061
this south taking sites that do actually use them as such.

465
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.370
And then he develops,
you know,

466
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:54.371
the kind of origins of the notion of evil out of slave morality and restaurant

467
00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.390
demand.
And then it comes to one of the most controversial issue,

468
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.300
the idea of the blonde beast,
the bird of gray.
Um,

469
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:09.050
and the origins of ideals of what can be easily.
I think,

470
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.410
again,
I'd have to ask for your patients.

471
00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:18.030
And then the idea of Eva Manchuria and finally the origins of punishment and,

472
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:23.120
uh,
Beth consciousness and deal.
Okay.
So as I sat here,

473
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:25.460
reconstruct the genealogical mattered.

474
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.050
I think it's a wonderful sentence how the whole book begins.

475
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.200
The are on the norm to ourselves,

476
00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.650
the knowers and did good reason.

477
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.340
We have never looked at ourselves,
right?

478
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.240
This is critical theory.
What he suggest,
right?

479
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.140
You think you know a lot of stuff about,
you know,

480
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.080
Hobbes and Locke and Rousseau and now nature,

481
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.040
but you don't look at yourself,
look at yourself,

482
00:33:55.130 --> 00:34:00.130
be critical of your own consciousness and especially the major step here,

483
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.920
try to subject the very conceptions what you think is ethical to critical

484
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:10.560
scrutiny.
Is there,
does this idea come from uh,
uh,
uh,

485
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.030
and he said he is real argument.

486
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:17.270
Is that the origins of the term good and evil?
Good.

487
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:22.650
And do we have to discover how it actually was constructed and not with,

488
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.770
uh,
uh,
a more superior principles.
So therefore,

489
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.630
what we need is a critique of moral values.
This is wonderful.
Now,

490
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.960
the value of these values should be subjected to critical scrutiny itself,

491
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.110
right?
And not only the values,
but the values behind the values.
You know,

492
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:47.090
there is an unending criticism,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,
in,

493
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:51.440
in the process.
So this way what nature can do,

494
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:56.150
or he believes he can do,
is to offer a critical analysis.

495
00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:00.620
We sell some ultimate value.
He does not give you ultimate values,

496
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.510
but is the right value is,

497
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:07.520
but he does that without becoming in a holistic and to say anything goes.

498
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.560
Not we can discover the miseries of the world.
We can be upset.

499
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.120
He could solve the,
I was so upset to cuddle this horse,

500
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:21.770
which is beaten,
right?
You can have compassion.
Uh,
and he,
uh,

501
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.450
uh,
he sure this was an inspiration for full call.
All right.

502
00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:30.740
The difference is in the origins of good and bad and good and evil.
Well,

503
00:35:30.741 --> 00:35:32.460
I think this is a,
a pretty,
uh,

504
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:37.410
probably the most straightforward part in the text.
What you have read.
Yes.

505
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:40.230
He said,
thou then the use the verb good.
You,

506
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:45.231
Oh van often see that God has something to do with it being not a [inaudible].

507
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.571
He said,

508
00:35:46.571 --> 00:35:51.571
[inaudible] that's not so it has nothing to do with non egoistic in terms of its

509
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.950
origin.
It was constructive and non egoistical later on.

510
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.080
And she said,
where does a good coming from?
It is coming from a master race.

511
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.710
A master is which show store itself as good and defined the dose who were

512
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:14.280
subjected to each rule.
Uh,
usually dark standard,

513
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:18.800
uh,
natives,
uh,
as bad.
Um,
uh,
uh,

514
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.860
that is where the notion of good and bad is coming from.

515
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:28.350
Um,
but that's different with priests.
Uh,
uh,

516
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.970
you know,
he was studying to become a minister and he really disliked priests,

517
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.420
priests,
you know,
very in these dark hoses,
you don't know what they are,

518
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.860
not the chivalry.

519
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.730
Alastar cratic kind like the Greek as Sandy,

520
00:36:41.731 --> 00:36:46.470
Garth's and God's right,
uh,
who are confident in themselves.

521
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.570
And,
uh,
therefore,
uh,

522
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.450
the chivalry can Edisto cratic distinction,
right?
Which was that the physical,

523
00:36:54.451 --> 00:36:58.140
the good,
you know,
um,
uh,
the beautiful body,

524
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:02.370
the man and women,
uh,
of,
of,
of Greek antiquity,

525
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:03.900
um,
uh,

526
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.080
or could see themselves as good and others who were not as good as crippled.

527
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.660
They've are bad.
Now,
uh,
uh,

528
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.860
the police are powerless and his powerlessness,

529
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:21.930
at least to his credit,
he shut off those who have power,
right?

530
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.780
And now those who have power as seen by the power,

531
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.850
less as evo,
not simply as bad,
but as evo.

532
00:37:29.851 --> 00:37:33.720
So now the contrast is not between good and bad,

533
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:39.150
but between good and evil.
But what turned that around,
uh,
is,

534
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:42.840
uh,
the power relationship and now comes the slave morality.

535
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:47.490
And now he said it was the Jews.
That was the priest,
the nation,

536
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:49.140
the nation of priest.
Um,

537
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:54.500
and the origins of Christianity a brought about this reversal saying all the

538
00:37:55.951 --> 00:38:00.750
doors who suffer are good,
only poor.
The powerless are good,
right?

539
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.640
The reach and those in power are evo,
right?
Um,

540
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.930
and,
uh,
the slave revolt of moralities,

541
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.190
each ad begins with the Jewish rev world.
Uh,

542
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.970
and this has a,
a thousand years of history.
And you know what,

543
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.290
that was victorious.
This is the dominant mortality of our times.

544
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.910
And he said,
this leads to the,
and,

545
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.800
and here you can see this is not an antisemitic statement.

546
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:33.450
This is a criticism of the Judeo Christian morality.
And in fact,

547
00:38:33.451 --> 00:38:36.240
the real target is Christian morality.

548
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.500
That's why he said this is the horrible paradox of God on the cross,

549
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.300
right?
Uh,
that that is,
you know,
when,

550
00:38:44.301 --> 00:38:47.200
when you sort of turn right,
uh,

551
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:51.550
adores doors without sin to carry the sin of human kind,

552
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:56.440
the Sev crucifixion of God for the salvation of mankind,

553
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.000
right?
And this is a,

554
00:38:58.001 --> 00:39:02.950
these restaurant he meant a very strong team on that is no proper English or

555
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:07.840
German word for it right now,
beginning to see the enemy,

556
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:12.160
not simply as bad as,
you know,
I don't care that it's bad.
I defeated,

557
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.260
but it is easier.

558
00:39:13.261 --> 00:39:18.120
It may even defeat me and now comes the boom beast.
And other approvals,

559
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.040
Sandoz statement,
the center of all knowable,

560
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:25.560
racist from cannot fail to see the beast of prey,
tobacco,

561
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.860
inefficient blonde beast,

562
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.880
a writer and heavily [inaudible] around to spoil and victory,

563
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.720
right?
As I said,
Chiro via worship.
But let's uh,
you know,

564
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.610
uh,
is this the German blonde?
He said,
well,
Europe feud with horror,

565
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.720
the reaching of the blood Germanic beast for centuries,

566
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.660
but then he asked watch together fully,
right?

567
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.920
Although between the origin and manage people and us Germans,

568
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.190
that is cast the,
an idea in common,

569
00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:02.200
let along blood relationship,
right?
This is not Nazi ideology,

570
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:02.860
right?

571
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.860
This is a kind of a argument that being powerful being the realizing yourself

572
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.290
is,
uh,
uh,

573
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:15.630
is actually what is the job or what you should be striving for a well,

574
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:21.910
I think this is a very important try this,
this last sentence,

575
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.560
14th here.
Uh,
I'd,

576
00:40:24.561 --> 00:40:28.780
what happening in European situation is a kind of a leveling right?

577
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:33.220
Today we see nothing but wants to expand,
uh,

578
00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.590
the organic thinner,
right?

579
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.750
You're not as strong as the statute in Greek statue to her.

580
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:45.640
Right?
And better nature,
right?
Clever.

581
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:50.860
I'm more comfortable and more medial car.

582
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.580
And he said,
well,
I had a bad day.
It smells what?

583
00:40:55.581 --> 00:41:00.581
I'm horrible modernity right now they become own major and all the same and we

584
00:41:01.421 --> 00:41:05.170
cannot feel fill ourselves.
Right.
And then,

585
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.880
well this is a very nice,
sporty,
provocative,

586
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:12.850
but you know,
think about it then.

587
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.040
That is just nothing strange about the fact that the lamps smear a garage door

588
00:41:18.321 --> 00:41:20.710
Varsa large birds of prey.

589
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:26.130
But that is no reason to blame the large birds of prey for and the little lab,

590
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.660
there are no lamps.
Circle each charter,

591
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:33.930
these words pray our evening meal and whoever is least slide a birds of prey.

592
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:39.470
I'm was like the opposite like us.
The lamb is good,
isn't it?

593
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.363
Right.

594
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:45.470
Those who dominate is bad and doors we are the suffering God,
the good ones.

595
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.060
Bad.
Yeah.
The bird afraid as finance,

596
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.690
they don't bear any garage at all towards was good labs.

597
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.970
In fact,
we love them,
right?

598
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.040
Nothing tastes better than I can.

599
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.060
All right,
well as I said,
this is disturbing,

600
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:10.850
but I think the point is what he is calling for,

601
00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:13.930
right [inaudible] of individual.
And the,

602
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:19.160
and his desperation that in modern world we cannot fulfill ourselves.

603
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.250
And here comes the workshop.
Our ideals,

604
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.750
the ideas are fabricated.
He said in this workshop,

605
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:31.751
realize are turning weakness into accomplishment.

606
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.330
In Paul Importance,
uh,
um,
uh,

607
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.380
mark to retaliate is being turned into goodness.

608
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.560
Though you are only in important and you beginning to construct your pretense

609
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.220
has good.
You are not good.
You can't do anything about it.

610
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.300
And submission to people you hate.

611
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.630
That's what you call obedience.
Not because they,

612
00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:00.560
you really accept their superiority because you are afraid of them.

613
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.570
And then you construct a good notion out of this obedience.
This is a good word.

614
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.510
Um,
now he said there are,

615
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.760
they are also talking to love your enemy,
um,

616
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.830
and our sweat by the assays,
right?

617
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.410
It's a big lie.
You don't love you on it.
You hit the gestalt of them.

618
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.490
You say you love them and me and values,
right?

619
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:30.390
That's what he said.
You know,
this is the workshop,
right in which,
uh,

620
00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.850
uh,
uh,
uh,
the ideas are created.

621
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.410
This is where they call it the triumph of justice.
Uh,

622
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.790
you don't hate your enemy.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.

623
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.700
You hate injustice,
right?

624
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
You create your enemy as in just right and are there other thing?

625
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.070
Well,
this is why anime and he's stronger than me.
Um,

626
00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:01.240
well therefore he said the workshops where ideas are fabricated,

627
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:06.170
they s change of lies and again,

628
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:10.370
better get out of here.
Clean Air,

629
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.200
less stark.
True,
not lies.
That's the point.

630
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:20.060
And Eva,
man,
she's the one which will,
right?
Because either manages,
uh,

631
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:24.530
he said,
well,
a good and bad,
good and evil food together.

632
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.380
Now the good and evil is a dominating us.
They are,

633
00:44:29.381 --> 00:44:33.570
the renaissance was brilliant.
It was reconstructing ride the,

634
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:37.740
our classical idea.
Um,
but Dan Kim again,

635
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:41.400
you said the Judah three [inaudible] gain again,
be careful,

636
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:45.780
not anti Semitic nose.
It's again more like a against looter.
Then again,

637
00:44:45.781 --> 00:44:50.781
Jews is that thanks to the basically proletarian German and English arrest song,

638
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.650
Chemo moving around car that the reformation,
right?

639
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.430
That's his real enemy here.
And he said,
well,

640
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:05.340
if we don't have time to labor on this very briefly,

641
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:09.870
origins of punishment,
we have to forget.

642
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.820
A forget is we have to suppress memories,
which were bad.

643
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.840
And in order to suppress,
uh,
uh,
well,
uh,

644
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.340
that is a magnum namel techniques,
uh,

645
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.370
that means that we are actually have been,

646
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:28.910
is the most useful way.

647
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:33.810
How we forget what we have to forget.
We have to remember,
right.

648
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:37.680
Um,
you said these Germans,
donation of thinker me,

649
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:42.270
the memory for themselves,
the fool matters.
Uh,

650
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:46.450
stoning,
breaking,
gone deals reaping.

651
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.610
But Bart and trend pink to this by horses.

652
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.990
All right.
I have to finish it now here.
Uh,

653
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.930
but I hope you get sort of the bottom line,
right?

654
00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.960
The bottom line is have a radical critical theory does not need ultimate value

655
00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:08.721
to be critical of a false ideas and lies get shoes.

656
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:14.150
And the ideal is the person who can fulfill itself right in the world and

657
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:16.560
conquer the world as such.
