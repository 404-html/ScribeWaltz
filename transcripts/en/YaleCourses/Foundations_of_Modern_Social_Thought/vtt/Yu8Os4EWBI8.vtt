WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.970
Well,
I would like to get started.
Good morning.
Yeah.
Uh,

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.530
I had the discussion section.

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:11.550
I realized I sort of screwed my last lecture,

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.570
didn't come pride clearly through,
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.560
either here or Marx theory of alienation.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.520
So I would like to come back to,
uh,

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
the theory of alienation and how Mark's gets to,

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.080
um,
the,
um,
um,
uh,

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.090
bat his manuscripts,
uh,

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.780
before we get into historical materialism.
And,
uh,

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.240
let me just,
uh,
uh,
make,
uh,

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.650
two introductory comments about this.
Uh,

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.970
one important point I tried to make is,
uh,

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.490
um,
uh,
you have to be,

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.730
I think one purpose off my lectures in Mark's is to alert you that there were

16
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.290
two marks is not just one,

17
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.430
and you are likely to know only about one marks,
right?

18
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.260
This is Mark's who had the theory of class struggle and the theory of

19
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.180
exploitation,
right?
And who was a theorist of,
uh,
uh,

20
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.890
communism,
but you may know very little about marks.

21
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:23.680
The idealists that he'd Galley and the humanist,
uh,
um,

22
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.090
who was central idea was the notion of alienation,
right?
Um,

23
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.160
who's major concern was about the human conditions under modernity.

24
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:37.560
And wonder to overcome it.
And uh,
you know,

25
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:42.000
these two very different and Marxists appear to very different audiences.

26
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.740
And in fact,
the first march,
the humanist,
uh,

27
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.780
did he galleon the idealist was almost forgotten for a very long time and was

28
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.330
rediscovered by the 1960s onwards generally.

29
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.140
And so it's very important to see that most likely that what you heard about

30
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.440
marks and I suppose most of you have never read any text from Max as a biased

31
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:13.500
view.
You only move one marks and not bulls.

32
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.950
And my point is to try to introduce you to the complexity that you meet boss

33
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.630
Carl Marx.
Right?

34
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.090
The second point is at that was what I found a um,

35
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.260
a frustrating then the discussion section yesterday,

36
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:35.070
which was one of diverse I did in the last couple of years,

37
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.340
not ever in my life.
I did even for us discussion sections.

38
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.460
But this was the real bad that,
you know,

39
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.140
the importance and the significance of Marcy theory of alienation did not come

40
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:46.890
through.

41
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.890
And I obviously did a very bad job because there are very few text written in

42
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.780
the 17th 18th and 19th centuries,

43
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.170
which are so powerful as so influential and so broadly influential on theories

44
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:05.890
of the 20th century that exactly this text on that Ian Asia.

45
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.180
Ah,
you can sync about literature,
right?

46
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.310
And you can see the extra ordinary impact of the idea of alienation and

47
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:19.960
literature.
Some of you may have read are their commune,

48
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.500
the French novelist,
the stranger.

49
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.640
This is right out of the theory of area nation.

50
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.630
You may be familiar with Franz Kafka,
right?

51
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.340
There you go.
That's the sense of alienation.

52
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.090
You may have watched ever the play wonderful play of Henrik Ibsen bear good.

53
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.200
That's about alienation,
right?

54
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.680
So in the 20th century literature,

55
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.370
the are full with the senses of alienation.

56
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.980
And so his 20th century social theory,

57
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.100
that is no 20th century social theory.

58
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.880
[inaudible] theory of alienation by the way,

59
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.680
is interesting because of that,

60
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.550
his manuscript for the first time was published only in 1930 wrong,

61
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.850
never the less,
the idea was already beginning to creep in earlier.

62
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.240
Smart people read that theory of alienation in Mark's earlier girl Glucophage

63
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.680
for instance.
And then the friend first school,
there is no door,
no,

64
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:30.370
there is no work time or there is no mark Koser.

65
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.570
We saw the theory of area nation and I can go even further.

66
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.920
There is no cultural theory.
We saw the theory of alienation.

67
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.520
There is no Bauman,

68
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.500
there is no color Kowski beside the theory of alienation.

69
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.960
This is a very important idea.

70
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.710
So I have to come back to this and to try to show you how he arrives at this

71
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:54.340
point.

72
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.340
And Vi he abandons it by the second Marxism merging and then he get it starting

73
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:02.080
with the second marks,

74
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.220
the first step Dover's the second marks is the thesis on fire.

75
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.670
But I want to talk about her today and I tried to economize with my time.

76
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.170
Right?
Um,
all right.

77
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:19.171
I have learned from Adam Smith's right to be more utilitarian and to make sure

78
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:24.460
I,
that needs some ants do match with each other or k,

79
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:26.950
let's come back to Hagar and he goes,

80
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.980
theory of alienation because I don't think from the discussion section,

81
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.180
my sense was I did not make it clear enough,

82
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.280
but he goes to your ears and,
uh,
uh,
well,
um,

83
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.130
let me,
uh,
try to labor on this.
Um,
uh,
as I said,
you know,

84
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:46.450
he was an idea this,

85
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:50.470
and I hope I explained it to the extent it is necessary.

86
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.870
Have you come back to this then I'll be,

87
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:57.280
I'll be talking about the thesis on fire back on the German ideology.

88
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.810
But he really thought that somehow,
um,

89
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.540
consciousness receipts,
a material existence,

90
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:09.320
and that's what made him into an idealist,
uh,

91
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.190
how religious he was.
I actually don't know.
This is not a religious,

92
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:15.910
not a theological propositions.
Now,

93
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:20.210
the idea is that before the physical word existed,

94
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.600
there has been an absolute spirit right at the origin of the world.

95
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.320
There is an absolute spirit existing and that existed.

96
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:34.340
The material Verdis such,
um,
uh,

97
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.050
and then,
uh,

98
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:41.051
his central idea is that you can describe the history of the universe as a

99
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:47.351
problem of Eliana nation as a problem of gradual separation.

100
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.200
As I said,
well,
I'm subject and object.

101
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.570
This is a very important idea and B,
you'll have to deal with this in marks.

102
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.050
And even,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

103
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.160
if you are dealing with 20th century theories,
critical theory,

104
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:08.630
this is a central notion of,
you know,
um,
subject and object.

105
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:13.130
Let me try to labor on this a minute and I have to do it on the blackboard.

106
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.970
So,
um,

107
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.693
<v 1>uh,</v>

108
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.710
<v 0>he goes fundamental idea.
Yes.</v>

109
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.230
That's when you have the absolute spirit.

110
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.280
<v 0>All right.
Uh,
and this is not that person or God,
right?</v>

112
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:35.500
But just the idea here,

113
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.950
this is a situation of totality.

114
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.640
The absolute spit it is at the same time subject and object United in itself.

115
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.490
Right?
And that's what he got costs totality.

116
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:53.450
And as the term totality being used,

117
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:56.980
the later on in critical theory and we are safe.

118
00:07:56.981 --> 00:08:01.230
We are searching for totality.
We are searching for the unit,

119
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.950
young of subject and object.
Then he goes,

120
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.840
the second stage is that subject and object are divided from each other.

121
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.690
Uh,
that is the material world.
We,

122
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:25.691
south consciousness and consciousness becomes absolute consciousness because he

123
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.770
kind of projected the material word out of itself,
right?

124
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.240
And this is the,
this is the situation of alienation.

125
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.433
<v 1>Uh,</v>

126
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.100
<v 0>object becomes separate,</v>

127
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.370
<v 1>okay.</v>

128
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.230
<v 0>Then as human being some of subject and the object beginning to merge,
right?</v>

129
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.630
Consciousness emerges,
right?

130
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.480
<v 0>Uh,
consciousness,
right?
These are subject,</v>

132
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.340
this is you and the object,

133
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.240
the conditions of your life,
right?

134
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.700
And I'll dive bursts on you are interacting with is a sub object of your

135
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:12.420
interaction or the conditions of your life,
right?

136
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.130
Your objective conditions,
this room,
uh,
a year university,

137
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.660
the construction which is going out that rather these are objective conditions,

138
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.660
right?
And you are the subject who are reflecting on it,

139
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.560
but because you are gaining some consciousness,
right?

140
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.800
You are beginning to concrete the objective conditions of your life and what

141
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:38.880
he's suggesting,
right?
That alienation when overcome,

142
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.670
then your subject,

143
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.750
you'll be able to control the objective conditions of your life,
right?

144
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.140
When you're s value consciousness is Adec vet to your existence,

145
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.910
right?
When you are the master of your life,
you are a master of your conditions.

146
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.970
It is not the conditions which rule you,

147
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.240
but you are the master of the conditions,
right?

148
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.530
That is the key idea,
uh,
in,

149
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.120
in Hagar and rice is very much following this idea.

150
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.280
I mean,
he of course,
eliminates the whole idea of absolute spirit,

151
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.240
right?
He doesn't want to,
uh,

152
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.380
deal with the idea of absolute spirit.
For him.
This is too speculative.

153
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.810
He's also bothered by the idea that you can overcome the problem of alienation

154
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:34.880
simply by thought.
Right?

155
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.890
Monks project is to bring this whole idea of alienation down to earth to

156
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:43.170
everyday experience.

157
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.500
To your experience and you experience of,

158
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.770
I've would use the term modernity until 1944 marks does not have a concept of

159
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:58.950
capital is more capitalist mode of production,
right?
Uh,

160
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:03.951
he even just vaguely thinks about private ownership is really tried to

161
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.610
conceptualize modernity,
more modern,
industrial,

162
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.450
urban life as distinct from earlier,
right?

163
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:13.710
Commune or life,

164
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.490
the life what we had in more intimate communities,

165
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.160
peasants of the villages or whatever,
right?

166
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.540
It tries to conceptualize this and he sees this is a progress.

167
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:26.280
Modernity has a progress,

168
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:31.380
but we have to have pay a heavy price for it.
And the price,

169
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:36.381
what with bay for these modernity is the separation of subject and object,

170
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.273
right?

171
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.490
The Besant in a village was not separated from the objective conditions of its

172
00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:47.610
existence.
It was United with the objective conditions.

173
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.460
It was bound to the earth,
right?

174
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.280
Even the slaves were not separated from the objective conditions of that

175
00:11:56.281 --> 00:11:59.590
existence.
They were treated as objects,
right?

176
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.750
There was no subject separated from the op shop.

177
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.200
So the unique as this is Mike's,
right?
This is not Hagle anymore.

178
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.580
And I the unique feature of alienation that you have the separation from subject

179
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:17.050
and object in modern conditions,
right?

180
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.350
And I think this is why Marx,

181
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.620
theory of alienation survived.

182
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.680
Mark Steer you of exploitation that the young Marx survived the older marks,

183
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.190
the first marks survived a second marks because we can all relate more if you

184
00:12:37.001 --> 00:12:42.001
have a good lecture that and who brings more clue in more effectively to you,

185
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.020
but he's getting it.
You can relate more.
You can say much more.

186
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.310
I uh,
I feel alienated in this class,
right?

187
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.180
That makes no sense to me,
right?
Uh,

188
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.030
this doesn't make any sense to my life and I have to see that because I'm a

189
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:01.750
sociology major and I have to take this bloody class,
right?

190
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.410
Then you are early and 80.
Right?
And this is when you follow your gut.

191
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.080
That's what you have.
You'll say,
right,

192
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.340
I am Ellie and ate it because I have to deal with this nonsense,
right?

193
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.480
Because they forced me to do so then you add alienated.

194
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.760
This is exactly what Marx is getting get right Manny,
that day it is your choice,

195
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:24.580
right?
You that a sociology major,
right?

196
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.510
But then you are forced to do stuff that you don't really want to do.

197
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.230
So it doesn't mean right that you are not free.
You are free,

198
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:33.700
but we seen your freedom.

199
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:38.470
You are alienated because you don't control your conditions and it looks like

200
00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:41.770
that.
We seen your freedom,
the sin,
you were free choice.

201
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.930
You are forced to do stuff,
right?
This is what Mark's trying to get at.

202
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.880
You think you are free,

203
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.860
you think you are equal with others and you are really not free because the

204
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.910
objective conditions but you create it for yourself,
right?

205
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.860
He will caught for trouble,
right?
Uh,
who force you to be a sociology major,

206
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:07.160
lower body and then you are in the trouble that you have to do certain,

207
00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:11.800
take certain hurdles but you feel alienated and you don't feel that your whole

208
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:16.780
personality is being developed.
Right?
To put it straight to John Stuart Mill,

209
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.240
you don't feel self development,

210
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.930
then you are alienated and Uri so,
right.

211
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.730
Is that a bit coming closer to it?
Makes more sense.

212
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.403
All right,

213
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.970
now let me therefore also show you how much gets through it.

214
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.690
I think this is very important and I skipped all of this stuff.

215
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.670
Um,
uh,
and because I was trying to get very quickly,

216
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:47.290
I was trying to get to quickly to the notion Marx theory of alienation.

217
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:52.291
Now I would like to correct this and I already foreshadowed in my last lecture

218
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:58.630
that these are fundamental double years for marks and 1844,

219
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.960
80,
43 and 1844 in two years.

220
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.290
His intellectual development is quite extra ordinary.

221
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.660
And let me follow you through of these intellectual development.

222
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.260
In the summer of 1843,

223
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.330
he writes this book a critical contributions to our critique of Hegel's

224
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:24.230
philosophy or fried or Vegas philosophy of law.

225
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.140
And um,
well he

226
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.530
has,
it has gone through a long,
um,
development,
uh,

227
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.830
uh,
uh,

228
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.860
intellectually he started out as a radical and admirer of the French revolution

229
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.960
and that's,
he was getting older.

230
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:49.961
He was becoming more and more conservative and was becoming concerned about the

231
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:55.150
consequences of the French revolution.
And,

232
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.990
uh,
and as he became cooler,
you know,
more conservative.

233
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:04.820
He was he so well what is happening with the French after the French revolution

234
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.060
is not really what I wanted because now the French revolution is actually

235
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:15.400
splitting the society in two classes.
Uh,

236
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.420
right.
Uh,
capital and labor.
It's not exactly the terminology,
what he means,

237
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.070
but that's what he got is getting,

238
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:27.071
getting the philosophy of ride and who can tell who is right and who is wrong.

239
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.530
The,
our conflicts with each other.
Uh,
the,
uh,

240
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.730
the employers or the owners wants something and they're workers one,

241
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.560
sometimes something else,

242
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.720
they boss that present particularistic internist,

243
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.130
but they're easier universalistic intro.
So ask Kayla,

244
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.210
there must be some universal justice,
uh,

245
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:53.900
to put it in the terminology we use in this course before,

246
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.080
there must be something like common good,
right?

247
00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.850
Which brings capital and labor together.
There are the,

248
00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:05.600
or this common good come from.
And in the philosophy of ride,

249
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.590
he offers an interesting theory.
He said,

250
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:14.390
if you come from the government,
it's scarves from the state.

251
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.470
The state should represent the universal instance.

252
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.280
And then he said there,
you know,
the society,

253
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.670
modern bourgeois society,

254
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:30.671
which emerged as the result of the French revolution is these by I did into this

255
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:34.040
particular Isti classes,

256
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.640
but we need a universal agent,
right?

257
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.350
And Universal class,
which represents the common good.

258
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.650
And this must be the government,
right?

259
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.340
This must be the class of civil servants.
And in the book,

260
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.660
a philosophy of,
right,
which is his kind of last major book.

261
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.340
Uh,
I sit not long before he dies,

262
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:04.650
he argues these other civil servants who constitute the universal class.

263
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.470
Now,
this is not a silly idea.

264
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.060
We do think about this way.
And yes,
I mean,

265
00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:14.610
he bills in many respects,

266
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.790
in a more sophisticated way on law can show and the idea of general via,

267
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.770
particularly in Rousseau,
right?

268
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.900
And this is the state which should represent the general there,
right?

269
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.970
And we also occasionally think about this way,
right?

270
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.390
That are all these conflicts around this country.

271
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.330
And we expect the government right,
to express the universal interest,

272
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.250
right?
The innovator,
General Ville.

273
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.510
We expect occasionally the federal government to do that.

274
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.010
And the federal government,
occasionally it does.
It,
uh,

275
00:18:53.011 --> 00:18:56.970
you'll have a read about the civil rights movement.
I mean,

276
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.070
who was the agency,
right?

277
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.310
Vich made sure that the states and surely obey the laws and integrates the

278
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:11.940
schools.
It was the federal government,
right?

279
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.630
It was Bobby Kennedy who went down and made sure that the southern states don't

280
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:19.740
follow the rules,
right?

281
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.140
The expected the government right to add have expressed the universal entered

282
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:27.600
us,
right?
So it's not silly,

283
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.670
but Mark's in know they said,
well that's not that simple.

284
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.363
Uh,

285
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:39.470
he ain't got his naive about the government and he says,

286
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.291
vow,

287
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:45.291
the government is not that non partial as we would like it to be.

288
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.470
All right,
if you are rich,

289
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.210
you have more influence on what the government does,

290
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.550
that you are poor,
right?

291
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.740
There are lobbyists in Washington DC,
right.

292
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.490
And you probably have her whole leverage on these.

293
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.270
Um,
uh,
lobbyists.

294
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.300
Big Business has a lot of leverage on these lobbyist,
right?

295
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.180
And they of course have a great deal of pressure on Vat.

296
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.280
The legislature will do just follow what is happening and that the house care

297
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:33.210
legislation,
uh,

298
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.480
well you can't call your congressman and you can send emails,

299
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:42.510
you know,
and can send letters and ask them to do something,

300
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.250
but they leave me.

301
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.460
Then the pharmaceutical industry spends a lot money and they also senator,

302
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.440
you know,
unless you vote this way or that way,
right?

303
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.470
We probably may not be able to support your next a lecturer campaign right now.

304
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:03.640
I need to be,
you make more impact than are individually email,
right?

305
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.780
Either you should not send individual emails,
send it.
Right.

306
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.900
Being walled my be over there,
right?

307
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:15.430
That the government is Sam to be more responsible for a big business.

308
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:19.060
So he said,
how can it be whenever,
as a class,

309
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.160
that's really the point.
But he's making in the philosophy of,

310
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:27.100
right,
right.
Let's say it is not universal.

311
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.640
If breed tends to be universal,
it has stupid,

312
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.320
tend to be universal in order to be legitimate,
but real.

313
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.540
It is not universal and the civil servants are,

314
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.280
of course not that universal class.
Okay.
On Day are quite corrupt.

315
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.830
Right?
Mack,
you'd do United States of course,

316
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:49.690
but in some countries I can think of see my serve and south court off.
Right.

317
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.310
You know,
and then they are offered,
you know,
a three seats,
you know,

318
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:58.390
and have private jets it,
they accept it and then they accepted it.

319
00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:02.850
They do something for the owner of that private jet.
Right.
I,

320
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.030
so there are some civil servants who are not all of that in a sense.
Right.

321
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.400
And they can be influenced.
So it is not all that university of class.
They are,

322
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.780
not all CV was servers aren't angels.
Right.

323
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.080
Some of them are,
some of them are not.

324
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.430
In fact,
he concludes the Barn,

325
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.740
the finished book that really the problem is that if you don't have universal

326
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:31.330
suffrage rice,

327
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:36.331
he in 1843 and he said let's have universal suffrage and then if the in three

328
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.670
elections universally elect their representatives,

329
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.680
the problem VOB gone as we know.
He was not quite right.

330
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.500
Right.
We have old four vote.

331
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.540
But if you do not have or equal voice,
right.

332
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.900
I think that's a,
um,

333
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.100
but mice here is still a bourgeois libero as of the summer of 1843 believes the

334
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.900
problem will be solved.

335
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.290
Now let me rush through and show you the kind of intellectual development I'd

336
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.790
briefly pointed out to this.

337
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
These are the three important steps which follows a these abandoned manuscript.

338
00:23:22.611 --> 00:23:26.260
He now enters the road of radicalization,

339
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.380
right move survey from Hager and tries to carve out his own intellectual and

340
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.690
political project.

341
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.120
And he writes the paper on the Jewish profession,
um,

342
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.330
in which he says,
well,
they,
he,
he got his right.

343
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.680
We need something universal.

344
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.890
These should not allow society just to be the struggle of particularistic

345
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.030
interest,
right?
It,

346
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:57.290
this is in a way against Adam Smith's and utilitarianism.

347
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.620
It's not enough that individuals fight each other interest out and that will end

348
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:04.550
up to a universal good.

349
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.090
Or we need some universal good to be achieved.
Now need to be,

350
00:24:09.091 --> 00:24:14.091
have not simply achieved by particularistic interest followed that is,

351
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:19.060
uh,
uh,
uh,
Mark's point.
But then he writes a,

352
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.153
uh,
uh,

353
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.010
an introduction to the critique contributions to the critique of Hegel's

354
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:28.130
philosophy off right?
And then there's introduction.

355
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:32.270
He said the is something universal emancipation,

356
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.890
but Whoville bring universal emancipation to humankind.
Right?

357
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.060
He's looking for an agent who can carry this out.

358
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.920
And in the introduction he said this will be the proletariat.

359
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.860
Well you may say now he's entering their own growth.
Um,

360
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.630
and he's entering a very danger,

361
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.670
he basically painted himself in the corner of where he viewed before the rest of

362
00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:02.741
his life trying to show that indeed the proletariat will emancipate us or,

363
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:08.170
and we'll create good society or such and bad people when they are reading the

364
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:09.381
introduction.

365
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:13.460
And I will give you a few citations from it because it's a beautiful piece of

366
00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:17.600
work.
Um,
in many ways it is wonderful poetry.

367
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:21.770
He has some extra ordinary framing of the problem.

368
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:27.050
But then,
you know,
his critics said,
what a math sense.
You know,

369
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.240
why honors the proletariat as we all know,
the workers are dumb.

370
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.130
I mean are you are saying that the critical philosophers,

371
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.860
the cannot emancipate human kind,

372
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.550
but you think that these ordinary workers be alienated consciousness.

373
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.770
They the bring gas and on the Alia and I donated work.
How comes?

374
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.790
But the nonsenses this,

375
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.710
so that's when he rides a Paris manuscripts and try to now briefly the whole

376
00:25:57.711 --> 00:26:02.711
idea of alienation down to earth to feel it to the sun economic content.

377
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:10.390
That's why now he crashed do related to commodity production and make the claim

378
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.051
that door.

379
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:17.051
In modern society everybody is alienated but they are only the earth who are

380
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:22.220
fully [inaudible] and that interest is to overcome the Eliana nature.

381
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.920
That's what this is why he tries to,
I view that alienation.

382
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.430
We are bringing the working class to emancipate humankind.

383
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.000
That is the project.
Of course,

384
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.450
he'd never publishes the book because after he wrote it down he said,

385
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.380
oh I suppose he said,
well this is quite nicely written.

386
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:46.530
I have a couple of good ideas but know about the deal.

387
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:51.531
Believe me right now working class will not go on the battery case and die

388
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.770
because I am telling them that they are alienated,
right?

389
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.970
They don't care about that IA nation.
I have to come up some,

390
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.620
some better lesion,
you know,
by diverting birthing class of your rev ward.

391
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.230
And that's end of the young Marx.

392
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:12.410
And now he beginning to read Adam Smith and Ricardo and political economy,

393
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.910
right?
And he beginning to develop his theory of exploitation.

394
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.210
This is the young or mature marks and Vivi or talk about him very briefly now,

395
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:28.000
just a couple of ideas here.
All right.
Uh,

396
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:31.560
what about uh,
the own,
the Jewish question?
What is at stake?

397
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.230
I brought on Bauer,

398
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.710
wrote a paper on the origins of antisemitism and he said,

399
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.740
we have antisemitism in Germany.
Uh,

400
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.620
because the state is Christian and as long as the city is Christian,

401
00:27:45.621 --> 00:27:50.621
if you discriminate against the Jews to the solution is to separate the state

402
00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:54.870
and the church to have political emancipation,
right?

403
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:59.760
And if we have political emancipation,
the abolish antisemitism.

404
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.170
Now Mark's stakes is born here.
And he said,
look,

405
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.180
this guy is completely wrong.
Look at the United States.

406
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.980
The church and the state are separated.
And the 19th century,

407
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.520
there was quite a bit of antisemitism in the United States,

408
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.460
not only in the 19th century,

409
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:26.150
in this very institution in the 1920s and thirties,

410
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.290
there was a lot of anti Semitism cause I'd wonder if we'll,
uh,
sociologists,

411
00:28:31.291 --> 00:28:36.291
Jeremy Karabal wrote a great book about the admission policies of Ivy League

412
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:39.990
universities and the 1920s,

413
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.340
and he was able to prove that in the Ivy League universities,

414
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.060
including Yale,
actually applied their quota.

415
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.020
They never edited more Jews to Yale,

416
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.620
then the every Jewish population in the United States.

417
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.340
Believe it or not,
it was never official policy,

418
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.960
but it was practice all the time.
Um,
so I mean,

419
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:05.280
there was antisemitism.

420
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:10.281
Antisemitism can exist if the state and church are separated.

421
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:14.820
If the state is supposed to be secular.
And Mark said,

422
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.470
there does come like racism.
Uh,

423
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:24.120
come from you said it comes from what he said,

424
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.410
civil society.
He doesn't have the notion of capitalism.

425
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.510
He said,
this is rooted in people's everyday experience and interest,

426
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:34.960
right?

427
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.960
Antisemitism comes from civil society because some people feel threatened by the

428
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.160
Jews.
Why is that?
You know,

429
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:50.180
Auntie African American feelings because some people feel threatened by

430
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:53.110
everything.
I'm Americans.
Right?

431
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.700
And this is why that dad is racism.

432
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.820
So you have to fix the problems in civil society.

433
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.780
The problem is in civil society,
not in the state.

434
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.700
Therefore what you need is universal emancipation.

435
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.440
That's the bottom line on the Jewish Russian.

436
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.570
Is that reasonably clear?
Okay.

437
00:30:18.571 --> 00:30:22.690
That last go for it further.
And this is the introduction,

438
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.900
uh,
well,
uh,

439
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.920
that are some wonderful stuff in this,
uh,

440
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.960
it's more poor three then it,
it is certainly not social science.

441
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.730
I would say more poetry,
but very forcefully don bell.

442
00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:43.320
He said,
uh,
uh,

443
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.120
what we have to do is to move beyond Feuerbach Oh,

444
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.160
who simply sort of contemplated on the situations and he said once the holy form

445
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:59.150
of human south estrangement has been unmasked,

446
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.650
that's what Feuerbach did,
right?
He did show that Addie,
yeah,

447
00:31:04.651 --> 00:31:09.651
nation is our leave projecting out alienation by creating God ride.

448
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.233
He said,

449
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.620
now the task is too on the mosque,

450
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:22.490
self estrangement or alienation and it's on the holy form,

451
00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:26.570
right?
In a,
in the everyday life,
in your everyday experience,

452
00:31:26.571 --> 00:31:31.210
especially in you would economic activities.
That is the point,

453
00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:35.470
what he tries to make.
Then he goes further and he says,

454
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:40.510
well,
the young key galleon shad be critical.
Critique,

455
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:44.020
criticize,
or he galleon teary and I seen,

456
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:48.820
this is a fantastic sentence,
I guess.
Beautiful poetry,

457
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.230
uh,

458
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.730
very dangerous and let a lot of trouble in history in a way.

459
00:31:54.731 --> 00:31:56.920
I wish he would not have written it down,

460
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:02.160
but I love that he did write it down because it's a beautiful sentence.

461
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:07.890
The veteran of criticism cannot replace the criticism by veteran right now.

462
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.170
It's not enough to be critical in thought.

463
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.320
You have to be critical in action,
right?

464
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.730
You have to act on it just below.
Just stock.

465
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:27.040
Do something about it.
That's what it says.
Well,
I think this is,
you know,

466
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.930
one of the strongest sentences I have read in social science literature,

467
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.800
right?

468
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.180
The veteran of criticism cannot replace the criticism by veteran.

469
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.420
Now this is also a great sentence.

470
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Do you becomes a material force as soon as it has grasped the massive grip to

471
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:50.510
the masses.

472
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.890
Dod Is Capable of gripping the masses.

473
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.930
As soon as he demonstrates ad Hominem.

474
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.390
Whoa.
That's why something,
uh,

475
00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.830
about he arrived.
He said,
well,

476
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:11.640
the question is what is a good theory?
Watch real.
How are you,
you,

477
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.720
you emancipate yourself.
Good.

478
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:19.610
The essence of good theory that it grabs you at grips.
You right?

479
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.830
When you say,
Aha,
it did it me,
this is theory,
right?

480
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.590
But it can only be,

481
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.390
then it is ad Hominem when it is addresses your problems,

482
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.600
right?
Acuity what you are lost.

483
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:39.110
You don't know why it is relevant for you.
Life is no good.

484
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.640
I would even go as far the Curie,

485
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.410
which is boring is bad theory,

486
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:50.360
but you need is fascinating theory.
You have to be fascinated.

487
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.370
You have to be fraud,
right?
You have to be say,
yes,

488
00:33:55.670 --> 00:34:00.410
no,
I will live differently after I the I this theory,
I understood,

489
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.190
right?
It has to move you.
That's the good theory.

490
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.530
I think that's a,
that's a wonderful point,
right?
And very powerful.
The down.

491
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.700
And then he said,
well,
Martin Fowler,

492
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:18.290
and he see that the theory has to grab the mask is not what kind of Mashes,

493
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.270
who is our audience?
Well,
and he says,

494
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.770
be in order to carry out a revolutionary change,

495
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.370
it's not enough to have a theory,
not enough to have ideas.
Uh,

496
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:33.470
you mean need?

497
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.680
He said that's a very problematic but very crucial to understand the downside,

498
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.500
the side of Marxism,

499
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.740
passive ally man's right and material base,
right.

500
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:52.110
As you see,
no matter how much,
uh,
Mark's,
uh,
uh,

501
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.350
glorifies the Verking class or thinks about them as a passive ELA math,

502
00:34:57.351 --> 00:35:00.470
right.
A simply as a material days.

503
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.330
And that is who is that?
The proletariat and why?

504
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.440
Because it has muffing clues,
but he changed.

505
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:14.470
It has a universal character and this is why it is the universe,

506
00:35:14.471 --> 00:35:19.460
our class,
uh,
and you know,
and 1843,

507
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:20.880
it may have been quite cracked.

508
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.810
They're working class poverty has little else to lose,

509
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:29.050
but he changed certainly in 2009 is usually not true.

510
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.400
The Virgin class has much more to lose any change.
Right.

511
00:35:34.401 --> 00:35:37.210
It has probably its own nice suburban.

512
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.500
They probably own two cars.

513
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:45.740
They probably even have some Benjamin fung ride on the stock exchange even or

514
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:50.910
definitive workers checkout what the Dow Jones did yesterday because it affects

515
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.810
that impact.
But in his times it was probably true.

516
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:58.830
So this is how he gets to the problem.
It is the proletariat.

517
00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.320
Every trivial would be the universal class.

518
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.060
And now you are already familiar with the Paris manuscript and ivy are not

519
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:06.894
talking about this.

520
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:12.020
That's why he wants to show that the proletariat is the most alienated and that

521
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.640
makes follows logically,

522
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:19.641
I think it damages to some extent the theory of alienation because it narrows it

523
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:21.600
too much down.

524
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.780
The focus is too much down on diverting class and innovate too much down on

525
00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:28.320
working class,

526
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:32.370
working on industrial production in firms.

527
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.390
But really the message of alienation is much broader.

528
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.720
It Christ to Conaway you some general experience of modern life there.

529
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:45.600
The,
the do not feel at home.

530
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:51.110
This is the big framing of the problem.
Um,
and uh,

531
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.640
uh,
uh,

532
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.640
the Early 20th Century homelessness,

533
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.950
the homeless mind,
right?

534
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.950
That these feel homeless in this world searching for a home.

535
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.840
That's the sense of alienation.

536
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.680
That's what March tried to capture it here in a very own.
Fortunately,

537
00:37:10.681 --> 00:37:14.100
ms specified,
too much emphasis on,
very curious,

538
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.630
just because he beginning to have this political project and wants to find that

539
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.620
evolutionary class.
Uh,
and you know,
he abandons it.

540
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:24.030
This is ridiculous.
You know,

541
00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:29.031
we ha I have to put my show together and then he does a,

542
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.250
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

543
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.320
beginning to develop what he calls historic on that.
Cheerier.
I,

544
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.870
so let's get into that one and uh,

545
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:45.950
uh,
I have 10 minutes to do it.
Uh,
uh,

546
00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:50.610
that's all right.
Uh,
if NASA,
Sheree Ivo come back to this,

547
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.850
so Mars is developing a,
he calls historical material is man,

548
00:37:55.851 --> 00:38:00.610
the ivy will suggest it does make it,
it is done in two steps.

549
00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.110
First a,

550
00:38:02.111 --> 00:38:06.340
he's emphasizing dialectics in his criticism of fire.

551
00:38:06.341 --> 00:38:09.760
Bang for your buck is a materialist store ride,

552
00:38:09.761 --> 00:38:14.761
but he's a mechanic on materialist and Mark's wants to being dynamics,

553
00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.880
uh,
in the,
uh,
his,
uh,
materialism.

554
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.910
And he will argue that this has to be at,
yeah,
historical.

555
00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:27.190
He specified material force and this is what he will do.
Um,

556
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:31.590
in the,
uh,
the uh,
uh,
German ideology.

557
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.990
Um,
but what is dialectical,

558
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.510
I don't want to waste time on this.

559
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:42.350
I want to get straight into the thesis on Feuerbach,

560
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.290
which is a very short text but very GD.
Um,
uh,

561
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:52.540
so here are the 11 thesis of Feuerbach on Dcis on fire,

562
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:57.370
but he tries to carve out what his new,
um,
uh,

563
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.070
approach VOB.
Uh,

564
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.910
and these are the 11th thesis,
very sharp.
He said,

565
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.040
choir box material is my boss.

566
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:11.041
Simply reflective if actually manned subject and object remained separated and

567
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:17.431
the subject reflected on the object outside of the subject dominating the

568
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:19.060
actions of the subject.

569
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:24.190
But it is assume that there are objective conditions irrespective from the

570
00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:28.450
subject.
And you only left left on the subjective conditions.

571
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.350
And he said they're all in the new material.

572
00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:35.990
Is throughs is a practical question.
And I,

573
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.540
you're talking about this in a minute.

574
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.790
It means you have good breathe by human practice subject and object together.

575
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.770
You have to change your objective conditions of your life.
That's,
you know,

576
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.570
not a passive agent.

577
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:54.520
Not over Deta ammunition marks is overs red as a determinist.

578
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:59.770
No.
As I will say,
Mark's philosophy is a philosophy of praxis.

579
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:05.250
Praxis practical activity is the key of Marx theory men.

580
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:10.960
And then change his circumstances.
And how if you'll elaborate on this,

581
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:15.580
but you know,
we get shit.
You know,
we were born in certain conditions,

582
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.850
but we can change it right then.
Uh,

583
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.510
but in order to change the reality,
we have to become effective alone.

584
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.260
We have to cooperate.

585
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.110
There's seasons for he said that he was,

586
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.960
he thought that it can be done in thinking no.
Uh,
uh,

587
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:40.180
foyer backdoor to become Donny in contemplation.
Mark said no,

588
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:44.530
it can be only done by social practices.
Uh,
five,

589
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:49.390
six now or an attorney.
All his mum was looking at the individual.

590
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.600
Right now I will look at the collective social relations,

591
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:59.440
relational,
but I'm suggesting is relation.
Now they all,

592
00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:02.710
religion is also a social product.
This is a kind of,
by the way,

593
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.630
social life is practical follows from what we have said.
Um,

594
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:08.830
uh,

595
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.630
how contemplation implies isolated individuals in society.

596
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.270
Um,
uh,
well the offer,
uh,

597
00:41:17.271 --> 00:41:19.840
a view of socialized humanity,

598
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:24.430
that's the all act together and this collective action,
which means change.

599
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.760
And then the most controversial and most important one so far,

600
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:32.900
the philosophers and interpreted the,

601
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.520
now the point is to change it,
right?

602
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.120
Good theory is not just describes,

603
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.690
it gives you up to ascription what to do about your life.

604
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:49.550
That's the kind of theory what we want.
That's the thesis on fire Buck.

605
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.380
Just 11 sentences,
basic raid sentences,

606
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:58.020
salt of old materialism is,
uh,
uh,

607
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.780
reflective,
right?

608
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:05.290
The chief defect are Feuerbach is the dinks and he saw the German term is Gagan

609
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.620
[inaudible],
um,
uh,
ish reality.

610
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:18.290
Sensuousness feeling through our senses,

611
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.153
right,

612
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.290
is to go and see it only in the form of the object that he sends to the object

613
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.020
outside of our contemplation.

614
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.200
But censures asked is not perceived as human action activity.

615
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.020
Right?
We simply feel the staff,

616
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:41.021
what we don't do anything about that he says sensors activity is what I

617
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:46.050
emphasize.
There are new materialism.
This is,
you know,

618
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.850
one of the most important sentences.
Mark's throwed them.

619
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.230
Um,

620
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:57.020
there are the question that the objective choose can be attributed to human

621
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.830
thinking is not a question of theory,

622
00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.900
but it is a practical question.
Mom mess must prove,

623
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.140
choose the,

624
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.870
this worldliness of his thinking in practice,

625
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.883
right?

626
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.690
It's not a speculative thing whether aggression if throughs.

627
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.820
Um,
the best of the pudding is in the eating.

628
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.080
He says as their,
um,
uh,

629
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:32.770
Italian Marxist philosopher on Donio grab sheet who died in the prison of

630
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:38.140
Mussolini called Marxism,

631
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.420
the philosophy of praxis.

632
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.850
That's the essence of Marxism.

633
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:49.300
That the trolls is not the subject reflecting on the object,

634
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:55.690
but the interaction of the subject between the object right there,

635
00:43:55.921 --> 00:44:00.921
the subject changes the object in order to meet the need of the subject.

636
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.070
That's the major point.
The separation of subject and object.

637
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:12.110
The assumption that there are objective conditions which are outside of our

638
00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:17.111
pastoral action is what later Marxists would call positive is,

639
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.080
ma'am,
Marxism is not positivist.

640
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:26.330
It believes that we can change the world that then just to accept of Erd.

641
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.110
Right.
Well,
I don't have to talk about,

642
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:34.260
don't have enough time to talk about the ground.
She just one word.
In fact,

643
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:38.970
he called Marxism as a philosophy of practice because he was writing his major

644
00:44:38.971 --> 00:44:43.971
version in the prison of Mussolini and was smuggling this book out there called

645
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:48.550
the prison old books.
Um,
uh,

646
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:52.350
it was smuggled out before he died and he knew that,
you know,

647
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:57.080
the prison guards will read it,
so he did not want to ride down the term Marxism.

648
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.420
And then he met Mark Cisma.
He wrote it,

649
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.400
the philosophy of praxis.
And of course the stupid fascist,

650
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.620
uh,
uh,

651
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:12.360
guards did not know what honors philosophy of Praxis is.

652
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.290
So it did,
they did not know his writing get about Marxism.

653
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.740
But I think he got a very important point.

654
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.250
This is indeed an important feature of Marxism.

655
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:27.670
There a man changes circumstances.
Now,

656
00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:32.340
circumstances can change by man.
And this is again,
a name potent Sam.

657
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.450
Then dance,
the educator must himself be educated.

658
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.710
And those are few in my discussion section yesterday,
this is what you did.

659
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.180
You educated the educator.
I realized I did not get,
you know,

660
00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:48.240
the theory of area Neisha through quite effectively.

661
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:51.570
So I went back and collected my course,
right?

662
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:55.080
The educators must be educated,
right?

663
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.730
I think that's a great sentence now and run these through.

664
00:45:59.731 --> 00:46:01.650
Discover the role of the masses.

665
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.880
Now that's very much march political project coming in,

666
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:10.800
but any important project,
right?
That's you cannot do by yourself,
right?

667
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.480
If you want to achieve something,
you have to cooperate.
You know,
you,

668
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.890
you need cooperation with orders,
right?
Um,

669
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.030
otherwise nothing can be achieved.
Um,
well,

670
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:28.410
uh,
he goes starting point was abstract thinking,

671
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.400
foyer blah.
He's a materialist.
He thinks,

672
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.430
but he's real is what we can grasp.
Vitaros census.

673
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:41.460
Maurice said,
no,
this is census.
Practical activity.

674
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.900
It has to be sensors,
but it has to be practical.
This is something,

675
00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:50.010
but you're going Habermas laughter.
The German philosopher,

676
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.280
he said this is Jerry or marks who sees the essence of all tenses,

677
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.740
EC,
human activity being the court.

678
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:03.120
Later marks is that reduction is because he reduces sensors.

679
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.340
Activity to economic activity.

680
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.240
Here in Mark's perceives all sensors.

681
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:12.900
FDT including human interaction between us,

682
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:17.670
including sexual interaction among us as a,

683
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.210
as activity,
right?
As the material reality.

684
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:26.360
That is not so much a conflict between marsh and fried as it appears.

685
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:28.830
Now let me go for it

686
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:36.130
as six.
All material is more looks at the individual,
right?

687
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:39.070
And this is Mark's big,
uh,
our obsession.

688
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:42.750
The problem with modernity is the isolated Bush.

689
00:47:42.751 --> 00:47:47.751
Why individual and we have to overcome these isolated individual and we have to

690
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:51.670
engage each other in human interaction.

691
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:56.020
He is a communitarian,
right?
He is a communist,
right?

692
00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.440
He does not want to have isolated individuals,
right?
They,

693
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.700
he wants a human interaction.
Uh,
well I,

694
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.730
I skipped this one.
Religious is also a still shot.
Productor um,
uh,

695
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.160
social life is practical.
This is again,

696
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:16.210
quite obvious and I can probably skip this one.

697
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.860
And here again,
you know,
the isolated individual,
that's the problem that you,

698
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.880
you do not see that really what we can achieve is all of us interacting with

699
00:48:27.161 --> 00:48:29.950
each other and building on each other.
Um,

700
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:34.960
a single individual or you're not change anything.
Uh,
well,

701
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:37.960
and therefore we stand for socialized humanity.

702
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:43.530
The standpoint of old materialism is civil society and the isolated Bush.

703
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:50.131
Why individual in civil society and the afternoon get about a human society,

704
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:55.350
right there we are brothers and sisters,
right?
Then we have solidarity,

705
00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:00.420
right where we act in concert and in solidarity and now comes a,

706
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.770
um,
uh,
the most controversial thesis.
Uh,
uh,

707
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.510
but I,
um,
hage and what I love,

708
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:12.400
uh,
love because again,

709
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:17.350
I think it is Var wonderfully done here because it's desperately wrong,

710
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.273
right?

711
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.720
Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.

712
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.290
The point is to change it in some ways,
right?

713
00:49:26.291 --> 00:49:29.310
This is follows from the earlier ideas.
Uh,

714
00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:33.760
namely Baxis a cruise is a practical question.

715
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.050
A philosophy only makes sense if it changes your life.

716
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.680
If you just read the philosophy text or the theoretical text,

717
00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:44.650
uh,

718
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:49.650
four foundations of modern social thought to make sure that we uveal fall

719
00:49:49.961 --> 00:49:50.794
asleep,

720
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.990
then the text is something wrong than I did something wrong,
right?

721
00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.210
Uh,
if you,

722
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.930
if the texts are right and if my lectures are right,

723
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:05.190
if you start reading the thesis on Feuerbach,

724
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.500
you cannot fall asleep,
right?

725
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:13.590
You may have to take a sleeping pill to quiet down and to sleep because the idea

726
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:19.591
of disturbed you because you'll feel now you have to change the world rather

727
00:50:19.901 --> 00:50:22.330
than to accept it.
I don't know.
Thank you.
