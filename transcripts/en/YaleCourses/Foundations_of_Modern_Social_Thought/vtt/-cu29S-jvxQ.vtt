1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.680
So good morning,
uh,
valid today.

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.640
We have a fun topic,
suicide.
Um,

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.030
actually I didn't realize how much interest that is amongst students in suicide.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.550
Um,

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.550
once we invited a professor from Australia who wanted to teach a course on desks

6
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.280
and suicide,

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.210
and I was very concerned that those students who will take it and the class was

8
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:33.084
full.

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.840
So it looks like suicide is a popular topic and I think I know why because when

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.260
I was your age or occasionally took her through my mind,

11
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.300
what if I commit suicide?
All right.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.050
So I think thinking about suicide is probably something what crossed many of

13
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:58.680
yours.
Mine.
Uh,
and therefore hopefully,

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.050
uh,
there can be,

15
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:06.051
will be exciting for you and we'll help you to understand why did you consider

16
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.850
it and why did you did not do it right?
Or Via your,

17
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.620
um,
friends or acquaintances thought about it.

18
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
Some of them may have tried,
some of them may have killed themselves.

19
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.960
Anyway,
so this is about suicide.
And as I said already before,

20
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.780
um,
um,
this is a path to baking book.
Uh,

21
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.780
in many ways,
uh,

22
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:39.781
it's really the first rigorous empirical study and offer social phenomenon.

23
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.800
And they're very curious social phenomenon.

24
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.490
And we were talking about this as the lectured on faults because we tend to

25
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.230
think about suicide.
There's something very personal,
right?

26
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.630
An individual and or right,

27
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.920
if a psychologist is interested in suicide is understandable,

28
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.470
but why on earth as sociologists would be interested in suicide?

29
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.060
It is so rare socially,
fortunately,

30
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.590
uh,

31
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.590
I mean in some societies but in most very rare and it looks like it's so much a

32
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:25.320
question of individual decision.
So why should um,

33
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.310
a social scientist try to explain it?

34
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.030
So there are times sets for himself a very difficult task and he does it.

35
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.700
Formidably ivy,

36
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:42.701
we'll show you that he does some spectacular methodological innovations.

37
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.370
Um,
he's kind of offers metal dialogical insights.

38
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.100
What social scientists start excited about even today.
Uh,

39
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.370
uh,
well over a century after he this book.

40
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.440
Okay.
So that's about Swedish side.
And first of all,

41
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.090
I've your ask a few general questions.
Um,
uh,

42
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.100
and the first off all the question is what is suicide?

43
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.120
Then when do v I decide at the death is suicide.

44
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.680
And then also I would like to pose the question,
uh,
what are,

45
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.080
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,

46
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.450
what are the reasons for social scientists to study it?
And deer came,

47
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.580
give some very good reasons.
And finally I've,

48
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.740
you'll introduce Durkheim's die Balaji of suicide,

49
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:42.760
the many dirty cams scholars versus struggling with this,

50
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.810
how to make sense of this.
Stype Ologie and I've,

51
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:52.810
you're sure you have on,
um,
uh,
very hard to do it sort of that are,

52
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.250
uh,
he has major,
uh,
uh,
types.
Uh,

53
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.330
our ego is the altruistic Annemieke and fatalistic suicide and live you,

54
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:06.730
we'll talk about each of them in Kern.

55
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.290
Okay.
So let me start with the definition.

56
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.190
And this is tricky by the way.
Uh,

57
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:18.730
also extremely tricky.
Um,
uh,

58
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.830
when it comes to statistics to figure it out,
uh,

59
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.850
what statistics do rapport as suicide,

60
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.140
uh,
um,
people die.
Um,

61
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.320
especially if they do not leave a letter behind.

62
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.890
It's very hard to decide whether that person actually committed suicide or it

63
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.640
was just an accident.
Well,

64
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.600
that are occasions when this is quite obvious.

65
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.950
And I had somebody hanging himself or herself,

66
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.970
uh,

67
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.590
which is a fever that they have of committing suicide of certain type of people

68
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.310
in certain instances.
Right?
And the VA,

69
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:08.311
how somebody hanged himself makes it quite clear that it was a suicide.

70
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:13.411
But doctors investigating the cause of death very often are puzzled.

71
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.940
A veteran,
this is suicide or not.

72
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.650
So you clearly have an overdose of sleeping pills.

73
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.580
It's unclear whether it was an accident accidentally.
Um,

74
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.830
you took more blip bills then you should have or whether this was actually a

75
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:34.420
suicide.
Uh,
so that is,
um,

76
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.630
a lot of problem in studying statistical data about suicide.

77
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.450
Um,
uh,
and the very often,
um,

78
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.460
doctors do make judgments,
uh,
um,

79
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.090
on the social circumstances of the person who committed suicide,

80
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.630
right?
Uh,

81
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.650
they read Durkheim or they have read some social scientists.

82
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.370
They tell these are the kinds of people under the circumstances who,

83
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.860
who commit suicide.
So they go to the scene,

84
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.950
they look at that person,

85
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.770
look at the circumstances.

86
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.160
This is an old man who's wife just passed away very recently.

87
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.270
So that must be of course,
suicide.
All right.
So therefore,

88
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.720
what is suicide is being defined by the circumstances rather than actually,

89
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.880
uh,
by,
uh,
the,
uh,
medical reasons.
Okay.

90
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:38.480
So let's try to struggle a little bit this,

91
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:43.481
what is suicide under what circumstances can be talking about suicide.

92
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.020
And here is,
uh,
um,
uh,
Durkheim's definition.

93
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.240
The term suicide,

94
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.270
right is applied to all cases of deaths resulting directly or indirectly he

95
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.190
positive or a negative act of the victim himself,

96
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.630
which he knows we are produced.
These results,
well,

97
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.470
uh,
looks like a very complicated definition,

98
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.430
but a very full and they're very good volume.
Uh,

99
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.440
and the first point is intention,
right?
Uh,

100
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.670
that in order to call at the s three side,
uh,

101
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.560
there must be intention,
uh,

102
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.770
on behalf of the person who commits suicide.

103
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.930
Well,
there's intention can be very,
uh,
um,

104
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.430
uh,
uh,
well,
uh,

105
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.400
the AME might not be necessarily Saturday structure,
uh,

106
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.410
and the AME may be something else.
Uh,
for instance,
uh,

107
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.120
or you can't think about suicide bombers,
right?
Uh,

108
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.850
they don't want to kill themselves.
They want to kill others,

109
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.990
but they use their body as a vapor,
right?

110
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.880
And they explode themselves in order to cause harm to others.

111
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.080
Right?

112
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.080
But that's clearly a case of suicide because they know that they will die as a

113
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:20.810
consequence of that action.

114
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.720
And therefore it can be called suicide.
Do it,
uh,

115
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.580
uh,
is not aimed at the person himself.
Now,

116
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.513
uh,

117
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.250
the how the act of suicide can be in director,
um,

118
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.960
uh,
uh,
and in fact in can be,
can be negative.

119
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.310
Um,

120
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.310
sort of you more suicide is a direct and positive action,

121
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.240
right?
Uh,
you jump from the 40th floor,
right?

122
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.440
And then,
uh,
uh,
uh,
you,
you kill yourself.

123
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:03.420
You'll take sleeping pills and overdosed and you kill yourself,
uh,

124
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.770
about it can be injured,
act and negative.
I mean,

125
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:11.640
you can starve yourself to death.
Um,
uh,

126
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.700
and that can be crawled suicide as long as your intention is to kill yourself.

127
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.710
All right?
Um,
so it becomes very tricky.
Uh,

128
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.150
uh,

129
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.150
what do you do with people who are abusing drugs or alcohol?

130
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.590
Right?
Uh,

131
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.950
they may actually die as a result of excessive alcohol or drug drug consumption.

132
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.070
Uh,
if it is not intentional,
uh,

133
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.180
they don't want to kill themselves.
They just lied,
boozy,
right?

134
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.830
They just like cocaine,
right?
Um,
uh,
uh,

135
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.240
uh,
Dan,
it is not switch side.
Uh,

136
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.240
there are lots of Russians who have been dying.
Um,

137
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.150
and the last 35 years,
their numbers,
especially,

138
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.210
um,
middle aged Russia,

139
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.260
men were dying like flies because they are drinking too much vodka in the

140
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:22.410
overwhelming majority of the cases does not suicide,
right?

141
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.530
They are depressed.
They are silly.

142
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:30.531
They think drinking vodka will have the depression and those results,

143
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.220
they will get liver cancer and they will die,
right?

144
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.210
So it was not suicide.
Uh,
well,

145
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.910
if you lock yourself into your room,

146
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:46.911
you take sleeping pills and you drink a bottle of vodka in order to kill

147
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:50.420
yourself,
then it was suicide,
right?

148
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.520
So anyway,
uh,

149
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.040
you have to know the consequences of your action.

150
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.310
You have to know that's what you do there.

151
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.330
Kill yourself in order for your act to qualify as a suicide.

152
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.700
So I think this is really beautiful,
beautiful.
U Dub,
um,
and,
uh,

153
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.630
uh,
has been extremely influential,
uh,
for,
uh,

154
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.690
uh,
uh,
social scientists.
As I said,
it makes,
um,

155
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:22.900
um,
um,

156
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.970
very big challenge to medical investigators who try to determine the cause of

157
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:33.120
deaths.
Um,
uh,
because,
uh,

158
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.080
it's very difficult to establish the intention,
right?

159
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.250
Uh,
uh,
and the most of the cases of suicide,

160
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.500
you cannot be absolutely sure of the intention.
You don't know that,

161
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:51.501
that this was an accident or whether it was intentional unless the victim of the

162
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.610
suicide Aveo tell you,
uh,

163
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.790
leave selector behind Dallas that I committed suicide.

164
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.520
Okay.
Uh,
now,
uh,
as I said,

165
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:11.521
it looks life that suicide is very much a very personal action.

166
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.420
All right?
Uh,
uh,
uh,

167
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.493
well,

168
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.220
occasionally people talk about that intention to commit suicide when and if they

169
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:29.270
do so they probably feel not do it right.
Uh,

170
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.620
those who are serious about suicide keep it to themselves and them kill

171
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:37.980
themselves.
Those who talk about B,

172
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.520
I am suicidal very often simply want to have attention.

173
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.490
Right?
Um,

174
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.870
and then even if they attempt suicide,
you know,

175
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.030
it's off often it's kind of fake,
you know,
uh,

176
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.850
the smart enough,
they just take a little overdose of sleeping pill,

177
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:02.230
but not too much.
And because they already told they are suicidal,
right?

178
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.150
Their friend rushed to the hospital and they've,
you'll be all right.
All right.

179
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.290
So anyway,
uh,
um,
uh,
uh,

180
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.330
it's a very individual act.

181
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.360
You usually keep your intention to commit suicide to yourself rather than

182
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:23.580
discussing with somebody else.
And it looks like,
you know,
taking your life away,

183
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.820
um,
uh,
is really,
um,
you were on,
on business.
Um,

184
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.750
so the question is why owners,

185
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.520
people who study society should be interested in these very individual,

186
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.320
very private act and well,
he said,

187
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.950
look,
uh,
look at for instance,
the suicide rate,

188
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.960
how it varies across countries.

189
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.740
And he said that it's tremendous difference in suicide rate across countries

190
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.590
that are countries which really low and the other countries with very,
very high.

191
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:02.050
So we decided relatively speaking,
I mean,

192
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:07.290
so his side is a no over the top ranking cause of deaths law in some countries,

193
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:09.700
you know,

194
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.700
and in certain age groups it can easily enter the top five causes of deaths.

195
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.400
And on top of this,

196
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.820
those countries where people commit suicide tend to be countries where people

197
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.760
committed suicide for a long climb.
It's a very stable indicator.

198
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:36.210
A Scandinavian countries are wants where usually the suicide rate is reasonably

199
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:37.114
high.

200
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.540
My native Hungary is a country which for a very long time bus proud of being

201
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.700
number vom in committing suicide.
All right.

202
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.170
Uh,
uh,

203
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.130
well incidentally this is not in very time.

204
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:59.700
What if I may add to this that were people who were of course you know,

205
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.410
during can inspire it and still in Spanish,

206
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:05.990
a lot of research on suicide.

207
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.730
He has been challenged on many questions but he still,
you know,

208
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.731
after 110 years the agenda Satcher on suicide research.

209
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.150
If any runoff you become a biologist or sociologist the doctor and want to

210
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:26.090
conduct research on suicide,

211
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.600
you have to cite their client,
right?

212
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.870
You have to start from there kind if you are studying at this.
But anyway,
um,

213
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.020
there were people would have inspired by him and looked further insight

214
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:39.854
countries.

215
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.850
And what is interesting that we in countries there are actually gigantic

216
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:49.190
differences between regions.

217
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.660
There are some regions in this countries with very high and some regions,

218
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:58.661
some of these countries with relatively loose suicide rates and these are pretty

219
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:03.290
constant as such.
Uh,
well I had a colleague,

220
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.790
as I said,
you know,

221
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:09.791
it's Blah or not too parochial for me to refer to Hungary because now hunger is

222
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:14.540
I think only a number two or three in the world in suicide rate,

223
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.980
but has been number one for a century.
So anyway,

224
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:23.240
I had a colleague who did that and detailed studying in Hungary about,

225
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:28.241
so he's side inspired by Durkheim and found that there were certain regions in

226
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.340
the country where the suicide re were particularly high as valley.

227
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:40.510
It was low and he actually could identify,
uh,

228
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.520
the type of people who committed suicide and the way how they committed suicide

229
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:46.640
for instance.

230
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.640
And that has been stable for a century as far as it was possible to go back in

231
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:55.670
statistics,
just to give you an example,

232
00:16:55.671 --> 00:17:00.671
and it feel also help us when we are looking at the deer camp apology of

233
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:06.260
suicide.
For instance,
he found that,
uh,
you know,

234
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.300
male farmers,
um,

235
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.900
all the male farmers are living in detached forms.

236
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:16.340
Uh,

237
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.340
when their wife pastors of a unexpectedly women are expected to live longer.

238
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.680
That man,
right?
Uh,

239
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.440
when their wife passes away unexpectedly the typical way,

240
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.850
but men doors,
they hang themselves in the attic.

241
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.720
And this happens again and again.
The tosh farms,

242
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.970
all the man live died.
People grew up and hang themselves,

243
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.590
right?
Uh,

244
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.550
suicide to put in another way is a way of dying,

245
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.863
right?

246
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.870
That are some circumstances in which in certain societies,

247
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.440
uh,
you know,
that this is the unsure to your problem.

248
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.790
That's who commits suicide,
right?
I had the few are men,
you know,

249
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.730
we are usually pretty dumb.
We don't know how to cook.

250
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:12.120
We don't know how to take care of ourselves.
You know,
you are old,

251
00:18:12.121 --> 00:18:16.140
you are vived died.
So what do you know you'll call miss soy side,
right?

252
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.820
Under certain circumstances,
right?
Anyway,
I think this is a,
uh,

253
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:22.880
this is why it makes it interesting,
right?

254
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.850
For social scientists that there are interesting social patterns,

255
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.090
cultural patterns,
how people commit suicide.
And you know,
uh,

256
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.750
uh,
during can build very calm this as much.

257
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.400
And then he said that are in fact large,

258
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:43.401
big historical events which do have an impact on suicide rates.

259
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.800
You would think there is a big social Kerman oil,
then suicide rates will go up.

260
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:50.963
You are wrong.

261
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.780
If that is a big social suicide rate tends to be going down because that is

262
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.940
damson revolution.
People don't commit suicide.
Anyway,

263
00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:06.930
his point is that suicide is a collective phenomenon,
right?

264
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.340
Somehow it is social and the debtor mine as Fmr.
Memnon,

265
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:12.451
okay.

266
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:17.451
Now this is the type Ology of suicide and I have been struggling with this and

267
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:20.540
um,
uh,
uh,

268
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.380
people who know much more about Durkheim have been struggling with this type

269
00:19:24.381 --> 00:19:28.400
Balaji.
Um,
and uh,

270
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.923
uh,

271
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.350
what of course I was trying to do as others who are trying to do to do a two by

272
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:36.060
two table,
right?

273
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.570
And to put these types of suicide in this two by two table there Kime in writing

274
00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:47.570
about suicide seemed to make a distinction between um,

275
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.930
uh,
the question of integration and regulation,
right?

276
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.820
Integration means you know,

277
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:58.821
how tight the organized a group or society is in which you live.

278
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.550
All right?
And that as a,
I already pointed out,

279
00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:08.800
you know,
in the earlier lecture right there,

280
00:20:08.801 --> 00:20:12.530
it kind of has these idea of normal versus logic.

281
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.370
And I've,
you're talking about this in more detail.
Um,

282
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.870
when the last lecture on,
on their crimes,
uh,

283
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.770
uh,
uh,
methodology,
uh,

284
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.200
he has this interesting idea.

285
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.600
That's what is normal is to kind of tippy car.
I had to put it very crudely.

286
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:38.040
Normally it's the kind of the average if it is too much or too little,

287
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.600
this is pedological or have more and more.
That is the idea.

288
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.540
So therefore one dimension in which what,
uh,
he,

289
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.260
he uses the type apology is integration,
right?

290
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.640
How Val integrated,
we are into a social group,

291
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:59.350
the odd n now that can be too high or can be too low,
right?

292
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.860
And War store high integration and too low integration can be the cause of

293
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:12.871
social pathologies and Vaughn of the social pathology is that you kill yourself.

294
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.670
All right?
Um,

295
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.210
and the other dimension is regulation.

296
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.340
Um,
uh,
how much,
how tight,

297
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.930
how rigorous the norms are.
We should regulate your behavior.

298
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:29.741
Again,

299
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:34.741
it can't be too high or it can be too low and it feel,

300
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.550
uh,
uh,
I fact also that,
apologies,
you know,

301
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:41.690
if you are obey from,
uh,

302
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.790
the Golden Middle Road,
right?
That's what,
Eh,
you know,

303
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.720
dairy,
dairy,
calves,

304
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.960
idea of normality is if you are on the golden middle of the road than you are

305
00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:59.580
more and more.
If you deviate,
you're on an abnormal.

306
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.370
This is a very problematic proposition and Durkheim has been challenged.

307
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.920
Now,
the big trouble is,

308
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.520
are these two dimensions independent from each other.

309
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.310
They overlap and it's three hourly.

310
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.100
They are not really how completely independent from each other.

311
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:25.320
This is why you could not put this into a two by two table,
right?

312
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.120
Uh,
because,
uh,
uh,
your,
um,
uh,

313
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.720
some of the types of abnormalities can be only understood in integration or in,

314
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.890
Eh,
Eh,
in terms of regulation.
But anyway,

315
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:44.880
I was saying this is probably the best way I can come up with it or end the

316
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.870
dairy.
Admit it should the best way I have read.
Uh,

317
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.950
basically using this to the mansions,
uh,
as,

318
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.720
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
not,

319
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.550
not as a two by two table sort of topic.
To put it this way,

320
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.780
uh,
it's uh,
that de done a two by two table.

321
00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:11.450
It's like you don't have two dimensions,
all right.

322
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.170
And then you have the types over here,
right?
Too High and too low,

323
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.330
right?
And you have integration,

324
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.180
integration and uh,
uh,
you have regulation

325
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.510
and uh,
high and low and high and low.

326
00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:35.720
This is how you can do it,
right?
You can conceptualize it,

327
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.440
but it's true.
You know,

328
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.420
it doesn't vary within that normal two by two table.
Okay,

329
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.810
well let me start to talk about [inaudible] side,
right?

330
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.390
And therefore,
right?
Eight boys,

331
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.790
the suicide had something to do with it.

332
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.230
Social Integration and it is a case,

333
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.750
then the social integration is too low.

334
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.190
Um,
and he said,
well,
uh,

335
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.430
the more Veekan the globe to which,
uh,

336
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.620
or the person will come and sue dotted belong,
the less he depends on them.

337
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.540
Um,
and he caused this egoism,
right?

338
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:30.530
If you don't,
you know,
you,
you are to yourself and you are not,

339
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:35.060
do not feel as possible,
uh,
to you own,
grow,
uh,

340
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.040
and uh,
uh,
uh,

341
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.040
therefore you may be committing suicide.
Um,

342
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.130
again,
you know,
people who are considering suicide,
uh,

343
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.140
uh,
uh,
uh,
just to show,
uh,

344
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.540
the lack of ego is man,
the importance of the group.
Uh,

345
00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.110
now you may think you have a good enough reason to kill yourself.
You know,

346
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.270
my life doesn't have any purpose.
You know,

347
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:05.420
my boy or girlfriend left me,

348
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:09.170
so therefore I'd rather kill myself.
And then they say,
well,

349
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:13.200
I can't really do this to mom,
right?
Uh,
right.

350
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.840
I cannot disappoint by my parents.
Right?
So therefore,

351
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.040
you are not,
you cannot act egoistic,
Ali,
right?
You belong to a group.

352
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.340
And because the tightness,
um,

353
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.360
the solidarity with the globe prevents you to commit suicide.

354
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.420
So in order to act egoistical,

355
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:37.421
it means that you don't care about others or you don't care first of all about

356
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.330
yourself.
Um,
as such,

357
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.970
now the solidarity can be different.

358
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.070
It can be religion,
it can be family,

359
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.810
or it can be the society.
Um,
and,
uh,
uh,

360
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.600
let me speak to this.
If this,
uh,
uh,

361
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.910
religion and family or so Satya such offers sufficient solidarity,

362
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:09.521
then you reel not be likely to commit suicide.

363
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.540
Uh,
okay.
So let me,
uh,
uh,

364
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:16.610
talking about religion and,

365
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.560
and suicide and also,
uh,

366
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.930
a bit about the,
uh,
how,
um,

367
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.890
religion and education are linked together with,

368
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:32.891
so he side there came thus you something really pass breaking.

369
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.220
Yeah.
No,
the statistical technologies were not available.

370
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.720
You really do,
does the logic off Marty,

371
00:26:40.721 --> 00:26:44.090
various statistical analysis,
uh,

372
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.790
he almost does aggregation model to put it this way.

373
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:51.960
We south numbers,
but that's,
that's the logic of the argument.

374
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.680
And then he's starting to get bad,
but he cross the Jewish exceptionalism.
Uh,

375
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.870
um,
uh,
well this will be,
uh,

376
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.090
interesting because the fundamental idea is that in fact,

377
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.570
generally,
uh,

378
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.200
people who are more educated and more likely to commit suicide,

379
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.010
right.
Uh,

380
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.480
there is also a relationship between religion and,

381
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.470
and,
uh,

382
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:24.470
and so he side Protestants are more likely to commit suicide catalytics,

383
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:30.210
less likely to commit suicide.
Catholics are less educated.

384
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.600
Protestants are more educated to being more educated than Protestant makes you

385
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.740
more susceptible to commit suicide.
You are use,

386
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.280
but Jews are an exception because joy is suicide rate is generally very low and

387
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.390
Jews are very highly educated.
So that's the Jewish puzzle,
right?

388
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.010
By owners,
highly educated Jews don't kill themselves.

389
00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.790
If you are right,
a Lutheran or Presbyterian,

390
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.880
then you are educated.
You kill yourself.
Right?
Why are Jews don't try?

391
00:28:04.881 --> 00:28:06.390
That's the puzzle.
You know,

392
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:11.630
what is the relationship between education and religion and why our nurse

393
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:19.080
education leads to higher level of suicide?
Right.
Uh,

394
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.250
okay.
Let me therefore,
uh,

395
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.520
start with this one there.
Um,

396
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.900
as I said,
uh,
uh,
he generally new finds that,
uh,

397
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:36.050
that is a higher rate of suicide among Protestant and lower rates among

398
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.950
Catholics and Jews have the lowest suicide rate among the Judeo Christian,

399
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.780
uh,
uh,
sphere of,
of the world.

400
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:53.460
That's what he studied the European countries.
Um,

401
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.890
in fact,
Islamic,
uh,
suicide rate is also,
uh,
uh,
low.

402
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.640
Uh,
well,
uh,
uh,

403
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.110
one possible easy answer would be that,
um,
you know,

404
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.680
there are stricter penalties if you are catalytic and if you commit suicide as

405
00:29:13.861 --> 00:29:18.480
far as you don't commit suicide,
right?
But that's not quite true and were time,

406
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:21.570
why are you was right.
Um,
in fact,

407
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.060
all religions are against suicide.
No religion aloes suicide.

408
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.860
Well,
Roman Catholics may be a little more,
uh,
uh,

409
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.550
rigorous about it.
You know,
uh,

410
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.000
you do not yet at a religious burro burrito.

411
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:42.130
I think most Roman Catholic piece would not bury who committed suicide in more

412
00:29:43.911 --> 00:29:48.360
standard trees.
Um,
uh,
uh,
while,
uh,

413
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:53.380
but I have to stand ministers May,
may perform a [inaudible] ceremony,

414
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.320
but I don't think,
you know,
if you commit suicide,

415
00:29:56.321 --> 00:30:01.321
it's really all that concerned that and how you view would be buried right

416
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.160
now.
So the question is why,
right?

417
00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:11.170
The F the first unsaid is that some diligence prohibits a suicide more than

418
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:17.881
others is not very persuasive because order diligence prohibits suicide.

419
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.230
Well,

420
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:25.230
and here he comes with the idea of integration and he said that Justin does ms

421
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:30.670
less strongly integrated church than the Catholic Church.

422
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.670
Less of a community.
Um,

423
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.380
and uh,
Judaism actually even more directly integrated,

424
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.760
even more so of a community.

425
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.420
So therefore it leaves relatively little room for egoistic suicide because the

426
00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:55.801
high level of integration and hear the rank order is relatively low level among

427
00:30:57.551 --> 00:30:58.570
Protestants,

428
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.800
higher level among Catholics and particularly high among,
uh,

429
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.080
shows.
Well,
um,

430
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:13.330
how onerous gumps education into and the the picture,

431
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:18.250
well,
he says,
uh,
uh,
as,
uh,
the

432
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.850
common and costs,
costs,
costs.

433
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.860
Are Marie pleasure disease weakening that is an increase in the trend of

434
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:32.200
suicide?
Well,

435
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.590
it's not exactly prejudice in the most conventional sense of the term.

436
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.260
Uh,
what he's referring to a,

437
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:44.470
he's referring here to,
uh,
the question,

438
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:49.471
what kind of overcome with the education generally speaking,

439
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.720
right?
Um,

440
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.110
that if you are becoming more educated,

441
00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.640
UVL have last off excepting doctorates,
right?

442
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:05.260
Education,
right.
Is a critical exercise.
Right.

443
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.300
And that's what I was trying to do in this course,
right.
To challenge you,
right.

444
00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.230
To be a critical theorist.
Right.

445
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.800
Do subjects your own consciousness to critical scrutiny and to subject the

446
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:23.830
theorists you have read to critical scrutiny.
Right.

447
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.990
That's why I asked you in the tests to do,
uh,
uh,

448
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.220
find a puzzle,
right?
And take CISE in this puzzle,

449
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.570
offer some criticism from some of the theories.

450
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.040
That's what education is all.

451
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:43.790
And therefore prejudice is dogma is declining,
right?

452
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.420
And if Dogma is declining that are less given stereotypes for us,

453
00:32:49.611 --> 00:32:52.460
we believe in,
uh,
then,
uh,

454
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.980
beyond more likely to come with mid suicide.

455
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:59.981
This is a kind of weakening of the collective conscience is becoming more of an

456
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.690
individual consciousness.

457
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:07.810
The critical thinker is becoming more of an individual.
Um,

458
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.740
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
consciousness.
They'll end,

459
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:13.790
he said,
well,

460
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:18.970
they go together with religion because Catholic standard to be less educated

461
00:33:20.301 --> 00:33:22.070
than Stratasys and more educated.

462
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.250
I don't know how much this still stands up to scrutiny,

463
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.550
but there certainly true that traditionally,
um,

464
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.790
artists than churches did attribute and greater emphasis,

465
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:39.050
uh,
to education.
One big reason was,
um,

466
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.270
uh,
uh,
the relationship between,
uh,
believers,

467
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:48.050
uh,
and uh,
and the clergyman,
right?

468
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.890
And the classical Roman Catholic theology like the clergyman interprets the

469
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.510
Bible,
right?
Uh,
for the believer believers,

470
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:05.050
the big right revolution of that formation was that they translated the Bible

471
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:13.151
right into native languages and printing was just made available and the started

472
00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:18.740
to print the Bible and they wanted leap people to read the Bible.

473
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:23.090
Now in medieval Roman Catholic church,

474
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.250
only the priests read the Bible,
right?
Uh,

475
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.140
sort of Protestant is vent together with mass education,

476
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.240
massive public education and an emphasis on education.

477
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:43.040
How to read and write.
Alright.
Uh,
so therefore,
uh,

478
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.570
I think that that is a good,
good claim to be made on the long run.

479
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.010
And generally speaking,

480
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:53.900
Protestant tended to be more educated than Catholics.
I doubt,
you know,

481
00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:58.901
whether you would find Marshall religious differences in contemporary societies,

482
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.890
but that was,
you know,
that,
you know,

483
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:06.230
VA was simply a correlation pointing into same direction.

484
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.830
Um,
and he,
he also makes this point,

485
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:13.170
which is by now utterly untrue,

486
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.590
Vema and are not less educated in advanced societies.

487
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:19.424
The man,

488
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.700
the men are actually by now more educated than man in the head once Western

489
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:29.330
countries,
including the United States.
Right.

490
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.110
In no time.
You guys,

491
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:38.710
you really have to very harder to make sure that you can catch up with the

492
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.550
ladies.
Right?
Because they will be better educated than him.

493
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.280
He'll be all right.
Uh,
but anyway,
and his times,

494
00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:52.110
women were less educated than man and they were less likely to commit suicide.

495
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:54.450
I think there's also still the case,

496
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:57.930
I think for women are still less generally speaking,

497
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.950
still less likely to commit suicide.
In fact,

498
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:06.951
I think women are more likely to attempt suicide but completed suicide rate is

499
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:11.970
much higher among men than among women.
Right?
That's,

500
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.760
I think the basic finding.
But anyway,

501
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:18.540
here it's more of a methodological point.
I don't,

502
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.130
I doubt that whether the Catholic Protestant,

503
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:27.030
a distinction still stands and it's certainly,
it doesn't stand for women,
right?

504
00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:28.820
Women by now,
um,

505
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.480
in the vest and advanced countries in almost every country are better educated

506
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:38.070
than men are,
especially the younger generation are better educated.

507
00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:42.870
Um,
but the methodological point is interesting,
right?
As I said,

508
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:46.020
he's beginning to do multivariate analysis,
right?

509
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.420
So the dependent variable is tendency to suicide.
And he has a little,

510
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:54.930
you know,
regression model,
right?
He looks into the regression,

511
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.940
mother countries and gender and education and religion and trust to explain the

512
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:07.470
variance and the suicide rate.
Uh,
I mean,
uh,

513
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:11.430
in terms of research design,
this is very beautiful.
He done right.

514
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:16.680
This is social science,
right as we know it today.

515
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.390
Well,
and that is the Jew Judaistic puzzle.

516
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.790
Uh,
Jews,

517
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.570
I think there's still true is better educated.
They're non Jews.
Uh,

518
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.830
again,
I've wouldn't have survived on it.
I,

519
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.540
I really have not looked at data on religion and education,

520
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:44.490
but certainly generally has been true at,
at that time.
Uh,
then,
uh,

521
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.850
Durkheim was writing about the late 19th century.

522
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.250
Jews were a highly educated,
uh,

523
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.170
in European particular,
uh,

524
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.790
and by the 1920s and thirties in the United States as well.

525
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.810
Um,
uh,
do they are highly educated.
Uh,

526
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.740
well,
yeah,
less likely to commit suicide.
So there is a trouble,
right.

527
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.750
With his explanation of the model,
right.
Uh,
what's going on here.

528
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.280
Um,
and then,
um,
he,
uh,

529
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:23.390
tries to understand what is the purpose of learning math.

530
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.980
You said the purpose of learning among Jews is different and that's the claim

531
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.740
Jews seeks to learn,

532
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.120
not in order to replace his collective prejudices,

533
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:41.290
but Millie do better arm for the struggle,
right?

534
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.990
So,
uh,
you'll read the Talmud,
right?

535
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.520
You go to the rabbi and you was through a all the kind of education to better

536
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.530
understand the holy scripture,
right?

537
00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.310
And the interpretations of the Holy Scripture,
right?

538
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.070
You've got a lot of education,
right?

539
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:06.850
If you are preparing yourself for your Bar Mitzvah,
right?

540
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.830
We even have to learn Hebrew,
right?
To pass your bar,
Bar Mitzvah,

541
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.730
you sweat blood,
probably me.
And while doing so,
right?

542
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:20.380
Um,
uh,
this is not to challenge the doctrine.

543
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.860
It is to better understand the doc chain,
right?

544
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.850
And therefore he doesn't undermine the collective conscience,

545
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:32.290
these education strange,
the collective conscience.
Right?

546
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.710
I think that's at least Durkheim screen very,
again,

547
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:40.660
I think take it methodologically,
I think methodology call the formidable,

548
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.880
but this guy is doing a right as early as nine,

549
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.140
1897.
Right?

550
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:52.400
This is the kind of stuff today and if any one of you have,

551
00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.870
you'll do a phd,
right?

552
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.540
In political science or economics or sociology,

553
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:03.760
you have the Candy Chi,
this kind of research design your mentor,
if you will say,

554
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:08.410
go for it.
That's the right way to do it,
right?
Anyway,
so that's uh,

555
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:13.660
so,
um,
uh,
now he says,
uh,

556
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.950
education.
Therefore it's a very interesting idea,
right?

557
00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:20.920
You now does a kind of interaction,

558
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:25.921
I fact right between education and religion and he looks at this interaction

559
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:30.340
effect,
how these two affect each other.
They said it depends,
you know,

560
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:33.430
what education is all about.
You know,

561
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:38.770
education if it is v canning,
the collective conscience,

562
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.860
uh,
makes you just critical of everything.

563
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:46.861
What you learned a valuable to build the cause of suicide or devise is actually,

564
00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:52.450
um,
uh,
uh,
important to,
uh,
um,
uh,

565
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:56.230
reinforce,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

566
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.700
you are in society and now family and suicide.

567
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.190
And this is the point that I,
I did make,
right?
Um,

568
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:11.050
uh,
in fact,
you know,
if you are integrated in a sauce in,
uh,

569
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.210
uh,
uh,
you know,
family,

570
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:18.211
you are less likely to commit suicide.

571
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:22.480
And he said,
well,
uh,
there should be,
if that is true,

572
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:27.580
there should be some evidence that people who are married,

573
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.980
uh,
uh,
we'll be,
uh,

574
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.040
less likely to kill themselves and people who are unmarried and vidoe the,

575
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.530
and that is actually the case.
Uh,
uh,

576
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.180
uh,
generally by the way,
marriage seems to have a,
uh,

577
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:50.420
a house advantage,
right?
Uh,
uh,
if you are considering,
you know,

578
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.380
never to get married,
think about your health,
right?
Um,

579
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.410
uh,
uh,
if you,
if you get married,
uh,

580
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.040
statistics will tell you you will live longer.

581
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:09.430
And actually they also tell you you have your live happier than if you stay

582
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:11.810
along and now,

583
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:15.830
and you'll probably is less likely to commit suicide.

584
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:20.960
So that's what he called matrimonial immunity to suicide.

585
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:25.310
Why he says,
and this again,
incredible what he,

586
00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.730
what the guy's doing here,
right?
He said,
well,

587
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:32.280
one possible explanation is that you know,
um,

588
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.700
because you know you are in a community right then for you,

589
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.000
you're not commit suicide.

590
00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:42.490
I cannot due to my spouse to cure myself because my spouse,

591
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:47.510
your beam him or herself or my desks and I don't want to cause harm to my

592
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:51.410
spouse,
right?
Therefore I don't commit suicide.
I said,

593
00:42:51.411 --> 00:42:54.470
young people often don't commit suicide.

594
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:58.820
The respect to,
uh,
to the their parents.

595
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.470
But he said,
and this is really extra ordinary,

596
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:09.020
he said that it can be caused by matrimonial selection,
right?

597
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.270
People who are more likely to commit suicide to begin with,

598
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:18.470
it may not marry.
Now,

599
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.170
those of you who took statistics classes,

600
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.400
you know what he's talking about though,
at that time,

601
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:29.060
this was not in statistics at all.

602
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.570
It is called the selection problem,
right?

603
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.870
This is exactly the selection problem.
He said,

604
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:41.350
we cannot really tell why people who are married are less likely to commit

605
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:45.380
suicide because it is possible.

606
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:50.420
People that intention to commit suicide are not get married,
right?

607
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:55.310
Because they are lonely people to begin with.
And this is why they did not marry.

608
00:43:55.550 --> 00:44:00.550
So the lower frequency of suicide among married people is not the consequence of

609
00:44:00.981 --> 00:44:01.814
marriage,

610
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.060
but marriage is the consequence of people's likely not to commit suicide.

611
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:12.850
This is the classic got example or discard the sample selection lawn,

612
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:18.140
right?
Um,
and the,
all the,
you know what the only solution for this is,

613
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.650
uh,
experimental methods,
right?

614
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.530
That's the only way how you could deal with this to solve the problem,
right?

615
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:32.140
Um,
and if you,
uh,
uh,
Duke Feed Professor Green,
uh,

616
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:36.420
uh,
political science course,
you know exactly what I mean,
right?

617
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.040
Social scientists really should do experimental random assignments.

618
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:46.090
You could really come read of the problem of these,
uh,
uh,
uh,

619
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.910
sample selection bias.

620
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:52.860
If you could randomly assign people to get married or not to get married and

621
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:53.221
then they've,

622
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:57.360
you'll get married or not to get married and then to see whether it had an

623
00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:00.480
effect or not.
Unfortunately,
in society,

624
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:03.870
we can't really do random assignments,
right?

625
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.060
The hardly can assign people to get married or not to get married and follow it

626
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:14.010
up 30 years later,
but that they are still alive,
right as the problem.

627
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:14.700
Uh,

628
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.700
but and advise that is really statisticians to all kind of big tricks around

629
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:22.590
this but really cannot be solved.

630
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:26.250
The real solution would be only the experimental metric.

631
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.920
There's nothing formal about this,
right,

632
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:32.910
that he is very ahead of himself.
You know,

633
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.420
I the whole problem of,
you know,
sample selection issue,

634
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:41.660
I came across this in statistics in the 1980s that's very,

635
00:45:42.491 --> 00:45:47.370
it became a big thing.
The 1980s sample selection model,

636
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:52.320
how you control for the sample selection.
Grandma and he knew about the problem,

637
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:56.500
not the statistical album,
but the research design problem,
right?

638
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.630
In 1897.
Okay.
But he said,

639
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:04.530
well that is still data which supports actually,
uh,

640
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.000
that matrimonial Islam.
In fact,
they'll society the same.

641
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.370
That's counterintuitive.
He said if there are great social disturbances,

642
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.530
then actually social sentiment salad,
high revolution,
right.

643
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.250
You feel identified with your country and the revolutionary calls,

644
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:24.810
and you do not commit suicide.

645
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.890
If otherwise you would have committed suicide after suicide grade,

646
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:33.900
you'll be going down.
Uh,
so anyway,
uh,
um,

647
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.370
this was about egoistic suicide.
Now let me,

648
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.530
I am running out of time very badly.
Uh,
uh,

649
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:44.670
altruistic switch side,

650
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:51.370
there are touristic suicide is a happening then social integration is far too

651
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:54.750
high,
uh,
unbearably high.

652
00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:00.410
And that's when people will be committing what he calls altruistic switch side.

653
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:06.390
Um,
uh,
uh,
the scan happen,
uh,
for instance,

654
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:10.410
he said,
uh,
people,
older man,
uh,

655
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.850
the example of what I gave,
you know,
the age,
uh,
uh,
commit suicide.

656
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:16.343
Um,
uh,

657
00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:21.030
Vienen occasionally on the death of their husband commits suicide because they

658
00:47:21.031 --> 00:47:22.710
think this is expected from them.

659
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:28.140
And traditionally after and followers or servants on the desk of the chief

660
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:31.050
committed suicide.
So,
uh,

661
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.120
we are talking about altruistic suicide because people commit suicide because

662
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:41.130
they think it is their duty to kill themselves.
Right?
Um,

663
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.930
and this is,
uh,
uh,

664
00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.040
a sacrifice which is imposed by society for something like as social and right.

665
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:55.090
It can be obligatory in certain societies.
Uh,
uh,
you know,

666
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:58.740
if you lost a battle,
uh,

667
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.550
and you will a Japanese soldier,
right?
You committed hierarchy,
you know,

668
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:08.500
if you heard the general,
even in the Second World War,

669
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.250
they committed hierarchy,
killed themselves,
um,

670
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:17.920
uh,
or,
uh,
it actually can be even kind of mystical.

671
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.680
So he signed for instance,
uh,
as you know,

672
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:25.690
Hindus occasionally jump into the Ganga River to kill themselves.

673
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.220
Um,

674
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:31.690
well today he said this is a relatively rare incident,

675
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:36.250
but it happens in the army.
He says,
soldier skill themselves,

676
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:39.640
not because they are not sufficiently integrated.
What?

677
00:48:39.641 --> 00:48:44.641
Because they are highly integrated and therefore that individual is,

678
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.270
is vague and that's why they've committed suicide.
And now,
um,

679
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:53.020
about uh,
uh,
uh,
anatomics suicide,
right?

680
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.200
Well,
you know,
anime,

681
00:48:56.201 --> 00:49:00.130
anime is the lack of social regulation.

682
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.420
And indeed he said,

683
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:06.310
if you find yourself in ever changing situations where a value system is

684
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:09.690
changing,
you are likely,
uh,
to,
uh,

685
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:14.700
more likely to commit suicide.
Um,
uh,

686
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:19.850
and,
uh,
well,
it can be a reason for,
uh,
uh,

687
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.300
uh,
economic reasons.

688
00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:27.301
So a traditional institutions decline a suicide during the Great Depression as

689
00:49:28.931 --> 00:49:31.070
the bank,
uh,
um,
uh,

690
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:35.650
collapse of our street when people were jumping out of the window.

691
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.670
Uh,

692
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:41.670
it actually a few of the happened those so last fall with the turn down of the

693
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.030
stock market and it can be,
you know,
uh,

694
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.910
another good example is domestic and on me.

695
00:49:48.911 --> 00:49:53.020
You get your spouse dies or you get divorced,

696
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.740
then,
uh,
suicide rate is recurrent.

697
00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.930
And finally fatalistic switch side.
Um,
it,
as I pointed out,

698
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:06.460
a Durkheim notion of fatal is miss a twin concept to marks,

699
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:09.180
notion of alienation that is cool,

700
00:50:09.181 --> 00:50:13.840
much that you relation and not enough social integration,
uh,

701
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:19.000
uh,
such as the keys off him,
slaves or childless women.

702
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:23.530
Uh,
then the turns to commit suicide.
There's about so,

703
00:50:23.531 --> 00:50:26.900
so much about their time.
And so it's side

704
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.550
and Max Lecture,
I view it was dark too.

705
00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:36.440
The questions briefly before we go on,
do a capsule methodology.
So they'll come,

706
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.300
you know,
they'll help full or the test.
Uh,
uh,

707
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:45.100
and I appreciate actually your class attendance.
It was wonderful.

708
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.670
All along.
