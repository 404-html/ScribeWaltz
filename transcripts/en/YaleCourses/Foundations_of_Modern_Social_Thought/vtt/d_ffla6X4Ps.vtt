1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.740
That's got going with John Stuart Mill.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.140
And let me just one more time to say,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.590
John Stuart Mill is formidably influential,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.440
very influential on our days,

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.620
and he's the ultimate of liberalism.

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.290
And I'm in some days,
uh,

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.030
among all the auteurist video be reading this semester,

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.820
he's the most consistent,
uh,

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.760
the clearest one and the most consistent of the mall.
Uh,

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.330
he draws the line to the logical conclusions,
uh,
no matter what it is,
right.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.610
Um,
and,
you know,

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.450
taking just point of departure from Adam Smith's lock,

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.220
Adam Smith's and then,
um,
um,
Bantam,

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.821
uh,

15
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:52.821
he pushes the line of utilitarianism to its most logical conclusions and he's

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.820
extremely influential what we call now neoclassical economics.

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.690
And he's fine.

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.690
He was exactly the person who made the many people who've are liberals and

19
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:11.601
Democrats in the 1960s and seventies to change and create what they call,

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.480
they'll conservative is more narrowly,

21
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:18.481
but all his Ma and went over to the Republican Party was an important dividing

22
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:22.030
line,
um,
uh,
meals,
uh,

23
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.000
a strong insistence on individual liberty.

24
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.920
Right.
And He,
and what follows from this staunch insistence,
uh,

25
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:36.210
for,
uh,
uh,
the role of the state.
Right?

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.010
And how far stage can interfere,
uh,
individuals.
Uh,

27
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.940
that was really,

28
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:46.941
I think the dividing line in which many people who were on the political left

29
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:51.020
center left or occasionally far left,
uh,

30
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.480
by the late 1960s,
early seventies,

31
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.950
seeing stuff like the affirmative action,
the war on poverty,

32
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.870
they change their lines.
They said,
look,
the Democratic Party liberal is Maria.

33
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:07.370
He betrays liberal is that's not liberalism.

34
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.300
Readjust to earth meal.
That's when you've,

35
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.140
or UV or Nova three or liberalism is right.

36
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.510
Anyway,
so I think this is,
this is why he,
you know,

37
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:23.250
his message is very much alive and I'm sure that,
um,
uh,
uh,

38
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.440
uh,
this classroom is divided by people.
You know,

39
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.470
some people subscribe to a John Stewart meals,

40
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.060
a reburial asthma.

41
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480
Others probably do think that he emphasizes too much individual liberties and

42
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:44.811
that is much more of a role to implement the general God by the government.

43
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.010
Okay.
I mean,
I think we left it right here.
Um,
uh,
last week.

44
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.890
These are the main team of utilitarian.
He's book on Utilitarianism,

45
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.920
the way how he departs from Bantam,
um,

46
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.420
very important change,
uh,
that he,
uh,

47
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.490
beginning to emphasize that our higher happiness is because we can see it is not

48
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:13.840
simply quantity,
but quality of happiness is what we see.

49
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.300
Very important contribution,
I think.

50
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:21.301
And this is an idea which is a only touched upon by Adam Smith's buttery or

51
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:26.080
they're not properly developed and certainly completely missing the in Bantam.

52
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.380
Uh,
it is really mirror contribution,

53
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:33.350
which is very important for a contemporary,
uh,

54
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.410
economic theory.
No,
no classical economics.
They call this preferences,

55
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:38.681
right?

56
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.681
That we have preferences and therefore individuals will attach different values

57
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.780
to different utilities.
Right?
Um,

58
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.130
and this really comes from the version of John Stuart Mill.

59
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.470
Then,
you know,
he makes this distinction between legality and,
uh,
justice.
Uh,

60
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.350
and uh,
uh,
uh,

61
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.540
what is legal is not necessarily just and what is justice necessarily approved

62
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:09.280
by laws.
Um,
and then justice and expediency but is expedient,

63
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.090
is not necessarily just,
um,
uh,
and,
uh,

64
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.560
we are just may have you Scott and me and I'd be the fastest way to get that

65
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.270
right.
Okay.
So,
uh,

66
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.920
Libor our way through of this and leave time to look at the questions there.

67
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.220
The idea is that we are human beings and therefore we have capacity to have a,

68
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.020
uh,
higher appetites then the animal appetites,
right?

69
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.240
Um,
so we have imagination about animals don't have,

70
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.270
we have moral sentiments and these moral sentiments may lead us in our choices.

71
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.880
Right now you can see,
uh,
the,
the met I mentioned that about Adam Smith.

72
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.740
Adam Smith might have had this theory of sympathetic humans,

73
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
uh,
which,
you know,
v born did these deduction.

74
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.520
This is very central for John John Stewart to male.

75
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.300
Uh,
and therefore he emphasizes that is a qualitative difference,

76
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:21.160
right between human and simply animal appetites.
Uh,

77
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.360
so therefore you simply cannot do what Bantam did.
Simply add up,

78
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.550
right?
The epithets and to save more appetites are satisfied.

79
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.960
Better of the society is,
uh,
the chief good.

80
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.360
So he argues is virtual be virtuous and then you'll,

81
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:43.660
you'll feel good.
You'll be,
we'll be happier if you are virtuous,
uh,
such,

82
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.270
uh,
Bart,
you know,

83
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:51.271
these are all qualifications of the kind of elementary utilitarian is my thing.

84
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.280
Qualifications.
But by the way,

85
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.570
a more stringent or choice your and uh,
and now classic classical economist,

86
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.690
if you'll also aggravate,
uh,

87
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.760
those who are critiques of now liberals and utilitarianism very often kind of

88
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.790
caricature that position mark reality,

89
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.760
understanding that following John's you are new.

90
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:18.650
They do understand that there is a qualitative differences between utilities,

91
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.070
but otherwise he remains by the utilitarian principle.

92
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.050
We are rational actors.
The ourself interested,

93
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.620
we know of what our needs are and we can make good judgments,
right?

94
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.780
Whether the price we have to pay in order to satisfy our needs is various for
us,

95
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:40.280
right?
That is the fundamental right idea of utilitarianism,
uh,

96
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.420
which is,
uh,

97
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.290
thank you very healthy today that are many people who disagree with it.

98
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.540
There are many people who agree with it.
All right?
Um,
but this is all,
uh,

99
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.340
John Stuart Mills,
um,
uh,

100
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.050
addition and now a bit on higher happiness.
Well,

101
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.520
the pleasure of the beast.

102
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.030
My be felt as decorating by a human being.
Um,
uh,

103
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.000
all right.
We want to have some,
we have higher needs than just,
uh,
um,

104
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.550
uh,
the animal needs civil,

105
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.940
or you'll go to a five star restaurant.

106
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.760
Maybe you serve you a little rude,
right?
It'll be delicious,

107
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.610
but it will be unlike,
you know,

108
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:26.840
these Italian family restaurant down the road.

109
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.070
And I in the Wooster street where they give you,
right,
um,
food,

110
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.790
what you can hardly eat,
right?
We satisfies your animal advertise,

111
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:42.350
right?
So anyway,
we have higher needs,
higher appetize,
right?

112
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.680
We want to see it or food served in a special way,
right?

113
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.150
And the honor just don't feed our belly as such.

114
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.340
And there are,
you know,
uh,

115
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.140
the pleasures of the Internet and imagination.

116
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:58.880
I think we all ready have seen,

117
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:02.330
listen also how important imagination is.

118
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.130
And if you are in comparative literature or English,
you know,

119
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:12.110
of course the aesthetic theories of,
um,
uh,
Schiller,
uh,

120
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:17.150
the German poet,
right?
Uh,
who emphasized how important actually,

121
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.880
um,
Eh,
uh,

122
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.390
imagination and play is in figuring out what,

123
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:28.040
what beauty is.
What are this do is something like,
Eh,

124
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.980
all right.
Um,
and then a bit on quality of life measures.

125
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.140
Right?
The reality,

126
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:41.141
the question is what kind of pleasure satisfies us rather than just the

127
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:46.270
quantity.
Um,
uh,
and uh,
I think this is,

128
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.210
this is a very powerful point.
Uh,
uh,
uh,

129
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.500
uh,
a few women's,
uh,

130
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.740
would to be changed into Annie of the lower animals.

131
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.980
Um,
right?
Uh,
uh,

132
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.040
no intelligent being would go on sand to be a fool even though they should be

133
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:12.801
persuaded that a fool is better satisfied then a lot of man,

134
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.200
right?

135
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.200
It's easier to satisfy occasionally Fu and this is really beautiful.

136
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.390
It's better to be a human being,

137
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:25.590
be satisfied then a big satisfied,
right.

138
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.100
Better to be so Kratos this satisfied then a full satisfied Bingo.

139
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:38.310
Right.
He got it.
I think that's very guilty,
fully done.
Powerfully done.

140
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.060
Think about it.
Very hard to disagree with this.
Right?

141
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.680
You want to be right,
Socrates.
Right.

142
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:51.681
And this satisfied rather than just being satisfied by your needs.

143
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.880
Well,
I don't want to develop,

144
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.950
go march on the issue of justice and the legalities,
quite obvious,
right?

145
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.290
That there are differences between justice and illegality.
Illegality.

146
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.830
Now it is unjust if anybody's a deprived from his personal liberty or,

147
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.430
or property,
uh,
um,
um,
uh,
even if,

148
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.050
if that's what the law tells you.
I mean,
come on.

149
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:23.850
These government confiscated property from people and they did it legally.

150
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.770
But,
uh,
uh,
John Stuart Mill,
you say they did it on just the right,

151
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.900
it was legally done,
but unjustly.
Uh,

152
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.840
it was against the sense of justice of people are being deprived around the

153
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.870
travesty and that are laws which do not exist at all.

154
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.110
They should exist,
right?
Um,

155
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.600
because some of the individual rights are not properly defended and you really

156
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:56.010
should have a such laws.
And of course for him,
uh,

157
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:56.963
uh,

158
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.970
there has not been in his time sufficient laws to protect the rights of women or

159
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:05.370
the rise of sleep.
So,
um,
they'll also,

160
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:10.080
today we are concerned about whether we have dropped our production in this

161
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:13.960
country for individual liberties against the,
uh,

162
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.680
surveillance techniques,
for instance,
which were used,
right.
Uh,

163
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.770
very recently in the United States.

164
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:25.010
Many people think we need very stricter controls on the government where there

165
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.530
they can listen to our telephone conversations,
right?

166
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.960
The want to have very clear laws rightly should define exactly what torture is.

167
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:38.010
We may be uncertain,
but the laws are sufficiently clear,
right?

168
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.050
So therefore you need occasionally laws which protects,
uh,
human rights.

169
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.980
This argument can be used actually for affirmative action.
I do.

170
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.410
You may need occasionally laws,

171
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.520
which kind of eliminates the inequalities,
right?

172
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.510
Of People's three dorms is some people have less freedom,

173
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.220
others because they've have it full can start from a different starting point.

174
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.080
Then you can use John Stuart mill argument and to say you need a law which we

175
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:12.010
protect these people and make sure that they are three enough,
right?

176
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:15.100
That they are there.
They,
you create an equality of freedom.

177
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:20.230
That would be his argument.
And then our laws which exist,

178
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.540
but they should not exist that are bad and aren't just laws.
Uh,

179
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.410
well we debate this issue a great deal.
Uh,

180
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.280
uh,

181
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.260
I'm sure there are some people in this country who do think that the government

182
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:40.150
should not kill,
right?
There are some people who are against the death penalty.

183
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:42.750
Probably the majority's forward that specialty,

184
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.700
but there is probably a minority in this room.

185
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.630
I don't want to ask you to show hands,
do I mind?

186
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.780
But I'm sure there are some people who think the government should or should not

187
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:59.290
kill people.
I'm one of those.
I don't think that's right.

188
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.540
I think life is sacred.
I believe sufficiently,
um,
uh,

189
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.860
um,
in hops,
uh,
first law of nature.

190
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.180
No government should here.
Uh,
so that's penalty.

191
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.500
I don't think it's right,
but you can't argue it's,

192
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.240
it's necessary to defend other people's freedom.
Right?
Uh,
but,
uh,

193
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.660
I think,
uh,
uh,

194
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.630
John Stuart mill probably would have been unhappy with the desk panel.
Uh,

195
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.750
so,
uh,
um,
uh,

196
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.750
you may want to change legislation,
right?

197
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.550
You may want to have a legislation,
right,
which are,

198
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.970
eliminates the death penalty or you know,
and other issuers,
let's say,

199
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.480
uh,
again,

200
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:48.481
I'm sure this audience here is divided on the question of,

201
00:13:48.621 --> 00:13:53.350
uh,
uh,
abortion that are some people who've believed that,
you know,

202
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:58.351
abortion should be prohibited by law because you should defend the freedom and

203
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:03.800
right of existence of the unborn child that are others.

204
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.410
Why are you the freedom argument on the other side,
right?
They say,
no,

205
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:13.411
you should not prohibit abortion because you should defend liberty of the women

206
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.160
who carries the child.
All right?
Now this,

207
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.960
these are just examples,
right?

208
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:24.370
That these issues are talking to very contemporary issues,

209
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.250
alright?
Uh,
justice and the equality.

210
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.490
This is a very interesting,
uh,
idea of what he's playing.
Get Out.

211
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.520
He said the head have actual year sense that justice is somehow related to

212
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:40.241
equality.

213
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:45.241
That we occasionally feel that some degree of inequality is already on.

214
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:51.380
Just even if it is legally achieved by legal means,

215
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.640
we may see it is unjust,
usual,
all the inequalities are,
uh,

216
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.460
um,
uh,
explained and justified by expediency,
right?

217
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.540
You have to create these high levels of inequality because you have to create

218
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.470
incentives.
We just heard this debate,
you know,

219
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.440
the last couple of weeks.
Um,

220
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.400
if you try to limit the bonuses,

221
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.530
the guys on Wall Street,
you get,

222
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.630
you do a lot of damage because this hot,
you know,

223
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.540
brokers will be hired by the competition.

224
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.710
Therefore they have to get this hundred million dollar bonuses.

225
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.320
Otherwise the business will be heard,
right?

226
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.370
And there were banks which were paying bank millions of dollars to the federal

227
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:40.970
government.
So the federal government cannot intervene,
right?

228
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.340
And cannot overrule,
right?
How much bonus is they?
Right.

229
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.100
Expediency,
right?
They say,
oh,

230
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:52.250
give me a break about these justice stuff,

231
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.430
that this is unfair that somebody earns $100 million they should learn because

232
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:01.970
otherwise the competition gets them.
Right.
Now,

233
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.530
this is the argument of experience.
See not the argument of justice,
right?

234
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.260
Uh,
all right.
Uh,
well,
there are different components of justice.

235
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.370
Well,
the first and most important one,

236
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.780
it is unjust to deprive anyone of its personal liberty and property.

237
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.850
That's the most important point,
right?
In just you Stuart near,

238
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:33.080
he's actually defending individual liberty.

239
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.210
The second one illegal,
right,
uh,

240
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.930
is deprived maybe rights,
which ought not to have belonged to him,

241
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.800
right?
That may be privileges.
I mean,
in contemporary societies,

242
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:50.801
this is much less common in his time that read a lot of laws that I featured.

243
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.250
The fact that the bended defended people's privileges,

244
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.710
fueled our privileges,
but he wanted to get rid off.
Right?
Um,

245
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.830
Dave or unjust.
Well,

246
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.890
he also then suggest that each person should obtain bought he or she deserves.

247
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.980
Right?
Even if it is not guaranteed by law.
Well,

248
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:17.910
how far do you go with this argument?
It's again,
can be very controversial.
Uh,

249
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:21.680
you can say that now you need a welfare state,
right?

250
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:27.140
Are you have to provide the basic goods and services?
What everybody,

251
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.180
uh,
you know,
this argument can be used,
you know,
you have to provide housing.

252
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:35.720
You should not let anybody in the south shelter,
um,
uh,

253
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.020
or you should not let anybody,
if you south health scare,
uh,

254
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.640
that would be consistent with John Stuart Mill.

255
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.500
And then he said,
well,
uh,
it is unjust.
If you bake faith,

256
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.450
right?
You promised somebody,

257
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:56.280
either you do it and then you take your bird back that's unjust at that.

258
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.200
You should not do that.
Um,
uh,
and it's fine,
or this is very important,

259
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:05.040
right?
Justice cannot be partial,
right?
Uh,

260
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.380
it has to be blind,
right?

261
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.950
And has to be equal to all parties.
And now,
uh,

262
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.020
justice had expediency.
I again,
don't want to labor on this.
This is obvious,

263
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:20.840
right?
That's what is expedient is not necessarily just expedient,

264
00:18:20.841 --> 00:18:23.820
is if you reach that goal with minimum effort,

265
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.800
but occasionally you don't,
you,
you,

266
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.300
you better not make shortcuts making those shortcuts maybe unjust and unfair.

267
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.590
And then of course,
sympathy,
right?
Uh,

268
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:42.680
we are all capable to sympathize,
uh,
uh,
not only,
uh,

269
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.220
with people we know about with the whole humankind.
We have sympathy,

270
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.690
um,
uh,
sympathy for our country and our mankind.

271
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:56.500
It's a bit,
you know,
like Rousseau's Lamore dropper,
uh,

272
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.180
idea.
Um,
uh,

273
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:04.760
I think I probably skipped this one.
Uh,
uh,
I think,
uh,
we,

274
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.970
it's quite obvious.
You know why,
uh,

275
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.080
justice and expediency do have a complicated

276
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.000
relationship.
And now on the other book on liberty,

277
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.100
right?
Well,
uh,
by them only emphasize,
uh,

278
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.140
that we are seeking pleasure mill emphasize self development,

279
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.910
right?
Uh,
he said,
uh,

280
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.320
we have to in our lifetime we have to develop our capacities,
right?

281
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.010
Um,
uh,

282
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.870
and what follows from this individual is and liberty,

283
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.720
these are the major values,
right?

284
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.640
Rather than just satisfying our needs.
Well,

285
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.880
this is an extremely important idea and very much an idea of John Stuart Mill.

286
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.140
We should not take freedom as uh,
as granted.
And he said,

287
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.210
be very careful of rulers,
right?
Who identify with the people.

288
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.550
It does not guarantee freedom,
right?

289
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.750
Because it can lead to the tyranny of the majority.

290
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:13.650
You have to defend the rights of the individuals,

291
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.080
the rights of the minorities,

292
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.560
that they should be also free to choose.

293
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.400
This falls very logically from his argument,
right?

294
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.730
Of these higher happinesses preferences arrived at by individual judgments,

295
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:33.480
right?
Not Super Imposed by government,
but individuals decide.

296
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.200
But is that higher value they attach to our utility?
Uh,

297
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.660
and therefore,
you know,

298
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:44.460
it can be minorities which do have different preferences and they have to

299
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:47.930
respect those references.
That's very cool,

300
00:20:47.931 --> 00:20:49.660
shall important ideas.

301
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:55.260
And that unit individual liberties should overstay precedents over short term

302
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:58.570
utilitarian consideration,
right?

303
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.500
The main value is individual liberty.
And believe me,

304
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:04.060
this is not a contradiction.

305
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.950
It follows very logically from the idea of preferences and from the idea that

306
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:13.951
there are qualitative differences between utilities and you are the only one who

307
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:18.040
can decide what is verse for you.
Mobile as scan naked,

308
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.450
a decision and judgment for you.
This is consistent with Adam Smith's by the way.

309
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:27.160
And then freedom of expression that is no nobody whom VB or read,

310
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.940
who stands so strongly for freedom of expression,

311
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.900
complete unlimited freedom of expression.
Um,

312
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.630
and the United States comes very close,

313
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.460
right to this and this is the only country in the dish comes so close to it.

314
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.010
In other countries which are democratic,

315
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:49.750
free and liberal freedom of speech may be limited.
You know,

316
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.840
he speech might,
may be actually limited,
right?

317
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.550
Denying the Holocaust and you end up in jail in Germany.
Right?

318
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.030
Um,
but,
uh,
in the US,
we,

319
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.760
we are very close to the million idea and he said,

320
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:08.910
this is absolutely natural set read to have that total freedom of speech because

321
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:15.130
an opinion,
uh,
Digi supressive right?

322
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.660
Then they lose the opportunity to exchange throughs for error.

323
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.320
So therefore it's obvious that it's noncontroversial,
right.

324
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.540
The truce even it is unpleasant,
should be lot to this poker.

325
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.570
Right?
Uh,
what is more problematic?
Uh,

326
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.280
should we are low to people to speak falsehood.

327
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.950
I mean,
we know right,
that the Holocaust existed,
right?

328
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.870
Should Vlo uh,

329
00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.910
those crazy people to tell us against all this strong evidence what we have then

330
00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:52.960
there was no holocaust.
He argues,
yes,

331
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:57.961
we should because this is the only day how they can find out the error if we

332
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:01.870
talk about this.
So very controversial argument.
As I said,

333
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.490
there are many countries in this word bitch do subscribe to it.
Right?

334
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.710
Um,
so,
and he said they have to listen to both sides.

335
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.800
That's the only way how we find out what truth is and tyranny by the majority.

336
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.070
Well,
this is very,
very important.
Our humanity,
right?

337
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.180
<v 1>Uh,
uh,</v>

338
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.103
<v 0>namely.</v>

339
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.833
<v 1>Okay.</v>

340
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.840
<v 0>One of the main major evils of a mass democratic society is a tyranny of the</v>

341
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:39.101
majority.

342
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:44.101
That will be a very strong tendency to suppress dissent and to conformity with

343
00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:49.940
the majority views.
And he said,
well,

344
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.750
<v 1>uh,
uh,</v>

345
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:57.460
<v 0>we have to try to resist it and we have to emphasize individuality.</v>

346
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.023
<v 1>Uh,</v>

347
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.320
<v 0>go on a forum is,
is more or oppression,
right?</v>

348
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.770
There's a lot of pressure on you to conform,
uh,

349
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.680
be the major,
the main stream as such.
And he said,

350
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.800
this is one of the big evs what we have to resist and we have to defend the

351
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:21.700
individual liberties,
right?
And we have to,
uh,

352
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.990
fight against intervention,
legal or not legal intervention,

353
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.070
right?
He did not live in a mass communication.
So Sadie,

354
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.170
but he would have been outraged,
you know,

355
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:38.060
how the media tries to brain wash people and write and put it into a,

356
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:41.160
conform his behavior on people,
right?
Uh,

357
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.180
he wanted the fen people's individual choices of life size and sexual

358
00:24:46.461 --> 00:24:51.460
preferences and whatever you name,
you know,
it has to be defended a,

359
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.390
and this is very important,
right?
This is uh,
uh,
a clear extension,

360
00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.110
very clearly argued.
Adam Smith did,

361
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.400
did basically agree with this,
but he did not look at sure strongly.

362
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.230
And so clearly,
therefore,

363
00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:11.231
intervention by a government is only permissible if injury has been taken place,

364
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.000
right?
Brace.
Uh,

365
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:19.060
the government cannot limit individual liberties only if that causes injury.

366
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.980
And he said,
look,
believe me,
I'm not indifferent.

367
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.110
I am for compassion.

368
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.750
All of that guy I am asking you is stolen guns,

369
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.880
respect other people's choices,
right?
No,
Theo compassion,

370
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.940
but don't try to make decisions for others.

371
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.180
Don't impose your will on others.
That's,

372
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.150
I think that and conformity,
right?

373
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.670
He is really this slide conformity.

374
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.390
It's essentially ahead of his son.

375
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.850
This becomes a very big issue in the 1960s and seventies,

376
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:57.800
that conformism is an evil and he already writes about this.

377
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:58.700
Um,

378
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.700
in the mid 19th century ended well,

379
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.730
interference can be only have,

380
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.630
the only justification is self protection,
right?

381
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.150
<v 1>Uh,
uh,</v>

382
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:21.400
<v 0>now this is very much in line of,
of hops argument.
Um,</v>

383
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.170
and therefore he said,
right,
I'm not for indifference,

384
00:26:25.171 --> 00:26:28.380
but I am for permissiveness,
for tolerances.
Sorry.

385
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.330
<v 1>Um,
uh,</v>

386
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.410
<v 0>well of you should help each other and,</v>

387
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.440
but there's different than to impose our will or our taste or our preferences on

388
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:44.750
other people,
right?
Uh,
uh,

389
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.990
neither [inaudible] person nor any number of person is warranted the insane to

390
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:53.930
other human creatures of Rye peers.
That's different with children,

391
00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:59.220
um,
that he shell and not to do it his life for his own benefit,

392
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.040
but he chooses to do with it right now.

393
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:05.540
A very strong argument and very troubling.
You know,
it's a,

394
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.600
what do you think about drug use,
right?
A bell.

395
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.460
If a John Stuart mill air,
he errs on the libertarian side,

396
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.940
he probably would be arguing for the decriminalization of most of the drugs.

397
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.620
Um,
uh,
on these ground,
you know,

398
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:26.040
this people's choice if they know that they heard the life.

399
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.930
This is that story now,

400
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.490
a very briefly and his views on,
on the man,

401
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.390
and I don't have to introduce you to the background,
you know,

402
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:40.590
that it mid 19th century,
uh,
women did not have equal rights.

403
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.410
Even not in England,
not in the United States.

404
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.410
They not only did not have the right to vote,
uh,

405
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.540
but they actually did not have the right to own property as such.

406
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.820
Um,
uh,
well,
uh,
as I mentioned how the,
uh,

407
00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.180
Taylor,
um,
uh,

408
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:02.790
his lover and viper was a radical feminist as far as we know,

409
00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:04.700
an extremely smart woman.
Uh,

410
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.110
she was more that he called and smiths because she actually,
so I pointed out,

411
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.460
um,
uh,
oppose even,
uh,
the institution of marriage.

412
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.410
So what are the major teams in this book?
The first point is,

413
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.690
um,
marriage is the only remaining case of slavery.

414
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.670
Uh,
well it's not true.
Of course,

415
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:31.671
leave already has as it existed as fat and unfortunately the factors still exist

416
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.060
around the world.
But he said,
you know,
uh,
the subject,

417
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.890
subjugation of women is a case of slavery and it cannot be explained by the

418
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:43.470
nature of women.
And he makes a case for it.

419
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:49.030
And he aren't used for legal equality and marriage and equality of women in

420
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:54.411
politics and education and all the mixer case for marital friendship.

421
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.140
So,
um,
and you said managers,

422
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:02.080
the only remaining example of slavery,
uh,

423
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.900
because they cannot own property,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
in fact,
uh,

424
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.580
uh,
their husbands can use them for sexual desires.

425
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.910
So in this sense it is even worse than slavery.

426
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.180
At least the sleeves are not expected,
right?

427
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.340
To love their slave owners.
Uh,

428
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.360
the vives I'd expected to love their husbands.

429
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.580
So he said this is even worse than slavery.
Right?
Uh,

430
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.310
and here he kind of elaborates on this issue,
right?
Uh,
at this,
uh,

431
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.230
uh,
not simply the obedience what man wants,

432
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:45.070
but also that they're lava.
And usually,
you know,

433
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.630
these relationships very early in the 19th century,

434
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.230
and in many cases,
even in the 21st century,

435
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.810
asymmetric.
All right.

436
00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.920
A man probably does not feel as much obliged to express love towards the vives

437
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.080
than they expect that of wives to express loft overdone.
That.
Right?
Well,

438
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.870
unfortunately,
I think that our steel meant like this.
Okay.

439
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.460
Um,
so that's,
uh,
uh,
I think a very provocative,

440
00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:20.050
very important statements written in the mid 19th century now.

441
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:24.160
And then he said,
this cannot be explained by the nature of women.

442
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:29.590
Uh,
uh,
he expects you counter argument,
well,
different,
you know,

443
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.850
the rule and argument.
We men are different.
They want to knit,
you know,

444
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:38.740
they want to be subjugated.
He said no,
there are two counter arguments.

445
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.270
One is that we don't know about the nature of the MNR,
right?

446
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.460
Because they did not have a chance for self development.
Right?
And then he said,

447
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.730
in order to justify women step be mation,

448
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.260
you should be able to show that no woman would ever capable to occupy a certain

449
00:30:56.261 --> 00:31:00.790
position.
So political authority,
if that were the man who did that,

450
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.760
then it cannot come from the nature women.
Right.

451
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.600
That's a neat argument.
Uh,

452
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:13.420
well he is the citation,
you know,
um,

453
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.580
how would we know,
right?
What the nature of the women is.
All right.
Um,

454
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.700
uh,
therefore this is an invalid argument.

455
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.550
He argues for the equality,
equality for marriage,
and that's,
do they,

456
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.940
it's a kind of common sensical,
Eh,

457
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:34.020
it doesn't need any further elaboration and equality of women in politics and

458
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:39.450
education and jobs.
This is still a very important,
and that is summer.
Uh,

459
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:44.250
the president of Harvard grab has not rat he John Stewart and you're carefully

460
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.760
enough.
Then he said,
right,
that's women and just not good enough,

461
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:50.590
right to do engineering.
Right.

462
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.970
He should have read John Stuart Mill and he should have known that there is

463
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:59.860
nothing in the nature of the men by they would not do as well in engineering

464
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:04.420
guys.
Man would,
uh,
sort of,
um,
and you know,
you know,

465
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.480
we still need some attention to diversity means diversity in order to make sure

466
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:13.750
that women do end up in political and other jobs.

467
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.830
And then he makes a case for marital friendship.
He said,
well,

468
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.980
I still believe in marriage because marriage can be based on equality of

469
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:25.570
partners.
So this is John Stuart Mill.

470
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.160
I hope you enjoy him.
I think he is a,

471
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.110
a controversial person,
pushes his point as far as as it can,

472
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.300
but I think is a very smart,
smart person.
Um,

473
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.790
so let me just,
uh,
uh,
I have,
uh,

474
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.200
two half more minutes to go and look at the questions and make a few comments.

475
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.700
How I would try to,
um,
uh,

476
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.240
myself deal via,
uh,
uh,
these,
uh,
uh,

477
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.500
questions in answering if I were in your shoes.

478
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.370
<v 1>Uh,
okay.</v>

479
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.930
<v 0>And here we go.</v>

480
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:12.963
<v 1>Huh?</v>

481
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.470
<v 0>Let me see how far I can go.
Okay.
Uh,
so,</v>

482
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.980
uh,
uh,
fresh out number one,

483
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.320
the first point,

484
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:29.330
what I would try to make here is that are people who read hops as believing that

485
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:34.220
humans are easier by nature.

486
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.990
This is not unreasonable after all vie owners.

487
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:43.040
You need la vie aton unless there is something wrong with us.

488
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.810
A while can also save l a walk,

489
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:52.560
which a lot of emphasis how rational the R and a state of nature and it will

490
00:33:52.561 --> 00:33:57.530
show is explicit about his noble savage idea,
right?
It is society.

491
00:33:57.531 --> 00:34:02.180
Which workshops have you all come out perfect from the hands of the Creator and

492
00:34:02.181 --> 00:34:04.340
then Sasha screws us.

493
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:08.860
So that does seem to be really an argument here.
Uh,
uh,
well,

494
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.080
would I tried to say to [inaudible] that that is a controversy fell.

495
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:19.430
I may try to qualify it in a sentence or two.
That's all of course hops.

496
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:23.880
Good be ad in a more complex way.
Uh,
because,
uh,

497
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:25.850
um,
uh,

498
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:30.850
after it all harps also believes that we are making rational decisions,

499
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:31.790
um,

500
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:36.790
van VR sort of edge adjudicating between our desires and our fears and the come

501
00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:42.200
to a rational decision about this.
Um,
uh,

502
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.830
therefore it's not that obvious that this is maybe about,

503
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:50.831
I would say this is a qualification that is still one can see a controversy bell

504
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.900
who saw,
yes,
he states that Vr,
um,
uh,

505
00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.010
uh,
uh,
you know,
come off perfect from the hands of God,

506
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:04.820
but off the road in the state of nature,
we are savages,
right?

507
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:10.290
Um,
and therefore we need to some General Ville,
right?

508
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.670
To overrule our judgment.

509
00:35:11.671 --> 00:35:16.671
So that is some qualification how much they to Zahra Jacques had in us,

510
00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.700
right?
[inaudible] had a bit suspicious of us.
So on,

511
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.180
these are the kinds of footnotes,
you know,
qualifications to the argument.

512
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:30.550
But then I would love if I,
what I will do,
I will say,
well,

513
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:36.430
I am a bit too romantic but to think about it because I do know that people can

514
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:41.130
be White Eliel right?

515
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.940
And therefore we do need more law and order.
Right.

516
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.320
We know need some intervention.
On the other hand,

517
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.830
I think I am probably more inclined,

518
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:58.250
I have to air to air on the side of Rousseau or John Stuart Mill.

519
00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.750
Don't believe that people are after row after row.
Um,

520
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.100
and uh,
uh,

521
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:10.250
VL act out of good veal and therefore I would like to see less of central

522
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:17.010
planners telling me,
but I should be doing and what my needs are.

523
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.280
And I would better live in a society where individuals can decide and make the,

524
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.860
make the have three choices.
That would be my line.

525
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:30.630
But you could argue the other way around.
Right?
Tell us what your view is.

526
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.680
Anyway,
that's the way how I view the,
the,
this Gresh

527
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.130
that's I think quite clear.
Uh,
hops.

528
00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:45.900
Bill believed in a strong and clearly identifiable silver and easy to support it

529
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:46.734
to be taxed.

530
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.600
I think this is uncontroversial and it's also quite clear that block wanted to

531
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:54.990
limit the power of the executive.

532
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.840
That's why he was to separate the executive right from the legislative.

533
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.890
So I did that.
And comparing them is,
is now pretty controversial.

534
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:07.800
You don't have to have many qualifications.
Do this right?

535
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.110
That's my straight forward now.

536
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:14.880
And what do you think right now?
What is your view on this?

537
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.650
Uh,
uh,
and you may say,
well,
uh,
hops has got a lot to say.

538
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.270
Think about the
September 11,
nine,
11.

539
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:29.250
Right now you need a strong government,
right?
If you need security,

540
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.143
right?

541
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:35.280
We just cannot push too far for equality or you can't take the opposite
argument.

542
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.180
He said,
well I think all that happened after nine 11 was wrong.

543
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.570
We should not have limited,
you know,
individual liberties.

544
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.470
That's the American today that you send by Liberty.
Anyway,

545
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.780
I'm sure people are divided on this and I would like to hear your views on this.

546
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.500
That's a hard question to answer.
Uh,

547
00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:00.480
in fact it is also a question who is a methodological individualist and

548
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:04.380
collectivist?
I would say a metal Dorjee got collectivist,

549
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.680
argues that there is stuff which is more than the sum total of individual Monty

550
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.430
skews.
Emphasis on law is a very good one,
right?

551
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.540
That the law,
you cannot explain the law by looking at,
at each individual and,

552
00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:20.880
and the top.
And that's the law.

553
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:24.150
The law is there and then it enters the individuals,
right?

554
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.550
So there is a collective conscience.

555
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.560
Bish precedes the individual and enters the individuals and others like hearts

556
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:35.100
or lock,
I'll use the other way.
No,
they have to start with the individual.

557
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.300
The only thing,
but we can observe,
right,

558
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.540
is the individual action and desires and bill and then we can arrive at the call

559
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:45.870
activity,
right?
Well,

560
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.690
I'm not so sure whether you are the methodological individualists store now,

561
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:53.890
but you can actually make a case whether you really think,

562
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.220
whether the right way is to think about the individual's action and individuals

563
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.320
rather about the collective good,
right?

564
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.730
Which comes from something somewhere else.
More historic trolley.
Uh,

565
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:14.200
uh,
those,
those general veal make a strong case for it.
Easy to make,
right?

566
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.230
That is obviously something what is necessary for a gender role bill.

567
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:23.890
Uh,
you want to believe,
for instance,
um,

568
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.960
and uh,
uh,
universal,
uh,
house care and to say,

569
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.840
well,
it's,

570
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:34.690
this should not be let to individuals to decide whether they take out the house

571
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:39.460
insurance or not.
Everybody should be insured,
right?
It's easy to see,

572
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.990
right?
Let's not fool us around,
right?
We need and a general bill.

573
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:48.760
So I think an argument can be made.
Um,
but then you can use,

574
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.320
uh,
uh,
uh,

575
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.430
a law or Montesquieu or meal or whomever to say,

576
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.240
well that is troubled with this argument of Arrow on ers.
The genital,

577
00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:02.750
the is coming from a life,
you know,
methodological individual.

578
00:40:02.751 --> 00:40:06.520
It's usually that save.
What about methodological collectivist there?

579
00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:09.310
Do you know what it is right there?
Does it come from?

580
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:13.630
If it is not in any individual consciousness,
right?

581
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.490
So there,
you know,
how,
how do government know?
What is my need?

582
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.710
Did they get a letter telling them what my needs are and overrule my decision

583
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:26.350
because I think this is my need and my preference,
right?

584
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.410
So that can be devastating.
And you can say,
well,

585
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:33.910
this opens up the door to totalitarianism,
right?
That's why you know,

586
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:36.910
Karl Marx loved Raj.
Aclu saw so much.

587
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.140
That's why learning loved John Jacques Rousseau so much because they want that

588
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:45.730
to have the central planners,
which tell you this is your need.
You don't,

589
00:40:45.731 --> 00:40:47.860
you know,
all your,
you'll short term needs.

590
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:52.300
I know you long term needs and therefore you have to do what I tell you you to

591
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:55.390
do.
Right?
And it also does that,
right?

592
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:59.710
He said you have to be forced to be three,
right?

593
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.320
I can't let you two just to be free.

594
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.910
I have to tell you what you real freedom is what your real needs are and you can

595
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:11.210
be critical about this.
So you see,
you can make the point in both direction.

596
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.970
I think most are respectable positions.
Now,

597
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.800
Adam Smith's or pseudo self interests,
you achieved the common goods.

598
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.720
Many of you believe in this,
right?
Uh,

599
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.900
that's half three unregulated markets and there it will be ended up did the

600
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:31.930
collective good.
Uh,
but you know,

601
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.340
it was so beliefs in the General Ville,

602
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.450
which is more than the sum total of individuals.
Yeah,

603
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.830
you can contrast it so that it's similar to the previous question,
right?
Uh,

604
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.400
and you can make a case,
you know,
why you think Adam's Mrs,
right?

605
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.650
Uh,
you know,
very,
very nervous.
You'll be able to figure it out.

606
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:56.780
But these are,
unless people decide for themselves or you can say,
well,

607
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:01.760
Adam Smith's is not living in the real world because he assumes,

608
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:02.603
right,

609
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
perfect at self regulating markets and perfect in formations and none of those

610
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:12.410
exist.
So in Indonesia over that I'm Smith's does not,
does not apply.

611
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:16.710
And in the real world,
he actually,
uh,
John Jacques Rousseau,

612
00:42:16.711 --> 00:42:19.820
it makes much more sense.
Now again,

613
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:24.230
you'll call how you make your decision about this.
Um,
you know,

614
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:28.850
strong government buy hops and Smith's Sir is uh,
uh,

615
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:34.160
about invisible hand as little government as possible.
Again,

616
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:36.200
I don't think I have to have that,
but eight on this,

617
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:38.000
you can see the line of argument,

618
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.510
easy to show that hops in beach suit for strong government.

619
00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:46.070
You have the citation Adam Smith for the invisible hand.

620
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.280
You can add the footnote that is a controversy about this.

621
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.520
But most people today in the 21st century interpreted them smiths as the person

622
00:42:56.901 --> 00:43:00.800
of invisible hand and small government.
And then you can say,
what is your view?

623
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.750
And again,
I think this class must be,
we have split 50,
50%.

624
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.650
Some people still believe,
you know,
Ronald Regan,

625
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:12.740
the government is not the solution.
The government is the problem.

626
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:17.960
Other people believe in,
you know,
uh,
Liberal Democrats and you're saying,

627
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.800
no,
no,
no.
We need big government.
And just see what happened.

628
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:27.040
Now in the global financial crises then there was not enough government and was

629
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:29.210
too much deregulation.

630
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.920
We need regulation and just see about George W.
Bush did,
right?

631
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:38.360
He bailed out from taxpayers money.
Anyway,
you see the point,
right?

632
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.160
What you can do,
you can argue it both ways.
Well,

633
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.110
the agenda issue.
Ah,
AH,
wow.
Hard to defend Russo,
right?

634
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.240
Uh,
he really sucks

635
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:57.800
that lead team carefully.
I gave you the citations.

636
00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.760
He said,
well,
uh,

637
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.570
he's foreshadows the idea of distinction between sex and gender.
He says,

638
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.580
well,
can see he's a sophisticated feminist.

639
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.550
He said the man should not look like man.

640
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:14.750
They have equally humans.
They have same human rights,

641
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.470
but it would be wrong for the men to dress like Matt,
right?

642
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.130
What's wrong about a woman being feminine?

643
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.430
There are some contemporary feminist who are you this way?

644
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.940
So don't dismiss him too easy.
Well meal,

645
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
I don't think needs to much of the fence for four,
five minutes though.

646
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.090
I could offer some criticism,
feminists,
criticism of him.

647
00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:41.190
Now I'll bill it was a utilitarian,
um,
uh,

648
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.700
well what is his difference between Adam Smith's?
Uh,

649
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.110
well this is a hard question to ask.
That is not that much difference,

650
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:53.100
but as I was trying to point out in the lecture today,
that is a difference,

651
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:53.934
right?
Uh,

652
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
John Stuart Mill is much more conscious about preferences and the qualitative

653
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:03.120
differences we attached to different utilities.

654
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.980
The idea is not something,
but Adam Smith's would both school,

655
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.520
but certainly an idea which has not been as elaborately developed in Adam

656
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.020
Smith's than it was in John Stewart mill.
Uh,

657
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.920
this is very easy,
right?
Again,
harps,

658
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.980
arguing for security and the meal or lock arguing for freedom.

659
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.690
Uh,
you can make the case.
We have done it in earlier,
uh,
uh,

660
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:37.040
questions.
Uh,
um,
and you can tell,
tell loss.

661
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:41.220
What do you think again,
I think the room VOB split bill,

662
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:45.840
you want to allow people to carry guns?
Some people think yes.

663
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.740
What individual?
The other of you say,
this is crazy.

664
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:53.700
Most countries in the world who don't tell all week and just see these nuts,

665
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:57.780
right?
Keep mess murdering people in schools.
Of course they do.

666
00:45:57.781 --> 00:46:02.490
If they can carry guns and nine 11,
right?
Thor?
Sure.

667
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.830
Uh,
this listening to people's telephone conversations,
some people will,

668
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.600
they'll say,
oh,
well,
we are living in a dangerous world.

669
00:46:09.601 --> 00:46:14.250
We should their load the CIA to do that,
right?
Honestly will say,
no,
no,
no.

670
00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.830
Individually,
liberty are sacrosanct.
Right?

671
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:21.270
And this is what I would like to hear from you.
Okay.
Have Fun.

672
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:23.430
And Bees do enjoy it,
right?

673
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.990
It's not regurgitating this exercises about thinking.
