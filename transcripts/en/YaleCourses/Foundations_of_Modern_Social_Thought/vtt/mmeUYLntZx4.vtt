1
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.140
Marks is cited that once he said,

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.390
I am not a Marxist.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.710
And I think there's a lot of truth to it and the reason why I got the on and on

4
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:22.011
and on with marks in the scores because my experience is that,

5
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.470
uh,

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.470
many of us do have a very simplistic stereotypes in our mind who caused Marx was

7
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.500
and what his theory is all about.
Well,
he was,

8
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:40.980
uh,
a creative scholar,
um,
uh,

9
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:45.981
vibrant mind was ready to change his mind when they're confronted with new

10
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.620
arguments or confronted with new evidence.
And there were many,

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.820
many facets,

12
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.050
many faces of Karl Marx of you have seen some of those,

13
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.770
right?
We have seen march starting as a hey and idealist,

14
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.760
um,
being obsessed with the idea of alienation,

15
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.910
disappointed with eagles,
a fluffy idea of alienation,

16
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.740
uh,
bringing,
get closer to home,
bringing it more down to earth,

17
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.730
making probably some reductionist mistake in the process.

18
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.740
Then abandoning yet,
um,

19
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.850
and turning into a materialist,

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.780
a somewhat hesitantly and reluctantly,
uh,

21
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.691
van,
he starts,

22
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:41.691
his turn door was historical materialism in the thesis on fire.

23
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:46.710
But he also says the point is to change the world,

24
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.330
uh,

25
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.330
through s is a practical question we seen six months in the German ideology.

26
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.110
He is a positive is social science.

27
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.670
I had a point where we start with are really individual and a real actual social

28
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:06.240
circumstances.

29
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.740
He offers testable hypotheses.

30
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.420
To put it this way,

31
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:17.421
in modern social science language and the Assamese he remains a positive is

32
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:20.970
social scientist,
uh,

33
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.970
in four in his major varix.

34
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.900
So he was changing his mind and indeed he was less doctrinaire than usual.

35
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:35.160
The Marxists Star and easy to be less doctrinaire right.

36
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.030
If you are one of the person who created the doctrine,

37
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.700
uh,
do they Viv,

38
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:46.230
we'll be talking about von important component of Marx theory.

39
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.120
His theory of history,

40
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.880
and this is also contradictory full the tensions and contradictions,

41
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.770
but it is a formidable body of propositions.
Absolutely.

42
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.870
Uh,
that is actually not a single to Uris.

43
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.450
I can recall who live.

44
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:12.451
Karl Marx not only has a very specific set of ideas in what stages,

45
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.770
who won human evolution from the very elementary societies to the most complex

46
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:25.180
one evolved.
There are many who offered typologies of like this.

47
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.370
We have seen in Montesquieu,
we have seen in uh,

48
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.640
Adam Smith.
There were many who did that.

49
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.290
But what is unique about marks that he has a genuine,

50
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.230
he really have a history.

51
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.980
He has a very powerful argument.

52
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.790
What is the exact cause or mechanism,

53
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.270
which links the transition from one form of society to another one?

54
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.270
What drives historical evolution?

55
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.390
Mark's is genuinely the Darwin of social scientists in this respect.

56
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.470
But Darwin could do with the evolution of species Mark's was capable to do in

57
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.750
the theory of history.
It's a genuine theory,

58
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.643
right?

59
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.660
A clearly when you have an idea what are really the cause or mechanism that

60
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:28.831
links cost to an effect and Mark's has such a theory,

61
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.540
maybe you'll see,
um,
then we will be discussing,
uh,
uh,

62
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.480
vapor,
uh,

63
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.540
whom I admire a great deal that we have really does not have a such a theory and

64
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:46.420
as far as I can,
nobody else does.

65
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.050
They're the only downside of marsh theory of history is that history proof to

66
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.970
win,
to be wrong?
Well,
uh,

67
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.140
theories are not necessarily to be supported by the facts.

68
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.330
Theories are there,
you know,

69
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:08.530
to have it tight enough proposition and to be tested.

70
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.100
But what exactly the theory is the will vary in Mark's own writings and there

71
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:20.581
are some versions of this theory which fit better the empirical reality than the

72
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.200
original Vaughn and the,

73
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.360
which became kind of carved into stone in the literature on marks.

74
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.680
And this is why I do a little comparison between the German ideology.

75
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.450
We touched upon the German ideology or ready and uh,

76
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.880
and other manuscript that he also left incomplete and unfinished.

77
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.610
He was working on it at 1857 and 58 and was never translated the title into

78
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.193
English.

79
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.800
The overs referred it to grow and reset the air at the end.

80
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.940
The sounds right.
A English speaker like to call it grown dress.

81
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.860
No,
it is grown.
The reset and grown.
This means a sketch,

82
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.070
an outline and that's what it is.

83
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.680
1000 Pages,

84
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.830
handwritten pages written at an a big hairy between 57 and 58 like the earlier

85
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.100
attempts to ride the big book,
the Paris manuscript.

86
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.090
And the German ideology.
When it approached him,

87
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:42.410
Mark's approaches the end of his style,
he argued,
um,

88
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.570
theory.
He said,
my goodness gracious,
I got it all wrong.

89
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.370
I have to start it all over again and he will start all over again,

90
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:56.390
just in 10 years time.
And if your ride oscopy Tara,

91
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.680
did he get it wrong in the ground risk?

92
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.520
That's what ivy or tried to post today.

93
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.540
And I was merciful enough that I did not ask you to read too much from the

94
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:15.860
groom.
This what you read has been published.
Uh,

95
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.960
um,
uh,
as a separate little book under the title,

96
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.033
uh,

97
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.020
a capitalist economic formations.

98
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.800
And this is probably the most accessible text in the whole 1000 pages.

99
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.190
It was put together and translated by the wonderful British social historian

100
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.720
Eric hops about fortunately is still with us.

101
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:47.960
He's 91 years old and thanks God,

102
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.050
he's strong and he's still traveling if you pay him business class.

103
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.230
But we could get him to this,
uh,

104
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.570
class if year would be willing to pay business class ticket,

105
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.380
but year would not do it anyway.
Uh,
he's sharp.
Good.

106
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.500
And he was the major social historian of the 20th century in Britain.

107
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.580
Not a trivial matter because the best social history was in Britain in the 20th

108
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:20.420
century.
Anyway,

109
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.650
he translated it and you read his translation was difficult.

110
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.220
Yes,
but try the rest of the groom that his son Daniel,

111
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:32.830
you'll see how easy this text is.
Okay.
Uh,

112
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.850
and the point,

113
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.860
what I'm trying to make today is to show what a fundamental shift that is in

114
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:43.310
mark thinking from the German ideology to the grinders.

115
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:49.030
So we will start with the initial formulation in the ground risk.

116
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.410
How he beginning through conceiver of what a historical evolution is.

117
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.230
And this is something we did covers like can rush through all of it very
quickly.

118
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.281
Right?

119
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:07.281
The idea is what he introduced this for the first time in the German ideology.

120
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:09.180
Um,

121
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.890
1845 is the concept of the mode of production.

122
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.810
And you already have seen this citation,
right?

123
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.370
Man can distinguish from animals by consciousness,

124
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.190
by religion or anything you like.

125
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.800
They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals.

126
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.440
As soon as they begin to produce,

127
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.830
as soon as they begin to change the world to feed their human needs.

128
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.410
Uh,
that is the fundamental insight.

129
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.260
And you may dismiss it,
but you know,

130
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:49.800
that's clearly a very serious proposition,
right?

131
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.220
That if you look at history over time,

132
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.000
you will become very interested how these people survived.

133
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.110
What did they eat?
How did they produce what they did eat?

134
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.210
What kind of housing did they live it,
how they did build that housing,
right?

135
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.180
How they did move around?
Did they invent the wheel?
Uh,
the,

136
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.800
they already know the wheel,
right?
These other questions you have,

137
00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:19.230
you'll be asking when you are studying the society,
uh,
did they,

138
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.610
could they lit a fire or they couldn't?
Right?

139
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.960
So you were interested in this stuff.
How did they kill the deer?
All right.

140
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.810
What kind of veterans?
They had a,

141
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:35.550
what kind of instruments they used when they planted their plants,
right?

142
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:40.440
These are obvious questions to ask.
And he said,
that's it.
That's what we want to,

143
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.830
to see.
And he said,
uh,

144
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.860
this mode of production must be calling on sit and not simply as reproduction.

145
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.220
Right?
And I think this is a very powerful argument.

146
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:55.170
What he makes it here.
All right?

147
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.820
This is a definite mood of life,
right?
What,

148
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.100
what arms such when,
not when I'm suggesting mode of production,

149
00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:07.110
I'm not narrowly focusing on the economy.

150
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.500
I am basically talking about differences in ways of life and different ways of

151
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:15.650
life as he asked.
Where puts it there.

152
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.710
First you have to drink and eat and five shelter and once you are not hungry and

153
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.170
hunger and you are not that when it is raining,

154
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:28.250
then you start thinking right?
Um,

155
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.620
but first you have to feel your stomach right and make sure that you are safe

156
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:37.800
from the rain fall.
That's reasonable argument.

157
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:39.803
Uh,

158
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.860
now there are some very important key differences,
uh,

159
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.930
as we proceed from the German ideology to on the ground research,

160
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.440
uh,
well in the German ideology.

161
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.300
And there's one important difference histories driven by increasing division of

162
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:01.870
Labor.
And I pointed to this in the earlier lecture here,

163
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.450
he throws directly on Adam Smith's.

164
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.500
He basically takes it over from Adam Smith's.

165
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.130
That's what Adam Smith's death in the glue and is.
On the other hand,

166
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.410
he sees a movement,
a gradual movement over history,

167
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.640
towards private ownership.
That's what drives the story,

168
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.510
a gradual separation of the laboring subject and objective conditions of the

169
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.653
vernacular.

170
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.970
That's how he describes now human history and doing so separation of laboring

171
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:40.561
subject and the objective conditions of labor and enables him in the ground risk

172
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.530
to bring back the notion of alienation.

173
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.780
He already seemed to have forgotten and put it on shelf then Helio,

174
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.850
forget it again.
But for this piece of work,

175
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.240
the idea of alienation reinterpreted as the making of private ownership and the

176
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:03.160
separation of work and end the objective conditions of work,
uh,

177
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.620
is very crucial.
Very important.

178
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.050
There is another big difference in the German ideology.

179
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.530
Marx has a uni linear view of history,

180
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.810
a very deterministic uni linear view of history and this is what you come back

181
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:25.231
in later and marks and that's dominate a Marxist of various kinds.

182
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.730
UNILINEAR means right?

183
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:32.790
That you also Saudi start at the same starting point tribal society.

184
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.940
They all process progress through slavery,

185
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:42.150
few dollars and capitalism with the assumption that they all will end up in

186
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:47.230
communism.
But this is a kind of view unilinear stage.

187
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Every society will have to go through of these stages and that is a necessity.

188
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:57.220
That one moves from an earlier stage to a later stage.

189
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.960
And as I said,
he will show the causal mechanism or how it is happening.

190
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.210
The grown Risa is different.

191
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:10.380
This is a massive description of human history and Marty linear trajectory and

192
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:15.190
ivy or show you what is Marty linear trajectory is.

193
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.760
And the beauty of shifting from this union linear trajectory to the Marty linear

194
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:25.090
trajectory is that though Mark's message,

195
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.790
completely the logic of argument up,

196
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.660
but he produces after your rec at the core proposition.

197
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.470
But you can see it fits already in his stamp,

198
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.500
the historical development very well and would argue by Accenture now and I will

199
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:45.160
extend his argument is even fits better later.

200
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:48.520
Historical evolution.
Okay.

201
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.580
Let's return now to the German ideology briefly and the sensuality of division

202
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:59.340
of Labor in this very,
uh,
well,
uh,

203
00:14:59.341 --> 00:15:01.770
Maurice described,
right?
Uh,

204
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.910
and Waldorf production between the dialectical interaction between what he saw,

205
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:14.160
he called forces off reduction and forces of production means basically the

206
00:15:15.241 --> 00:15:20.241
technology room anteriors the labor power and eventually he invents the term

207
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.700
relations of production.
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

208
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.740
he identifies this big property relations in the later work,

209
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.780
but it,
he tends to use the word,
um,
uh,

210
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.490
intercourse or division of Labor in the German ideology.

211
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.640
A now dialectical interaction.
Uh,
what on earth.

212
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.260
These are the means.

213
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.710
I think I also mentioned once that marks in our letter to angles once wrote,

214
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.680
you know what,

215
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.270
I don't understand something then I say it is dialectical.

216
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.350
So it,

217
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.520
the idea of dialectics was not much clearer to Karl Marx than it is to you.

218
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:18.170
Right?
Um,
but dialectics basically man's right,

219
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:22.070
an interactive relationship.
Uh,
I,
you know,

220
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:25.760
in today's social science language we would say,

221
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:30.620
right then there is the causal Arrow boy Indian bowls phase,

222
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.090
right?
It's not simply that relations of production that are mine,

223
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:40.091
relations of production that certain relations of production can blog block the

224
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:45.140
development of forces of production.
And when they change,

225
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.350
the new relations of production can unleash the development of the forces of

226
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:53.450
production.
So that is the dialectics,
right?

227
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.810
That the causal Arrow there is not simple that imagination pointing from one to

228
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:03.530
the other,
but there is a feedback loop,
right?
Um,
uh,

229
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.560
that would be I think the modern social science language,
uh,

230
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.830
to put this one.
Um,

231
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:17.360
as I said that I had in the initial formulation here really thinks this is the

232
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:22.070
division of labor rather than property relationships.
And,

233
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.040
uh,
I think the,
uh,
have seen it reveal,
uh,

234
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.250
this comes straight out of Adam Smith's.
Uh,
what you have read,
right?

235
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.150
The relations of different nations among themselves depends,
uh,

236
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.180
to which each has developed these productive forces,

237
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.410
the division of labor and the internal intercourse.

238
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:45.560
So that's exactly right.
What Adam Smith said,

239
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.580
hunting and gathering societies,
grazing socialities,
agriculture societies,

240
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.200
commercial societies,

241
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.400
they all correspond to different levels of division of labor.

242
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:01.670
And that's what marks initially tries to do in the German ideology.

243
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.830
And,
uh,

244
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.810
he deals with the question of the,
uh,
property relations,

245
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:13.950
but he said,
look,
uh,
property relations also change.

246
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.100
But this changing property relations are simply the outcomes of the increased

247
00:18:19.671 --> 00:18:20.730
division of labor.

248
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.110
So it's basically debtor manned by the division of Labor.

249
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.220
If I understand the level of division of Labor Ivy law understand wrapper,

250
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.330
the relationships as well.
Bell sounds actually quite reasonable.

251
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.950
And these sections of the German ideology,
by the way,

252
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.940
were rediscovered by Marxists in the 1950s,

253
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.680
especially marches to were living,
uh,
in,
uh,
uh,
uh,

254
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.340
the Soviet Empire.
There was,
um,
uh,

255
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:55.020
a formidable,
um,
uh,
a social scientist in Poland.

256
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.820
His name is,
or soft skills and the soft ski in,
uh,

257
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.830
uh,
1957.
Re-Read,
um,

258
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.720
the,
uh,
uh,
German ideology.
And until then,

259
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:11.970
you know what for scribing to stone that,
you know,

260
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.980
Marx's theory suggests that this is a property relations which explain

261
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:21.210
everything.
And this is was what that was the project,
right?

262
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.560
Of Communism.

263
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.120
You eliminate private ownership and everything will be fine,
right?

264
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.810
No private ownership,
these few be rosy,
right?

265
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.830
That will be equality among people,
right?
And dynamic economic growth.

266
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.180
Now the Soviets eliminated private ownership.

267
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.990
Was it then I got Italian society?
No,
it wasn't,

268
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.620
was it a dynamic society?
No,
it wasn't now,

269
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:51.570
or sort of scheme was rereading the German ideology and said,

270
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.690
you did not do any or marks,
right.

271
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.840
Maurice doesn't say it is property relations,

272
00:19:57.841 --> 00:19:59.820
which is school Shabat Division of Labor.

273
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:05.190
So of course the division of Labor exist in a communist society,

274
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.750
just not the appropriate relation,
uh,
division of labor.

275
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.690
And that creates inequalities.
Anyway,

276
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:17.190
that was a very interesting,
get their Beta or soft.

277
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.560
He had a very great reception,
uh,

278
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:25.210
in a vest and social science circles.
Um,

279
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.500
okay.
Anyway,
so this is the initial idea,
right?

280
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:33.501
In the German ideology and then he blows seats as again.

281
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:35.180
We have seen it.
I rushed through of it.

282
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.000
He describes various modes of production this way.
Right.

283
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:43.880
There is the Chai bus society.
Very brief,
native,
uh,

284
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.880
uh,
means of production,
uh,
hunting,
fishing,

285
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:49.714
gathering.

286
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.200
A division of Labor is very elementary and he uses the Sassy sexy storm.

287
00:20:55.841 --> 00:21:00.210
This is only a natural division of labor between man and the man.

288
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.550
The man gather and the man hunts.

289
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.350
We thousand amount are strong and does it,
we know the movie minority,
right?

290
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.470
And therefore this is a natural division of labor.

291
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.110
Well probably you can be forgiven.

292
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.170
I mean he wrote this in 1845 and then he moves on to sleep buddy.

293
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:22.600
He said,
well now,
uh,

294
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.420
the forces of production beginning to develop in a tribal society,
uh,

295
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.660
people just had enough capacity to gather and hunt and fish in our food to

296
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.220
survive and therefore everybody had to go out get.in conducting and fishing.

297
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:45.090
But now we have new technologies which are more productive and therefore it

298
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:48.630
becomes possible that some people say,
well,

299
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.660
I am not going out hunting and Ivl got sleeves and saves fuel.

300
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.970
Do divert for me and Dave,

301
00:21:57.971 --> 00:22:02.340
you'll be able to produce what is necessarily for death survival.

302
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.450
I give them only as much that they do not die from hunger.
I,

303
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.480
he dressed and between [inaudible] and then I just sit at home and I am writing

304
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.910
philosophy.
So ancient philosophies worn right?

305
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:24.250
You'll Plato is sitting at home and thinking and you are writing a drama and

306
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.320
poor [inaudible] and you create hearth.

307
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.080
Because the slave side working the fields,

308
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.380
producing a surplus but can be appropriated from them.

309
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.300
Division of labor increases as technology increased.

310
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.370
Well and as a result,
some change in property relationships.

311
00:22:45.371 --> 00:22:49.190
Right now this is not a communal relationship.
Yeah.

312
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.100
Not Members of the same community,

313
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.060
but a pretty oppressive relationship between slave and slave owner.

314
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.590
Then he goes on and then comes fewer dollars.
And what happens with feudalism?

315
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.720
They all uh,
uh,
what is the problem in the slaves?

316
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.060
The problem with the sleeves,
uh,

317
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:10.120
that they have absolutely no interest in producing.

318
00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:14.650
They were simply physically course to produce.

319
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.990
Therefore they can be pretty negligent in operating the means of instrument.

320
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.630
You have to supervise them.

321
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:28.110
You beat them right to make them work right or you keep killing them.

322
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.450
You know,
if they disobey this trouble,

323
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:36.010
you don't have to conduct wars all the time,
right.
To get new slaves.

324
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.350
Therefore an s technology develops.
You need a labor force,

325
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.680
which is more motivated to work harder.

326
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.960
So slave side being replaced by serves my assets.

327
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.770
And what is the big change?

328
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.330
The big change is that now the peasants who will get a plot,

329
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.850
they can cultivate themselves.

330
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.440
The actual do you have to work only for two or three days or the on the largest

331
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:05.930
state of the feudal Lord.

332
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:11.950
And the rest of the time they can see at home are cultivate the land.

333
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.740
They can build their house,
they can have their family,

334
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.540
they can marry and their children will belong to them rather than to the Lord.

335
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.400
Right?
Big Change,
right?

336
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.260
In classical states of slavery,
the children,

337
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.830
there are no marriage,
no home,
right?
Slaves.

338
00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:33.440
The lifts in barracks,
right?

339
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.220
The institution of family does not exist.
I mean,
you know,

340
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.280
slavery in the south of the United States was not quite classical slaverly in

341
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.720
Greece and Rome or in Egypt,
but had some similarities,
right?

342
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.770
Slave owners certainly had clean,
uh,
on the children,
uh,
of,
um,

343
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.460
uh,
of slaves.
And in many instances,

344
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.810
a marriage was really not really an existing institution,

345
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.150
even in even in 19th century,

346
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.140
us now the surface are very different.
They have their family,

347
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.850
they have their home.
Uh,
they do not have that title of the land.

348
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.803
And the home,

349
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.970
but did they have possession of the land and the home and therefore they have an

350
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:22.320
interest.
If they don't work hard on those two days,
uh,

351
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.880
on the land of the landlords,
they are kicked off their land,
right?

352
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.820
So therefore they didn't have to pay more attention.
That's the idea.

353
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.910
But then he looks at,
you know,
calm peers,
uh,

354
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.400
the doll come Middle Ages in Europe,
right?
The peaks of few dogs.

355
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.440
Uh,
it,
Rome and Greece and Athens.

356
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.120
And he said,
did the division of Labor increase?

357
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.190
He said,
no,
they,
the division of Labor decreased.

358
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.451
I mean,

359
00:25:56.451 --> 00:26:01.451
antiquity that was discovered in renaissance was far superior to the Middle

360
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.710
Ages.
The big cities like Rome,
we were abandoned.

361
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.640
Many of you have early in the room,
even now you see ruins,
right?

362
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.360
The glorious room,
right.

363
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.190
Was left as a grazing land for the sheep,
right?

364
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.290
Those lands,
you know,
they could,
uh,

365
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.080
bring water into your homes,
right?
The grease,

366
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:34.940
they had high levels of technologies.
They have highly developed industries.

367
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.090
This was all forgotten in the Middle Ages,
right?

368
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.230
So what the middle is the Middle Ages.
Some people said this was a step back.

369
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:47.370
What historic colleague,
alright,
inquisition,

370
00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:51.090
the Darth middle age is the decay of the cities.

371
00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:55.800
It's a better step backward now.
Maurice doesn't know what to do with it,
right?

372
00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.060
And there's our shed pointed out,
he abandons the manuscript here.

373
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.520
He said,
well,
the theory doesn't work.

374
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.740
I cannot explain this or increasing division of labor.

375
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.220
Uh,
then of course would be the forest small should be capitalism.

376
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.600
And as he's beginning to develop the form of capitalism,

377
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.770
he beginning to develop now,
uh,

378
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.420
the notion of relations of production,

379
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.900
really a few dollars Miss Superior,

380
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.850
this idea comes up right in,
uh,

381
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:36.020
the German ideology superior to the Middle Ages because it had more developed,

382
00:27:36.551 --> 00:27:40.950
the relations of production more develop property relations.

383
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.690
It was a further step.

384
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:47.691
Dover's private ownership was a further step because now the Labor had

385
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:54.120
possessions,
uh,
of,
uh,
uh,
of,
of,

386
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.100
of the land what they cultivated.
Now,

387
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.300
uh,
and here,

388
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.770
here it comes to classical and Marxist view of what he will change in the

389
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.090
[inaudible] about historical change.

390
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.560
And this is I think,
a provocative,

391
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:18.420
important statement that he said,
if I'm looking at a mode of production,

392
00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:23.421
we can characterize them by the correspondence of the forces and relations of

393
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.164
production.

394
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.100
A certain level of forces of production required a certain type of relations of

395
00:28:33.451 --> 00:28:38.160
production,
a certain type of relationship between individuals.

396
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.010
Uh,
this is,
uh,

397
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.400
in Mark's Rut a hundred years later in social sciences were called

398
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.000
structuralism.

399
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:52.410
This is a typical structurally statements,
right?

400
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.390
That you have correspondences of the different elements of the system.

401
00:28:57.391 --> 00:29:02.391
You are analyzing a correspondence of the forces and the relations of

402
00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:05.004
production.

403
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:11.450
And then he goes further and now we begin to see how he develops the causal

404
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.490
mechanism of change.

405
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.980
It says that is the development of forces of production,

406
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.340
uh,
to use,
uh,

407
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.400
the term of a contemporary Marxists.

408
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.310
Eric all in right is sticky down.

409
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.710
Sneaky down means that the forces of production can only become more complex.

410
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.300
You don't forget,
actually,
it's not true,
but that's the theory,
right?

411
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.550
You don't forget more advanced technologies.

412
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.580
Technology is always advancing.
But,
uh,

413
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.670
the growing,

414
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.850
evolving technology eventually gets into conflict with the relations of

415
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:59.941
production between the property relationships and social relationship.

416
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:03.190
It's in society,
they become outdated,

417
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.570
so outdated because as I pointed out,

418
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.840
the service slaves were not sufficiently attempted to technology and the service

419
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:18.100
were more attentive but not sufficiently attentive.

420
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.650
The serfs were not,

421
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.040
did not have such a high incentives to work very hard bit complex technologies,

422
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.400
then you guys feel be venue will be in a job,
right?

423
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:35.050
Because you will be highly paid and highly skill and you'll have fringe benefits

424
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:37.630
and you don't want to be fired,
right?

425
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:42.610
And you will put your skills to use and therefore you will be able to use very

426
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:47.710
big great care that the computers you use are not being damaged as you are using

427
00:30:50.771 --> 00:30:51.604
them,
right?

428
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.790
So therefore you have to become a wage labor to have these very high incentive

429
00:30:57.611 --> 00:31:02.180
to work very hard and to be very careful,
uh,
with uh,
uh,

430
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.670
uh,
uh,
uh,
the instruments,
what you are using.

431
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.040
And then he says,

432
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:14.430
therefore what happens is that eventually these outmoded social relationships

433
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:21.030
becoming a conflict with the forces of production and the to have more the vom

434
00:31:21.651 --> 00:31:26.390
to have development,
right?
And therefore a bit,
one point,
uh,

435
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:31.490
there will be attention between the outmoded outlived all relations of

436
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:38.101
production and the need to create new spaces for the development of forces of

437
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:43.480
production.
And this is the revolutionary moment as Mars,

438
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:44.314
the fancy,

439
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:49.240
this is the time when the revolution will come because this is when we will rise

440
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:54.220
against the old social relationship and replace them with new social

441
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:56.320
relationships.
Right?

442
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.940
Which will create new space for further growth.

443
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.170
The development of forces of production.
Again,
you know,

444
00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:08.080
just to make clear or vague,

445
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:13.110
one after often misunderstood idea of March,

446
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.930
March,
they never said that capitalism is not effective.
On the contrary,

447
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:22.240
Maurice said capitalism was the most productive system in human see history.

448
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.390
He said in the last hundred years of capitalism,

449
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:29.830
we achieved the more progress than in the whole human history.

450
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:35.230
All that Marx said he wrongly sets.
So he proved to be false.

451
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.000
That if you never,
not not,
we'll go on forever.
At one point,

452
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.930
capital is like any other previous more so production view,

453
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.970
get in conflict with his relations of production and that's when the revolution

454
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.900
will have to come,
right?

455
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.740
And so far we know that Mark's proof to be wrong.

456
00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.160
He underestimated the extra ordinary capacity of capitalism to adapt the major

457
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:06.520
challenges.
Right?
We just have seen it in the last 18 months,
right?

458
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.220
Barely an old capitol is,
was grumbling.
Laura writes,
you know,

459
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.200
just think about the layman's brothers right thing.
Think back in March.

460
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:18.670
Well,
you know,
this was very shaky.
Really turf,

461
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.200
it looks like it probably does,
right?
They learned how to recover.

462
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.010
Anyway,

463
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:30.010
Mark's point was capitalism was really a big revolution and unleash the

464
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:35.120
development of forces of production.
Now we want to grown reason.

465
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:39.140
What are your major contribution then?
Years later

466
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.710
now,
uh,
first of all,

467
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:46.330
now the evolution of modes of production is described.
The,

468
00:33:46.331 --> 00:33:48.500
the changes in property relations.

469
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.910
This is basically where the German ideology ends.

470
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.920
He started their own point division of labor and now property relations is a

471
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:02.750
central idea.
And drive that ownership is now defined in a new way.

472
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.040
He said,
what is private ownership?
Then the subjective,
uh,
um,
uh,

473
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:13.230
laboring subject is completely separated from the objective conditions of labor.

474
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.740
Right?
You can see this is a big step forward from uh,

475
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:22.560
the baddies manuscript right there.
The essence of alienation was,
uh,

476
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.080
a commodity relationships.
Now it is not commodity relationship.

477
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:32.260
He captures the essence right of alienation in the nature of private ownership.

478
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.260
Um,
and vv we'll talk about what that exactly means at the transition.

479
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:44.261
Therefore to capitalism is a separation of workers and the conditions of labor.

480
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.560
And Mars puts it very powerfully.

481
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.790
This is an idea of which then comes back and haunts us all the time.

482
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.930
This is an idea of if you'll be able to read in Max Weber's as well,

483
00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.580
the big progress,

484
00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:03.581
what is happening that the worker becomes three in a double sense of the term

485
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:10.930
that is of capitalism is producing in contrast to traditional or feudal society.

486
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.250
They became free.

487
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:19.660
I got slave and now there is a civil war and it is declare no more slavery.

488
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.560
I am legally free bought.
Said,
yes,

489
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.450
capitalism produce legal freedom and legal equality,

490
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:35.510
but it also kicks you off their land forces.

491
00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:39.270
You go to the city and forces you to sell your labor.

492
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.040
So you are also freed from your possession.

493
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.340
So you don't have the means of procession.

494
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.320
What a farmer had to some extent,
even a slave at some,

495
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.630
but certainly,
um,
the peasants do,
they have that means of subsistence.

496
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.120
Now capitalism requires that people do not have the means of subsistence,

497
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.050
that you have to go to the supermarket to buy your egg,
right?

498
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.460
The system will not work very well.

499
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:14.730
If in your backyard you could grow everything what you need,
right?

500
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.260
The incentive for you to work will be substantially reduced.

501
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.490
Fortunately,
the cannot grow our vegetables,

502
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:28.140
what we need and they have to drive to get to work when we have to drive to get

503
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:33.141
anywhere and we have to buy gasoline and we are also therefore forced to sell

504
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:37.860
our labor force.
This means that three in the door sense of the term,

505
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.753
right?

506
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.800
Legally free and freed from the means of subsistence.
Right?

507
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.630
Uh,
the notion of freedom,
of course,
sad with some irony.

508
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.190
Okay.
Uh,

509
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.520
and then the force proposition multicollinearity,
right?

510
00:36:56.521 --> 00:37:01.521
There are various ways so se can take from a tribal society and he rice about

511
00:37:03.301 --> 00:37:04.260
antiquity,

512
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.330
he invents the notion of the easier dick mode,

513
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.030
but he never used before.

514
00:37:10.031 --> 00:37:15.031
Or Labor is talking about the Slavic form and the Germanic form.

515
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:20.880
And rather than talking about most of production marks in the ground research

516
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:25.881
writing about social formations or economic formations,

517
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:30.710
a very interesting change.
Uh,
it's not,
uh,

518
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.550
just the change of terms.
It's very important change in the theory.

519
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.110
Okay.

520
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:42.110
Just very briefly about the evolution of the mortar production and changing

521
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.950
property relations.

522
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.360
Now he said in all free capitalist formations,

523
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:54.020
now there is an appropriation of natural conditions of labor of the earth has an

524
00:37:55.111 --> 00:38:00.111
original instrument of labor and the individuals simply regards the objective

525
00:38:01.561 --> 00:38:03.330
conditions as his own.

526
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:08.810
There is no separation really of the objective conditions and the labor.

527
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.020
Slavery is the clearest example,
right?
Um,

528
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:18.810
the Greek sad,
the slave is a working animal,
right?

529
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.930
The slave was treated as an object,

530
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.720
but it's not really seen as a subject.

531
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.260
The sleeve did not have the rights of an individual subject that we'll know

532
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:34.500
individual liberties for the subject.

533
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.400
I mean that it from slavery to slave,
only about in antiquity.
Right?

534
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.650
That was the idea.
A little Stepford that obey,
right.

535
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.290
Uh,
they actually have,
do not have ownership,

536
00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:53.020
but have possession of the means of production.

537
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:58.360
The are not treated as legally free individuals and subjects.

538
00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:02.860
Uh,
think about the right to the first night,
right?

539
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.780
The feudal lord had to write a,

540
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:11.320
to spend the first night,
um,
with uh,
bid,
the bright,

541
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.590
uh,
indicators of her bed.
The,
uh,

542
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.730
you have seen the opera most sad,
the marriage of Figaro,
right?

543
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.670
You remember about the story is,
um,

544
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.180
got always in deeply in love with Susanna,
um,
um,

545
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.740
and wants to marry her.

546
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.320
And he is scared that the landlord wants to live,

547
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.190
had the right of the first night.

548
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:41.850
He does not want the Lord to spend the first night we were at his right.

549
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:47.130
Okay.
That's the story,
right?
Um,

550
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.590
and important 18th century story.
Anyway,

551
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.630
so it's not quite a subject.

552
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.250
The Vercher riverkeeper is a subject.

553
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

554
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.800
<v 0>All right.
Let me just move on to private ownership.</v>

555
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.970
He sat under capitalism.
Uh,
the work,

556
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.840
the object are completely separated from the very care.

557
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.430
Uh,
and here is,
uh,
right.
Uh,

558
00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:19.810
the idea that we have these double separation,
right?
You know,

559
00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:24.830
separated from the means of our existence and we are also legally free.

560
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

561
00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.660
<v 0>And more,
uh,
citation of the sky.
And,
uh,</v>

562
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.520
it's also very important,
right,

563
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:38.570
that the transition to market economy happens by pushing people off the land and

564
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.500
forcing them into the cities to become laborers will depend only on the wage,

565
00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.970
what they earn on the labor market.
And now,
uh,

566
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:57.170
gums,
uh,
uh,
a few more minutes and intriguing guy idea,

567
00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:01.580
these multiple trajectories she described,
right?

568
00:41:01.581 --> 00:41:05.690
So the initial idea was a uni linear trajectory.

569
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.980
That means just do it this way.

570
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.580
This was the idea,
tribal society,
uh,

571
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.830
the leads to slave society.

572
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.980
That leaves the feudal society

573
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.190
and that's leads to capitalism.

574
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

575
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:34.270
<v 0>Right?
And dialectics.
So relations</v>

576
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.450
forest,
it was awful abduction.

577
00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:51.670
This dive sleeplessness,
right?
It happens through breaks,
right?

578
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.170
These are revolutions.

579
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:55.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.660
<v 0>It should lead from one to the next.</v>

581
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.700
And these nine alactic crawl introduction,

582
00:42:02.701 --> 00:42:06.570
right least for people to throw up the old system.

583
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.600
Now here we have a very different view presented here.

584
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.210
He describes rather various forms with different individual,
uh,

585
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.990
uh,

586
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:26.990
forms of ownership and points out that in fact the uniqueness of what he called

587
00:42:27.571 --> 00:42:30.330
the Germanic form Germanic tribal form,

588
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.360
that it became individual procession.

589
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:38.630
This is indeed as far as even now we know from historiography a unique feature

590
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:44.830
of Germanic tribes that they allocated the land by,
uh,

591
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.260
a lottery,
a,

592
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.120
B before each season to individual families.

593
00:42:51.121 --> 00:42:53.310
And then families cultivating the land.

594
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.750
They did not have individual prepper delights in the land,

595
00:42:57.751 --> 00:43:00.740
but they had individual per session are located.

596
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:05.750
That was the common land was divided up by individuals or individual families.

597
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.710
And that is the unique feature of this.
And here it is.
Um,

598
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.960
and I hope you see it right there on the multi trajectory,

599
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.160
um,
development.
But he describes,
uh,
um,
in,

600
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:28.290
uh,
the grinders.
And that is,
it's not true.
That true,

601
00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:32.280
that tribal is all led to antiquity or slave societies.

602
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.400
He spends,
you know,

603
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.150
from eight in the morning until 10 in the evening was sitting in the British

604
00:43:39.151 --> 00:43:44.130
library and reading like crazy and they said something wrong.

605
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.790
Uh,
when I am looking at Asia,

606
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:53.090
that is no universalize the slavery that are slaves in China.

607
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.011
Uh,
but you know,

608
00:43:56.011 --> 00:44:00.420
they ask kind of family slaves that are no great plantations,

609
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:05.070
which are cultivated by slaves like in Egypt or ancient Rome,

610
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:09.690
the excessively generalized about Rome,

611
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:14.520
Greece and Egypt.
The whole notion of slave mode of production.

612
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:16.830
This is unique antiquity,

613
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:23.150
but when I'm looking at Asia and in fact I'm looking at,

614
00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.050
uh,
uh,
pre Columbian America,
right?

615
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.790
Uh,
there is no universal I buddy,
uh,

616
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.430
so he was,
is the easier the form.

617
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:39.480
He did not know much about pre Columbian.
Um,

618
00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:40.520
America's,

619
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.800
he knew a little more about India and China did not know much.

620
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:51.120
He,
you as much as usually people could,
um,
uh,
uh,

621
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:55.510
in the,
uh,
1850s was reading cavalry.
Uh,

622
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.550
but he understood that this was a different form.
Right.

623
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:05.630
And the uniqueness of the Asiatic form as he puts it was this were hydraulic

624
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:06.870
societies.

625
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.900
They were big empires or organize around irrigation and flood protection works.

626
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.170
And in order to have this irrigation and flood protection works,

627
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.570
you needed big empires.

628
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:26.990
And what the big emperors in China did that they left the village communes alone

629
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.970
as long as they did deliver doors,

630
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.980
taxes from which the imperial power was able to build a flood protection and

631
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.040
irrigation that works right?

632
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:47.150
So the village commune was left alone as a commune itself and was not

633
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:51.770
transformed into serves or slaves.
Uh,

634
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.940
China never really had a classical case of few dollars,

635
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.960
a few dollars from the way how we know it from England or France or Spain.

636
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.840
It never existed in China.
Uh,

637
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.910
if therefore it was the easier the form write a centralized imperial bureaucracy

638
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.780
and the hydraulic economy driven by water problems.

639
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.590
And then he said,
well,

640
00:46:17.591 --> 00:46:21.390
there was the Germanic form and I briefly talked about the Germanic form.

641
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:24.090
All right,
well you had family possession.

642
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:27.310
And he said,
Ha,

643
00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.070
where those few doctors who come from the origin or theorists said,
you know,

644
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:36.720
transition from one mode of production to the next happens because of internal

645
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:39.670
class struggle.
Right?
Uh,

646
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:44.690
the theory should predict that few dollars fell because the serfs had enough.

647
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:51.050
The vent uprising hang to the slave owners and created a new society.

648
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:58.290
Well,
Mark said I was a jerk.
This is not how it worked.

649
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.840
Look at how Rome fell.
It was invaded by the Germanic tribes.

650
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.430
And what is interesting,

651
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:10.470
these Germanic tribes actually had much less advanced military technology and

652
00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:12.510
technology generally,

653
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.000
but they had a superior social relationship system.

654
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:23.540
They had a more developed idea of private ownership than a hat.

655
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.380
So in fact,
the Roman Empire fell because it was in bay,

656
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:31.360
invaded by the Germanic tribes,

657
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:36.510
and they transformed the Roman empire into a feudal society.

658
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.880
They transformed slaves into serves.

659
00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:46.070
And that is also the Slavic form.
Now that is the Russian option.

660
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.380
That is a kind of few daughters about the feudal lord actually treats the option

661
00:47:52.471 --> 00:47:55.120
of the village commune as a unit.
Again,

662
00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:00.420
it is not the central authority in Russia who collects the rents but the feudal

663
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:01.301
lord,

664
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:06.301
but leaves to a large extent the village commune to operate in a communal they

665
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.150
and therefore he said,
therefore I was wrong.

666
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.180
It was not internal class struggle which led to the evolution very often this is

667
00:48:15.781 --> 00:48:20.781
an external force which leads to a change into another mode of production,

668
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:26.020
right into another social formation.
And therefore he said,
well,

669
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.340
shall I say that is yet,

670
00:48:28.341 --> 00:48:33.040
if form necesarrily we'll have to go through few dollars before it can be

671
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:35.110
capitalism.
No Way.

672
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.680
China is in Ebay or ready have some signs to move Tovaras capitalism,

673
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:45.310
the south creating feudalism.
But he did not know that.

674
00:48:45.311 --> 00:48:49.450
A gentleman called Mousa Tome come a little later and he said,

675
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:53.680
and do we have to become capitalist first and mouths that don't said,

676
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.600
but we hate capitalism.

677
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.860
Why don't we create communism straight out of the Asiatic form?

678
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:04.330
And that's what he was trying to do.
And therefore,
you know,
he had the,

679
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.880
this is sort of my additional,
this Arrow of course,

680
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:11.881
it did not exist in Mark's right from the easier ti form to come [inaudible] but

681
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:16.630
that's what Moussa toon did.
Did it work?
No.

682
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:21.100
Uh,
it Elo,
I want to say probably they're,

683
00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:24.040
the only point is that communism is not at the end.

684
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.890
Communism is before capitalism,
right?

685
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:33.150
I think set tone successfully converted is Yeti form into communism in order

686
00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:37.810
than to move communities mean to capitalism.
That's what marks did not buy.

687
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:38.620
Consider.

688
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:43.420
But we'll be completely consistent with the type of analysis he offers.

689
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:46.400
Right.
And in,
uh,
the,
uh,

690
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.760
grown recently finally about the Slavic form and I am out of time now the same

691
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:53.524
argument.

692
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.770
He gets a letter from a Russian and are his Verizon outreach and that allows us

693
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.610
to reach was a great admirer of marks,

694
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.050
but she was a kind of populist,
uh,

695
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.930
anarchist left finger.
And he said,

696
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:13.120
but Mr and marks,

697
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:18.660
do you really want us to destroy these wonderful Russian optional village

698
00:50:19.151 --> 00:50:24.151
commune that we live so intimately together as brothers and sisters to create

699
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:27.650
this hated capitalism?

700
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.280
Why can't we move straight into communism?

701
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:36.810
This is a communistic form and Mark's kind of muddied varies.

702
00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.740
So he responded as an interesting idea,

703
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:45.890
and this is exactly what Vladimir Ilyich,
Lenin and Stalin did.

704
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:51.850
They call inverted the Russian option into what they called Cohoes collective

705
00:50:53.001 --> 00:50:53.960
enterprise.

706
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.280
All that happened similar to the mouse story.

707
00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:03.580
It turned out not to be the road to the most advanced form of society,

708
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.570
but a kind of side ruled right though vars,
capitalism,

709
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.681
and the question,

710
00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:13.700
what remains to be discussed that or decide Rhoda was national Sherry,

711
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.860
and whether this was the most effective way to move to capitalism and what came

712
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:23.210
out as capitalism from it is really the best possible capitalism at all.

713
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.080
But that's for another course.
If you think that Iot is of capitalism,

714
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:28.730
we talk more about that.
Thank you.
