1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.090
So Val,
uh,
this is,
uh,
uh,

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.820
the course on foundations of modern social thought.
Uh,

3
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.821
it has a sociology number and political science number and the humanities

4
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:17.934
number.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.320
And My name is Yvonne [inaudible].

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.010
I'm a professor of sociology and professor of political science and it is my

7
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:32.880
honor that I can introduce you,
uh,
to,
uh,

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.540
some of the founding
fathers.

9
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.510
I'm afraid they are,
or fathers,
uh,
mothers among them.

10
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:45.960
I will tell you why not,
uh,

11
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.680
of modern social thought.
Uh,

12
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.680
it's basically theories,
uh,
uh,
starting,
uh,

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.110
uh,

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.110
from the 16th century and ending up in the early 20th century.

15
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.450
This course is very interdisciplinary.

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.550
It's not accidental.
It has a humanities number,
uh,

17
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:16.190
political science number and the sociology number.
Um,

18
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.490
in effect,
as we started discussing,
uh,

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.270
the foundations of modern science in the 16th century,

20
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.910
that is even,
no distinction,

21
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.300
no sharp distinction between sciences and social sciences.

22
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.660
Right?
The first orchard on our list,

23
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.080
dormers hops did a lot of work on optics and has been in a violent controversy.

24
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.440
We,
they cry.

25
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.130
So those of you who are in natural sciences are probably familiar with they car

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.430
and his bio nearing work on optics.

27
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.310
Um,
John Locke,

28
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.120
for those of you who are spry to become a doctor,

29
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.760
I was actually studying medicine and performed a surgery on a very well known,

30
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.940
um,
uh,
English,
uh,
uh,

31
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.100
politician at quite a successful surgery.
Though even today,

32
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:22.830
doctors via don't know better.

33
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.960
These politicians survive because of good luck or because of the surgery.

34
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.140
Anyway,
the point I'm trying to make,
uh,
uh,
in the early,
you know,

35
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.480
uh,
16,
17,
18 centuries,
um,

36
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.500
uh,

37
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.180
sciences and social sciences are not separated from each other yet.

38
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.580
George Jacques Rousseau,
um,
a real pain in the neck,

39
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.000
but an extremely smart guy.
Um,

40
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.790
he also wrote an important book,
uh,

41
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:01.210
which dealt with sciences and social studies.

42
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.070
Um,
uh,

43
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.720
it's Sorta yellowy by the kind of late 18th century,

44
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.410
uh,

45
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.410
that people are beginning to identify as studying society or human behavior.

46
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.700
But even then,
until the very last orchard,

47
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.190
what we have here,
Emile Durkheim,

48
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.150
people identify themselves with a number of approaches,

49
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.410
disciplinary approaches,
they've,

50
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:33.850
or social scientist or write or philosophers or right.

51
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.940
The difference between philosophy and,

52
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.260
and social science is a very vague word.
So,
uh,

53
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.120
<v 1>okay.</v>

54
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.100
<v 0>Um,
uh,
um,</v>

55
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.590
they beginning to distinguish themselves,
uh,
uh,

56
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.630
increasingly,
uh,
uh,
or from sciences,

57
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.020
but they are still multidisciplinary.
Uh,

58
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.980
who is Karl Marx?
You know,
he is a philosopher.

59
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.870
He's an economist,
a,
he is a political scientist.

60
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.200
A sociologist named him as one of the founding fathers of sociology.

61
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.460
Max Faber.
Uh,
he identified himself as a,

62
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.090
as a legal theorist,
right?
Um,

63
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.630
he was studying economic history.
He,

64
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.490
I think primarily identified himself early in life as a,

65
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.440
as an economist,
as an economic historian.
Um,

66
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.760
at least early in life,
he began to call himself a sociologist.

67
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.330
So the point is this is a very interdisciplinary course.
Uh,

68
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.100
so one advantages of you to take this scores,
uh,

69
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.860
is,
uh,
that you will be getting more knowledge,
which leads you,

70
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.480
which would benefit you if you are studying sciences.
If you are,

71
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.900
if you want to become a psychologist,

72
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:06.901
if you become an economist or a political scientist or an anthropologist or a

73
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:11.380
philosopher,
I mean these lists of names,
right,

74
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.040
will appear on your reading list.
Okay?
So that's our been,
uh,

75
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.990
Ivo goal.
I have many,
many slides to show you and love.

76
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.310
You will try to bring them alive to you a little.
Um,
uh,

77
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.050
so I don't want to waste too much of my time,
uh,
to do rush through all of this.

78
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:32.520
But let me still speak to some of the details,

79
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:37.521
but I'm sure many of you aren't particularly insurance first about the readings.

80
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.190
<v 1>Okay?</v>

81
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.700
<v 0>Uh,</v>

82
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.700
and my first advice is don't let yourself to be scared by me.

83
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.680
Right?
Order readings are on the Internet.

84
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.180
You don't have to buy any books.
You don't have to go to the library,

85
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.430
you just to the Internet and you unload the readings and you can't claim the

86
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.270
reading south.

87
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.170
That's when you get scared because some of the readings are too long.

88
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.310
And some of the readings,

89
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:14.750
you start reading and you feel you don't understand the word of it.

90
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.740
Well you would experience is not very different from mine when I was reading

91
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:22.430
this text for the first time.

92
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.410
So my advice is don't get scared.
Right?

93
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.280
I don't expect you to do much more reading for discourse.
Uh,

94
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.300
in a done let's say five for six hours.

95
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.570
This will not be enough for you,
right?

96
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.940
In first leading to get the readings on your command.

97
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.510
I mean anything,
characters like hops or reading,

98
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.220
even characters like Nicha is a hard stuff to do.

99
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.990
My advice is that you kind of click creeds,

100
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.090
Kim Reed for the lecture,

101
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.990
do some reading for the lecture so you can come in with a sense of the text,

102
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.990
then I,
they'll give you a,

103
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.830
the most important citations and then interpretation.

104
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.680
And then I give you a searchlight.

105
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.030
You can go back to the text and you know what you are looking for.
Right.

106
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.400
And get ready for the discussion section at the discussion section.

107
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.350
I will keep my mouth shut and I want you to talk,

108
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:34.640
I will ask questions and we will have a lively discussion.
Right?

109
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.950
Um,
so by that time you really have to have more of a sense.

110
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.660
But I will use a lot of powerpoints,
right?
And the powerpoints,

111
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.460
we will be put on the Internet and will help you to go through the text.

112
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.690
So my first point is don't get scared with the readings.

113
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.430
Please don't drop this course because you said there are too many too difficult

114
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:02.320
readings.
This is not meant to be an easy course,
but I've,

115
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:04.220
you'll make it easy for you.
Okay.

116
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.810
Easy and fun.
You know,

117
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.380
you can't believe how Tomas hops can be fun,

118
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.500
but give me just one v thrive and you get to see how fun he is.

119
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.730
All right.
Now the other concern,
right?

120
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.560
People who shop assignments,

121
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.710
well,
there are quite a few assignments to discourse,

122
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.370
but I am one of those people who are scared of exams.

123
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.880
I was almost 70 when I got my driver's license because I did not want to fail.

124
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.080
We fail,
you know,

125
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:53.081
my diverse says so I understand anxieties about tests.

126
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.840
So therefore I had been versed in cards over my life to make assignments

127
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:06.420
serious.
Make sure that you put serious work into the course,

128
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.810
you mastered the material and at the same time the level of anxiety is reduced

129
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.790
near zero.
How do I do that?
Easy.

130
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.250
That'd be a B,
three tests.

131
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.810
All the three tests they'll be administered on the intern that you'll sit in

132
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:33.780
your room,
you sit in their library,
you go to a coffee shop,

133
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.840
you go to Starbucks and you login 8:00 PM on a given day and then you'll be able

134
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:46.110
to get questions from this.
You have to answer some of them,

135
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.210
right?
I also,
they'll give you a set of questions,

136
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.630
Vaughn v before the test,

137
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.250
so you will not be surprised what kind of questions you've,

138
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.760
you'll be asked Ibo,
reduce that list.

139
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.290
And either from this,

140
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.460
let's say I will give you a list of about eight to 10 questions.

141
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.260
They use it to three and then you will have to answer to,
okay.

142
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.360
But that'd be,
it'd be no anxiety if you don't know exactly what's going on.

143
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.790
You've,
you've have von hour.
Uh,
to answer it,
I don't mind.
You know,

144
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:28.140
if you prepare and you cut and paste and you put it on the Internet,
that's okay.

145
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.760
I used to open book.
You can use books.
What I want you to do,

146
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:37.380
not to use books,
I want to use your brain,
right?
Fletchy change.

147
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.430
Okay.
So that's the,
the three tests.

148
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.490
And then that will be one paper for the end of the course.
Uh,

149
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.110
the paper is not a big deal.
Uh,

150
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
I just want to have to try to bring the course to gather different elements of

151
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:57.440
the course,
to gather the three tests.
Dot.

152
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.430
About three blocks of the courses.

153
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.290
The paper is supposed to link at least two blocks of discourses,
right?

154
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.950
Uh,
um,
and again,

155
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:12.951
you will be able to talk to me and you're teaching fellows about their paper

156
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:15.320
topic.
Um,

157
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.590
and let me then introduce our teaching assistants,

158
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.370
teaching fellows to introduce themselves.

159
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.153
We do do so.

160
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.503
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

161
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.590
<v 0>Well,
you have that third bomb.
He didn't show,
uh,</v>

162
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.560
and IVF takeover.
So two discussion sections.
Uh,
uh,
myself,

163
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.780
uh,
uh,
Ivo think a Monday and Wednesday a discussion,

164
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.130
um,
uh,
7:00 PM,
uh,

165
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.080
so sort of make sure that people,
uh,
uh,
don't,

166
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.450
don't,
don't overlap with other obligations.

167
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.830
Even athletes can't take it because practices are usually over and dinner is

168
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:09.664
over,
right?

169
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.850
So after dinner you can come do a nice after dinner conversation with me and ivy

170
00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:18.940
will be grading the assignments of,

171
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.110
of students who take my discussion sections.

172
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.520
Um,
you can also be sure that we have,

173
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:32.521
you'll make all efforts that everybody will be able to get into a discussion

174
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:33.364
section.

175
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.350
So right now the crowd is bigger than the number of teaching fellows and myself,

176
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:43.351
we have so far on the Internet listed only five discussion sections.

177
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.390
But,
uh,
um,
uh,

178
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.790
if you want to take the course and you do not fit into any of the discussion

179
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:55.600
sections,
you will be talking to me and ivy,

180
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:59.260
we'll be figuring out that you will get your discussion section.

181
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.750
Not a single person should drop out of this course because there is no

182
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:08.800
discussion section that students are your teeth.
You have my virt 40.
Okay.

183
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.880
Um,
I think that's probably all,

184
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.390
um,
uh,
housekeeping.

185
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.130
Any question about this?
If yes,
please.
Loud.

186
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.270
<v 0>Well,
it looks like it's clear,
right?</v>

188
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:37.150
Clear and,
and attractive.
Uh,

189
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.130
as just one very last sentence.

190
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.530
I don't want this to be a Mickey mouse course.
I want to be this to be serious,

191
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:51.880
right?
I want you to be challenged.
I want to you to think,

192
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.650
I want to do,
do you to read and I want to remember what you learned in,

193
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.000
in discourse,
right?

194
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.810
But I want to live a decrease the level of anxiety and make the workload

195
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.580
reasonable.
And if you come to lectures,
you can't discussion sections,

196
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.830
right?
It will be okay,
right?

197
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.310
You will not be overloaded by work and you will not be a bit anxiety.

198
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:17.740
Now,

199
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.740
let me try to rush quickly suit with through of all of these orders and give you

200
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:28.830
at least a couple of words about every one so you get a sense what will happen

201
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:32.950
in discourse,
right?
And I have how many?

202
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.590
27 minutes to do that.
Uh,

203
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.810
so this is Tomas hops born in 1588.

204
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.430
Uh,
well,
uh,
hops.
Uh,

205
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.370
had a little bit of a trouble child who,

206
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.560
a difficult father who was a man,

207
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:55.850
got into a fight with another clergy man and had to disappear.

208
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.620
He had a fight.
Thatcher in a cemetery we can in the 16th century was no,

209
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:05.500
no,
especially for clergy man.
Anyway,
he,
uh,
grew up,
uh,

210
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.280
with uh,
uncles.
Nevertheless,
he got to the University of Oxford.

211
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.650
They're pretty good and became a tutor and our beauty.
I'm Cavendish,

212
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.993
um,

213
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.510
and then traveled with him to Europe or France and Italy and he met Galileo and

214
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.560
was greatly influenced by Galileo at that time.

215
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.690
Um,
in English universities.
They were mainly teaching art historical,

216
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.040
um,

217
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.040
and a bell hops became very disenchanted with Aristotle,

218
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.920
the dogmatism of artists,
toto philosophy.

219
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.250
And he was an thrilled by the emergence of new positive science of art gallery

220
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.340
level represented.
Um,

221
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.950
then he can came back in England and that were very turbulent politics.
I've,

222
00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:06.510
you're talking about this greater in the course.
And he was among dose.

223
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.970
He's a conservative guy if you are a republican UV love it.

224
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.400
Uh,
he sided with the kink against the parliament.

225
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.130
And since he did that,
uh,
he 19,
1640,

226
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.580
he better a Skift and van to France into exile and then returned in 51,

227
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.750
uh,
to England.
Um,
because he was a troublemaker.

228
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.930
He was not only in conflict with the Republicans,

229
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:42.830
he was also in conflict with the royalists.
Uh,

230
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.180
he died in 1679.
Now,
uh,
uh,

231
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:52.181
his first very cause a translation of [inaudible] he liked to kidney does

232
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.860
because he thought to kitty that short why democracy doesn't work right.

233
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.660
He's an absolute dist.
A hops are conservative,

234
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.790
right.
Absolutely.
List.
Um,

235
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.640
and then he wrote an interesting trilogy and this is again,

236
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:15.200
shows the unity of sciences and social sciences.
They'll try it.

237
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:19.100
The first volume deals with the human body,
the biology,

238
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.210
the second,
uh,
works with on the individual.

239
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:24.920
It is really psychology.

240
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.400
And the last one verse on society and Politics and he thinks the way how to

241
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:35.951
understand a human existence is start with bodily functions and more from body

242
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:41.750
functions to uh,
uh,
politics and philosophy.

243
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.220
And then his major work is Leviathan,
is the verb.

244
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.150
Probably most of you heard the title.
Um,

245
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.200
and this was actually at a time when Charles,
the first,

246
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.390
um,
Missourian had the executed,
um,
and,
uh,

247
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.010
uh,
uh,
uh,

248
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:07.250
he actually was considering now shed should be a possibility to transfer loyalty

249
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.330
to a new ruler,
but the royalist fellow royal is,

250
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.790
or in exile in Paris,
didn't like,

251
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.240
so now he had to escape barriers to escape the anger of the royalists.

252
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.880
Uh,
this is the first edition of the Leviathan,

253
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:30.840
one of the most influential book in politics ever written.

254
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.850
Well,
I'm not a very attractive work.
Uh,

255
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.530
the main team is,
uh,
that in the state of nature,

256
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:45.270
naturally by human nature,
uh,
people are quite either,

257
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:46.980
uh,

258
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.980
and therefore ordered has to be imposed over people above each other.

259
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.310
Otherwise,
that would be a war ever.
We've,

260
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.990
we've would be in a state of war of everyone against everyone.

261
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.880
This is the major citation from Leviathan.
That's what everybody knows.

262
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.920
Right?
Okay.
John Locke is the next,
uh,
born,

263
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.050
uh,
half a century later.

264
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:18.330
Also a British scientist.
Um,
uh,

265
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.290
oh,
he came from a minor gentry family.
Uh,

266
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.580
he also studied the Oxford philosophy and as I said,

267
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:31.170
medicine was also a,
his second major.
Um,

268
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.050
early on he was very much attracted to hops.
Um,

269
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.040
Medan he met a major,
um,

270
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.870
a British politician Shaftsbury he con he performed the,

271
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.133
uh,

272
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.950
liver operation on him as humanity saving his life.

273
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.650
And then he changed course from our conservatives,
uh,

274
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:59.651
and became a sort of a republican or by America and political Sanders.

275
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.290
He shifted from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party.

276
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.730
That's what they did.
Right.
Um,
well

277
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.981
in fact,

278
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:15.981
he was even involved in 82 in a plot to overthrow absolutism and he had to

279
00:20:17.671 --> 00:20:19.530
escape to the Netherlands,

280
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.390
returned in [inaudible] 89 to London and died a few years later.

281
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.610
Um,
well,
uh,

282
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.300
he's conservative work was in 64.

283
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.930
His address at the college in which actually offered the hopsy on theses King

284
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.440
Saul Gods and the people are beast.
But then he changed completely.
Uh,

285
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:48.430
he already writes an important paper on toleration,

286
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.720
Libero,
sassier reading yet.
Um,

287
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.730
and especially he rides a two treaties,

288
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
which is a major foundation work for modern democratic theory.

289
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.470
Major Foundation work for the American constitution as well.

290
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.590
This is the first edition of it.
So what are the main point?
Uh,

291
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.100
he said,
well,
men are born free and equal.
Uh,

292
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.800
and in the state of nature,
they are good.

293
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.470
That is a need for superior,

294
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:25.471
but a superior can also be accepted by the consent of everybody who is subjected

295
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.830
to authority.
Um,
and he is the first,
uh,

296
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.700
uh,

297
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.700
political theorist who advocates the separation of powers and has a major impact

298
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.450
to gather with [inaudible].

299
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.050
So on the foundation of the American constitution,

300
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.210
this is the American constitution comes from now.

301
00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:53.610
We moved from,
um,
from uh,

302
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.040
England to France to Montesquieu who was a worn or delete a 17th century and

303
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:06.950
lived in the kind of order,
the swinging 18th century,

304
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.780
18th century was essentially,
at least in France,

305
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.240
fun to live in.
Uh,

306
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.720
well it was a lot of turbulence about interpersonal relationships were quite

307
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.340
interesting.
We'll say.

308
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.360
It reminds me of the 1960s,
you know,

309
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:30.310
hobbies,
um,
the hippies and whatever,
right?

310
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.760
Uh,
sort of before the French revolution,

311
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:38.650
you have the 1960s kind of stuff.
Now,
there was not Marty who ana,

312
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.880
but there was a lot of various kinds of sex,
right,

313
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.840
which made the,
made the 18th century quite fun.

314
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.410
And the life of Montesquieu maybe quite fun.

315
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.680
Now he was a born in the right ways,

316
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:58.570
knew more door where the good vine is grown.
Uh,
Brad,

317
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.680
uh,
his name was actually Sharis Louis the second.
Dot.

318
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.350
And he became Montez here when he,

319
00:23:07.351 --> 00:23:12.351
his uncle died and inherited the title of Barone Dumont.

320
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.230
Montesquieu from him.
He studied the law.

321
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.990
Uh,
he's a major legal theories.

322
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:23.050
Any one of you who is adding to law school,

323
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:28.270
we will have to take this course because the theory of law,

324
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.840
right,
starts with Montesquieu,
right?

325
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.020
Any there he studied the,
uh,

326
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:39.820
at the University of Bordeaux and 28th,
he did the right thing,

327
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:44.140
you know,
to be in a parliamentarian in Bordeaux was boring.

328
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.860
And rather he did,
he went into commerce.

329
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:53.861
He became a vine merchant and the mercenary and that adventure spent two years

330
00:23:55.341 --> 00:24:00.341
traveling all over in Europe and having lots of fun leaving his wife behind to

331
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:04.520
run the business.
Not Very nice of him.

332
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.830
So the money life was sending them money,
right to,
uh,
uh,

333
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.260
uh,
uh,
money orders or the equivalence of it,
uh,

334
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.370
wherever he was having fun,
you know,

335
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:20.540
in Italy or England or the Netherlands.

336
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.010
That was fun.
Uh,
then when he returned,

337
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.020
he began to do writing,
particularly,
uh,

338
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.320
his major book,

339
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:35.590
we are talking about antibody died in 55 about the very,

340
00:24:35.711 --> 00:24:38.960
there are two major work,
the parish and lectures,

341
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.960
which is a fond of Eric and ironic feel,
a French and Persian.
Um,

342
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.970
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

343
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.850
for the life of Patty's,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in the,

344
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:57.000
in the eyes of two Persian visitors,

345
00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.250
a kind of ironic view of the absurdities of,
of French,

346
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:05.540
French life.
And then 48,
he writes,

347
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.430
find out his major book,
the spit.
It's off laws.
Um,
uh,

348
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.530
which,
uh,
um,
you know,

349
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:16.370
it's an extremely important book and you'll be able to read this is the first

350
00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:18.470
audition off if you've your read from it.

351
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.840
What are the major contributions there?
As I mentioned already,

352
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:25.850
law book needed,
uh,

353
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.040
notice the need for the separation of powers about law,

354
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.060
separated only three branches of government,

355
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.000
the executive,
the legislative,

356
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.370
and once what he called the,
uh,
uh,

357
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.780
federative Montesquieu formulated the way how it is in the American

358
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:52.460
constitution,
right?
Namely,
he separates the legislative,

359
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.760
the executive and the judicial branch.

360
00:25:55.910 --> 00:26:00.530
And we'll talk a great deal about this,
why it is so important to separate,

361
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.810
uh,
the jury difficult branch from the legislative and the executive.

362
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.870
And then,
uh,

363
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.050
he also did something very pioneering,

364
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.350
extremely naive v but very pioneering.

365
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.460
He looked at ecosystem,
right?

366
00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.350
Here's the sort of the first environmentalist,

367
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.290
not quite even Khaldoon bid much before him,

368
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.630
but for a modern,
more contemporary theories,

369
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.870
it's really Montesquieu who tries to explain the nature of laws of eat a

370
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.610
climatic conditions,

371
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.640
looks at the interaction between nature and society and the two costs,

372
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.770
basically 300 years to realize how important this interaction is,

373
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.090
right?
So he's really doing some absolutely pathbreaking work.

374
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.130
Um,
now this is your show.
So,

375
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.210
I mean that I have many favorites among these people as long as Jacques Rousseau

376
00:27:07.211 --> 00:27:08.190
is one of them.

377
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.420
Not because I disagree with everything what he said,

378
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.690
but he says it's so provocatively and it is in such a fun way that I just

379
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.870
cannot,
uh,
uh,
resist to enjoy it all the time.

380
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:29.871
He was born already in the 18th century and jr died just before the French

381
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.160
revolution,
though.

382
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.160
Played a big role paving the road to the French revolution about his life.

383
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.450
He was born in Geneva,
so he's Swiss a,
whatever it means.

384
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.620
Uh,
his father was a watchmaker,
uh,
and,
uh,

385
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.000
like Hopsin had a turbulent childhood.
Uh,

386
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.440
the father probably has some depth,

387
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:57.441
so he had to jump the boat and went to Istanbul and left his son behind.

388
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.140
Um,
uh,
uh,
who then in 28,

389
00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.560
they move to Anansi,
uh,
uh,
uh,

390
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.650
France and met a wonderful lady and Mrs warrants will took Ian Young boys.

391
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.490
Uh,
right.
Um,
uh,
he was,
uh,
just about 16 at that time.

392
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:25.380
Um,
uh,
she was about 10 or 12 years,
his senior,

393
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.830
and they're alive.
You're talking about this more.

394
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:33.030
I will give you all this gossip,
um,
in,
in,
in,
in this course.

395
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.180
Um,
uh,
well it fascinated a lot of people.
Um,

396
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:38.790
uh,

397
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.790
later on these interests in relationship between John Sharp and Mrs Warren's

398
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.590
stone.
Uh,
uh,
um,

399
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:54.410
anybody remembers the name of the French novelist?

400
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.970
Um,
a rule Renoir,
uh,
uh,
rather,

401
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.520
and the black bell,

402
00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:07.530
this is all that Italian destroyer of John [inaudible] who saw and Mrs warrants.

403
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:14.060
Well,
um,
the affair lasted for a long time.
Uh,

404
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:19.230
then he moved in 42 in Paris and he became a superstar,
you know,

405
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:20.700
wherever he was,

406
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:25.701
he had to be a superstar and he was a superstar in everything.

407
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.810
Uh,
it's,
uh,
I that is just no match.
Uh,

408
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.140
um,
probably Leo Nardo Da Vinci as somebody who,

409
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:40.170
who can become paired crew.
So in his,
as a renaissance man,

410
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.350
you know,
he knew everything and he did everything perfectly,

411
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.780
perfectly.
I mean,
or problematic now.

412
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.360
And 62,
he publishes two of his major books and Ivy,

413
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.970
we're talking about the middle of the glacier,
the big scandals.

414
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:03.270
They have to escape France because he will be big trouble with the church in

415
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:07.900
particular.
But in swizzle he doesn't get along very well either.

416
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:13.020
So then he goes to England,
return Slater to France,
um,

417
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.080
under an assumed name and died in 78.

418
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.850
Okay.
Uh,
about Rousseau's very kept,
uh,
uh,

419
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:27.870
the first one which I said is still dealing with sciences and social sciences.

420
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.690
Uh,
the disciplines are not separated from each other.

421
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.900
But let me also mention that in 52,

422
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.300
he rise in our para and United's a wonderful opera.

423
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.890
The dive into the lodge.

424
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.220
I have a CD of the opera and the five would know how to play music and I would

425
00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:51.960
show you some of his music is great music.
Um,

426
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.020
more tart was so excited,
uh,

427
00:30:56.021 --> 00:31:00.550
that he actually wrote an opera following Russo's upper.

428
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:06.540
He was in a big Viv,
we'll talk about this later.
I'm a bit,
uh,
uh,
um,
uh,

429
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.750
obsessed with music.
And anyway,

430
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.760
he was a big conflict with the greatest French composer ever Rom all,

431
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.090
I'm sure many of you know,
the vertical for our mall,

432
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.370
a great 18th century,
a musician.
There are,

433
00:31:23.371 --> 00:31:28.230
it also was not quite as great a composer as a mall,
but,
uh,
uh,
um,

434
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:28.550
uh,

435
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:33.550
had a debate with him and his music was to be an alternative.

436
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.700
Grandma Rumble Vonda to write French music and Russo was committed to Italian.

437
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:46.330
You see Melodie beltcon too.
Right?
That's what he loved.

438
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.470
And that's what Mozart in most of his uppers loved.

439
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.350
That's my more south loved there were so rather than Rameau.
Right.

440
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.030
Okay.
And then second book,

441
00:31:58.031 --> 00:32:01.930
discourse of origins of inequality.
Absolutely.
Great Book.

442
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.800
I don't have the time to work on this.
And then in 62,

443
00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:10.801
the two big books video you will be reading from Ishmael and social contract,

444
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.750
Emile,
uh,
72,
uh,
some of the major themes,

445
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:20.440
uh,
I mean,
he writes about education or philosophy.

446
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:25.210
Those of you who are heading to education,
this book is a must,
right?

447
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.620
You cannot be right.
Uh,

448
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.580
an educationalist be south having read Emil cover to cover,
right?

449
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.650
This is the foundations of modern educational theory.
Um,

450
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.290
and he follows the life of a young adult.

451
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.620
A domain point is so Sattik corrupts pulls all the bad ideas in people's mind.

452
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.660
So the real reason of education is to get rid of education.

453
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:57.770
What people got,
well,
I don't have,

454
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.480
I can't quite have the ambitions to do it in this course now to get everything

455
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:06.200
what you learned so far out of your mind and to get the new ideas.

456
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.930
But that's what Rousseau thought.
Real education is.

457
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:13.760
Education is negative education,
uh,
probably wrong,

458
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.980
but very provocative idea,
right?
And then,
um,

459
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.510
uh,
he is the opposite of hops.
Nature is many.

460
00:33:23.511 --> 00:33:28.100
Nature is good.
Um,
uh,
and foreshadows mark source.

461
00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:30.260
So believe that now the social contract,

462
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.800
now the idea is that legitimate authority has to be authorized by those

463
00:33:35.801 --> 00:33:38.340
subjected to authority.
Um,

464
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.560
and he advocated the first popular Suva Vanity,
right?

465
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:47.570
It has to be done by the majority of man.

466
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:52.630
He actually was not advocating a voting rights for women.

467
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.570
Yeah.
But at least voting last Rashford or man.

468
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.290
Uh,
but

469
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.330
he also suggested that individuals,
no,

470
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:09.740
only their own interest.

471
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.340
There must be a state which expresses the genital veal.

472
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:16.370
Vivi were talking about this a great deal later on.

473
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.420
Adam Smith's is the next one.
Again,

474
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.700
you want to be an icon icon.

475
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.720
[inaudible] you have to read the vast of nation cover to cover more than bonds,

476
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.350
right?
Otherwise you are not an economist,

477
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.650
so they will be dealing with Adam Smith's,
uh,

478
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.100
was born in 1723,
uh,

479
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:45.190
studied at the University of Glasgow and later on Oxford and became a professor

480
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.260
of logic and professor of moral philosophy.

481
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.410
Extremely interesting that uh,

482
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:59.590
the most utilitarian economists was at up professor of moral philosophy.

483
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.490
And in fact his first book is God,
the theory of moral sentiments.

484
00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:09.260
It is about all about ethics rather than rational calculation.

485
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.670
Um,
um,

486
00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:15.940
and then he travels in France matters or kind of people returns to Glasgow.

487
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.060
And finally 76 rise the book.

488
00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:22.640
For those of you who are heading into business,

489
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:25.790
we'll have to read the valves of nations.

490
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:31.450
And you got in mind that the seat that is to Adam Smith one or who is,

491
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:35.870
uh,
talking about the self interested individuals.

492
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:41.190
All of us act rationally and the individuals acting pursuing stuff,

493
00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:46.080
internist,
um,
uh,
fulfill social interest.

494
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.500
This is in the about in the theory of moral sentiments.

495
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:54.800
He is writing about sympathy is writing about the helping hand is racking up

496
00:35:54.801 --> 00:35:58.760
thinking about God rather than just businesses self interest.

497
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:03.630
And that has been a library of literature,
whether that are uh,

498
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.200
Adam Smith's or whether this compliment each other.

499
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.610
And that is really volunteering and von good economic theory,

500
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.290
which is both ethical and the rational and calculative.
Okay.

501
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.610
And this is the verse of Nation.
Um,
uh,
Bell,

502
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.830
one big issue is about he promotes self interest,
right?

503
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.400
People shouldn't be acting out of self interest in order to achieve the common

504
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:33.210
good.
And people are the best judge of that interest,

505
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:35.040
not the government.
Right.

506
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.070
Well this is very much a question for today.
Um,

507
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.180
how scare form does he do,
do,

508
00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:48.180
do we need the government to tell us but kind of health scare there?
Fourth,

509
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:53.010
we need Adam Smith's probably will say,
no,
you don't need the government.

510
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.690
You should judge for yourself what kind of,
how scale you want.

511
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.860
And then he develops the Labor theory of value,
uh,

512
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:05.160
that all value is created by labor.

513
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.240
He develops in an interesting way,
but for shadows,
uh,
uh,

514
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.590
Karl Marx later on and then,
uh,

515
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.310
of course he's known about the idea of the invisible hand.

516
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.950
While the invisible hand is not that obvious,

517
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:28.310
he uses the term three times in his work and or each time he's using in a

518
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:33.550
different and sense what it means simply,
uh,

519
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:38.760
uh,
the invisible hand is the free unregulated market.

520
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.210
That's how we normally understand it today.

521
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.840
Then he is using it as the hand of God and then he is actually using it as the

522
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:53.160
hand of Jupiter,
right as the bat hand as the faith.
So,

523
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:58.380
um,
video discussed this at great deal.
It's,
it's three of fun.
Ah,

524
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.790
okay.
Then John Stuart Mill and in fact,
uh,
uh,

525
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.670
how do you tailor who is a companion later wife,
very important for his room.

526
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.450
Now he was born in London,
uh,
um,

527
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.740
and it was actually brought up by Jeremy Bentham.

528
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.480
Um,
uh,
Jeremy Benton,
uh,
um,

529
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.150
uh,
is,
uh,
uh,
the,

530
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:29.160
the theory is to created what later was coined by John Stuart Mill

531
00:38:29.161 --> 00:38:31.860
utilitarianism.
Uh,
the idea,

532
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.980
the central idea of Benton is,
um,
that,
uh,

533
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.133
Vr,

534
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.150
<v 1>okay.</v>

535
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.200
<v 0>All of us seek pleasure and try to avoid pain.</v>

536
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:48.600
That's what explains Human Behavior Utility is this is what we want to avoid.

537
00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:52.860
And the correct action is to maximize pleasure,
minimize pain.

538
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.600
Uh,
now,
uh,
uh,
uh,

539
00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.320
Neil had a nervous breakdown in 1926.

540
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:06.180
He found a Bantam theory too oppressive.
Um,

541
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:06.480
uh,

542
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.430
he met also Mrs. Hardy at Friedman who was married at that time and had an

543
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.040
interesting triangle,
uh,

544
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.580
Mr. Taylor and Mrs. Taylor and,

545
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:21.300
and meal until Mr. Taylor died and that's when they actually got married.

546
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:26.750
Um,
how do your tiller of,
was quite a feminist until the big impact,
uh,

547
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.750
on the thinking graph of Jon Stewart,
the mail.
How do you died?
Unfortunately,

548
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:35.420
very early.
Um,
uh,
um,
and the meal,
uh,

549
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:40.410
later on,
uh,
ruled his most important book after it had,
he had a desk,

550
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:44.370
but probably greatly influenced by Harriet Taylor.

551
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:48.750
Now he's very,
he established a utility Italian society,

552
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.850
but eventually became a revisionist.
Um,
um,
um,
because,

553
00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:54.943
uh,
uh,

554
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.670
explain it in a minute because he said that are really higher values,

555
00:39:59.671 --> 00:40:04.410
which are also utilities rather than just a seeking pleasures.

556
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:08.250
Um,
uh,
he wrote the,
uh,
on liberty,

557
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:13.560
on utilitarianism,
and finally on the subjection of women.

558
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.200
Um,
uh,

559
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.160
the most important work is probably his work on subjection of the man,

560
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:22.973
which is a,

561
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.830
<v 1>uh,
uh,</v>

562
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:32.100
<v 0>inspired many feminists even up to this day.
Um,
uh,</v>

563
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.133
uh,
Eh,

564
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:38.530
he argued that women Antarctic actually worse in their conditions than slaves

565
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.690
because,
uh,
uh,

566
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:45.730
men expected in uneven love rather than just obedience and can least from slaves

567
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:51.400
they don't expect love.
That's the bottom line.
Then Karl Marx,

568
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:56.230
well,
uh,
was born in my 18,
18.

569
00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.340
I studied the barn and Berlin,
uh,

570
00:41:00.341 --> 00:41:05.140
I probably can rush through off his life,
probably better known than others.

571
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.860
Met with 44.
Frederick Engels.
Um,

572
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.930
I was expelled from France for revolutionary activities.
49.

573
00:41:13.931 --> 00:41:18.570
He moves to London and became involved in politics.
Uh,

574
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.830
and,
uh,
then,
uh,

575
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.740
finally died in 1883 and his major works.

576
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.370
Patty's manuscripts,
you will be reading from young marks,

577
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:34.520
um,
uh,
about alienation,
the German ideology,

578
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:38.000
the foundations of what the Scots historical materialism,

579
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.280
the communist manifesto,
a band flat,
which is UV or read from it,

580
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:47.840
some steel interesting arguments.
And finally,
the major work,

581
00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.050
the scrappy Tom,
this is a strappy towel.

582
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:55.550
And I just skip the rest of 'em.
Uh,

583
00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.760
and go on to Frederick Nicha because I'm already running out of time now and

584
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:05.250
each of us 44,
um,
as a,
uh,

585
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.740
sign off a Lutheran Minister,
uh,

586
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.900
studied at the University of Bonn of what the vibe was.

587
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.990
A professor at Basel met,

588
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:20.120
became great friends with 300 Wagner then became bitter enemies liter on.

589
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:21.841
And I'd be like,

590
00:42:21.841 --> 00:42:26.760
explained to you what is the reason of friendship and an arm is anonymous.

591
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.130
You see,
at the Burger,
he actually got a nervous breakdown,

592
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.750
uh,
and the last 10 years of his life he was just out of touch.

593
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.810
He was insane.
Um,
uh,
his major is,

594
00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.830
what we will be discussing was it didn't make it seven.

595
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.850
It is the genealogy largely off models.
Um,

596
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.530
and again,
I've,
you'll have to skip a of Arthur.

597
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.740
His contributions are,
he is first,

598
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:59.950
first of the postmodern theorist he questions slide absolute rationality.

599
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.810
And a major bottom line is all knowledge is from a certain perspective,

600
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.000
including the moral values,

601
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.750
cannot be rooted in some universalistic principles.

602
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:17.080
Zigman fried and there's another auto vivia be dealing with.
Born in 5,600,

603
00:43:17.081 --> 00:43:21.890
a very,
very long life.
Moved to Vienna.
I studied medicine.
Um,

604
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.690
and of course discovered psychoanalysis,
uh,
uh,
uh,

605
00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.390
um,
and,
uh,
uh,

606
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.540
created the Viennese psychoanalytic society.

607
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:36.540
Still a major movement.
38 left lawn,
uh,

608
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:42.230
Vienna for London.
Uh,
his major versus the first one,

609
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:47.180
the studies on few stereo.
This is van psychoanalysis to be discovered.

610
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.570
The interpretation of Dean,
uh,

611
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.500
dreams in 88 [inaudible] on sexuality.

612
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.350
Um,
and the two papers,

613
00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:02.351
what we will be reading from ego and ear and civilization and discontent.

614
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.520
Um,
again,
I,
I have,
you're just KIPP,
right?
Uh,
uh,

615
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:09.290
we'll put this on the internet.

616
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:14.770
A brief summary of ego and ed and civilization and discontent.

617
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.960
A just very briefly,
Max Faber,

618
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:21.440
I'm a German historian,

619
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.540
a legal theorist and sociologist born in Frankfurt,
uh,

620
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.380
studied at Heidelberg and Ausra.
Um,
uh,
had uh,

621
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.920
or nervous breakdown,
recovers it from

622
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:42.590
92 beginning to work on a religion and rice economy are so savvy,

623
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.540
right in 1920.

624
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.900
The major keys about UV or be reading the Protestant ethic and 1903 19 or four

625
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:56.730
and section soft is major unfinished work if kind of immune society.

626
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.140
Again,
I just skip and go to our last order.

627
00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:05.010
Emil Durkheim,
a French social scientist.

628
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:09.640
I was born in 58 and as a son of a rabbi,
um,

629
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.600
but became an eighth Aisley,

630
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.610
turned on and re re converted back to religion as a New Jersey to later in life.

631
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.760
Uh,
was a professor and France,
the major we're excited about.
You've,

632
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.320
you'll be reading from the division of Labor.

633
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:30.900
Then the rules of sociological mattered.
His wonderful book,
the suicide.

634
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:31.950
Um,

635
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.930
and what you view might be reading from four is elementary form of religious

636
00:45:36.931 --> 00:45:41.760
life.
So that's about the course.
And I hope very much.
I didn't scare you.

637
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.710
I've made you entrusted in it.

638
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:48.200

639
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.860
Ski Model,
