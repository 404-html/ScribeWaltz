Speaker 1:          00:01          Good morning. Yeah. Um, well I think it is high time that you start thinking about your final paper. And let me just one more time, uh, value what my expectation is a right, there are three major blocks in the course for each of the blocks. That is a test you have done. I have one more we'll be done last week of classes. Um, um, I mean the idea of the paper is that you do a little more ambitious, very crowds. You link, um, uh, two of the blocks to it, to each other. So you compare, uh, harps, theory of human nature with the Durkheim's theory of human nature or Harps Russo and Durkheim or something like this. Um, or, um, uh, you look at the vision of power in Hops, Snitcher and vapor, right? Uh, do two or three orders as such. Um, uh, I also highly recommend you that you, um, uh, goal.

Speaker 1:          01:16          What excites you the most? Uh, you pick a topic, what you find exciting. If there was anything in this course, what made you excited, right about it, right? And you can use, uh, uh, earlier, uh, asset topics. What you brought up, that's no problem. Uh, that there'll be a new paper. Anyway, I had the class, you have to link occasionally by distant Otros to each other and talk to your discussion section leader or send an email. It can be very short, uh, just to make sure that you are on the right, um, uh, uh, right trajectory, right? And probably your discussion section leader of you. I'll give you just a two sentence response to say, yes, this seems to be fine or no, you are taking on too many at the law. Too many orders. Why don't you do only two or three rather than five, what you suggested or avail, uh, you know, you should be a little more ambitious, right?

Speaker 1:          02:15          This is the kind of feedback you should expect and advise. And let me also say that one more time. Uh, uh, you know, was in discourse. Uh, we want to make this abstract dude is relevant to your life. So therefore don't shy away if you have opinions, if you can reflect how, uh, the course, uh, um, uh, helped or did not help to understand yourself in society. Do so. Right. Um, uh, but I think you really should, uh, a doctor, your discussion section leader or email at least on email, um, uh, before you leave for the vacation because, um, uh, I want van the you, you were out of tired of Turkey or you had enough a beer and watching a football and then you want to have fun, then you can start working on your final paper, right? You don't leave it to the very end, right? But you can use your spare time during Thanksgiving break to get started on it. And that's not a big deal. You know, we want you to do something like six store, uh, more state beaches, but more like six pages. This is not really much more than, you know, the usual tests and assays. Okay. Um, is that all clear and the question about this?

Speaker 1:          03:46          No. Anyway, maybe we'll try to be as on bureaucratic about this as a, in a bureaucratic organization, you can be all right. As you have seen in this course, we've trying to break the rules of bureaucracy and hopefully not at the expense of efficiency or, right. So this is labor on the labor theory on class and um, Liz is probably neighbor next to Mark's is the most influential theory of class, um, uh, and the ad or saw on a collision course with each other. Uh, correlation of course in many ways, uh, uh, Ivy will elaborate on this, but just to foreshadow, uh, uh, uh, that are really cool fun theory, fundamentally important issues where Markson Vapor, these Agri marks, as you recall, identified classes in property relationship I had, the class I caught on me was between those who own capital and those who own only their labor power.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Vi Bird in contrast defines classes on the marketplace as Marcus situations. So the relationship, uh, this would be more complicated, but then the class relationship is between the employer and the employee. It is between the manager and the worker and not the owner. Right. And, uh, uh, the possessor of labor power. Then march, also sad of l a or history of human Candice, history of class struggles. So vapor has a of Marx has a theory of class, which is overarching the whole human history. The is very specific about this class is a modern phenomenon. Classes only emerged with the emergence of the market economy. Market capitalism before capitalism that are, they are not the stratification system is not based on class, but it is based on status and talking about, uh, the notion of staters and grade there. And finally that is obscured, important political difference.

Speaker 1:          06:05          Marx believed that the class struggle gets more intense over time and therefore the subordinated class, eventually you'll revolt and overthrow capitalism. They were believed, uh, that uh, the in the opposite, uh, a class struggle is the most intense in early stages, rough stages of capitalism. And as capitalism becomes consolidated and bureaucratized, class struggle is the actually reduced. Um, so these are the three fundamental differences. And this is the outline of the presentation, uh, today. Uh, so first of all I want to talk about the usual interpretation of vapor and I want to challenge these interpretation. Uh, if you ever took a course in which Weber's theory of class was discussed, you usually had the interpretation. What I pleasant. Now, if you go on the Internet and you find what vapor got about class, this is what you get. I disagree with it. Um, and, uh, IVL tried to show you why this is the wrong approach.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Uh, the usual interpretation goes back to a British sociologists that, uh, um, uh, Runciman who wrote about this or that in the 1960s, um, uh, uh, he's still active actually. And, uh, he interpreted the Labor as a offering, a theory of social inequality. Uh, in three dementia. It's, uh, again, go on the Internet, 90% of, uh, Internet posting on vapor and the Class V or give you this view what our dose three dimensions, status or prestige is one dimension. The second is class, uh, usually defined by income or avails. And the third dimension is power. Um, and therefore, if you look at stratification in society, people can be unequal in any of these, uh, uh, can be privileged in any of these dimensions or all of the dimensions as such. Uh, these, uh, Runciman, uh, uh, uh, conceptualization of Weber's theory of class was extremely influential on empirical research.

Speaker 1:          08:39          There was a lot of empirical survey research carried out, which was trying to measure, uh, how people fare in these three dimensions. Um, Gerhard Lenski, uh, who was professor and love and marriage was professor was professor at the University of North Carolina, uh, created a theory of status inconsistency. Um, the idea of was that, uh, um, uh, people actually can be high in one, one of these dimensions and relatively low in another dimension. So for instance, uh, uh, you are a professor of sociology, uh, then, you know, you were prestige is a sort of reasonable, you know, probably somewhat higher than average. Um, if you are a professor that, you know, it's a sort of even a little higher than average, you know, uh, um, substantially higher don't have rich. Now in terms of intercom, you know, if you are a professor of sociology, you will, will be again only slightly higher than average of, you'll not be very high in terms of power hour.

Speaker 1:          09:56          You'll have, you'll be very low in the power hierarchy. Um, at least in the United States, right? Nobody listens. What sociologists are saying, you know, students who have to write and occasionally they have to take a sociology course. That's the only power, the Yali and professor exercises. Now, if you are a Supreme Court justice, uh, then your prestige is extremely high. You are on the top of the pastiche hierarchy, at least in the United States. If you are asking who, what, who is the most prestigious occupation in the United States in surveys, people voc to be a supreme court justice, right? Serve on the Supreme Court. Now, um, in terms of Entercom, the Supreme Court justices probably don't do all that well. They probably do about as university professors do. Uh, right. Um, people in public service usually don't do all that well. I think probably a governor of a state is not your anymore than a university professor, but in terms of power, uh, David would be very high, right?

Speaker 1:          11:08          Supreme Court justices are very high or occasionally they can even at poet tried to president of the United States if I may flag this joke. All right. Anyway, they are very powerful. Well, if you think about a mafioso, the prestige of a godfather except in the mafia will be very low, right? You regard it as criminal. Um, in terms of income, you'll be on the very top, right? In terms of power, well, we will have some power, but mainly in the mafia, not really nationally. You see what they are getting get. So therefore you cannot measure, uh, uh, seizures, class and power three dimensions. And this is very helpful to understand. Vetter, uh, uh, uh, uh, the social status is crystallized, uh, people who have high best. These also have high incomes and high power. And, uh, uh, let's say somebody who is sleeping on the floor, right?

Speaker 1:          12:14          Um, uh, uh, uh, we'll have very low prestige, very low income and low power at all. So that is a useful way how to stratify society for upper, upper class to lower lower class. That is the way how vapor usually it has been used. Now I veal challenge this, uh, uh, uh, uh, I don't think I'm the only one who does challenges. Anthony Giddens I think gets very close to what I'm describing though. Probably he doesn't stick his neck out as much as I do. Um, I, my fundamental argument is that Weber's distinction between class and status is a historical distinction. And this is not accidental that this is an English speaking person. Runciman who reads the notion of status, the way how he reads it. Because if you know a little German and you try to read vapor in German, you know that the word status is actually a translated from the word she's done and she's done the val, it can be translated into English as status, but it's not very good translation of the word.

Speaker 1:          13:34          The better translation is a state. Now, if you would translate dung as a state, it would become obvious that what we is trying to suggest, that that is something our cake about status stratification as distinct from class stratification, which is a modern phenomenon, right? So this will be one of the major points of a time trying to make. And we will try to show this, uh, um, uh, uh, from Viber text. Then, uh, the question is, where is the third dimension? Right? As I said, a status and class art historical categories, but valley spower. Uh, and when I was working on one of my books, I was very much attracted to Runciman Saudia idea and try to interpret vapor and this way. And in fact it appeared to me, agreed deal to use power as an independent dimension. Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, the class position.

Speaker 1:          14:42          Uh, I was trying to understand the social structure of communist societies and their power appears to be an independent dimension. So I was looking into the vapor tax and I read cover to cover economy and society a couple of times and I could not find the term dementia read it. It is not dead. Uh, um, uh, so, uh, trying to understand what FIBA is getting yet. I, you know, I came to the conclusion that for vapor, uh, power is the dependent variable. What he wants to explain their power comes from and veterans power exercised is exercise on the basis of class privileges or whether it is a state to stype of, uh, uh, or s state type of power, which is exercised in society. And this is very consistent, but you already knew about Max Faber, right? Type of authorities where power comes from. What legitimate power, right?

Speaker 1:          15:46          Tradition or legal rational authority, right? Uh, class stratification corresponds to societies based on legal, rational authority status stratification corresponds to traditional authority. All right, well I will, uh, elaborate a little on this. Wheel qualified is somewhat primarily because we were like, uh, in his, uh, uh, types of authority as well. Uh, has two balls in the air at the same time. He has a macro theory, right, of historical variations of stratification for him. Transition From and you know, um, uh, traditional society in modern rational societies is a transition from s state type of stratification to class stratification. But vapor also has a micro theory. He also said, okay, the society today is primarily class stratified, but I can identify status, power in modern societies as well, just exactly as he does with the types of authority. Yes, the United States today is legal, rational authority, but I can spot elements of traditional authority or Charismatic Authority operating Visene, legal, rational authority.

Speaker 1:          17:16          Since it is dominantly legal, rational authority, it will be secondary law. We will make a difference. But traditional tradition in this society, in these very America today does make a difference, right? It is contract venture very well in society. Traditional Authority is consequential, right? Uh, we are all equal before the law, but in practice where we end up has a lot to do with traditional tragedy says th the traditional, they have power up on age. The same goes for, he brings back the idea of status. This is why I've said translating stoned the status is not completely wrong. It only gets the footnote in the vapor concept, right? The fourth north is a stunned, is primarily a historical concept for past traditional societies. But by the way, this is the food note even in contemporary digital sources out society in class, that if I societies that is bowed occasionally exercise on the basis of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, status, uh, valid.

Speaker 1:          18:39          Obviously, you know the power which is exercised by a Supreme Court judge or the power exercise by a university professor, the little one we have that the me probably in some way try to change your mind, right? Which is an act of power. Or some would say even an act of course, if power, right. A booty call the symbolic violence, right? I violate your mind. You know, if I can penetrate your mind and put a new idea into your mind, right? This is an act of power. Now it's primarily done or what grade you done? Well, I stages, uh, that you save l this is a professor who has a phd [inaudible]. Right? Uh, then it is really right. The reason why you started believing me has a lot to do with my status. Hopefully not only the status. Hopefully I can make a good argument then past radio, but occasionally it's a mixture.

Speaker 1:          19:43          Now you tend to believe me or this, believe me. Right? And the very fact of the status, what I, uh, what I am incumbent off, it has something to do, right? Uh, uh, uh, a few, uh, trying to believe your professors. So, uh, uh, let me vary on the notion how vapor defines classes. Um, and the most important issue is the uniquely they bury an idea is that class has to be identified under Marquette. And then Ivo, uh, also say a few words about class interests and how he, to what extent is different from marsh in this respect. So class and market, uh, now here you have Themis definitions and he said class teacher. And is that your mind by Martha Situation? Um, classic tuition is ultimately a market situation and this is very important. Now the of as follows, right? The effects of nature per session per is only the fore runner of the our class formation slaves he's had, or you can say sheriffs out of not a class the hour rather as Steve to school.

Speaker 1:          21:00          Now here you can see by the historical uses of the distinction between class and status, right? Uh, and also the challenge to marks a prop, those who have property and the private room property, uh, do not constitute a class. And the fundamental argument for this is that in traditional societies, it is not really property which puts you into a high status position. You being in a high status position has the concept of events that you are of LC, right? So the king or the queen decides to give you mobility and gives you ns state, right? Um, in capitalism is versus the other way around. In order to become a billionaire, right? You don't have to get the approval of the president of the United States. Simply enough, you go to was cheat. You Invest Your money smartly. You start with $1,000 and the no time you have a billion, right?

Speaker 1:          22:11          If you invested it in a smart way and then you are in the class, right? Or billionaires, right? So here it is your, your property, uh, and your activity on the marketplace, which end helps you to enter the class, right? In the aristocracy, it was a legal act, right? Uh, a political act by a king or the Queen, which made you nobility, made you are lord. And then as a construct vents, you became wealthy, right? It's also interesting. By the way, that event, if you lost your valves that were some poor, noble people, you still repair, re retained. You are, uh, uh, status as state privileges. So if you were mobility in most societies, for instance, you did not have to pay taxes. Now, if you lost all of your estate, you know, because you gambled. For instance, right now you wanted to go to Monte Carlo or you, you gambled everything, go away, then you became very bored.

Speaker 1:          23:18          You were a seal Lobel and you still did not have to write a pay taxes. Your state status be villages remained the opposite, right? Uh, in capitalism you start, eh, poorly investing your money and you lose your money on the stock market, you cease to be a capitalist, right? Then you will have to safe to find a job, right? And since you lost all of your money, who will not find a very good job? Because who wants to hire a loser? Right? Okay. Uh, uh, e this is also a very important citation from vapor. He said, you know, the class position really means that people have common life chances, right? Uh, if, uh, you are located differently that are the positively and negatively, this is the way Berean point positively or negatively privileged positions on the market place. And if you are negatively privileges privilege in their marketplace, your life, chances are not very good, right?

Speaker 1:          24:26          If you are positively privileged, uh, in the market place than your life, chances are great. You guys in this room are Oh, very positively privileged, right? Because you are getting a Yale degree and you know, probably a Harvard degree would be even better for you. Uh, don't tell Rick Levine that I said that in class, right? Um, but, uh, um, uh, uh, this is, you know, about the best degree, what you can have. So you are extremely valid positions on the labor market, right? Your life chances are great, right? You have to make a lot of mistakes to screw this one, right? Yeah. Right? You are on the right trajectory. Um, uh, if you are in a community college, right or you are a high school drop out, then your life chances on the labor market, we will be lousy. Right? Um, um, especially you are poor.

Speaker 1:          25:26          You are African American, you dropped out of high school. Uh, well, uh, your chances that you know, you will end up in jail before you turn 30 is I think 70%. Uh, so, right? This is life chances, right? Rigid that it in this case of course, it is not only class, right? That is a special type of status group, right? Race. It also plays a role right in you that tell you rating life chances. Now, let me also say that the, but actually suggest that you can think of classes on every single market situation. Uh, so, uh, for instance, uh, some people and I, myself in my work have been writing about housing classes that if differences between the owner of a house and the tenant who rents this house is at class, relationship can be interpreted as a class relationship. The landlords very often by the tenants are seen as blessed.

Speaker 1:          26:32          Soccer's right? Because they charge too high rent and they do not maintain your unit properly. You know, when you call them and, and you say that the water dripping and I need a proper, they've, you'll find excuses why they were fixed, you know, your uh, uh, uh, uh, water or by they do not fix your eating right. So they are bloodsuckers right? Uh, and as a tenant you are in a negatively privileged class position. That's true. But on the other hand, Labor is quite clear that there are two important market positions which fundamentally define your class position. Um, and these are the labor market and in fact the capital market, uh, will define where a veteran you are, have good life chances or poor life chances and all other positions on other markets will be consequences if you position primarily on the labor market or on capital markets.

Speaker 1:          27:38          Now this actually brings a vapor and Mark's a little closer than it appeared for the first time, right? Because as we've, you'll see, beaver does acknowledge that if there is a market economy differences in proper, the are very important to creating a class positions. But unlike mark see emphasizes, this is only the case if that is a market economy in place. Now just very briefly about class interests and class action. And here he said, well, the statement by a talented altar, he doesn't tell us who that author is. I assume it must be Karl marks that the individual may be in error concerning his interest, but the class is in a fallible about his interest is false and pseudoscientific. So he said, well, the classes are actually not communities, right of community may have a kind of collective understanding that you belong to a class, uh, just because of your position of the labor market.

Speaker 1:          28:51          And you actually hear, he subscribes to Adam Smith, right? Uh, a class members are individuals acting out of self interest and not acting out of collective interests, but the are in a similar position and therefore they have common class interests and surprise, surprise, or occasionally they will act the same way, right? Because they have a collective interest, but not as a community. But, uh, as rationally acting individuals that share mind by their rational actions, right on the market place. Uh, and therefore he said, well, classes will really exist. How can I tell that the class is really exist? I can tell if I see classes, acting classes, Metro allies in action, right? Because I speculatively cannot make any class distinction. But people VR made distinctions for classes by acting upon their class interest. Now let's go onto the ration of status groups. What our status groups and a bell.

Speaker 1:          30:08          I briefly want to identify who status groups, our spot status privileges are, and then a c two stratification, um, uh, and the cast and question of ethnicity in Weber's. So what is the status group? Well, unlike classes, status group or skin there, this is the pollute all of the done the uh, momentally groups. Um, uh, seaters groups means that you belong to a group, right? And you have a high esteem and you have a solid additive is in the group. You have an honor. A certain honor is attribute it to you when you are in a status group, right? You are initiated right into becoming a noble man by an act of the king or the Queen. Um, uh, well, uh, uh, in order to get a university degree, you are initiated right into a status group. You know, they do earn a university degree, a bachelor's degree, a phd is entering in some ways as a state role.

Speaker 1:          31:20          It's not accidental that we were this funny, you know, medieval robes on those ceremonies where uh, the degree is conferred on you and many professions which require formal university training act as a state has growth. Uh, like the doctors constitute write a status group like, uh, uh, in some ways university professors, uh, constitute with the status group. Lawyers constituted a status group and they somehow control attic sent entrance into the law profession, right? Um, uh, the, uh, you have to pass a board exam if you want to become a lawyer, right? And in fact, states three all cause make, you know, in California, if you want to move to California, you want to get a law degree and you want to move to California, you'll be a sweat blood, right to pass the board exam. If you want to go to South Dakota, [inaudible] easily passed the board exam because there are not many lawyers who want to be lawyers in South Dakota, but there are many lawyers who want to be lawyers in San Francisco and therefore the board, California board, we'd be much stricter than the South Dakota board.

Speaker 1:          32:40          The same goes for, uh, medical eye exams, right? And it would be, um, again, you have to pass exams. Um, and uh, we will be different depending on the labor market ocean. And it's very important. The C to his honor is best expressed with specific lifestyle that they, how you dress, the way how you eat, uh, the way how you behave is constituting what is status group traditionally, right? Mobile men could wear arms, snow mobiles couldn't. Um, um, and uh, uh, well if you are a year professor, You Vale, uh, j press, right? Uh, uh, I mean, not everybody does, but you know, it's, you, you can tell this is a year. ProfessorB , you can see this as a cheap j press, um, uh, um, coat. Uh, so there are writer, uh, lifestyles. Uh, um, uh, but in a way, even in modern society constitute status groups.

Speaker 1:          33:48          Even with, since class stratification, you have these uniquely, you know, lifestyle specific stuff, but you adapt in order to belong to these status group kind of subgroup in a class. So if you are a Yuppie young, urban professional, right? You get a nice job on Wall Street, you move to Manhattan, right? Then you rent out, try it or buy a condo somewhere in a Trump building, right? Then you want to be driven by a limo to your workplace. You've, you'll be reading Wall Street Journal and you will be going, right? And you'll VOB having crossed arms for the morning, right? And you'll see what I'm getting yet, right? Yeah. You'll be, you'll be dressed in a certain way. People can tell, right, this person must be a broker. Right? On Wall Street, there are these lifestyle characteristics, but in a way creates an almost status group. You know each other, right?

Speaker 1:          34:55          You recognize each other, right? There are places where you hang together, right? There are Erp places. You look outside and you know, this is a Yuppie Brown field with grps. This is the lifestyle and by this shoe as them. And that also of course status privileges, um, uh, which is ideal and material goods, which is the consequence of you being in that status group read or uh, uh, then, uh, the source of it. Uh, and there are also specific special employment opportunities. If you belong to a status group and it's being controlled way. I mean, adequate profession is a very good example. It's being actually the Beatty. Then questions, why on earth do we need a system in which people have to have registered, you know, do have to have a medical degree in order to practice medicine, right? Uh, why owners, people who have to have a law degree in order to appear in court and the fence, somebody in court, right?

Speaker 1:          36:01          These are kind of status grew up, uh, uh, uh, uh, barriers to enter, uh, uh, the sister. Well, the market on the other hand knows no personal distinction. Well, under market it matters whether you are successful or you are a failure, right? And therefore, if you have the status group kind of privileges, this is a limitation on the functioning of the market, right? And therefore stronger the status groups are, if he can be a hindrance of free development of a market economy. And now an idea about the Kras and that necessity. He said if the boundaries between car, uh, uh, status groups are particularly sharp re drone in that case we can talk about casts the caste differences occur. For instance, when that APP low emissions to intermarry between cast a lower cash, I'll usually seen as polluted as dirty. You even cannot touch them.

Speaker 1:          37:10          Or if you ha you did touch a low class person, let's say an Indian culture, you have to go some purification procedures. Uh, right. Uh, and he said, uh, status group segregation grows into cast. That dance forms a horizontal coexistence of ethnically segregated groups into a vertical social system. Uh, uh, this is also very important, right? His notion of ethnicity. It's a very, uh, very innovative idea in writing this around 1920 about this I, the, the differences are held to be ethnic on based on the belief that it has something to do with blood relations, right? He does not believe, right, that ethnic differences really have anything to do with the blood relations. You have ethnical racial differences, then that is a common belief that blood relations do matter and are socially construct venture. He doesn't believe it is now class and status compared, uh, um, uh, I, um, sort of running out of time drawn from to, uh, uh, operate on to do too much on this. Uh, uh, the, the point right that, uh,

Speaker 2:          38:36          uh, uh, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          38:43          that is some kind of stability in state to stratification a class certification is dynamic and, and conflict shores. This is where his idea of your come from that in fact, uh, uh, um, uh, class relationships are not becoming more antagonistic over time, but it's becoming less antagonistic over time. But the point is, as you can see that the main point is that there are two basic stratification system, one based on uh, uh, status or Shonda. And the other one is a, um, class stratification historical difference. But that is also a type of stratification in a class stratified society based on status differences. So what are he makes a distinction between different types of classes. Let me just briefly how, Gosh through off it. He does not negate that. That is actually a class based on property that is actually the property differences can be very substantial as long as the upper think in a market place.

Speaker 1:          40:00          If you know your property can be sold or bought, which was not the case under feudalism. And if that is a labor market which complements capital markets, then differences in capital markets is the source of, uh, uh, differences. Uh, um, um, uh, but the most important distinction is what he calls commercial classes. And commercial classes are based right on the market situation, um, and particularly, uh, specially based on labor markets. And therefore the Basic Class Distinction for vapor in modern society is between management and employees rather than owners of Capitol and owners of labor power online marks. And that I think is, uh, uh, very insightful argument, at least an important, uh, uh, qualification on marsh are probably a used for replacement of marks with a better fitting theory to understand modern societies. Okay. Uh, and then that are, he introduces the notion of social classes that is a type of class in modern society, which is social class and social class people out in a social class situation.

Speaker 1:          41:24          Then individual and generational mobility is easy. And typically we see in that class. Uh, and then he said, well, what are social classes? And interestingly, he said, well, these as examples are working class is a social class. The petty bourgeoisie is a social class. The basic argument here is that, uh, you know, working class is not a commercial class working class or valleys writing 19th century, but it's, this is still to some extent true, uh, in the United States today, probably the least. So in the u s uh, than in other economies. Then, you know, um, uh, being working class was certainly very true in Europe. Um, uh, probably less so now, but even during the second half of the 20th century in Italy and France, that it was a very strong working class consciousness. You are proud of being working class in the u s the term working class hardly exist, right?

Speaker 1:          42:28          We are talking about the working people rather than a hurricane class, but in Italy or in France where it's a very strong identity of being a working class, very clearly identifiable lifestyle features. Now that if in fact in the United States you can't really, you usually can tell, I think with 90% certainty if you walk into a tavern, right? Um, or you know who, who is a manual work and who is not a manual very care, right? The way how people behave, the way how people dress, it gives you a very good clue. And you know, in France or in Italy to some extent, even in the United States, uh, you know, working class, if you'll say, well, it was good enough for me to be plumper. Why owners? My son doesn't want to be a plumper and continue my business as a plumber. That's good enough.

Speaker 1:          43:21          Right? If it was good enough for me, it should be good enough for my son and other, you know, how he understands the social class as a, as distinct from economic class. You become a social class when you say, well you are in working class and uh, uh, your daughter is dating a lawyer. He will say, can't you find a decent working class guy? Uh, you want to date with this ache had again, in the United States it is much less common, right? That is many more metro mobility across class lines, much less so, uh, in Italy, uh, or uh, or in France even, even today. Uh, anyway, this is social class. But as you can see social class in a way, bringing back the idea of status groups. It is a modern version of status group, but is being constituted as a social class cause it has a lot to do bit lifestyles, values, culture, right? And typical patterns of mobility and the aspirations. Um, uh, such bell, that's about it. Thank you very much.
