Speaker 1:          00:01          Now, uh, uh, also I would like to spend a couple of minutes, uh, kind of wrapping up some, uh, issues, uh, about, uh, the four orders of what we covered in that test, right? Uh, Mark Snitcher Fried and labor. Um, uh, just to help you to get that overall sense right for the bottom line is and what the similarities and differences are. And then I go into Max Faber. There is a lot dive on to cover today. Would love to talk a lot about his life. I won't have time. Uh, I could give you a lot of my stem juicy stories, what I have, but I, I unfortunately I, I have to be told myself. Ah, okay. So the four alters, um, that is one important common feature in all four quarters. And some of these things from the theorist we studied so far, uh, in one way or another or four of them can be called critical theorist.

Speaker 1:          01:10          That means they are offer critical analysis of what is in your mind. They say what is in your mind is not necessarily what you think it is. Less subjects, your consciousness to critical scrutiny. I think all four do share these argument, right? Um, mark, certainly even the idea that, well, the dominant ideas of each ebook are the ideas of the dominant class. Um, and therefore you think what is in your mind is your idea. They tell me what your class position is and diabetes tell you value your ideas are coming from right. Uh, now, uh, uh, uh, this is an hs project and he said, well, you sing, this is mortality. I will show the immorality of morality. What you think is more, right. Uh, this is certainly fried you thing. This is your ideas. Well, they all my couch and I talked to me and I will, you have, you'll recall all these early sexual experiences in your life and then you will realize, uh, what, who you really are.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Well, you know, um, vapor is a little more complicated, but uh, he also has this idea of legitimacy and domination with some later Marxists speak on this. And the fundamental idea of vapor is coming also from nature in the fundamental idea is that we actually do internalize the very principles of our submission. That's what legitimacy, at least in my interpretation in Vba is that his domination, right? And therefore vapor is also helps you to understand, right where these ideas are coming from and to what extent you yourself are you own jail keeper, right? As sort of mine a little postmodernist reading of Max Faber. Um, so these are this in this way they are or critical theory stride the architects, the architects of consciousness, but there are fundamental differences between the four authors. Um, and in some ways, uh, there is a similarity between marks and fried Marx and Freud all thick. They're point of departure in their project to be critical of consciousness for sensors, human experience, right? Material or reality in one way or another. They are both materialists, right? Um, of course four marks. It is reductionist because the sensors, human experience is reduced to the economy.

Speaker 2:          04:27          Uh,

Speaker 1:          04:29          you tell me about your position in the economic system are then, I understand when you have economic interests, Trad, you are behaving and you are thinking according to your economic interest and then ivy law, understand what is on your mind. Now, by the way, it's not all that different, right? From Adam Smith's and rationally actor, rationally acting individuals. Maurice has some similarities. All the offers it critically by Adam Smith's Fr the affirmatively. But that is Mark's reductionism, that what is sensors like? Experience is reduced to the economy. And then he also has an agency that's the big, uh, uh, unique feature of Marx theory. He knows what will society is, does not describe in much detail, but has an idea about good society. And he knows who the historical agent is, will be lead us there. I mean, many of you were probably turned off by his vision of the future, but the strengths of the theories that he has a vision of good society and he knows how to get there. So those of you who are looking for answers, Karl Marx does have answers for you right

Speaker 2:          05:53          now. Uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          05:58          what about, uh, uh, uh, uh, fried? He does not quite have answers to you, right? Man, you want to on his couch, right? Uh, he helps you to discover the rep fest, these jars in yourself, and then it will help you to get rid of your depression, anxieties, hysteria or whatever you are suffering from. Right. But it, there'll be up to you right, to somehow figuring out what is for the oppressed and we only will help you to find it. Right. And does he have a very clearly defined good society? He has sort of ambiguous attitudes about this, right? A CV [inaudible] modern civilization. Well this is coming from repression. CBLI physician has a lot to do, how people are being controlled. On the other hand, he knows out of the Ed, a lot of nasty, aggressive stuff is coming from and they have to be wrapped breast.

Speaker 1:          07:13          So he has a kind of ambiguous, our attitude. He does not want to go against civilization, but he sees the dark side of civilization at the same time. Now what these common uh, in, uh, um, uh, nature and vapor that they all depart from this idea, right? Uh, that it is sensors, experiences from which you have to understand, right? What's wrong with your consciousness? There. Central concern is power, right? Power and domination. It is not the economy, it is not sexuality. It is power. And interestingly, in some ways, therefore they've probably reach back all the way to hops, right? That all history of human candy struggle around Bowel Hour. Now this is the most radical he done by nature because what Nicha is doing right? He shows you how the most to noble ideas, but you have in your mind are actually manufacturer, right in the workshop of ideals, in very mass.

Speaker 1:          08:39          You Vase by course shern right? Uh, by torture and he shows you this instrument of growers. Um, uh, if the, he's sturdy of, uh, uh, the, the Museum of Historical Museum of Marx is filled up with the means of production. You go into a museum, you can see the life, right? How people lived, what that house was, but the instruments where they produce their livelihood. You'll see this, a lot of contemporary museums, which are not Marxists, but still inspired by these Marxian idea niches museum there. Well, you'll feel fine. Guillotines right? Be, you'll find all these instrument of torture. That's human history. The history of torture. And that's, that is an interesting similarity between a Viber and nature, namely, that the history of humankind is evolution. But this evolution has its downside. Our bodies may not be tortured any longer in modern civilization, but our souls are kept hostage. That's the bad news right now.

Speaker 1:          10:06          Uh, uh, I think that's in a nutshell, I think the kind of similarities and differences of the four [inaudible] we covered for these tests. And I don't think I have more time to deal with this. So let's now go to Max Faber. Um, and I am actually very sensitive. Somebody asked a question, a veteran, um, uh, the, uh, uh, on, on, on the desk, the question on domination, should it be the Ivr be thinking very hard about this. In fact, if you still have a very much disliked questions, send me an email and by will try to take this into consideration. Okay. So this is Max Faber, uh, born in 1864 and died in a 19 or 20. Um, uh, well nowadays with flu shots, he would not have died. He just died of pneumonia. It probably would have lived longer. Fortunately, he did not because he did not leave Nazi-ism.

Speaker 1:          11:13          And we do not have to ask the unpleasant question. Worth have Max Faber third into BMFC I doubt, but there are some who believe he might have. And vivio we'll talk about this later at all. So a word about the Max Faber family. Uh, this is a Protestant family who live in the city of Sal's work, be, it was, which was in the Habsburg Empire. It was actually an independent city, uh, ruled by an archbishop, very Catholic city. And by the late 18th century, these arch bishop started to take, uh, uh, counter that for Nisha to seriously. So therefore, those who were not Roman Catholic better left suited the vapor family. And they moved to Germany in the Rhineland and they settled in Bielefeld and they set up a textile manufacturing business, which operated pretty good. Uh, Weber's fodder. Max Senior was the younger of two songs and the family business though it was doing okay.

Speaker 1:          12:25          It was not enough to support two families. Therefore, he was asked to, uh, uh, learn some trade. So he, uh, uh, actually entered CVL service and became a politician and Seville server. Um, uh, Max Faber himself was born in 64 in air force, uh, um, in the eastern part of Germany where his father was stationed at that time. And, uh, his mother of us, Helen enough Steen, a very sensitive, wonderful woman. There were eight brothers and sisters, a big family and quite a family. Uh, here you have a, the three brothers, um, uh, Max on the left and the middle, afraid vapor, afraid vapor was quite a scholar. He was a younger brother of Max and he was a very prominent economist, philosopher and sociologist, Bri, primarily economist who was val northern for the theory of industrial location in his times. He was a professor that University of Heidelberg.

Speaker 1:          13:36          He did not turn into a Nazi. He was actually laid off by the Nazis and there is a statute in eight, 1945. Those of you who study in economics, industrial relation theory may have comment close the name of Alfred Vapor. He was actually the femurs vapor. Max Faber was less famous in his Stein then Alfred. Uh, now Max Weber's mother was Halena, as I said, she was a wonderful lady and, uh, she was a devil with Calvinists. So now you can understand the role of Calvinism in the Protestant ethic in the waiver, um, and, uh, uh, was also greatly interested in philanthropy. And that's where Weber's social sensitivity is coming from. Uh, there was a great deal of conflict between the sensitive Helena and, uh, uh, Max's senior who was a very auditory Italian paternalistic figure. It a very unpleasant guy, political yours, so extremely conservative. And they had quite a bit of, uh, uh, uh, conflict 50 charter early in his life. Max sided with his father did devote fried sad you will do when you would overcome your early posts complex to identify you with your father. Okay, this is what he did. But then he actually shifted and eventually started with, with his murderer. Well, this is the father. Well, I would not have liked him as my father.

Speaker 2:          15:15          Um, uh, um, uh,

Speaker 1:          15:19          he was a conservative politician, uh, a very patriarchal figure, a very, he watched, started in the municipality as a cvs servant in air foot. Then became actually a deputy of the National Liberal Party, which had very little to do with liberalism. It was a conservative party.

Speaker 2:          15:40          Um, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          15:43          uh, this was under the chancellorship of auto phone, the Bismarck at the Ireland Chancellor, real conservative times in Germany.

Speaker 2:          15:54          MMM.

Speaker 1:          15:56          Now, uh, about Weber's lives. Uh, he studied in Heidelberg and then in Berlin, uh, he studied in both law and agrarian history. Uh, uh, actually he was some valid between a legal theories that historian, um, and an economist. He was kind of sociologists, uh, last, uh, uh, in 92, he married Marianna Schnittger, who was a kind of second cousin, Ivo come back to this relationship. Later on, uh, in 95, he was appointed professor of economics at Fribourg, and then he moved to Heidelberg that he basically spent the rest of his life. Um, uh, he also became a professor of political science. Um, uh, he was involved early in his life in very feverish acronym, uh, academic activities. He published two Phd dissertation, one in law and one in history. Uh, the law, the law phd was on commercial law in medieval Italy. And, uh, the, uh, history was on agrarian history in the room walls, books were published. The, um, uh, and the are actually not in English. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          17:18          Um, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          17:21          liter version of, uh, the agrarian history was published in [inaudible] 97. He suffered a very serious, a nervous breakdown. I would love to talk in detail about this. Uh, by all likelihood, it had a lot to do with his conflict with his father. Uh, just during the summer of 97, um, uh, uh, the modern visited, he visited the patterns in and then the mother said, well, I want to visit you in Heidelberg. And then the father said, no, you can't because I need you here. Right. Uh, who via cook my breakfast. Uh, and then Max Faber, who was over as a subservient that there'll be the, unto the father, Rev, Walter Reed. And he said, father, you can't do that. If modern wants to visit us, she should be allowed to visit us. And this happened the first time that Max Weber's said no to the father where the father pastor of seen two or three months and just after the death of the father of Labor had a very serious nervous breakdown.

Speaker 1:          18:33          Now, Novar knows exactly what it had to do with the desks of the father, but there is certainly a correlation between the two facts. Uh, it was actually a very serious, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, disease. Uh, he was lucky to be married to a Vonda food and extremely smart woman, Marianna. Uh, they married in, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, earlier and Mariana was a great help for him to recover from this nervous breakdown for five years. Bieber could not teach, could not write good, not read. He will just sitting in the corner staring he had of himself. Uh, Mariana took him to travelers, they went to Italy and eventually he discovered 92. He's coming out of his nervous breakdown and recurrence to Heidelberg, though he never really took on very regular teaching youths anymore. Now 18 or four, he had his only trip to the USA event to the Saint Louis.

Speaker 1:          19:44          Worth Fair and Rotor Vonda food paper at that time. Um, and then, uh, in 1906, uh, um, again, I wish I would have more time to talk about the [inaudible] sisters. This is a great story and the way he obviously falls in love with Elsa Fondrick restore fan as up on [inaudible] was actually the wife, uh, uh, um, uh, a good friend and colleague of Vapor, uh, [inaudible], uh, uh, major, uh, political, uh, social theories. Well, this is a very important event in Babers life is slashed some dealer his desk. It is actually not Marianna who is standing by his desk bad about as I found Rico Fan. Uh, interestingly Al's and Marianna, very, very good friends. So, uh, again, I cannot resist to give you a little gossip, but the best as we know, uh, the marriage with Mariana was never consumed. So these are fair with as a phone. Rico fan is really the first real full field Aerotek experience in Weber's life and has a lot to do, I think in VBS, changing thinking about life, um, and modernity, the rediscovery of the power of eroticism.

Speaker 1:          21:09          Um, uh, then he has been doing work, uh, on religion. Uh, and this is mainly a response to criticism he got for his book. We will be trotting in a minute about the Protestant ethic and he trusts to the fender, uh, his very on, uh, uh, uh, the Protestant ethic by looking at various world religions and shows that rationalization did not take place in these religions as much as it happened in Christianity. And then he's working in his opal smuggle norm, uh, economy. And so sadly, what he never finished a, um, uh, uh, died in 19 trente where all this is Elsa from restore fund misses the Alpha. Um, uh, uh, she came from a very prominent German family. There were three very prominent and very beautiful Rico fan sisters. Um, uh, as I said, Elsa was the vie for Fed God [inaudible] or her sister Frieda from recto fun, uh, how the long and very passionate relationship eventual marriage bit DH Lawrence and probably many of you in high school have red DH Lawrence and sons in lovers sounds in lovers, was inspired by Frida phone.

Speaker 1:          22:33          Recto fan was a very durable and complicated relationship. Uh, well this is a Vba in Heidelberg, uh, last time in his life. Um, uh, the early version labor was mainly in antiquity in 1903 and four heroes, the Protestant ethic, then the big world religions, China, India and Judaism. And then finally economy and society. And on the finished manuscript. This is the first edition of the Protestant ethic. Uh, well I think I probably skip this one because I've, you're talking to the Protestant that later now this is the vapors housing Heidelberg. As you can see, University of Heidelberg Treaty that professors quite nice. Um, well, uh, Marianna was running us alone in this house, uh, with, uh, uh, extra ordinary intellectual circle around them. This is Mariana Vapor. Um, uh, she was, as I said, a wonderful woman. Um, uh, uh, he was actually kind of second cousin that his grandfather was a, the, uh, Max Weber's fodder.

Speaker 1:          23:54          Uh, uh, uh, she was also a formidable intellectual. Her book vives and moderates in the evolution of law was a great success. Um, Emile Durkheim reviewed the book and at that time, Ariana was much more famous than Max Faber was a Max Stern, quite nationalistic, as many other Germans during the first world war. But then he's experiences of the horrors of the first world war. And partially I think the relationship as a from Niko Fan, um, uh, tourance him from a committed liberal, uh, who just had nothing else to see, but approving things about modernity. Uh, somebody, we Scott a liberal and in despair, he remains liberal for his life, if you will over say that capitalism is the only viable system we can live in. Modernity has new alternative, but he beginning increasingly the, to show the downside of these modernity. He said, I cannot come up with anything better, but it should not prevent me to see that this enchantment, the lost of magic in the modern world and the horrors of the modern world.

Speaker 1:          25:14          A review you're talking about this, uh, uh, later on, uh, he actually nationalism or had impact on him. Uh, he actually was a part of the delegation at the Versailles peace gt and he was responsible for inserting article 48 into the very Marcos situation, which unfortunately was used for Hitler to gain power in 1930 to see, I mean, that's that waiver camp Shelby, how they're responsible for Nazis. And this is something I have to share with you. Well, uh, the last work economy and society is mainly a theory of domination and Vivia of talking about, uh, next week while domination is, he basically combines power, which has legitimated is the concept of domination. And what he does, he develops a theory, a fair human history has subsegment types of domination. So that major departure for marks, right? The social history is not describes as subset when more so production, but different types of domination. Okay. So that was the life and Varick Max Faber. And now let's smoke, turn into, uh, the Protestant ethic and try to do this in 20 minutes, which we are not be easy.

Speaker 3:          26:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:13          So this is a I city covers from the, uh, nervous breakdown. His first major book is the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism. And that's in many ways a major departure before the nervous breakdown. A Viber s is an enthusiast stick pro capitalist, Stan [inaudible]. Um, uh, his major concern before 1980, 97 is what blocks to development in the eastern part of Germany and how those forces which block the development of capitalism can be overcome is very much a liberal in the sense of Adam Smith and John Stewart, the male. Then he asks his nervous breakdown and the person who is a merging looks like a person who has been thinking about Nicha right. Why staring ahead of himself agreed deal. And that beginning to show already in the Protestant Ethic Bell, uh, he was working at a time when Marx's was the dominant intellectual force in Germany. The Social Democratic Party in Germany was gay, gaining ground and beginning to do extremely val after election says vow and therefore, uh, uh, in my reading Max v Birth project is to challenge Marxism in a fundamental ways.

Speaker 1:          28:42          And the Protestant attic is a first and major step in the, the action to challenge mark sees me. So what is the marks? They bird that bay. If you are injured us sit in a it ivy or teach a seminar next semester, which will only deal with this slide. What I'm presenting here to tell you I bought you will be asked Judy the laughter of text from marks and labor. Now a historic on maturity. Allah Islam, right? Suggest to um, uh, uh, that uh, uh, uh, it's only economic forces which explain, uh, um, uh, history, uh, um, vapor said, look, ideas mattered to you. You cannot deduce ideas and culture or features from Ecuador. Me Go on auditions. Um, also, ah, the virus has no problem. What motivates human beings, survival, economic interests. A vapor said no. We are not only motivated by economic interests, we are also motivated by tradition.

Speaker 1:          29:55          We can be motivated by values. Uh, he has a more complex notion of human not evasion. Then as I mentioned, a history cannot be described as subsequent van of production. But change is, is the nature of power. The different type of motivation but changes from time to time. Historically how people in position of power, what kind of claims do they make for you to obey and how you internalize, right? Uh, the principles of your subordination. And he develops these different types of uh, uh, of, of authorities, right. Made three major types to additional authority, charismatic or authority and booted liberal authority, legal, rational authority. This is his son, but awkward term to describe the liberal system, what we would call liberalism. And finally class, they uses the term of class, but he said they are not based, you should not identify class on property relationship but on marketplaces and marks make an error by believing that class is all of us existed in history classes or new phenomenon which emerges only with modern marketing, integrated cap economies, mark market economies or right.

Speaker 1:          31:23          What are the major teams in the Patterson ethic? It starts with that rather uninteresting. Bart. He offers some empirical evidence that is a correlation between being rich and being Protestant. Um, uh, well this is no proof of causality is a kind of prime, a fishy evidence of what he does. I think that's probably the weakest part of the book. Then he asked a question, what is the spirit of capitalism? What is the world view of capitalism? Then he looks at Lucas conception of Kalin calling and what it has to do with the spirit of capitalism. Then he looks at the religious foundations of [inaudible], these worldliest skepticism and how reformation formation brings these by. Um, and a in particular the interpretation of in, in Calvinism and the teaching of predestination. Okay. So these are the crucial issues so of religious stratification and affiliation to social stratification.

Speaker 1:          32:29          As I said, this is, uh, uh, uh, the weaker part of the book. You really are. He should do it if you will read the whole book as a prime, a fishy evidence, that is something going on here. Look at the data and it turns out that Protestant countries, we're probably ahead of cow cattle, Catholic countries in capitalism, and look at the very [inaudible] people and you've, you'll see more Protestant and Catholics. Uh, well, not a very forceful argument. He himself is a bit unclear about this because he does not quite know what causes what, um, is this, uh, uh, uh, uh, somehow, um, uh, uh, people, uh, Protestant inherited more valves or because the apparatus and they can create more of else. But you know, if you are looking at American history, that is certainly a prime, a fishy evidence for this, right? I think about 19th century United States.

Speaker 1:          33:35          Uh, right. Uh, uh, uh, it was wasp wife, Anglo Saxon and Protestant, right? And then they were the poor people coming in and who they Daver the Irish and the Italian and what, what does what, what was the religion? Roman Catholic. Right. So I think if you are thinking in 19th century, late 19th century us, the kind of empirical evidence is, you know, pretty persuasive. But otherwise of course, I don't think this will stand up for scrutiny. But I think this is just to start the argument now comes to the more serious one. What is the spirit of capitalism? And this is a, that are two important point he need. He says, what is unique about spatty the capitalism that the greed is turned into an ethical imperative. And the other one is that captured the essence of capitalism is rationalism and calculation. Now, greed, uh, turned into an ethical imperative.

Speaker 1:          34:39          Very interesting point because as we have seen, uh, Mark's does not offer any explanation why on earth suddenly the capitalist start accumulating capital. Marcus does not have a theory to explain the motivation of origin. All accumulation of capital. He only said or I, accumulation of capital is a kind of death, right? And once you had capital, you don't have to assume death. But you know, the original accumulation comes close to death. But he does not explain why on earth people beginning to accumulate capital and vapor said, well, this is interesting because in most history people like us who are working day and night and you know, you, you, you put our little money in four over on k's or whatever and you know, tried to put a little money in the stock market and you know, more. In most people, in most human history, they will say, these people are jerks.

Speaker 1:          35:40          You know, why don't they relax now? They have enough to eat. They should have fun. And most of you in digital via probably never have much fun, right? You'll be, you'll be working day and night to make more money there. Does it come from, he said, this is unique for capitalism. This is unique for modernity because greed to become rich became an EFT, ethical imperative, right? That is the essence. And He, it has a lot to do. The rationalization of modernity and voc is, we'll have a lot to do with Calvin asthma and, uh, uh, bad destination. And Luther's notion of colleague,

Speaker 2:          36:19          uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          36:23          well this is the point what I shed, right? The pre capital, this man actually could not understand us, right? They had two very dim light because they needed it in order to survive. But once they had enough food to eat and they had shelter, they were not running after money on the longer. Right? This is something which is unique for modern man. Uh, yeah. Capital isn't it? A system needs this devotion to the calling to make money, right? It is for, for us. Uh, um, uh, an ethical imperative. You know, uh, well to what extent the destination, I don't know about if you are very rich, uvs say bell, I have to get richer because I'm doing good by becoming rich because I'm creating jobs for others. What a good person I am. Right? That's why you want to become rich, to be uh, uh, to create jobs for others.

Speaker 2:          37:22          Uh,

Speaker 1:          37:23          now calculation, this is absolutely crucial for vapor. He said Val capitol is begins with rational economic calculation, which did not exist before capitalists times a bell. He kind of the parts here from Adam Smith for whom rational calculation, but all of us that people were just not rational, they burst said now this is a unique historical phenomenon that the beginning to calculate effort and return against to each other. And we invented double bookkeeping, right? This is what we spend in terms of money and our energy and this is our return. This is our, our profit, which appears.

Speaker 2:          38:07          MMM

Speaker 1:          38:08          sure. Rational economic calculation is the key of capital is spirit. So I, these are the two things that in order to her car then to make money makes you a good person, right? Uh, it's an altruistic act that you can become rich. And second, you are a capitalist. If you make rational bookkeeping, right? If you don't keep, you know, your income and expenditures, you are doing something wrong. You are not the real capitalist, right? So in order keeping in mind, you know, you really have to keep your checks is more balanced, right? You, all of us have to know how much you spend and how much you have. And the rationale is, Matt, there's a big tendency for history that we are becoming increasingly rationalized. Uh, right? And he said all the naive historical materialism assumes that ideas or originate and as reflection of economic situation, he said the spirit of capitalism was present before the capitalist store.

Speaker 1:          39:12          There you had to invent rationalism and rational calculation before you could have capital accumulation and capitalism as such. Now here you come. Luther's conception of a one very important, this shoe is, this is a, this worldly view. So big change from Medieval Catholic theology. Um, a looter coined the term bear rule in translating the Bible into German. And the term Beru has multiple meanings. Uh, in English I think it is quite val translated as calling do not quite because in German bedroom has the very pedestrian simple meaning of occupation. So if you are filling out a questionnaire, German language questionnaire for the line occupations stands roof, but bear roof is also a core roof is to call in German. So Barrow Office that you got costs. You right there, you got a roof, you got a call, right? God costs you right? You are needed. You have to do something for God.

Speaker 1:          40:25          They'd say this is bare truth. And what is God calling you to, to perform val in Yurok, you patient so vile in medieval SKT sees the essence of life was after life, right? You were a saint, then UV draw from your life. You hardly ate anything. You become sane because you all what you eat is an egg a day and you still survive, right? Um, uh, this is saint who'd in the medieval Roman Catholic sense. Now this is more good. Any longer. Realtor said you have to be active in this life, in your occupation. That's the annual St Martin. Can you withdraw yourself from life and wait for after life, right? This is the big innovation of Lutheran theology, a sort of therefore right for God once you is the four from your duties in this world, right. Rather than to be a sane, not to consume visual, uh, and so on and so forth.

Speaker 1:          41:28          Uh, okay. Uh, um, uh, now let's move on. But water is also a traditional theorist and vapor knows that, uh, in fact his emphasis on barrels means that you have to perform in the job, but you have in the social position what you have. This is not a theory for change. It is a theory for the reproduction of the state to school. And loader actually stood up against the peasant revolutions in Germany of his time and sided with political conservatives. And Therefore, uh, vapor suggest that this statute, it is a non dynamic view of history made it impossible for Lutheranism to become the real moving force. Uh, um, uh, and therefore, uh, it remained to traditionalist. You can, that's why you needed Calvinism. And by, by Calvinism. Now, the big change in modernity, that magic is being eliminated but was magic that we have power over God.

Speaker 1:          42:38          They could force God to do something for us, right? Uh, there were prescriptions. What we do, and this, these were magical means by which you have magic. You know, the magician comes rain doesn't come. Magician does it. Streaks and Rainville calm, right? That's magic. Now in order to rationalize the bird, you have to get rid of magic. A divert becomes rationalize. You understand where the rain is coming from and you know, you, there is hardly anything you can do to make a [inaudible], right? So, uh, this is, uh, elimination of magic. And this is what you see in the Calvinist church. You walk, you walk into the Calvinist church, they don't have any pictures of saints. You know, it's has a called nastoff rationalism ride in a Presbyterian church. Um, and what is the most important element of Calvinism is the theory of predestination. And that's an very interesting, uh, uh, teaching, uh, Calvin, uh, assumed, uh, uh, and this is basically to chat radical it, to get rid of any notion of magic that in fact, whether you'll be, you'll be saved or you perish was decided upon your verse by God.

Speaker 1:          43:58          There is nothing you can do about this. Um, uh, so therefore, uh, you know, uh, in medieval Roman Catholic churches, this is what Luther was revolting against, unfortunately, diverse, some corrupt, a Roman Catholic priest who said, you know what? Give me a little money and if you give me money, then you, you'll go to, to heaven rather dental health. Right? So w people could buy their way into, in, in, into salvation. Now, Calvin said, no way. You can't do anything. Uh, not only not giving money to the police, which was obviously caught up them the church and about approved. It was just kind of caught up practices of individuals. But he said, there is nothing you can do in the life because it has been. But at this feather stand, the big question is how on earth these teaching actually can create the Protestant work ethic, viable.

Speaker 1:          44:56          They work hard. If it has been decided pre, uh, decided before us, uh, uh, that, uh, uh, uh, Viveo parish or of will be saved. Now this will come out actually, um, uh, from uh, uh, the preachings of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Calvinist ministers, actual practices, a pastoral practices. They said there are, you know, you are, well, this is a town of puritanism that was really a pit place, right of predestination. New Haven was created by um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, by them you, you start teaching, then you'll will save. Well, uh, are you concerned whether you go to hell or heaven? You are, aren't you right? You don't talk to burn or your life. You want to know whether you want to heaven, uh, well that is one way to do it. Work hard. And if you are, you'll be rewarded. This will be a sign that God loves you and you, you'll go to heaven.

Speaker 1:          46:01          So therefore you are working card, not in order to buy your way into heaven, but in order to have the sign of God that you are on the right trajectory or new vehicle to him. Well, he said, unfortunately, this Protestant ethic groover car to save, um, Benjamin Franklin, he signed Benjamin Franklin, right? Uh, you, uh, uh, are gone, uh, uh, in modern capitalism, uh, because now, uh, uh, the puritans wanted UCR very hard. Now this is all gone. Um, and what was created actually the art in an iron cage. This is a femurs rotation. Again, you have to take it down. One of the most frequently cited sentences from vapor modernity created an eye on stage where we are actually working because we are, uh, um, uh, forced to very, very hard. And the spirit of capitalism today, I think he was reading a Veblen, uh, and the theory of the leisure class and looking at American, uh, uh, well seen by the early 20th century who started to have a good life, not only to save who Dave would not follow any longer.

Speaker 1:          47:21          Benjamin Franklin advice. Uh, uh, get up early when the song rises and go to bed when the sun SAS because you don't want to burn the candle and waste money on the candle when you burn. Right? Pat was the Reorg, right? Um, uh, purely turns spirit. The spirit which created this very institution, Yale University, Right born burn your candle stride because you raised money, save money. That's what we are pleased God. That's what will be the sign that you are having saved. Now he said, this is unfortunately not any longer because people are actually um, uh, ah for consumption. Good speakers consumption. Uh, well and then he ends up, this is a very important, uh, uh, quotation. Keep it, um, uh, and will be helpful for you to understand the important difference between March and VBA. He said, look, but don't misunderstand me. I don't want to substitute advanced sided materialist explanation of history, but Mark's offers with advanced sided idealist history.

Speaker 1:          48:40          I'm not suggesting that capitalism, it came out of Calvinism all the time suggesting that has been an independent change in theological teaching, uh, from Medieval Catholicism to that formation. Uh, it was a rationalization. If religious thinking, the loss of magic, the rational is the teaching of the destination. And if this would not have happened, capitalist institutions would not have been able to develop. Not that they caused that emergence of capitalist institutions. There was also an evolution of the economic systems. The material change happened in one line, and the change in the sphere of ideas happened in another line. And what he said, that is an elective affinity between the two. If you have the proper ideas and the proper economic institution goal, right, then the change happens, then you have modern capitalism. If you don't have the right ideas like Calvinists, we said like in China, in the 12 century, every buzz worthy, everything was ready for capitalism.

Speaker 1:          49:56          It did not happen because the con fortune and Tau is, the ideas at that time did not give the ideological framing, which would have helped the development of capitalism in China. And that's why China was hold back, right? Uh, Calvin Immuno nationalization of idea could happen, but if there are no economic conditions for capitalism, it will not happen either. So this is the idea of elective at finity. He rejects simple cause or relationship between ideas and material conditions and he soft stick CQ sit, we would say today an interactive effect, right? That is an interaction between ideas and material conditions. He calls it elective affinity. As such. Thank you very much.
