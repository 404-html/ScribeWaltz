Speaker 1:          00:01          Nope, Dan, let's go on to Tomas hops and I don't something about trouble. We're not everybody does. Uh, I've kind of history of ideas scores. I give you an overview of the individual, uh, whom you were reading from. Um, and uh, uh, uh, [inaudible], uh, some sense of the historic times they lived in. Well, occasionally I get negative comments in my course evaluations for this. People want just to talk about the past, but they have to know, um, uh, that are some people who like it to see, wow, this is how Tomas hops.

Speaker 2:          00:48          So that four, I still be doing this. I think. What have you tried to do? Yes. Go very fast through the slides. It should have my cake and eat right and showed us sleep in that historical context and the street and is all swollen up on the board. You can't go back to that. And then there'll be stopped that this week. Uh, almost hops and, uh, uh, bad. Their foundations of modern social for good stock pops or not. That's a Mash Tun. Uh, even some other courses I bake them about that even eat be Sundays. Audio almost pops. Yes. The first I believe the foundation. So mother silence, um, uh [inaudible] and the formula. Then you stream the controversial speaker and that's all very important issues. Yeah. All steel. That'd be good. Or are you by nature? I think that will be handled crowd one day started that in the discussion sections.

Speaker 2:          02:26          Got Our Napo in buddy border issues. Almost false screen. I do try to be low impact later. Social Sam Smith or Nesha on Brian on the next eight or and audios. Okay. So this is sort of sparse and a that'd be just that if he could talking about his life. I mentioned production. You like the most boring. Do you invest sport? I also mentioned that the Spanish was a baker. He had actual young, he's fine. He's learned. She man places in a cemetery. Absolutely. We'll know by that time. So we have to skip and this, that and the food must us behind me, the kid off and uncle when what's actually then go off. So you saw a peptide. Ooh, I'd be back to Oxford. They might go and call them in other ways. Uh, graduated became a future of feeding cabin vishuddha sector as we begin.

Speaker 2:          03:52          And then France and Italy. It's very important because he, that Med gone the literal, it's absolutely going by getting battle. And the quizzes, Stein, I already mentioned by the halts kettles be classified and, but basically it's even fellow would be classified as a social science is you boast as the much a map mission. I get the big advancement, I love all sorts of, made me be quote unquote the sciences. Now. Uh, uh, he had close association, uh, person, you'll be a fence faith and it was Francis Bacon in the groups, uh, fences fake come, uh, plus a few awesome bird. I haven't rejected of youngest book value on logic system. Um, uh, which basically was a, you have this system a stop out, some major assumptions. So we thought shows that alone. It's the most open ecosystem. As I said, well I build these scores by stopping.

Speaker 2:          05:09          That's his bacon. It does become in some ways is the founding father of modern science is because he said every scientific investigation, she'll start the induction from central observation and what you observe, you shoot off a suit. It does exist. What I've done for II advocate at the methodology is was exactly the opposite of Yeti slow Pallium methodology, which trust document the FOP adoption. But now that he most spending cools the affiliated good Cavendish and had a great deal of impact on hops initially we'll eventually, hops of change actually is mine and the other they suspend you left the stem time. That is uh, uh, and, and uh, uh, investigate natural science in particular because the most important sport for hops from Dadi level. If you learn, and I'll turn up who bacon's inductive Maca, uh, got a little awkward and methodologies by it and watch social scientists to bed who be in normal social science, subscribed Neiman's.

Speaker 2:          06:43          That's was the methodology bunk to the level a resolute called positive. She got the math that from struck the deduction, right? You have some initial hypotheses, then you'll move observation, central observation and froze the central observation you made, inductions that you made back and you test your hypotheses. That's how I'd be in bed. And this is what my bacon learn from garden level and uh, adapted this methodology. And now this is a really, they card, uh, you know, one of the greatest philosophers of the times and of all times the, they now as compared to something like call. Well, isn't it right? Isn't it he only man that he separated the soul and body from each other and hops rejecting this idea?

Speaker 1:          07:49          Uh, because he suggested that in fact they were engaged in a big debate on optics. What, what we do see, and he hops was advocating that there must be a real object whose movement we see, what we actually can see. So he rejected the dualism and then he wrote, I mentioned very briefly, he's try logix that quarter. This is about the human body, the homeowner, about men. And finally the Seaver about society. I see this is formidable and something which APIs are great deal to social scientists today, right? To try to develop a theory of social society, which begins actually the biology, the biological processes, and build it up gradually from biology to understanding of the social, the individual, and from the individual to understand society. That's highly controversial. There are many social scientists who rejected, but today that are many social scientists were greatly attracted to this and be see an emergence today are for sciences and social scientists.

Speaker 1:          09:05          Well, a hops entered politics as a royalist. Um, uh, uh, then, uh, uh, really I'm Kevin Bisch, uh, entered politics and in fact harps, uh, translated. I also mentioned to kitty this and basically because to kitty does express some skepticism about the democracy in Athens and he was greatly skeptical about the, uh, the democracy. Um, and the, uh, uh, believe the, uh, the need for a strong central authority. Where are these world very troubled times, a troubled times and religious conflict. So I skipped this one because I know you are all very familiar with British history, but it all started with Henry, the aides who had a very trouble the matador relationship. Right? Year three, vives, uh, divorced Vonn executed the second one, uh, in search for Assan from funnel, one of his, um, his wife's. Um, but in the process of divorcing, he split from the Roman Catholic Church.

Speaker 1:          10:16          And that's from Church of England. Uh, immersion. That's how, um, uh, uh, England became a rather standoffish a sword. Uh, um, well, uh, again, as I said, I, I skipped this one and one, they, this is a, uh, the eldest daughter, um, are from Henry ator. Mary, the first call, the bloody Mary. Uh, she inherited the throne. Uh, she was crying, uh, to, uh, uh, um, uh, establish a, um, uh, uh, Roman Catholicism or Bart had to resign. There was too much resistance against it. So he had to resign. And the, uh, give the Troon, uh, to, uh, his younger sister, um, our lizard that, um, uh, and this is screen Elisabet. Um, and Trina Elisabetta, uh, uh, was at the time of, uh, puritanism under a great deal of pressure of puritans who wanted to get rid of Catholics all together, uh, from government in England became this became a very important issue.

Speaker 1:          11:26          Uh, later on. And New haven has his spirit and connections. Uh, uh, anybody is from Davenport College. Nobody's from that are important. Oh my goodness. So naughty are purely turns around here. There are, that's a shame. Anyway, this was a reverend John Davenport. Um, he was a puritan who settled, um, in, uh, uh, new haven with his followers in 16 dirt the eighth. And, uh, uh, already of course in I think 1703, the puritans created this institution and they were basically running this institution until the late 19th century. Not Anymore. Okay. Um, now, uh, there will be a great deal of conflicts between, uh, you know, yeah. Mary was called the virgin clean. Well, uh, whether she was a virgin or not, it's unclear, but she's clearly had a lot of, uh, a very close friendship, uh, via to value as a man in her life. But she never married and never gave birth to a charge.

Speaker 1:          12:39          He was actually a very good cleaner, a smart, good, good, good, good, clean, uh, by, uh, you know, the challenges of the time. Um, uh, uh, but, uh, she was the last one and died be the Assan. Uh, uh, and, uh, then, uh, uh, the, uh, the crown went over to the, to the stewards and they were total disaster. James first was ordered the disaster and Charles the first was real disaster and they vote in collision of course, with parliament. And there was a constant war in England, civil war, culminating in 42. And finally charts. The first was executed in 49. Um, uh, and, uh, Oliver [inaudible] came to power. Now, um, are here I give you a picture of the execution of Charles First. If you don't believe it, you can see it. Uh, well hops that got into some trouble at that time. Um, uh, uh, uh, because he was too close to the royalists and he had to flee England, uh, in CC and 40, uh, a head of time and he van, uh, uh, to, uh, live in, in Paris.

Speaker 1:          14:00          And he was very close that to the is exercise. And in, uh, 51, he completed his major book, Leviathan. What review we'll be talking about in a minute. Uh, um, well, Leviathan became an extremely controversial book. It was very controversial in his times. Uh, became, uh, actually, uh, a big hot topic in the 19th century and it's a very hot topic in the last 30 or 40 years because a lot of economists and political scientists who are interested in rational choice theorists discovered in Tomas hops the first rational choice choice, the earliest it's extruding. He's a bonder fully lucid mind. And if you read the text and you know enough mathematics, you could do a lot of his propositions in mathematical equations, what all else and economists want to do, right? It must be true if you can put it into an equation right now, that's what certainly Thomas Hobbs is available to do because of the extremely lucidity, uh, of, of, of, of his mind.

Speaker 1:          15:12          Now, it was definitely a controversial book also for the royal royalist because in 51 hops, and if you're talking about this in great detail, was considering that probably people should be allowed to transfer their loyalty to an owner knew or authority which offers safety. Right? And that's what the royal is, did not want to hear that crumb val actually can become a legitimate ruler. And that's what in a day, um, uh, the book, um, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Leviathan, uh, uh, foreshadows so he better had to skip out of Paris and go back to London. This is the first edition of Leviathan, uh, 51, and this is about the idea that people are by nature evo and we need an all powerful sovereign to avoid the seat of war of uh, uh, everyone against everyone else. Powerful proposition. Again, I would think probably half of the people in this classroom then really think hard about it.

Speaker 1:          16:24          Do believe hops argument. Half of them would be violently opposed to the argument, right? So it's a very nice topic to have heated discussions in. Uh, the uh, um, uh, uh, discussion sections there via turn, uh, is a sea monster, the state or the silver room. Uh, we need to keep order as such. Okay. There were a great deal of controversies around him. Um, uh, he actually was publishing rather new trust stuff, only attacking universities, which is over as a good thing to do. Right. Um, uh, but then in a 1660, the monarchy was restored and charge the second, the son of Charles De Fund, uh, first became king hops was invited back to the court and it looked like if you'd be just fine right now as a royalist not so because in [inaudible] 66, there was a fire in London. And because of this fire, some people believe that this fire was a, the revenge of God because of the sin full New York, Not New York, London.

Speaker 1:          17:38          Right. And, uh, they were therefore trying to find the guilty long. And who was there? Of course Tomas hops with his is maride. Uh, no. So, so how is that a journal life possible? This must be an Ati is his book should be burned, if not himself. So they did not burn his book and himself, but you know, he certainly was out of grace and died in 79. He was greatly admired in continental Europe, but was very controversial in England. And Val, if you don't believe there was a fire in London, here is the proof, right? That is the great fire of London 66, which by you know, look like Los Angeles to me, right? Uh, okay. About 3000 people right there. The fire brigade was not as effective as today is in southern California. Okay. Now that's about, uh, uh, the person and the times, I think extremely for my, as far as I'm concerned, extremely important to understand this, uh, the Virg, um, if, uh, if you know the times when he, he lived in,

Speaker 2:          18:58          okay.

Speaker 1:          18:58          All right, so now let me go on and, uh, uh, dark too,

Speaker 2:          19:04          uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          19:08          Leviathan

Speaker 1:          19:23          [inaudible]. This is the first edition of Leviathan which came out in [inaudible] 60 and 50. Vaughn, uh, in cure big volumes. Each one was 500 pages long. Now this is the structure of the book. The first spot is on the man. Uh, uh, uh, and, uh, the first few chapters are about the mechanisms because of Galileo or hops of us are obsessed with the idea of motion. Um, so he described the biological motion, spot moves, man, senses, imagination, speech reason and so on and so forth. Uh, the, and the chap just sits is out bond chapter. It is about empathize, desires, every versions and fierce and the theory of voluntary action have you talk about this. This is really very insightful, very important, a very great deal of impact on contemporary times. And I hope that, uh, you can also relate to it individually. And then a chapter seven to 11 is, uh, uh, the relationship between people as Sawcha.

Speaker 1:          20:38          Uh, and then the final, the, the state of nature and the two laws of nature. We've, you'll have to talk about this in greater detail. So, uh, the bar two is about common Val's, uh, it's about really the first theory of politics. Um, uh, uh, the rights and duties of the governments and the subjects. Uh, there are some very interesting arguments here that actually the [inaudible] also have duties, not only simply rights. And then part three and four, a offer, some theological justification. What he does, uh, bizarre chapter, part three and four. Uh, I think very the red, or at least I see very few citations to it. So what are the major themes of the book? Uh, first about the theory of human nature? Uh, the second one is the relationship between, uh, uh, nature and sort of the theory of social contract, uh, hops is really the first of the contact areas, right?

Speaker 1:          21:50          Who are advocates that what brings society together is a social contract. If you want to understand. So Saturday you have to understand that we have contracts with each other. And then finally the theory of the Silverado, right? Uh, the major desire, the essence of hops work years to try to find an identifiable Silverman, right? He lived in turbulent times when you did not know who the silver on is. Is this the king is the landlord, are these disease, the burgers? Is this the parliament? Who on earth is the stubborn, he wanted to find one identifiable silver and we can all agree this is the proper source of law, right? That's what he was obsessed with. Okay. Uh, so let me then move on and about human nature. What are the themes here now? Uh, one important argument is that men will deliberate, deliberate between appetites and aversions and as a result it will act voluntarily.

Speaker 1:          23:00          Well, it's a fascinating issue. An issue. The cannot get red out of our hair. Uh, um, well when I was in your age, the all of us were there mentally debating the question, do we have the two, three, three bill? Or if you don't have reveal, right, our action is over a debtor mind. This is exactly the question of what the hops is talking about and develops the idea of voluntary action, which is kind of half day between absolute Freeville and complete determination, right? The idea is that we are driven by appetite, by desires. Vivio talking discourse later on about Zigmund. Right? Right. We were stuffing you about derives right, that our drives and have each makes us move these out about hops, God appetite few century before they won't fry. But then he said they also have aversions. We have fears, the are these what we want, but we have fares that we won't be able to achieve what they want.

Speaker 1:          24:14          And therefore we have to somehow negotiate out between our desires, appetites, and our fears or aversions. And what comes out is voluntary action. It's weak. Have a choice, right? We have to measure up, but the price of our action VOB and then we decide where that it is worse stupid this brass or it is not averse to pay this price. Uh, so I see somebody whom I designed a great deal. I thought it would be a great partner for me, but in order to approach that person and to say, can I have a date? It has risks because it may say go to hell. Right? And I don't want to be rejected. Right. I have fears that Ivy will be rejected. So I've even been measuring God. Right. And some of you, if you aren't in such a situation, if you since that the answer will be no, you don't place the phone call.

Speaker 1:          25:15          Right? And you'll, you'll never get that person. Right. The fare over rules, right. The appetite or others will say, heck, you know, it's a no then ivy or try a second time. I've you're trying to curve time and if it is no, the third time that I give up. Right? Okay. So this is voluntary action, right? This is freedom, right? You are free to decide whether you want to try it again, right? Whether you want to achieve your appetites. And then the second point is maybe of sea power. The essence of human nature is that we are striving for power. Again, an issue, very good issue to discuss at the discussion section. Again, I think the half of the class we probably agree with hopes that people are actually trying to dominate others. Others will see we are much more beneficial than three are actually nice people.

Speaker 1:          26:15          You don't want to dominate. Well, voc his argument for it, he said actually. And the last point is, you know, if we want to survive vivio need an all powerful silver. So, um, voluntary action. Uh, he actually said that are two kind of motions. One motion is what he calls vital emotions. And these are stuff like, you know, a food that we want to have food or something and that is what he costs. Well it sounds stage today, animal motions, but this is what I think is a better called voluntary motion. So, um, it'd be which actually has something to do with the appetizer or desires or aversions and how to deal with this. So let me just speak about appetites and the versions. Again, I don't want to read the texts savvy or put it on, um, uh, um, uh, on, on the Internet for you.

Speaker 1:          27:15          Uh, it just describes what I have said, right? That we all have appetites, we have designers, we have needs, and in order to satisfy our needs, it always has costs and therefore they have to figure it out. Whether it was the cost for us to satisfy that need, right? And therefore we have a certain degree of freedom. We don't be conned to do whatever we want to do, right? Because we may not have the resources to afford it or they have one, we'd want to have many things. And then we will have to have, prioritize what we want to have more and spend more on it. As you can hear, right. Hops is very close through, but later on becomes the Utilitarians, right? Very close to what Adam Smith, we'll argue in his economic theory or what Joe Stewart, Neil have you represent. It's uh, um, in, in, in his, uh, utilitarian is or for the at that safe, but what most economists today believe, right?

Speaker 1:          28:18          Who called themselves neoclassical economists or who identified themselves as rat choice, right? Or rational choice economies. All political scientists or sociologists for the sake that are some sociologists who also subscribed to restaurant of choice or I, this is also very lovely liberation and the bill. And he said, well, when we have designers and we have a version, that's when we actually beginning to figure it out. We liberate what on earth is verse for us. And the end of this deliberation, we have a bill redesign. I go for it. I want that to date. Right? Or we decide I don't want it because the costs are too high. Okay. And this is what we call the Ville. Your will will be that you decide I go for it or you decide, no, that's not verse for me. It would be silly. I make out a cloud out of me. I just don't do it right.

Speaker 1:          29:21          That's the veal well, uh, about power. The power is on ending, right. He said that is right. A general inclination for us to seek power, power, influence on other people. And he said, this is not nothing evil about it. It is necessary because if you want to survive the veal have to try to exercise influence on address. We have to seek power as such extremely important idea which foreshadows especially uh, uh, Nicha and Max Faber who comes up later in this course. Well then he comes a very interesting argument about equality. Very exciting argument. He, he is one of the very first philosophers who claims that the are all born equal. Now for you, this is of course of years but was not obvious in 1651 that people, mobiles and serves slaves and slave holders. We are all born equal. Uh, and he said in factor also extremely important that they are ever equal actually in strengths.

Speaker 1:          30:38          Because even the weaker person, we Casperson has the capacity to kill the strongest one. I even David can kill goal go out. Yeah, right. But he said the same goes intellectually and in fact intellectually we are even more equal than by physical plower. So that's Sal's Mandra fool and you probably all agree with it, but then he makes a very controversial point and probably that are some people in this room who agree with him, but others probably or disagree with it, namely he said, but comes from this equality is this unending fight that because we designed the same thing and he operates with the scarcity assumption that what is desirable is actually scares if you're five to each other. Right? And we can fight each other because we had equal because we cal can kill each other. You can outsmart each other. Uh, this is a very unusual argument, right?

Speaker 1:          31:43          He is a very ironic guy right now. He always says things, but you may not want to hear right. And this is something what, who believes in equality do not want to hear that. In fact, equality can be interpreted as the reason for social conflict rather than the solution for social conflicts. That that is his argument. Very interesting. Very unusual. Right, and again, probably the closest to Nicha as we will see they are. Then we have, this is I, this is, I won't read it, save it. This is the page you want to trend because for the rest of your life, if you ever Vonn thrive to site the harps, this is the citation, right? And namely that the, if we will be therefore be in a war of everyone against everyone else for the above reasons. Now about the question of social contract, a veil, he operates with this idea of state of nature.

Speaker 1:          32:47          Then they, we'll talk a lot about this because in among the most of the social theorist found founding fathers of social theorists, there is a debate what is the original nature of humans and it's controversial that that this is a useful concept at all the state of nature. But he did believe in this. Well, there are really two basic laws of nature. One Law of nature is that you are full, forbidden. What is harmful to you, right? You have to post. So self interest. He had again, you see the rational choice theory speaking, right? People are self interested and this is the law of nature that we should be self interested, right? We have to do everything in order to preserve our life. But that is a second law of nature. You are used and this requires that we what you would not do a yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:51          Not to do others. What you would not want them to do to you. Right? This is again, you may want to save these citation. Very important citation for shadows, major theorists of ethics, which gum many, many years or decades or centuries after him, particularly Emmanuel Kant, right? Uh, uh, and his categorical in better diverse. Okay? Uh, well does in the state of nature, if there are no restraints, that is no civilization. That's a very interesting idea, right? That pressure limiting the state of nature is necessary. This is again, for shadows. Absolutely. Zigman fried and his theory of civilization, the civilization comes out of the repression of drive. So rather than satisfaction of, of drives, if whatever you all need is immediately satisfied, there is no civilization. Civilization comes from software inks, right? For from suppressed desires. That's when you go back and you create great pieces of art or you become a great scientist because you suppress your sexual and other desires, right?

Speaker 1:          35:14          That's, you know, it's all of us from suffering. They're great products of humankind are coming from right. That's what he's saying. And that's of course what Zigmund fried view say. Okay. Uh, there are the two laws of nature and again, I don't want to elaborate on it. This is quite obvious. He said that is the elementary a law of nature. The right, that's we have to do whatever is necessary for sackcloth action. And the elder one is that we actually should consider others, but others will do bell and then the contract now, but follows from the second law of nature, uh, is that uh, we pulled our rights as side and transferred it to, uh, orders that uh, these chance food of rights, uh, is something that is some reciprocity there. We give up some rights and he gets something in exchange protection or safety or something as such. Um,

Speaker 1:          36:25          and when the transferred these rights to somebody else, this is what is called the covenant or social contract. This is as far as I can tell, this is the first formulation of the theory of social contract. Uh, it's not quite the theory of social contract, but we will read from a law or from Rousseau because he said to again, controversial comments, one that in fact that contract we entered by fear is also obligatorily. Uh, just because we were forced into a contract out of fear does not, does not mean that we can walk out of this contract whenever we want to. Right. So it's very much state to school. He's a conservative guy. I think it has to be understand, right? He's deeply conservative. And then he also said that in fact, a former corner contract makes void a later contract. So that is no divorce. The put in this way, right? Once you'll swear. Do you know that? Well, uh, uh, I save it you until via live. That's about it, right? Uh, that is no new contract, which avoids it. They'll, uh, uh, now, uh, very briefly about the power of the silver and it's power is to produce safety to the people, right? He lives in unsafe times, so he wants safer safety. But obedience is only due to the extent the silver and can deliver the safety. And if it cannot lie, charge the first couldn't, well, you could redraw your,

Speaker 2:          38:13          um, uh, um, uh,

Speaker 1:          38:18          obedience to you. Loyalty from it. Okay. Now, uh, uh, what is, uh, important, uh, in his time to find out who the sewer and ears and the silver Sudan actually can be? Uh, and, uh, uh, I just, uh, point out two words from the citation can be transferred on war, man, right? The king or a pawn one assembly of man. That's I think extremely important though he was very strongly in favor of absolutism. He did consider right that the silver and can be a properly assembled body of man. What, how they view be properly assembled. He doesn't have the faintest study or doesn't have the guts to say it right. It will become much more clear in lock and particularly in Rousseau, uh, where the sewer and ears and it becomes of course, crystal clear in the American constitution, we start re the people, right?

Speaker 1:          39:25          That's the silver one is uh, in hops Stein, it was not quite we the people, but he did consider that it may not be the royal, the royalty, the king right now, the, the sewer industry have duties. Uh, uh, uh, the, uh, office of the Silverman, uh, has to procure safety of the people. And he said he adds to this extremely important that it is not bear preservation. It has to give more than just survival, uh, uh, as such, and therefore you can expect to the server and to deliver this and the, the silver than does not deliver. You can, we drove right? You royalty. So even though he is, uh, uh, a theorist of absolutism, he does see you ride the need and possibility that you withdraw your loyalty and new transfer it to, I got king right to a good silver and as such, um, uh, well the question is also what are the good laws are the people say good laws are the laws which are good for the, and uh, and he said it, this is extremely important, but I, I highlighted it.

Speaker 1:          40:43          It is not so not through that good laws serve only the silver and the good laws should serve the people. Uh, well, uh, and this is the end of it. What are his contributions and what are his shortcomings? Well, his emphasis is on peace and order, right? But what he does not consider that the silver and might abuse his power. And this will be the big criticism of hops by later theorists, particularly by law Vivia seat or that events day, right? Rory is primarily considered by the possibility that the silver and may abuses power they'll, and then he actually does not develop as a result, you theory how power can be held in checks. That is no theory of checks and balances. That is one in hops and even one more developed in Montesquieu. And the American constitution does not come from hops or the cops for comes from Loc.

Speaker 1:          41:51          And particularly from Montesquieu. Montesquieu is the one which defined that checks and balances, which entered the American constitution. They're all, he was an apple or genetical. Theories of an enlightened absolute is not any absolute isn't right. Uh, he was, uh, against the real monsters, uh, as I ordered it demonstrated as a result, he was not acceptable to the monarchs because he put too much limitations on their powers, but he was not acceptable to the emergent bourgeois class because it that rebooted too much power to the monarch. And therefore, you know, nobody really liked hops, but the, uh, nobody liked. And you may not like him. What is impossible is to eat more him, right? You have to listen to him. Well, see you Wednesday and Thursday in discussion sections.
