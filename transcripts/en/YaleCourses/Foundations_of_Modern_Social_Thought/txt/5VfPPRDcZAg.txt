Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, I have a lot to talk about today. Uh, and we move a one century and then move into another culture. Both are very important. It may move from, um, uh, um, uh, 17th century England to 18th century France. We moved from a situation which was dominated by civil war chaos and the yearning for, um, uh, clear run, uh, and the movie in a, uh, century, um, you can call it of enlightenment. And that's where the term enlightenment comes from, the French context and a century of decadence. Eventually it leads to our evolution. But before the revolution, that is a lot of fairly juicy decadents. So two different epochs and two different cultures. Uh, British individualism, uh, Hobbes and Locke, we're methodological individualists. They thought, uh, the analysis should start all of us with the individual. Uh, you remember hops, right? Individual rives and fairs and then he builds up what society is starting all of us from the individual, not the French.

Speaker 1:          01:35          The French are methodological collectivist. They believe that is such a think as society, which is more than the sum total of the individuals. And somehow they know how to grasp it. So these are the changes, what UV is. See, uh, uh, today, there's today and next Tuesday, then Vba, we'll be discussing Montesquieu and Ron Jacques Rousseau before we return to British individualism or Adam Smith's and John Stuart Mill. Don't ask me why this difference between the two cultures, but there is an a lasting difference of today's topic is Montesquieu and I have a lot of fun stories to tell, but our try to limit my anecdote so I can focus enough on, on the texter and do not run out of time. Um, uh, by the end. Okay. So that was Montesquieu. Uh, uh, he was born and as Sharis Louis de Second. Dot. Barone our bread, um, was born in 1689 near Bordeaux.

Speaker 1:          02:58          Um, his father was a former normal family, but because he was a younger son, he had to become a mercenary. And the, in fact he was fighting chirks in Hungary. He received a law degree in nevertheless from the University of Bordeaux. Um, and uh, in 1715, he did what many atoms? Stock crash did. He married a val, said woman, I was wrong. Uh, large tig, uh, which was helpful for him because he was not all that very ballsy. Uh, though he was a noble man. Uh, his uncle Voss a bottle do Montesquieu and when he passed away a shower, Louis, uh, received the his style at all. He became Montesquieu and inherited his office. The presidency of the parliament of Bordeaux. Don't think about it, was not a very big deal and certainly did not offer income for the luxurious life, was not particularly effluence stuff and was not a particularly powerful stuff.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Now I bet about the times. Um, well here it is. Louis cut off the highs of French absolute is ma'am. Uh, well he caught him. They, he was called the Sun King and here is his emblem. The son, he, you know, the sun is shining like the sun. Uh, they are, um, uh, he actually claimed the, that's a famous sentence and important to understand Montesquieu later, some work. Uh, I am the state. Well, it was a kind of an overstatement. Not Quite. He pretend to, to be more powerful than he actually was. The French absolutism shows. She did show order the cracks and the bourgeoisie was becoming already quite powerful under the times of Louis Carr tours. But he had the notion of French glow, ah, the glory, right. Um, uh, and he built these wonderful palace of Versailles showing what Gla or glory is, uh, uh, resident to go ride.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Also emphasize, emphasize the French, go. Ah, the French are very fun of it. Okay. The 18th century was the century of enlightenment. They call the [inaudible] of Lumiere. Lumiere means the light. Um, well it was the car, uh, who transformed philosophy two words, uh, uh, uh, the code view cold look of reason. And that was Yvonne, which was spreading in 18th century, um, uh, in grant Cardone and thing in the 1789 revolution. And we see two major steps in this direction. Montesquieu Andrew saw, uh, uh, well one of the major accomplishment of the enlightment for the publications of Aussie Clopay d, uh, the sort of blood assessor, a British and cycle encyclopedia Britannica of digital and Darla and bear. And they did. And which put together rationalistic scholarship of the time. Well here you have the first edition, uh, for [inaudible]. Um, well, uh, as, uh, Louis Carr course passed away, his five year old, uh, great grandson, uh, um, uh, Louie fifteens and became the king and root for a very long time.

Speaker 1:          07:06          Now, uh, the, the K of absolute wisdom men royal authority continued and the are really entering now, uh, with, uh, uh, 1715, um, one, probably the longest in modern history, the longest epoch of decadence and sexual permissiveness. It's interesting. Kind of seem to recur in human history. Right? Then you had a similar kind of permissiveness and sort of decadence 1890s until 1914, probably 1930 and then the 1960s, of course, right. Then everything goes, uh, well this was a time of the scanned. Well, um, he was not at particularly interested in governing, but, um, he was very interested in beautiful women. Uh, well he was quite a good looking guy when he was young as well. So I'm sure women very fat interested in him too. And you know, the name Madame Pompadour, uh, was, uh, uh, the most famous and most influential, uh, of his mistresses.

Speaker 1:          08:23          As I said, it was becoming right at time of her sexual permissiveness. Uh, promiscuity, a ditty vice spread also affected Montesquieu. It is a Madame Pompidou, uh, indeed a very beautiful person but not only a beautiful, she was extremely smart as as far as we can tell. He was an intellectual of very distinguished stays days he knew or people of the Enlightenment Voltaire, uh, one of the big trouble makers of his time and he supported the dro and the project of Aussie Clopay d uh, which is a, it was unusual because you know, royal authority did not really like, uh, this one. Well, and that me just give you a little ethnography if you are interested. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:20          a br. Sure. They're low lack law. I wrote a novel about the sexual and most of this time, which is scar, the dangerous relationships they liaison dodger is now there was two movies out of made of fit and anybody watched any of these movie? Nobody watch it. Wonderful movie where there are two versions. One by Roger, Vadim, uh, and that puts the whole story in French society of its Stein. And the other one is an American Ron Stefan Fares. And it is Glenn close. Uh, uh, who features in it now? This is the Pr Luden movie. Okay. Borrow it. Do, you will have fun and you'll be, you'll have an understanding, right? But meet an 18th century in France was, and there Montesquieu and Russo are coming from. And of course, this is the American version with Glenn close. She's already, ah, you know, the person, what she likes to play, right?

Speaker 1:          10:27          Um, uh, the vicious woman. Okay. Um, now, uh, Montesquieu, uh, well, he lives in the century of enlightenment and promiscuous. He sells his office though. I mean, he made it lifts from the verse of his wife, a salsa band business, but then he leaves the van business to the wife and beginnings to travel in Europe and in England. Uh, then when he returns, he settles in Paris, leaves to the vive and back, you know, to run the van business. And he will be getting to write. Uh, he writes a publishes in 1721 already, the parish and letters. I talked about this before and then he was elected on the basis of these two. Academic, Fran says, uh, the French academia of sciences and art, the very big accomplishment that these very early age. And finally, 1748, he publishes doing major book. Um, it, this is really a very important book. I hope you did what I asked you glance that it not an easy read, a bit drier than some of the texts we read, but very important, fundamentally important stuff. Did you ask him to, uh, write something for the Onsie Gloppy d about democracy? About he's bored with the question of democracy. He wrote enough about this. So he writes an article on taste. Okay. And he died in 1755 and patty, so these are the times, and this is your order. Uh, um,

Speaker 2:          12:11          okay.

Speaker 1:          12:11          Montesquieu

Speaker 2:          12:15          MMM.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Oh, let me move on to, uh, the Varick.

Speaker 2:          12:41          Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:47          So here we go. This bit is off the laws. Anti yet is the first edition.

Speaker 1:          12:56          So what is this book? Uh, the first part as a lawyer and genital and different malts of governance, uh, entered us think, not pass breaking. Uh, this is not what he did be remembered for though. I mean that he is opening some very important subject matters. The second one is law and politics and separation of powers VVC, right. He bills, uh, on lock and takes lock him a big way for Vod. Great improvement in many of, you know, to the extent that is improvement of course lock has some insight which is missing from the Montesquieu and formulation of separation of powers. Uh, then he has this extra ordinary section on low and climate. This is one of his big contributions. Uh, um, Ivs. Sure. You, I mean, the way how he formulated is extremely naive. Um, almost borders on the ridiculous, but uh, given, uh, the 21st century, there are very few people with the exception of [inaudible] who I named already, right in the introductory lecture who was so sensitive that society lifts in these globe.

Speaker 1:          14:18          Right. And how society is formed and structured and how its laws are being shaped is actually greatly influenced by the nature of environmental and climatic conditions. So he is the first of ecologist. Here's the first environment artists thrive who understand the interaction between social organization, Morse ethics, ideas and society. Right. Um, and then the, that that is a bit on law and commerce. Ivo, very briefly talk about this law and religion and Ivo skip this section or together. And Lo and history, I also skipped. So what are the main teams? First, you know, we'll be about classification of governments then ivy, we'll talk about separation of powers and then an environment, law and social structure. These are the issues they will be rushing through. There's a lot of staff, uh, to, uh, uh, uh, look at it well before Montesquieu, uh, the question when they classified government was who rules, who is the silver and Montesquieu changes somewhat.

Speaker 1:          15:42          The discourse is interested in the manner of governments, how people who are in authority rule, uh, uh, the real music distinction, better government is moderate or whether it is despotic. Now, what are the questions? You know it when you try to judge, uh, the nature of a government, one important question you, he said you should ask, ah, the various power separated or not. Um, irrespective who rules, whether it can be a king, it can be an elected president, it can be a prime minister. The question is I have the power are separated. And the next question is, this is very important. Why do people obey the question, why people obey orders is Dutch strip on by hops and lock, but it's not really elaborated. This is the issue. But the will call the question of legitimacy, right? What are the principle of why the obey orders and Vivio see a much later in the scores at it will be Max Weber's will elaborate on this issue at great lengths.

Speaker 1:          17:04          Um, and then the next question is, okay, is the ruler and individual or is this an institution? Is it, this is all very interesting enrichment of the idea. But the nature of governments are, he himself supports a constitutional monarchy at his reports. Um, uh, a monarchy right in which there is a king or clean but king and clean, which operates on the rule of law. That's what constitutional monarchy is. The second major theme is separation of powers. I'm still elaborating what we are. Come well, you have read, uh, lock distinguish between and executive and federative branches of government. More skew, uh, distinguishes between legislative executive and you're ready. Call now. This is the Vaughn, uh, which is, has been so influential on the American constitution about the, or believe now in this country that these are the three branches which should be separated. Though of course, the federative remains to be an interesting issue.

Speaker 1:          18:19          Who should exercise federative powers the powers of war? Should it a the legislature or should it be at the executive branch? Uh, as such now, um, or Montez cures that the three powers will have to be separated. The legislative power, uh, and this is a departure from Hobbes and Locke, uh, should be by elected representatives. And then he makes an important, a new contribution. And he said the right of minorities should be respected. Uh, though he kind of foreshadows something like universals, um, um, uh, uh, wall thing though is not quite explicit about this, but you can read into it. But then he said, the minorities, right? Should it be, um, uh, reserved? And he said, well, the legislative power cannot and should not be held by the monarchs and what it has to be limited. There must be a limitation on legislative powers. Um, uh, and the executive bill exercise checks over the legislature.

Speaker 1:          19:36          Um, and Vivio again, doc about this in more detail. Uh, and, but there must be some checks and balances over the executive branch has val, um, when it comes, you know, who controls what, he puts more emphasis on the executive limiting the legislative stand the other way around, but, uh, reveal see what the arguments are and about the ration of for this is and how this affects, for instance, the functioning called the US government today. I think it is not all that far of a, for the blueprint Montesquieu um, established, laid back, um, in, uh, uh, the mid 18th century. And then the last issue of VOB environment, uh, how social conditions are shaped, uh, uh, by environmental on conditions, but he said, but that is also a general spirit, a spirit which is above the individuals. And this is the very French team, right? You cannot explain it from the individual. There is some general idea Durkheim vieux Carre collective conscience Russo via called it the general veil, right? The very franchise idea, right? That there is some consciousness at both the individual consciousnesses. This has formulated so powerful the first time,

Speaker 3:          21:02          um, by uh, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          21:05          Montesquieu and he actually said a civilization is progressing the influence of the natural conditions, the clients and the importance right of general spirit increases or to put with Durkheim, the collective conscience becomes more and more important. I'm just foreshadow that you have a sense right, that the score three or the hangs together, right? They are not talking about separate orders. We are talking about a set of orders who are talking to each other. They're beating each other, right? That's I think what is so fascinating about the foundations of modern social food. Um, uh, that's cannot be said about 20 or 21st century social theorizing where we are at each other throats and we ignore each other, right? It's a more typical, okay. Um, as I said, you know, he's a methodology called call activist, right? And that just explained this to you. A little riot methodological individualists.

Speaker 1:          22:06          We'll begins in order to develop our conception of society, you have to start with at the individual the only reality what you can observe in individual action and individual consciousness. Everything else, right? But you suggest is speculative, right? This is British individualism and empiricism, right? The French emphasizes there are stuff like law. This is why the legal system, the law is so important for Montesquieu. That's why the major book is called like the spirit of law because the law is not simply as some toto right of individual consciousness, it sends over us, right? And we get into a society and the law, the legal system already does exist. If will see Naruc handles the same thing. This is why the legal system is so important for him. Okay. Now let's move into the first team and talk about the different forms of government. Now he makes a distinction between Republican government, a monarchy, um, and desperate state. Republican government in his definition means that either the people,

Speaker 3:          23:25          uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          23:28          rule democracy or a subset of people, right? Aristocracy has the silver and power are the source of law. Um, as VBL see, he's not all that certain. Whether the people rule is all that good, right? He refers, sort of selected aristocracy. It will be even true for who. So he's much more radical than he is Manara here and which one alone governance. Uh, but by fundamental laws, the monarchy itself is bind by, by laws. Um, Eh, a desperate state. Now, there are no fundamental roles, rather desperate exercise. It is power at its vale, um, of Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Russia or Soviet Union. Our desk, Patek stays right where there is no proper rule of law. Now about a 30 public hell, as we said, there are two forms of it is the democratic and then the Edisto cratic farm in the democratic. You have a selection of people to office by lot.

Speaker 1:          24:40          Well, he's not, don't get about elections, but by lot and indeed in Greek democracy, people were occasionally selected two major offices, right? In ancient Greek by law, by lottery in aristocracy. People are selected by choice, right? The best people get into the office that they have the best skills to perform. Now he said, well, everyone can vote, but not everybody's prepared to serve in the office. That speaks right for uh, uh, uh, at his, at his stock class by choice. But, uh, whatever the republic is, that is a principle. Legitimacy is based on virtue. The person who served should be virtuals. Right? And if the virtuals ness of the person is question, then you know, the legitimacy of the person is in some trouble, a verb body. The virtuousness, remember Bill Clinton, he ran into some trouble, you know, because people started to bastion virtuals ness, right?

Speaker 1:          25:48          In the very narrow sense of the term. Okay. Anyway, that's the guiding principle. Then manner. Now here the prince has a silver and power is the source of law or to Mazda law is established. The prince has to follow that law. That's monarchy. And the principle here is honor. The prince has to be honorable, right? In order to be obeyed. Again, the busiest of legitimacy is honor and despotism as we have seen a Duvon of who governance can do whatever it wants to do is above the law. Right? Uh, and what is the principle of despotic rule fair, right? You obey those in power because you fear that. Well, the next is separation of powers and the see the, the three powers that are, but I the legislative power executive power, and they'd be able to see the power to judge later on. Executive power over Danks, depending on the right of nations executive power over things, depending on civil rights. Um, he said the first power executive power,

Speaker 3:          27:14          uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          27:20          executive legis legislative power, uh, in fact, uh, can be exercised by a king or a magistrate, uh, can be exercise by even elected body. But the second one, executive power, uh, Vale, it has to be executed. He believed the, uh, by, um, uh, usually by a monarch. Uh, and that is the last power, the power of judging a Veatch has to be separated from boss, uh, the, um, uh, legislative and executive power. Let, let's see the argument, what he puts forward. He said, vendor legislative power is United with the executive power in a single person that is no liberty. Uh, because one can fear, right that the same monarch who mates died, Dido, Nicole Ross, Bill, execute them in a tire and Nicole manner. So therefore you have to separate legislative and executive powers. Well, the separation is not complete, right? Because it takes time for the legislative body to pass laws. And therefore, very often executives even in the United States operate with executive orders, right? These executive orders kind of substitute right? For laws or legal regulations, right? So the separation, even in modern society like the United States is relative. And in fact, uh, many constitutional lawyers in the United States, we're concerned you in the last two administrations that the executive branch to often operated by executive orders, right? Rather than to ask, uh, uh, the legislature, right? To legislate about, uh, uh, doors today.

Speaker 3:          29:25          Um, okay. Uh, now, um,

Speaker 1:          29:35          he, then he goes on and he said, look, uh, uh, this is not really a question of that at public versus manner. He, uh, he said, look in in his stamps in most kings of Europe, but the government is quite moderate. Um, uh, he sat val depends who exercises. Uh, uh, the first two powers a bell, uh, leaves, uh, uh, uh, a great deal of autonomy for its subjects and the thallium republics. They are republics in office time, 18th century. The powers are United and that is less liberty actually in this Italian republics. Well, it's an interesting, uh, um, buoyant,

Speaker 2:          30:28          uh,

Speaker 1:          30:30          no about the legislative power. He said, val, it better to be an elected body, which exercises the legislative power, passes the laws, uh, and become close to the idea of universal suffrage in choosing the representative. All citizens should have the right to vote and then comes the qualification except who city so humble that they are deemed to have no deal of that all in order to have a veal, you better the be a property owner. Right. That is a suggestion here of property qualification. Mitch was quite dominant in the United States until the 20th century. Right? Um, uh, uh, in, uh,

Speaker 2:          31:23          Yep.

Speaker 1:          31:24          But on the other hand, he elaborates on it. People should not enter government except to choose their representatives. I, because in order to be in the executive, you'll need skills. Um, now you may know who would be the right person to run the office, but you may not be able to run the office. That's the fundamental idea.

Speaker 2:          31:51          Uh,

Speaker 1:          31:56          well it's also important, right, that these representative body, the legislature,

Speaker 2:          32:03          uh,

Speaker 1:          32:05          should be separated from a actual action. Now comes the idea, right? The right of minority. This is a novel idea cast in a very conservative way, but the way it is cast in a conservative kind of fuel door, Edisto cratic manner and that [inaudible] speaking, he's formulating a very important principle, what we are still struggling with, right? How to defend the rights of minorities against a despotism of the majority just be costs. 51% voted one day does not mean that 49% is wrong, right? And that the rights of that 49% or even just 1% in some days has to be guaranteed. And that's what he's struggling with. Now here in this context, and we'll put the citation, uh, on the web, so I don't want to read this very long citation. The argument is for the nobility, it said, well, the nobility has more rights and therefore they have more rights, more stakes in it.

Speaker 1:          33:16          They have more than one voice. Therefore, the solution is a two chamber solution, right? A chamber for the aristocracy, upper house and the chamber popularly elected by everyone, a lower house. Now, not in the aristocratic sense, but in some ways representing the defense, right? Of Small States and agrarian states. This is by the United States Senate. Every stage since two senators rather, irrespective of the size of the population, right? Uh, and therefore a though not in a, um, uh, uh, sort of few dollars stick way as Montesquieu demented, but it is, the whole proposition is very much alive, right. In our current political practices.

Speaker 1:          34:07          Uh, okay, that's me. The move on and talk about the executive power, the executive power should be stable. That's why he believes it better be in the hands of a manner, right? Because the government needs immediate action. It cannot leave right to Massey Congress to debate things all the time. Uh, the government has to act instantly and therefore it has to be in one hand. Um, well there are all of, he elaborates a number of limits of legislative powers. Some of it applies to the United States, others dawn, but may apply to Western democracies. It should convene at regular intervals. And that's quite true for all democratic states, right? The legislature is called very often, um, uh, and uh, with some regularity. Well, it should not be in session without interruption. Uh, the US, uh, uh, um, congress is virtually right in session almost without interruption, but other parliament in continental Europe or not necesarrily so the reason is that it, they don't want to make, uh, uh, uh, membership in the legislature.

Speaker 1:          35:34          The sole source of occupation and income and that are being switch speaks for this idea. Right now the legislature is not impermanent that a session. And then he said, that should not have the right to convene itself. Well, uh, the u s congress convenes itself. It does need the car of the executive. But in England, for instance, right, it is the queen who dissolves the parliament and cause the session of the bottle on them doesn't give her much power. But nevertheless, uh, it, uh, uh, the, the idea, the more Montesquieu and idea is present in a number of Western democracies, um, now, uh, regular intervals, that's obvious, right? When it should not be left to the executive, especially if the executive has the right to call into session the legislature, right? That may mean the executive veal not call the new laws are needed and they'll become a desk buddy.

Speaker 1:          36:36          That's why it has to be, uh, uh, uh, called by, um, uh, regular intervals. Uh, uh, and, uh, it, uh, you know, it should not be in session without interruption because he said it would overburden, uh, the executive power as well. Uh, and it cannot convene itself. He said, and the arguments are known because if it would, um, uh, have the right to decide whether it dissolves itself, it will never dissolve itself. That's the fundamental argument here. As I said, in many countries, this is exercise. She's very now the executive, he said, I should be able to check over the legislature. Uh, um, and uh, in what way? Uh, because it doesn't run the legislature, uh, to, um, uh, paralyzed the action of the government. Um, and, uh, the mean they, uh, how, uh, the, uh, executive exercises checks over the legislature is the veto right of the executive exactly like it is done in the u s constitution, right?

Speaker 1:          37:51          Uh, the president can veto laws which are passed by Congress, has to send back to Congress and the Congress has to overrule rather the veto of the president. But there is a clear light check of the, uh, executive over the legislature, right? Um, the executive has the possibility, uh, to remind the, uh, uh, the legislature, this may be a bad idea to pass this law. You better rethink it before it becomes a law. There are checks and balances over the executive branch. He is quite a conservative here. And he said the executive power belongs to the legislative oldest to its faculty, uh, Alpha,

Speaker 3:          38:40          uh,

Speaker 1:          38:40          vetoing, uh, the executive power. Uh,

Speaker 3:          38:46          uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          38:47          it's very important, right? And Axa, the rising of public funds,

Speaker 3:          38:52          um, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          38:56          only with the consent of legislature. This is again, a very important principle, the ruling all democracies. And either the budgets have to be improved, uh, by the legislature. Um, just see the mass. Uh, what we have seen in California recently, right by the, that the legislature was not giving the budget I have to the governor. Um, uh, but this is certainly a very important principle of democracy. Um, and now, uh, let me come to the question of environment and society and the whole idea that, uh, the physical condition shape,

Speaker 3:          39:37          uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          39:41          social conditions. And let me give you a couple of, uh, as I said, quite silly notes. He said, the spirit and passion are extremely different than in various climates. Laws should be relative to the differences in these passions. And now comes the real silly var call in cold climate, the blog is pushed harder or about the heart. This produces confidence in oneself and carriage and better, much so. You are more courageous, more active and smarter if you live in cold climates. Um, uh, like in France or in England, people in hot countries that they made like old man, I'm not all that teammate. Okay. Um, and then interestingly, you know, to sort of this himself from racism and that term which did not exist in his, that is that even the children of Europeans born inside the end is lose the courage of the European climate.

Speaker 1:          40:59          At least it is, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, not, uh, based on a racial argument, but indeed made ms on a extremely naive ecological argument. But let me emphasize that is fantastic insight here. Right? Um, for another 200 years, nobody took the environment seriously. I mean, the, the exception of Emil Durkheim, they will talk about this when we talk about their time coming from Montesquieu for Durkheim want a secure and Russo over the goths, right? That's that, uh, modern theory of society came from. It was Montesquieu and it'll solve a boss of them. So, uh, and now about the general spirit, he said many things, government climate, that ledger laws, the maxims of government, more sun manners. That is this all s to gather a general spirit which is formed as a result, right? I hope you get the idea of the general spirit, right? That that is a set of ideas, which is, uh, both our individual consciousness in child.

Speaker 1:          42:15          Who would we learn, right? We internalize those ideas. It is not coming from the individual. It is entered into the individual in the process of education, right? And therefore, the argument was Montesquieu makes repeated by Rousseau and do your crime. That's the 10 have and should have an idea off society or collective conscious neck standing over and above the individual. This is a big debate, right? Which informs most of the, that Bates in social sciences today in economics, in political science and sociology and anthropology, you have some scholars who the God themselves in economics, few methodological collectivists and doors will call themselves methodological individualist, rational choice people. Right. Are the methodological individualists, the cultural analysts are methodological Glock activist, right? We have that distinction virtually everywhere, as I said, least in economics. But even in economics, you have the institutionalists, right, who are on the edge, right? Or between being methodological or collectivist or being methodological individualists. Uh, and then, uh, uh, well, he says as civilization on force, uh, the importance of the general spirit is increasing and impact of climate is a, uh, a declining, not that climate doesn't matter, but overtime it's important declines. And the, the importance of general spirit increases. Well, that's about it for today. Thank you.
