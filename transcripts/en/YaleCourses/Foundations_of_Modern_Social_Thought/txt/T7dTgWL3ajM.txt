Speaker 1:          00:01          If saw that med school on to John Locke, um, uh, an order major, uh, scientist and a, another major founder of political and social philosophy and theory. I do again, what I did with hops, a Vr, again, do briefly for those who are not interested in lives and history. So first I introduce you, uh, are a friend today, John Locke, a, he was born in 1642 in Somerset. Uh, his father was a captain and a parliamentary or army are kind of small gentry, uh, uh, math, particularly ballsy but not poor either. Uh, uh, in 52, uh, he went to Oxford. Um, and uh, it was noted, uh, that, uh, he was idle unhappy and on the rare mark Qubole in Oxford, well, if you do not have a 4.0 at Yale bonds panic, right? You still can be right. John Law, there are somebody who blossom later. He was lead blossom or a, but he, by the end he was doing well.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Um, and in fact, uh, he, uh, uh, became, uh, an, uh, official, uh, you know, uh, English universities called teachers officials, officers, even at Yale, you know, we are called officers of Yale Corporation, uh, kind of, I think your old English tradition. Um, anyway, he was admitted and then in 64, he gave an address to the college. And this is a very important address because this is when he can learn the views of younger John Locke and cried career from this address that in fact, early in his life he was very traditionalist and quite authoritarian. The kings are good and the people are beasts. So in a way he was hopsy and, um, in fact, you know, in the two tatties he stays away discussing cops. But of course the ghost of hops is all over the place. Right. Uh, there are actually more seats in here and that's okay too. So you don't have to sit on the steps if you want to. That's fine.

Speaker 2:          03:02          Uh,

Speaker 1:          03:08          uh, a little about the times, uh, 49, I already mentioned Charles first was executed. Um, uh, the monarchy was abolished for that time. Oliver Cromwell, um, uh, uh, became lord protector of England. Uh, um, but, uh, he was very popular among many. Uh, he really could not control the struggle between the military and the parliament and the cows. Uh, a hops experienced, um, in the 30s and early forties. In some ways continue with the past, probably not as bad as before, but was still very bad. Belvin Colombo died. His song tried to become Lord Protector, did not succeed. And finally it was decided to call back Charles First Song, Charles the second to become king of England. So the monarchy was restored.

Speaker 2:          04:14          MMM.

Speaker 1:          04:16          So these were remained turbulent years and of course the kind of turbulence, a dusk color of what,

Speaker 2:          04:24          uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          04:26          lock stood for now, just a picture of Oliver Cromwell for you. Um, and then Charles Second, uh, who have a skin graft England for a 25 years. Um, now that is a new haven court action to all of this. And not all of you may know that,

Speaker 2:          04:48          uh,

Speaker 1:          04:50          but I'm sure everybody knows about it. They really have anu Wales and that a golf street is now, this has something to do with England and John Locke.

Speaker 2:          05:04          Uh,

Speaker 1:          05:05          two of the judges of the trial of Charles Wong, Edward Bailey and Villiam Golf, uh, we would accused of regicide and they escaped England in 1660 and they went to Boston. Uh, now they did their own choice, right? The event where horror Var this rather than going very earliest. Okay. Uh, but Boston was an unsafe place, uh, too much under the control of the crown. So therefore the went to the right place. Right. And that can it be, of course, new haven. So they came to new haven and you probably know where West rock is. Anybody was up on restaurant, few of them. Now Invest Doc, you'll see a sign be tess Josh School. So if you go that, that is a little cove and that according to the legends Vallely and golf high did in these school. So here you go. Uh, history comes back home. Then they moved actually to Milford and lived in a house there.

Speaker 1:          06:23          And I have the picture of this house. I don't spare my life on it, that this is the house in the day did, but that's what, uh, uh, some historian, they'll me. Okay. But that is a turning point in the life of John Locke in 66 when he meets a formidable person whose name was Anthony Ashley Cooper. Um, bell, he was a high Aristo crat, but he never, dls was anti royalist. He, Joe joined the parliamentary forces against Charles the first, um, and was also a member of the State Council, uh, during the republican times, but he supported the restoration of the monarchy in 66 and held very, very high offices between 60, 60 and 76 three, including the position of lord chancellor. Uh, well, um, uh, he became, uh, the Earl of Shaftsbury, uh, out of the grace of the king. And usually he's referred to as the Earl of chefs spirit. Uh, they only in 60, 60 event to Oxford, um, at Duke, uh, have a cure for his liver disease.

Speaker 1:          07:49          And this is when he met John Locke as a doctor. Um, and, uh, John Locke became a, his physician. And let's put it this way, his friend, probably a bit of a strong statement because the social status difference was too big to really call it as a friendship. But Ivo say a word about that relationship. And here is, uh, um, uh, the Earl of Shaftsbury, uh, now, uh, in [inaudible] 67, uh, lock move to Ashley's house at Exit Your House in this trend in London. And I'm sure those of you who visited London knew exactly that this trend is that still where sort of the legal establishment can be found in London. So he lived there in his household, like, you know, in feudal times, uh, clients live to the master's house and eat on the master stable

Speaker 1:          08:56          or with other servants, stable, even a high ranking people. Occasionally we're not a little to eat right. Uh, with the Lord. Now he became Ashley's confident advisor and surgeon. He performed a surgery. And I think medical scientists are still puzzled, uh, whether this was some pathbreaking surgery or vetter. Uh, he just had good luck, uh, ad that it helped. Uh, uh, um, um, Ashley, um, Ashley had a surplus production of his liver and he implanted a tube into his abdomen area to let this surplus flew out and certainly actually felt much better after the surgery. Well, uh, we know that occasionally the doctors say the surgery was successful and the patient died. Now this was a case when the patient was cured, but we don't know about that. The surgery had anything to do with it. Right? Uh, but, uh, uh, for those of you who are in sciences, this is just a proof that in the 17th century, you know, there was really, I didn't know distinction yet what sciences are, what philosophy is and what the social sciences are, was a difference, what theology was and the rest of the knowledge was.

Speaker 1:          10:25          But the rest of the knowledge was all the same. And sort of lock was also a scientist. 67. He wrote an essay, the essay on toleration, and this is a departure now from hops. These actually advocates, uh, uh, uh, the right to dissent as we have seen. You know, not that hops at all costs would have resisted every descent, right? You remember we discussed that that hops also conceited. If the king does not deliver, you can't transfer your loyalty from the king to another stupid fun. But, uh, the essay on tolerance does not simply make it as a such an exceptional case, you know, uh, but it makes a, makes a big argument that the right of the sand is an important individual. Right? He was also then elected in [inaudible] 68 as member of the Royal Society. The royal society is like what in the United States, we call the American Academy of Sciences.

Speaker 1:          11:34          Pretty hard to get into it. Uh, it was then, and it is now and 79, and he was already working. And, uh, uh, the second [inaudible], um, uh, uh, or assume or lead to some of, are talking about this, there is some debate when the first studies and the second draft is well written and that's not irrelevant actually. The timing of the two essays, they all, they've also, uh, on the other hand, that conflict between Charles the second and the parliament. And Earl of chefs, birdie. And of course by implication, John Locke, uh, Charles the second had only illegitimate children. He had quite a few of them, right? Uh, uh, I don't know whether he liked children, but it looks like he liked the technology at least. Uh, they are, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          12:35          therefore, you know, since the children were all the legitimate, the legitimate here to the Troon Vasa, his brother James. And the only problem with James was that he was Roman Catholic and we already know from hops that this was a big trouble at that time in Britain. So, uh, the parliament and chefs Bertie himself fear that Roman Catholics will restaurant that influence and that for the parliament's role there'll be reduced. Um, um, and then in 70s, three, uh, they, uh, the parliament was considering a Socon test act. And this is really an ugly act, right? Because test act man that you have to be tested whether you are Roman Catholic or you belong to the Church of England, and if you are Roman Catholic, then you should not hold certain offices. Right? This is just still discrimination. But you know, at that time it was kind of defense against the Vatican and the role of the pool. Uh, well, uh, um,

Speaker 2:          13:46          uh,

Speaker 1:          13:47          because Shaftsbury support for this, he was dismissed as lord chancellor. Nevertheless, a few years later, uh, the parliament, uh, uh, does pass the exclusion bill and they asked reporting, uh, James, one of the illegitimate children, um, are for chars as a successor to the truth. Now, um, and this is James Stewart, uh, the blood or of Charles the second, and this is the other genes, the Protestant Shaftsbury sprouter Gee, well, the Commons facet of law and Charles, the second death, he dismissed the parliament. Uh, uh, well Shaftsbury was at acid, a boot into the tower of London. Uh, you probably, if you've arrived in London, you visited the tower, or at least at the look at it, um, and after he was released was smarter than to stay in England who went to a right place. I actually have like his stage, the event to the Netherlands. Uh, if I had to be exiled, I would prefer it to be in Amsterdam before places.

Speaker 1:          15:04          Uh, okay. Uh, um, uh, in, uh, uh, uh, 83, uh, uh, the Vix, the vix at that time where the kind of the Democratic Party by the Tories were the Republican Party, right. And the vix were the equivalent of the Democratic Party. Well, the big swirl accused to have been involved in a plot to overthrow the king and some of them we would execute it. That was the right, right house plot. There are lock was smart enough, he knew he may be next in line. So he also made the right choice. He van to answer that. Um, well, again, I don't swear that this was exactly the house where the plot took place. I even not sure if the plot took place at all or whether this was an invention by the authorities there. Then there is that evolution in 88 and William of orange becomes the king. Yeah. Uh, um, uh, well the problem was the gym's a second did not realize that even the Tories, VNF support his religious agenda.

Speaker 1:          16:22          So he was actually overthrown. Um, and, uh, uh, then, uh, the Republicans and Democrats, I'm sorry, the Tories and Vicks came together and, uh, uh, they invited William, uh, uh, to become king of England. And here it is a very unstructured and the, uh, the color, uh, Queen Mary, uh, uh, uh, uh, his wife, uh, was very much involved in politics and important and locked down now can return to England. Um, and, uh, he felt safe and, uh, uh, uh, uh, 60 90 to do so. Well, uh, I've, you've talked about this later. The second Chatty's May actually be a reflection of the change to the house of Orange, which is a change from absolutism to constitutional monarchy. And therefore the second track, this can be read as an ideology for a constitutional monarchy rather than absolute designer, but that this is the case. It is being debated. A lock died in 1704. Interestingly, uh, you know, he is a major booker and the two charities on government was published, uh, um, uh, and, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          17:52          uh,

Speaker 1:          17:56          60, 90, but, uh, is it was published anonymously. You've was concerned enough, even at that time, uh, that, uh, uh, uh, he made on in could trouble if he publishes his book. Okay. Now I'm here, we'll be talking about the, the two charities and the, and the Varick now.

Speaker 2:          18:19          Whoops. Oh, of course. Yes, of course.

Speaker 1:          18:37          Yes.

Speaker 2:          18:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:40          So this is the duties of government, uh, reject. Shorty was appeared in print in a 60, 90, as you can see on the first edition. Now, uh, as I said, that is a debate about it. When the first and the second shut these was written and, uh, uh, there are two major locked scholars, uh, uh, bull spent all of their lives studying loch beat. The last letter, uh, suggested that the second Chatty's was written really first in the 1679. It was all engaged in the debates about the exclusion bill a while. Um, the Chubb Ashcraft to, uh, uh, he was, my colleague at Ucla at one point died. Unfortunately, very young billions scholar. Uh, actually he argued that the second year this was written in 1683. Um, and it is an evolutionary work that this is really the theory of constitutional monarchy and kind of popular Suva entity is being formulated for the first time. This is really in strong crash, almost absolute negation of, of hops. Well, not quite absolute disgust at some overlaps between the two arguments, but they both agreed that the first, that this was written in 1680, that's on uncontroversial, um, and was published anonymously.

Speaker 1:          20:18          So, uh, the first, uh, tease, uh, um, uh, well, um, IVL not to speak too much about this. Uh, uh, the second that it is really the big text, uh, everybody reads and sites. But the first that these, uh, uh, takes on a book, uh, published by 16 and 80 by Robert filmer. This looks to me, to me and very arcane book, but surprisingly it is still in print. You go on Google and you can buy a robot filmers, book, Patriarchy. There. I don't necessarily recommend it a, because I think this is really archaic and I don't think it got any major contribution beyond challenging lock to formulate a strong position against. That's, I think the only reason why you may want to read patriarchy. Now. Uh, he was very much for absolutism and the absolute monarchy, and he advocated actually inequality. He said, God said some man above others and he meant men, right?

Speaker 1:          21:27          Men are set over women, right? Uh, and, uh, older people like me are set over younger people like you, right? And the king over everybody else, right? So this inequality of power is coming from God. God decided that Aiden inherits the earth. And then the sentence of Aden, the sons and grandsons received their share of earth's right. So you'll have to show your family tree. Going back to Adam who received the, the, uh, uh, uh, word as a grant, and who was the first king? So the king should trace their family trees back, right? To the first person of grace of God. All right? So there was a scripture argument that God vested Paternal Authority in Aden, uh, gave the earth as a grant to him. Um, and the monarchical absolute power is inherited this way. That is the scent of the monarchy go power. So I said, I see very little right relevance of this argument. Uh, so I, I, but certainly it was important for luck to have a astrue man, right? He could fees his argument against, um, uh, probably spent too much time, right? Um, debating filmer. And you may have been a bit concerned about this theological controversies and theological arguments in the book, but otherwise, you know, he's really formulating the first big ideas for modern democratic theory.

Speaker 1:          23:13          Okay. So, uh, uh, now Lark as, uh, engages, uh, uh, filmer, uh, on a number of level, um, it actually engages him on the theological level and he said, well, it's Anshu, uh, that Aiden, uh, received the land. There's grant, it was mankind who received the, the land is a grant from God and then he moves on and he, uh, kind of, uh, makes, uh, a more technical argument is that they are, even if we assume that it was one single male who the of land and all authority, uh, how a nurse, you can trace your yourself back to this. This is not a real good way to legitimate somebody. How can Charles the second shows, that's, you know, he has the answers to the survey now, so that is not the right way to do. And then he said, well, even if it could be done, it would be silly to do that, right?

Speaker 1:          24:19          Just because somebody is the proper ancestor should not have, should not be this juvenile. What if that person is a jerk? Right? Then you really want to have the right people, right to exercise authority, right? It's a right in his Stan, you know, a very daring argument. Now let's have a look at the second Chatty's and the major themes. What he's like, like, uh, uh, engaging. Why cops, he begins with the statement, we are all born equal and he has free, free and equal. But as we voc he throws a very different conclusion than hops, dead or by and large, different conclusion. And then here does equity. The clock that we need, um, uh, uh, common superior, uh, uh, a silver, silver and a superior is necessary to avoid, uh, the state of war. Then he develops a fascinating theory of property, what we have to deal with.

Speaker 1:          25:30          Uh, and then he makes these pathbreaking aren't humans, um, that, uh, uh, what we need is a rule by majority. He does not quite identify what that, that majority is, right? This is not popular sue veracity yet. But the idea of rule by majority for the first time is formulated by John Locke. And acceptance of authority can be done only by consent and what is needed. And this is the very big contribution of law, a separation of powers, checks and balances, right? This is what is completely missing in hops. And he's making these past breaking, um, uh, argue man. So yeah, are all born free and equal. Let me speak to this a level now. What is political power? And he defies these three elements of political power, right? Well, uh, this is, uh, uh, the right to make law that is also execution of law.

Speaker 1:          26:40          And that is also politics means the defense of the common vast against outside enemies that are these three functions, right? Uh, politics is serving and this will be very important in his sort of divisions of powers as such. Now, ah, Bell, if he want to understand their political power, political power is we have to see at the origins of political power and to try to understand why owners, people from the state of nature, where they were free and the claw move into civil society where these two rounder, some of their freedom and veal Vivia CVL surrender some of that equality. So, uh, what is the origins of this, uh, uh, equality bell? The first argument is very much counter hops, right? Men all well at all made by God the omnipotence, right? And we are his rapper. The account of theological argument and the are not, have not been created for the pleasures of one another.

Speaker 1:          27:55          So there should not be any men who is a superior, right? But then support. All right, because we are free, right? The lock is a liberal, right? Hearts is a conservative. So what we are experiencing now, right, is the transition of philosophy wrong conservativism to liberalism, right? And liberalism, of course we'll emphasize, but particularly freedom is the primary, uh, uh, uh, value. Uh, and in the state of nature, he said, we will all governed by reason and I eh, and that actually sort of because we are all reasonable, the are born the reasonable you are born to be able to be rational, right? They should be able right to understand that they are not supposed to harm each other is it is a very different arguments. But what we have seen, uh, uh, uh, on from hops on Tuesday, right? A hops said that we are actually learning more reality, uh, out by interacting with others who are desiring the same stuff.

Speaker 1:          29:14          What we do, we are learning it from struggle, right? He does not assume that this comes out of our rationality. That we are reasonable and by nature good. He does assume that we are reasonable. Therefore why owners be should not know that we should respect others. Well, Bot and this then is where law comes the closest to converge with the hops. Well that is on the other hand, a danger that that ear will be have a war and in order to avoid war, this is why the real subject ourselves to an authority. And leave the state of nature. Uh, uh, but he also makes a claim just to distance himself from harps. He said, that's not, that's the state of nature is necesarrily war. Right? They have to make a distinction between the state of war and state of nature. We've got no state of nature of are good and reasonable, but nevertheless, uh, it, uh, it can turn into a state of war and that's why we will have to join civil society, um, and accept and authority.

Speaker 1:          30:31          Well, and now comes again a very big difference. So he accepts the danger of war. He lived in times of war and he accepts that we need an authority because, um, after this, uh, now, um, but, and, and now you come to the big differences. Well, uh, the live, uh, we, we subject ourselves to, uh, authority, uh, of others, but this has to be, has to be done by consent, right? Uh, those who are, who are accepting a server and have to consent to the subjugation to authority. Uh, and the last citation is also extremely important, right? Freedom of men on their government is to have a standing rule of liberty, right? Come on to every one of that society and made by a legislative power erected in it, right? So the legislative power, now this is the source of [inaudible] is somehow in a proper way constituted, right?

Speaker 1:          31:45          This was not a problem really for a hops. Not much, right? He could see that that will be simply confirming a silver entity to a single king. Now lock is very interested how the silver and the source of power to pass legislation is being constituted. And again, he's emphasizing which was not in hops but is important. The standing rules to assure liberty, right? Not simply survival, right? Davino hopes had it a more complex way, but liberties the major issue. Uh, but we are seeking for now and then he comes to it, an interesting guy. The or why do we submit ourselves to authority and seek protections for our liberty because we want to protect our property. That's the role of the public authority to Platek covered the, it's a very realistic and the important assumption aggression and which he and Karl Marx would probably agree. What is that all of the governments do guarantee the sacredness of private property.

Speaker 1:          32:59          And he has an interesting ideas about what property is that it is coming from. Very important. This foreshadows Adam Smith's in some days also foreshadows Karl Marx in another day. Now he starts with this idea that men had given the word two men in common, and therefore all the fruits belong to each member of the society. It's almost trite a socialist ideology, right? Um, uh, and, uh, he continues along these lines. He said every man has a property in his own person, right? And, uh, the label of what you produce is yours, right? The productive you labor belongs to you. And you will see this is the first formulation, what we bill learn from Adam Smith and Karl Marx as the Labor theory of value, right? Libor belongs to the Labor, right? Um, uh, as, as such, uh, uh, because it was created by what is yours, the only thing, what certainly is yours, and this is new.

Speaker 1:          34:14          We're on body, right? And you labor in capacity. He's had an for this labor being the unconventional property of the Labor. Uh, and then this is a beautiful citation. I just love it, right? Uh, do the water running in the fountain be every once yet who can doubt? But that in the picture is his only who do with that. Bingo. Right? How crisp Billy in once sentence, right? He can capture these wonderful idea that libor creates the value, right? Wonderfully done. And of course, great influence on Adam Smith and Karl Marx there, but there are also limits on private property. Again, he, he almost reads like a socialist. Uh, he said may anyone and gross as much as CVL a dovish, shy answer, not soul, right? God has given us all things richly hell, but how far has he given it to us to enjoy, right? And whatever is beyond this is more than your share. You have only, uh, in your, uh, belongs to you. What you can actually enjoy nothing, but you accumulate these radical idea. If your back paddle in a minute, right? I'd be show you how he backed out of this very radical idea.

Speaker 2:          35:58          But, um, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          36:01          now I, and the chief Macha is of course ers, he said it's absolutely obvious right at the property belongs to those who can cultivate it, right? As much land as mental plants improves, cultivates and can use the production of so much. This is Blah burpee. So the land belongs, it's not another notion of private ownership of the land. It's an ownership by the cultivator. And also, let me just point out why running out of time there is a very important difference here, right? But essential for four look argument is the abundance. He can make this argument because the primary assumption is that what we desire is available in great abundance to us. We have seen that hops had the opposite idea, right? Uh, we are fighting each other because what we actually desire is a scarce good, too many people want and then we kill each other to get it right.

Speaker 1:          37:01          So that is a scarcity assumption in hops. And there's an abundancy a hypothesis in, in lock and you have to make up your mind who is appealing to you more. Uh, do you think that the scarcity assumption is a better one or the abundancy argument is an empirical and more dealing one? Well, and then he, as I said, now he back backpedals he knows he's going too far. He said Bud Brigade, remember God gave the word to man in common, but since she gave them for the benefit, uh, well, uh, he basically did it to the industrials once. So those who are very hard there shouldn't get more rather than who does do notary that hard. And then he actually will go,

Speaker 2:          37:49          um, uh, uh, further, um,

Speaker 1:          37:55          labor creates value. Right. And the argument is right that everything, uh, what has been created as a value has been created by a, or almost everything. That's interesting kind of equation at the end. Uh, right. Um, the products of the earth's used food to life of man, he said nine tenths are the effects of labor. Well, I don't know if we felt that be it certainly about, well what, what that really means and why or nurse, she makes a claim. But now and here comes a very big qualification. The invention of money at cumulation of property becomes possible, right? And therefore, as a accumulation of money occurs, uh, well, uh, then wells can be hoarded up the south injury to any wall. And this becomes, again, very important, right? For liberal theory, you can't do anything by which you do not injure somebody else, right?

Speaker 1:          39:02          But shouldn't be prohibited. And where government should send in when they sense injury against somebody else. Right now, in order to preserve property, you will have to transfer power to the community, to civil society. There are some very important arguments here. It has to be by settling. Standing rules has to be written down, has to be agreed upon, and it has to be permanency. There must be a permanent suppose goes through. You need a predictable environment, uh, and it has to be the same to all parties. You cannot make a law, which applies to the surface and the law, which applies to the noble man. It has to be the same law for everyone. Um, uh, uh, uh, such, uh, well, um, and this is the origin of a legislative and executive power of civil societies. Well, uh, there is a difference between, uh, uh, absolute manner.

Speaker 1:          40:08          He, uh, and constitutional monarchies. He said in an absolute monarchy, you can appeal to the law, uh, to restrain violence against you by another subject of the crown. But he said in an absolute monarchy, you cannot really appeal against the king. That's what, you know, in communist societies, you could not sue the government, right? Even in Stalinist Russia, you could saw your neighbor, if your neighbor did school steal something from you. But if the government is steer anything from you, you could not sue the Soviet government, right? But a democratic system means this is foreshadowed here. If you can sue the government, right. And of course in the United States they can sue the government. Well, you can try it. We are not over. It's very, but, uh, good luck avail. Um, and then he says, this is fun and very, very good. Well, the thing that men are so foolish that they care to avoid plus miss chiefs can be done to them like your neighbor polecats or focuses, but our counter not to think of the safety of divorce by lions as crazy lions are the kinks, right? The big authorities. So don't just seek, um, laws which protect you against your neighbor. See Clause, which protects you against those in position of authority and power. Uh, right. Uh, and that not we would be no civil society unless, uh, uh, this, uh, uh, bands, well, he advocates than the principle of rule by the majority, right? Uh, well what we need, I can't sent of every individual who made the community in order to create legitimate through, um, uh, and once these, uh, is, uh, uh, arrived at and that you're bound, um, everybody,

Speaker 2:          42:20          uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          42:26          and the bond can be subjected to authority only by consent. They are, this concept can be passive is not necessarily all of us. Uh, explicit. You are born in the United States. You did not approve, right? The constitution of the United States, never. The less you have to obey the constitution of the United States, you have one chance not to do so. Uh, you can move through Afghanistan if that's what you prefer, right? So you don't have to go by American law. You can live under Islamic law. Then you move to a country, the world by Islamic law. Uh, and then the final major contribution, the separation of powers. And he makes a distinction between three types of powers, legislative, executive, and federative powers. That's very different from Montesquieu and different from the American constitution right there. The three branches are legislative, executive, and judicial power. Uh, he makes that claim, uh, that the turn branches federative power. Federative power is a defense against outside enemies. And he said, look, but it's important that legislative power and executive power has to be separated from each other. Uh, it is absolutely as if it is the same person or the same authority which passes the law and which also executes the law. We have to separate those. Um, uh, and, uh,

Speaker 2:          44:00          oh,

Speaker 1:          44:02          val, I don't have time to go into this. Uh, uh, uh, uh, it's clearly enough. Uh, and then that is the kind of federative powers. As far as the federative powers are concerned. He said, well, the federative powers may not be necesarrily separated from the executive branch. It can be actually held by the executive branch as such, as in many ways, it is the key. It's very unclear in the United States who actually has this federative powers, right? By law, it is the congress, which can declare only laws, uh, wars. But as we have seen, the United States was engaged in a number of major military actions, but commonly we call wars, though the war was never declared right. And it was the executive branch, right, which they fuck to a declared war and conducts war. Uh, occasionally we saw the consent occasionally against right. Um, the, uh, Bill, uh, of the, uh, uh, of the house and the Senate. So it's a complex issue, but I think he was quite right that, uh, uh, often, um, the federal active power and executive power are the same.
