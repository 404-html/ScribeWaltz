Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, good morning. Um, now the move to our last alter in discourse to Emile Durkheim, uh, that rd Ali to Durkheim's. Uh, we have seen certainly to Marxists and to, uh, uh, Weber's, uh, that I'd also two faces of Emil Dirk time. Uh, to put it bluntly, uh, the young Durkheim, uh, has been a functionalist and the positivist and then late in his life, he has his epistemological churn. He became a cultural analyst. Well, it's not quite true because you know, each author is more complex and there are already elements of his cultural is in the early Varick, but there was certainly a dramatic change in the Va, how Durkheim conceived the, um, but what the job of social sciences later in his life in his book, uh, the alimentary forms of religious life, I think it had a lot to do also with his personal life.

Speaker 1:          01:20          And if you're talking about this, um, he was, uh, uh, brought up here and I'd have been a core family and it was supposed to become a rabbi and then he revolted against the parental household. Um, much like Nicha did, uh, turned probably in 28 days, but certainly not an active believer in Judaism. And later in his life. Um, he became again, interested in religion and not only a philosophically, but also existentially interested in religion. Um, well in the course, uh, we have only four lectures on Durkheim, so I leave a Durkheim, the culturalist out and Vivio doing a very only on the, a earlier very, um, uh, the division of Labor. Uh, the wonderful book suicide and as somewhat difficult book the rules of sociological mattered. Uh, um, and I, uh, I just leave the elementary form of religious life. I don't have time to fit this into a Durer came, had a extra ordinary impact on the, uh, American social science.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Um, initially it was particularly the younger Durkheim. The functional is Durkheim who had such an extra ordinary impact. Um, uh, unlike, uh, uh, vapor or Marx whose impact was brewed. And the fact that history and economics and political science Durkheim impact was much more focused on the sociology. So in the scores, the only author who properly speaking is a sociologist, is Emil Durkheim. All the others you discussed? Um, uh, we're not really identified themselves as sociologists later in his life. He did did, uh, but, uh, not, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, on the whole Emile Durkheim, uh, uh, identified himself and his project as a sociology. Uh, it, of course has lots of food, lots to do that these disciplinary boundaries between economics, political science and sociology became much more sharp redrawn by the end of 19 and early 20th century. Um, and the sociology as an academic discipline was really established by the late 19th century.

Speaker 1:          04:16          So this is Emile Durkheim born in 1858 and died in 1917. Just very briefly about his life. He was born in a small down Epi now in France because I said he's a father, was a rabbi and the, uh, he was expected to become at home by himself. Uh, in 79, he was admitted to the Ecole Normale superieure, which is one of these very elite schools, MIT, uh, uh, version in France. Um, and, uh, uh, by the time he went to a university, you called northern mass per year is a university. Um, uh, he lost his religious beliefs. Um, uh, he was, uh, uh, for some time a professor at the University of Bordeaux. Uh, then he became politically active in the 1940s, um, especially in the so called Dreyfus affair. And Ivo just briefly mentioned what that was, uh, uh, than 1902. He became professor at the University of batteries, which is not quite as distinguished as a core Nora mastery per year.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Uh, uh, he's sign avast killed the end of war and shortly after this he died in Paris. So this is Alfred Dreyfus. This is a very important event in French and in many ways in European history. What was the drive was to have fear? You're probably, or no, in 1894 Dreyfus who was a, uh, Jewish, uh, it was, uh, a falsely accused to be a German spy and it was, uh, uh, imprisoned, uh, that was, uh, obviously, um, an antisemitic trial. And these mobilized, the French intellectuals are not only French intellectuals, uh, but uh, uh, uh, French intellectuals in particular, um, Emile Zola, uh, whom some of you may have rather a the leading French writer of this ebook rule, an important article which appeared in the, uh, French leading French daily newspaper. Yakuza I accuse the French should this study of being anti Semitic. Now Derek came joy into other prominent intellectuals to protest, to trial.

Speaker 1:          07:01          It took them a long time, but eventually they were successful. Dreyfus was eventually exonerated of all charges and amid the night of the Legion of honor. So it was, uh, a happy ending, uh, French antisemitism, a photo via then it came back with van Jams, um, during the occupation Nazi occupation franchise, not as innocent about antisemitism as you may want to believe it. Uh, uh, many of you are collaborating with the Nazis. Well about the Verruca in 93, he wrote a dissertation and which it probably is still his most influential book, the Division of Labor in society. And today's lecture, if you will be focused on this, uh, 95 feet first followed by the rules of sociological and mattered, uh, which is, uh, his most positivistic statement. The division of Labor is his most functionalist work. Um, and then, uh, in 97, he had all suicide. A suicide is a very important book because it's three early, the first piece of rigorous empirical social science, which takes a very unusual, very rare phenomenon like suicide and, uh, crunches numbers extremely carefully to test where that he can identify social determinants of such a real phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          08:38          Uh, fortunately, uh, even in countries where many people commit suicide, like side is still area for an [inaudible]. Uh, it's, uh, but he managed to come up with a very provocative theory, but he, um, uh, uh, demonstrated it very careful empirical analysis. Maybe we'll be looking at the two parts of the division of Labor. Um, today we will be looking at, uh, uh, the major arguments of division of labor. Um, um, um, and then, uh, also Vivia look at, uh, uh, uh, uh, Thursday on his theory of Anime, uh, which is a central piece of the book, division of Labor. Um, uh, but, uh, uh, uh, I kind of a bite of a, um, uh, analysis. Um, uh, uh, uh, and as I said in 1915, he wrote this book, the elementary forms of religious life, which is a major break in his work. Uh, uh, uh, and the shorts, his renewed interest in the spiritual and the metaphysical.

Speaker 1:          09:52          Okay. Uh, just, uh, very briefly what is in the box. As I said, the division of Labor was his phd dissertation, but on like money, uh, um, uh, scholars who's a only go the book is that dissertation and Durkheim full audit up for Viet a number of good other books. Um, uh, many festivals, I'd actually one book people, or at least they should have been because there are only good book for us that is sufficient and what they publish later only published because publish or perish, right? To get tenure. That's why they probably published too many books. Um, anyway, um, he was inspired by Montesquieu. Um, uh, they all do it. Academies, Very French, uh, and his roots are deeply in, won't askew and to some extent in Jerusalem. Uh, he admired Russo as val, but Montesquieu is really, uh, the, uh, major, um, inspiration behind him.

Speaker 1:          10:55          And, uh, well what he does, he uses law as a measure of social development, uh, uh, much life. Montesquieu did sort of a, um, uh, um, uh, and, uh, uh, he explains, uh, uh, by using the law or the legal system, um, uh, uh, how, um, the division of labor of war, of the, what were the stages of the development of division of Labor? There are, um, uh, just a very brief for contrast, right? Maurice was interested in economic conflict, right? In struggle at and, uh, um, uh, scares economic resources. The Zebra was interested in struggle for power. I Sovos nature, they're kind of was interested in social solidarity. Um, uh, Mark's and vapor are conflict theorists. They tried to explain about breaks up society. Um, Durkheim is a tiered is the of each just to understand what holds society together but brings us together.

Speaker 1:          12:03          Arisal Saturday is not falling apart. Uh, right now, uh, in the book he makes a crucial distinction between two types of solidarity, mechanical and organic solidarity. Um, and, uh, uh, I've, you'll speak about this at great lengths. This is an other attempt to develop a type pathology of evolution of societies. You are already familiar with Mark's more soft production, right? The evolution from slavery to feudalism to capitalism. You're all familiar with Max Faber, traditional authority and legal rational authority. Now, direct camps alternative is mechanical and organic solidarity, right? But a vapor called traditional authority is kind of mechanical solidarity for Durkheim or Marx called pre capital is formations, is mechanical solidarity, organic solidarity. Describe legal rational authority or modernity or capitalism. Uh, uh, he also identified the pedal and Dzhokhar pedological forms of division of labor. And this is what he called anime. And his idea of anime is a kind of similar or analogous distinction.

Speaker 1:          13:32          What was, what was alienation in marks and what it was this enchantment in the vapor, uh, a door that are very important differences as well. And I will be talking about this tourists today now on suicide. As I said, this is the one of the first very rigorous empirical studies of a social phenomenon. A phenomenon we think is not quite social. They think it is really an individual decision whether you take your life or not about Durkheim actually was capable to show that even in these very private action when you take your life that are social determinance, who is committing suicide or not, and he's making a distinction between different types of suicide. Annemieke, altruistic, egoistic and fatalistic Vance and ivy would be talking about this, uh, uh, after you returned from Thanksgiving spray now about the methodology, he was a methodological collectivists, much like Montesquieu or Shaw and very much online cops lock or mills.

Speaker 1:          14:45          You know, Mark's being kind of halfway between methodological individualism and collectivism as a teary stuff, revolutionary consciousness. He evolves at evolution as a methodology called call activists. Maybe you'll see a deer camps notion of collective conscience is not all that different from Weber's. Uh, Mark's idea of class consciousness, which is not the sum total right of the individual consciousness are very curse. Uh, uh, but, uh, Mark's in his theory of exploitation as you have read his stacks reach almost like Adam Smith or John Stuart Mill, right? It's a self interest international individuals from which he explains the nature of exploitation. Arielle, it's much more difficult to figure it out, but how VBA Fitzy cause we scatter goodies. I think he's also [inaudible] between collectivism and individualism later in his life is becoming more of a methodological individualism. But Dirk kind of consistency in Durkheim, is that from Dave Ron, he's a methodological collectivist and remains I the logic God called activist. But at the same time he believed in the existence of social facts. Um, and the social facts on the other hand can be observed which rigorous and [inaudible] and methodology. And this is what makes him a in, in a v a positivist. So this is a, uh, just a brief introduction to a who the orchard is an now let me move over to the division of Labor. Um, and uh,

Speaker 1:          16:58          yeah, all my computer getting slower as the semester is progressing. So it's probably time for the semester to end because my laptop though it is new, it's still, uh, there'll become unbearably slow by the end of the semester. Okay. So this is Emil Durkheim and the division of Labor in society. So how does a Durkheim proceed? Um, in the Varick and a, uh, today's presentation will focus, uh, on the question. Why do a kind of begins the analysis, uh, uh, by taking the law as a, the point of departure. Um, uh, and uh, uh, uh, uh, Dan, uh, Viveo, uh, proceed how he makes the distinction between organic and, uh, um, uh, um, uh, mechanical solidarity. Um, uh, so, uh, the question actually is what I methodological called activist, uh, uh, uh, uh, that you need to find the, um, some of collective expression, uh, in order to study society and not individuals.

Speaker 1:          18:24          And a march, like Montesquieu, um, he be beliefs that the law is such a collective phenomenon, a law, which again, be studied and established the, to studying individual views or individual opinions. Right. Uh, it's a, uh, Bart's off, uh, about, uh, you know, uh, during camps during the analogy is the collective conscience, um, nerve, which is, uh, uh, at Bhava individual consciousnesses. Ah, okay. So that's, um, uh, uh, uh, what, what are the most important, uh, issues, uh, um, in, in the very few, as far as we discuss it today, uh, val, he is interested in, in solidarity. Um, as I pointed out, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, the, our, uh, his, his real question is what holds society together? The are so different and society short fall apart. And it is a writing in the late 19th, early 20th century. This is the time of industrialization of urbanization.

Speaker 1:          19:44          People are, this launched from that, um, the traditional communities from the traditional villages, uh, Gustave from Besant agriculture and move into urban industrial employment. Um, and the question is, um, a veal society breakdown, social VR, social order breakdown. Um, if, uh, the traditional order does not keep us together and this is what he tries to figure it out, what in a modern, urban and industrial society cannot keep us together and he tries to find a Saudi daddy did and, uh, uh, well, uh, uh, uh, uh, what creates is a solidarity, uh, is called lefty for consciousness. Uh, um, uh, the fundamental idea about indirect came about collective consciousness. Um, as I said, it is a analogous to the notion of the genital veal, um, uh, in the, uh, uh, a little sore or, uh, the notion of class consciousness, sir, uh, in Mark's, uh, uh, so therefore it is not the sum total of individual consciousnesses, uh, but, uh, something, uh, uh, of, uh, shared norms, beliefs and values which exist prior and individual is being born prior, uh, society actually existed, which is passed on from one generation to the other.

Speaker 1:          21:22          Right. And, uh, uh, therefore he tries to show, right these collective consciousnesses of which persist over time. Um, and, uh, of course, the most obvious, most rigorous way to go about this, to look at law because that's exactly what the law is, right? The law is changing over time, but usually, uh, the change is very, very slow and reaches over several generations. Uh, so, uh, ever before, somebody who is a French social scientists, you know, and run the Unifi, we already talked about this. Uh, uh, uh, the French are very methodological collectivists the Anglo Saxon send to be methodological individualist. Um, and the French online, the German, um, are very scientific. The are very much scientists. Um, uh, delivered our CRT thick, uh, in German does not exist. Uh, the German say, um, uh, API, this and shaft La vison shaft means, uh, um, uh, uh, vison is knowledge, uh, uh, um, uh, science in German is constituted by all sorts of knowledge, right?

Speaker 1:          22:50          It's a much broader notion, right? In French or in English bit sciencey really mean rigorous science of the natural science. Stipes. Now that's Derrick hand did not go as far as saying it is natural science, but certainly he was very scientific in insistence of rigorous analysis. Uh, our firm objective data, right? That's what, uh, uh, uh, why the Germans, you know, Vincent Schaffler, all those who study ideas, uh, uh, Bisson shufflers it's a much, much, much broader notion of natural scientists are also vison shufflers but people who study humanities and history of ideas. I'd also vison Shufflers, uh, people who are an expert on co ops and spend their life writing on hops is a vison shuffler right? In German we can hardly see somebody who does right. History of ideas to be a scientist, right? It's uh, uh, uh, the, we call it, you know, humanities.

Speaker 1:          23:57          Um, it talks about social sciences, uh, uh, with a lot of anxiety and real scientist ask cross social science. What do you mean? What is science about what you are doing? Well, those of you who take economics, they make sure it looks like silence because you have all the equations on the blackboard. So therefore, you know, a scientist can relax, but you, if you are listening to my lectures and not a single equation on the blackboard, you probably have doubt that this is the reality. Social Science. Anyway, he was a CRT faker in chance of being very rigorous and his analysis sort of artist collective consciousness. I give, uh, here, uh, um, uh, a, um, a citation for you, right? Uh, um, uh, if there's, uh, a totality of beliefs and sentiments of each are common to the average member of society, right? But which has a life of its own.

Speaker 1:          25:05          All right. Um, uh, that's what he calls a collective consciousness. So this is, uh, uh, different from the consciousness is of the individuals and door. You know, he, he's a, he's a scientist, uh, right? Is she on traffic? And it is, has to be realized in individuals. So therefore, I mean, Durkheim, I will not necessarily be opposed, uh, uh, to carry out even survey research and ask individuals about the custom sort of values and the sort of aggregate this up and try to find those patterns, especially overtriage diamond across nation. That's not really what he did, but I think he would be open for these kind of half research, which of course made him so influential in early American sociology in the 1930s, forties and 50s. Because, uh, um, American sociology has been very positive and very embedded car. Now, uh, but the most obvious example of collective conscience is, uh, the law, probably also the language. Well, uh, there are differences, uh, in law and the three modern and modern societies. Now we are getting into, he's building the argument opt to make the distinction between organic and, uh, um, uh, uh, mechanical, mechanical and organic solidarity. Um, and, uh, uh, left me just, uh, uh, Gore through of this, uh, uh, ops,

Speaker 2:          26:53          uh,

Speaker 1:          26:54          too far. Okay. Um, so, uh, in the argument is done in, in pre modern societies, uh, uh, the, the law of each existed is Brian Maternity or repressive or penal law. Um, uh, val that, uh, you know, that is, uh, uh, the purpose of Bunich Mandt is to punish evil behavior and we tend to agree what is eve? Your behavior is, uh, um, and punishments. So therefore, also tends to be harsh, uh, to, uh, prevent, uh, uh, further, um, uh, aggressive behavior. Um, uh, uh, by, uh, individuals, uh, uh, uh, sued. This is, uh, the legal system of pre modern societies. Well, I will give you a couple of citations and I won't read them. Uh, I will put them on the intranet and you can see the, uh, to at your leisure. It kind of elaborates, uh, on, on the points I made.

Speaker 2:          28:04          Um, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          28:08          okay. Uh, but in modern society, uh, the legal system is very different. Uh, the legal system is based on contract. The essence of modern legal system is contract. There's not that we do not have a pin or cold, right? The penal code survives. But what is of a novel is a, uh, a contractual, uh, law, um, which is rest of the [inaudible] river, which is not about punishing EDL, but simply restitute the damage. Somebody by baking a contract costs to the other contracting partner. Right. And he said that this is a new type of law which emerges, uh, uh, via modernity. Uh, Marshall will say, uh, it is, uh, uh, a new legal system, uh, which emerges a of, we had to be capitalism or, uh, um, and, uh, Vaibhav you'll say this is the essence of Liga rational authority. Uh,

Speaker 2:          29:15          uh, um,

Speaker 1:          29:21          bell. Uh, Oh, why does he study law? I don't want to elaborate on this too longer. Uh, that's, uh, obvious that, uh, the legal system is the single best measure of what he, he tries to get at collective conscience, which can be the most objectively, right, that our law books and legal practices and, uh, uh, minutes of, uh, uh, recordings, how the courts operated and how low was made and implemented, which can be studied with great level of, uh, rigor. Um, uh, uh, for instance, it's very easy to study whether indeed contractual law, um, is a new form of law are you can go back to legal history and to establish exactly then contractual law and merged. This was actually also very much undermined, uh, for, uh, the younger Viber. Uh, then he was also looking at basically the emergence of contractual law. You can lead to medieval Italy, um, in, uh, his, uh, uh, phd for the law degree.

Speaker 1:          30:38          Uh, uh, uh, I think I already made this point. What is interesting that uh, Durkheim and labor sort of ignored each other? Um, uh, I don't think they ever cited each other. I don't recall ever seen a citation to one another. They were working on the same area. Of course it was, the speed did speak most of the languages. And they were of course aware that the other giant exists. They were probably in many ways to close, um, too much in competition with each other to cite each other. I mentioned already that Durkheim did review Marianna Weber's book, but never any of Weber's book, though Mariana was writing, write about marriage or a lot of marriage law of which was a marginal interest to Durkheim and they've ever was rotting on religion. This was so central for their clients into us and never had their last, they've kind of ignored each other.

Speaker 1:          31:41          Now about the two types of solidarity, uh, well, uh, mechanical solidarity, uh, it's real hard to remember the distinction. One would think organic solidarity must be old, right? And mechanical must be modern. The machines. Now, the opposite is true. I, I kept making these mistakes for the first two or three years when I was leading Durkheim some 45 years ago. Uh, uh, uh, mechanical or sorry, Daddy. The, the is, uh, uh, uh, which describes a pre, pre modern societies. Um, and uh, this is a solidarity which based on the similarities, uh, uh, of, uh, uh, uh, of, of, of, of the parts, uh, um, well this is why you can have a, um, uh, a penal law because a penal law does not make a distinction between contractual partners. Uh, it assumes the sameness of the group as such, uh, uh, and uh, uh, mechanical solidarity, right?

Speaker 1:          32:56          Uh, is, uh, as I said, it's primarily based that we are the, the seat CRC have similar, uh, in, in the globe organic solidarity. A Savill Durkheim argue is one which is based on differences in society. A higher level of division of Labor in society produces organic solidarity, organic. He man sits as a kind of biological analogy and modern societies like the human body, right? There are functional differences between the human organs. That's why these organic solidarity, right? The heart performs a different function than the longer, but the long could not live the south of the heart, right? This is why this is organic. Saudi, Saudi, Daddy, the society operates more like an organism or um, in the earlier times society was more operating like a machine where you actually a party staking out mechanically. It doesn't matter all that much. Right? Is a simple machine.

Speaker 1:          34:05          Uh, I mean, so that's a, that's the fundamental distinction by the way, also for Durkheim. Um, uh, and this is also in the Texter, but you are eating, there's distinction between mechanical and organic. Solidarity is, uh, developed in order to describe a societies as such, but much like, uh, the bursts notion of traditional authority and Legal National Authority, uh, he is also using this to understand the, um, uh, uh, uh, so sad. The social solidarity is in contemporary life. So mechanical solidarity does exist in the, uh, in contemporary society as well. And he makes, you know, these reference to finding it. Um, um, a marital partner, the one to day two, it, uh, and who the, uh, uh, considered to marry, uh, um, occasionally Vr, uh, uh, we tried to find somebody who is more similar than we are. Um, and people voc. Well, uh, you look like a, if you are heterosexual, I brothers and sisters, uh, or if you are a gay, then you look like brothers or like sisters, right?

Speaker 1:          35:32          You look seen, you, you look, look similar and that can be right. A consideration for elastic partnership. I'm trying to find somebody who likes the same stuff. What I like, who is like me, right? But it can be the opposite as well, right? You may be looking for that person. You know, you may follow the logic of organic solidarity, right? Uh, you may be looking for a person who will compliment you. All right? Uh, I'm bad in keeping the books. Uh, uh, and therefore, uh, what I'm trying to look for a rod, if somebody who view balanced the checkbook, right? Um, uh, so occasionally looking for a partner, we are looking for somebody who will compliment us. Now that describes a right modern society with a higher level of division of Labor, division of labor, he says, can bring us together, um, uh, March, like, uh, the body of the organism that we are performing different functions in society.

Speaker 1:          36:40          We compliment each other. They need each other on the basis of our differences rather than our similarities. Um, uh, and the, in fact, the contractual law expresses the spirit, the AF organic solidarity as such. Well, uh, Durkheim veal, uh, show us that there is a, in fact, uh, a lot of trouble in the transition from Oregon from mechanical to organic solidarity, and this is what he will call anime, uh, in the transition from mechanical to organic Saudi Daddy, the moving from a traditional society through our modern society, our value system breaks down. We find ourself in the situation of anime about, this is a topic I've, you'll be talking about, uh, uh, jurors there. Thank you very much.
