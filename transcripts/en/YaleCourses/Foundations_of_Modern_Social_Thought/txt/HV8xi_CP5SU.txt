Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So today is about the notion of anime and, and Anna Amuse seems to be a very simple notion. Um, um, animal meat means the state of normalness ness and therefore it's very easy to interpret. It looks like it is very easy, easy to interpret them and Ami, uh, ivy or show that's far from the case. Uh, uh, in fact, Durkheim has a pretty complex notion about, um, uh, abnormalities, uh, um, uh, in the transition to and market economy, uh, in the transition to modernity. But before I do, so let me come back to the issue of the division of Labor, uh, in, uh, in Durkheim, um, uh, um, uh, though, um, you know, he stages the book, we had the idea of collective conscience, um, and, uh, goes along blanks explaining why he's using a law as an indicator of collective conscience and be discussed at great lengths when it comes to describing the different of the crucial differences between mechanical and organic solidarity.

Speaker 1:          01:25          He doesn't make much out of it are, uh, what drives the analysis of the, this, this distinction, right? Bri, modern and modern societies. Uh, to put the closure criteria is actually the division of Labor, but drives the story is the division of Labor. Uh, so in this sense, in fact, I think Durkheim can be understood as being greatly inspired by Adam Smith. Right? Who also, so evolution of human societies as you recall, as a gradual evolution of the division of Labor. I do again just does not offer such a complex or sophisticated Betty or digitization of society's flight hunting, gathering and animal husbandry and agricultural and commercial. He just makes these bipolar distinction between mechanical and organic. But if you ask, well yes, there is a difference in the legal system, but what is fundamentally different is the division of labor. Mechanical Solidarity has little division of Labor based on similarity of the actors in the society.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Uh, organic solidarity has a great deal of division of Labor and, and uh, uh, uh, agreed deal of the Similac, the similarity of the action. And this is puzzling because the question is, if it is such a high level of division of labor and such a great diversity there on earth, solid additive will come from how we hang together. So that's, I think we should appreciate how important the division of Labor for Smith from Durkheim was. Uh, by the way, in some ways, even the early Mark's, uh, in, uh, uh, the, the German ideology also tried his stereo digitization of society with the division of Labor. So I think this is also the influence of Adam Smith's. So I seen that as a clear Adam Smith impact, uh, on, on, on the vertical of Durkheim, uh, on, on, on the types of, uh, uh, a solidarity. There is also another issue I would like to, uh, mention.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Um, uh, uh, I pointed out that how important, right Montesquieu avast for Durkheim and uh, um, it's, it's obvious. He ethnologists is that two Montesquieu, uh, start, uh, the book, uh, Vietnam, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, collective conscience and the notion of, uh, um, uh, and, and law as the best empirically a observable indicators of this collective conscience comes of course, directly do Montesquieu, but that is an odder, uh, less frequently notice the impact of Montez Cure, uh, on Durkheim. And that makes actually a very interesting orderer for us today. Uh, as I mentioned, I met really has an impact today with his later Varick as the cultural or an analyst. But in his early Virg, he responded to an other, uh, Eh and eh, uh, stimulating idea of Montesquieu. And that is the, uh, uh, interaction between social system and the environment and the ecological system.

Speaker 1:          05:13          Uh, I mean, uh, I vent at some lengths in the lecture on Montesquieu, uh, to show how important it was and how unique Montesquieu his contribution was. Ellen, how important it is for us today, though he made it in a very naive, a Durkheim actually has a much more sophisticated and complex understanding, uh, off the relationship between an environment. Um, and, uh, uh, uh, society, uh, and the type of source of solidarity and the Division of Labor in society, uh, or on, unfortunately, this is a sort of a neglected element in Durkheim too bad because, uh, in fact, uh, you know, the problem of environment and studying and environment should be a central issue in economics, political science, sociology and anthropology. And it is not quite as central as it should be. Uh, especially I think in political science and sociology and anthropology, the study of the environment is too narrowly focused on environmental social movements.

Speaker 1:          06:30          There are, there kind of has a different interesting thing, uh, which I think a should inspire a social researchers be the economists, political scientists, sociologists and Anthropologists. What is it? Their time in the division of Labor has a core of an idea, but one can call the ecosystem, right? Uh, he sees a interrelationship between the physical environment, the size of population, which lifts in this physical environment, the technology which is used, uh, uh, uh, in these environment and the division of labor and the type of social organization, what we have, what kind of social solidarity you have. Let me just put this on the blackboard. Uh, I think this is a rarely naughtiest. You will rarely here in Durkheim's lectures or rarely read about this when you read, uh, uh, uh, about Durkheim. Uh, so the idea here is that you have, uh, uh, the environment. You have the population, you have technology, and you have social organization, and it's constitute a system which interacts with each other.

Speaker 2:          07:57          It's,

Speaker 1:          08:02          and what ought to be studied is reality. This whole system. And you know, of course technology has a lot to do with the division of Labor,

Speaker 2:          08:13          right?

Speaker 1:          08:16          And that's what can be called the ecosystem. I, he doesn't call it this way, but environmental researchers would call it today as the ecosystem. Um, and I think this is an extremely productive way, uh, for social scientists to think about the problems of environment. Right? Uh, and let me give you an example. Uh, uh, why don't you think about southern California, right? Southern California, uh, before the Europeans appeared on the scene, it was a very, uh, uh, dry climate suffered from the lack of water resources. So the Los Angeles basin probably could accommodate a livelihood for something like 20,000 people, right? These 20,000 people, right? Lived in this very arid environment, loose used very elementary technologies, and very had a very limited division of labor. Uh, so the population size was greatly affected with the technology and the environment, and they had mechanical solidarity. That was the way how society was organized.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Now, today, uh, we figured out how to solve the, the hydraulic problems for the Los Angeles basin for the time being. Uh, don't hold you abreast because in no time we may have a major crisis. So in the same bed as it based in 20,000 people live now, 20 million people live, but the live with a very high level of technology, uh, we successfully pollute the air, which is, uh, uh, write a hard, hard to breeze in downtown Los Angeles during a hot summer day. Right. Um, uh, and we have of course, um, uh, organic solid Daddy Thi operating right large and the, you know, manage to screw the environment. Thank you quite nicely. You know, and we keep doing it in no time. The La base in VOB on inhabitable. Right. That's why I think it is interesting to think about, uh, these do Camian idea of ecosystem, how it interacts.

Speaker 1:          10:41          As I said, it would offer you a very rigorous scientific field framework, uh, to study the interaction right. Between Social Organization, the demographic pro problem, the technological issues, right. And, and uh, um, uh, and it's a relationship how we can leave, if he can be useful, if it the environment. Anyway, it's just a backdrop because, uh, uh, uh, to show again the sensuality of the division of Labor for time. Now today I will talk about, uh, um, annual me. Um, and anime is one of the abnormal, uh, concept Vance's, uh, for, uh, the division of Labor. Uh, and well, this is a one off the troubling aspects of Derek Hansen. Eric, uh, the whole idea of abnormality or social better ologies and he has been criticized about this. I agreed the, um, how do we know of what is abnormal and Ho, Ho, Ho how on earth can we tell what is the normal state of sociality?

Speaker 1:          11:57          Pathology does assume, right? There's social researchers has some way how to judge what is the house see condition for society. And this comes from Durkheim's, uh, early functionalism as I said, right? He was greatly influenced by biology. It was not a biologist my any means. But as I pointed out, the whole metaphor of organic solidarity uses the human body, right? And as the example, right? Uh, how in the human body, divers or guns depend on each other to reproduce each other and therefore better divert pathology is also borrowed from medical sciences. So [inaudible] we all have better logic or features as well, and there are abnormalities in society and somehow believes that social researchers will be able to establish what abnormality is and what better bet. Bet apologies are. This is, I think, troubling for most social scientist, right? We first, we seem to have some commitment to at least value neutral type of analysis, right?

Speaker 1:          13:15          We, in which we do not labor necesarrily phenomena out, right? You know, labeling theory, you may have heard about it, uh, you label something as criminal or abnormal, uh, simply because it's probably unusual in society. Um, what bots, what was abnormal in one society may become absolutely normal in another society. So we have to be extremely careful, right? We, the notion of normal and abnormal, uh, let's say, uh, being gay until fairly recently a vos scene, I mean, except a antiquity, but for most human societies and most of the cultures being gay is seen as a kind of abnormal behavior. Today, very few people will think about this, at least in a country like the United States, that somebody gay is an abnormal, right? Uh, uh, so what sexual behavior is normal or more, more depends on the times, right? It's really not the job of the social scientists to be able to decide, you know, what kind of sexual behaviors should be called normal or abnormal.

Speaker 1:          14:36          The best we can do. Why owners, some people call some sexual practices, abnormal law and order's normal. Why is there differences in our society accepting some kind of sexual behaviors and not the others? Right. That is a question. Was social scientists good study anyway, this is a, I think literally, um, um, uh, a problem, uh, in, in, uh, uh, for contemporary social scientists, uh, uh, uh, Durkheim's Rurik. But anyway, he did believe that he is capable to show, uh, that some abnormal development do take place. He was a specialty, as I pointed all that the last lecture out on the transition from, uh, um, uh, mechanical to organic solidarity and the, then that happened then, uh, pet pathologies good and merge. And again, put it into the social context. Durkheim is writing in the 1890s and early 19 hundreds is in Bordeaux and then he's moving to Paris.

Speaker 1:          15:50          The city of the sin, right. And he sees all the science of social pathologies, right? Uh, our core holism and homelessness and prostitution and theft than crime, uh, which was in existent or much rarer in rural France, uh, adjust a couple of decades ago. So he's confronted right with massive phenomena which is being seen as abnormal or petrologic car and he identifies them as the results of the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity. Well, pathologies can have two different routes. Um, and uh, what we normally understand from a Durkheim that he identifies pathologies from the absence of rules. That's what the term enemy refers to. But interestingly enough, I have the citations for you and if you have read the text scale, you've found the citations as well. He actually also does consider that pathologies can also reserve the result from the overregulation right of two forced division of labor.

Speaker 1:          17:10          I think it's very intriguing to see this because we normally control Paul's Marx theory of alienation and Durkheim's theory of anime as Durkheim is complaining that is not enough regulation in society by Marxists arguing that it's too much than [inaudible] in society. And Ivy, I'll give you a number of citations now, uh, from, uh, uh, Durkheim each actually, we are sure that the difference between Rice and labor is not such gigantic as we initially made. I have salt on generally of would assume that, uh, uh, there of is quite sensitive to some of the Marxian analysis, even to the marks Jia notion of alienation. He doesn't use the term, but it gets very close to it. So let me just move on. Third and, um, uh, dark about better largest bet. Bet ologies may charge coming from the absence of, of rules. Now, uh, and I've used briefly say, uh, these interesting, uh, uh, idea that in fact division of labor can be the source of solidarity.

Speaker 1:          18:26          As I said, this is counterintuitive. Uh, we did believe that solid the solidarity crumbs from relatively small size communities where people are relatively similar, share the same values and the same system, same norms, and then they will have a solid artistic feelings store, watch each other and people are very different and they are competing on the market place. There are the, uh, you know, our strangers in this sort of cities, they don't know each other. Uh, uh, the, the separate subscribe to different values, uh, uh, or they even don't know what values they should obey because the are fused, they just left the village and ended at the big end sinful city and they don't really quite know can I do here anything? Is that any control over me or not? I, you know, it's all up to me what to do. Even stealing is all right, sunny my buddies or, right.

Speaker 1:          19:24          Ah, I see other people who do that. Why don't I do it? The are not being quote, I probably will not to, could be caught either. So that is a kind of right under these circumstances when that are no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, similarities. Why owners, uh, will be solid that estate. We don't know how other people, and they have these stereotypes that, you know, in urban industrial society, we are not solely that estate. Right. Uh, uh, this is the, yeah, the usual stereotypes. You say you go to New York City, right? And that is somebody who is dying on the streets and other people are just stepping over that person, right? Who Cares? You can die on the street and that will be hundreds of passengers going by and left to die. It's actually not true. Right? Um, if you ever have seen anybody, uh, you know, feeling, feeling ill, uh, uh, in Times Square, I mean that are usually a lot of people rush to it and say, are you all right?

Speaker 1:          20:26          Or that's kind of stuff. Um, but anyway, but you know, the stereotype, right? Um, uh, so usual stereotypes about cities anyway, so it's puzzling why a society which is so different and nonmembers and such a high division of labor can be solid that asleep. Then he defines various pathologies. And interesting, the battle laundry one sounds very similar, very close to Mark's Mel. That is crisis in the system and that is increasing class conflict and this cross country to psychological. Um, and the second one, uh, well against something which is not all that different from walled. Karl Marx, uh, division of labor can be too excessive and too much division of labor. Uh, can lead to better logical consequences. And finally, his unique contribution that pathology can come from the lack of regulation. And that's what he calls an me. Oh, let me, um, uh, uh, work on this and also the concept of an anime a little more.

Speaker 1:          21:39          So here it is a the division of labor as a source of solidarity, right? He said, well, normally the division of labor produces social solidarity. Uh, well, but it can happen, uh, that that are the opposite results. All right? So therefore he said, when we know when division of Labor Creates Social Sa, so solidarity, then it will be better equipped to figure it out. Then actually, social solidarity has better logical consequences. And as you can see from the citation, he directly site, uh, the medical, um, uh, uh, metaphor right here as elsewhere. But ology is a pressures and Ciliary to physiology. So you start with the physiology of society, uh, you identify when it works normally and then you will be able to show than it is better logic though, right? That's the fundamental idea. And this seemed that way. How he tries to get off the hook of the problem that he actually capable to tell.

Speaker 1:          22:57          What is special logic pro. All right now the first battle out, but pathology, it's actually about class conflict. He said, well, uh, and I think mark would have, would not have been particularly unhappy with this citation, right? As labor becomes increasingly divided, there are commercial crises that are bankruptcy's that is hostility between Labor and capital. And then, you know, all these conflicts become more frequent right now in traditional societies in mechanical solidarities, well this class conflict were rare and unusual. Now, uh, today, uh, they are not all that on the usual and he uses the term Verking class. Right? You said part of the Virgin class two or three really desire the state to society, right? Well, not quite a theory of exploitation, but certainly, uh, an expression that do high level of division of labor in absence of other can't create in dance class conflict, which is a pathological consequence of high division of labor.

Speaker 1:          24:21          Then he goes on and he writes about excessive division of labor. Uh, well he has not tread the patties manuscripts, which was not published of course, um, for uh, 14 more years after he died. But yeah, you will have read the pedis manuscripts and you can see this interesting pedals. The individual will isolate himself in his own activity. He will no longer be over there of the collaborator who Varick at his side on the scene task he has even not longer. And the idea at all what the common tasks consists is not that's miraculous. He could not have the faintest idea that a work called the patties manuscripts exists. Right. And hear what is being described is getting very, very close to the idea of alienation. Right. And in fact comes very close to the Marxian notion of Eliana, you're not the Hague Eliana run the Marxian notion because he roots it into excessive division of labor.

Speaker 1:          25:41          Too much market, right? Uh, too much competition creates this situation. Well, I think this is me innocuous. And very often, you know, these sentences are kind of skipped over as a kind of through over a line. Uh, by the time it isn't, it is very important to identify what his unique contribution is. And this is indeed the emphasis that a pathology can occur out of the lack of regulation and lack of regulation means, and on me now, uh, he said, well, if he's not necessarily for social life to be visceral struggle, struggle in itself is not that bad at all. The role of organic story reality is not to abolish a competition, but to moderate it. All right. Well, I just want to remind you, um, this Niv, uh, reminds us to Adam Smith. He's sympathetic theory of human nature, right? Uh, well, uh, on limited competition is not right, right.

Speaker 1:          27:02          Unlimited egoistic behavior is not right. They have to be sympathetic to the other person, right? The are struggling for recognition by others, right. That is the idea where that is a similarity in Durkheim's and Adam Smith's analysis. But, but then he couldn't, but he, then he continues. But in some cases, and this is crucial, there's regulatory process, which rates competition I there does not exist at all or not related to the degree of development of the division of Labor. It is insufficient. The that are, I don't know, regulations or not enough regulations. If then division of labor does not produce solidarity. It is because the relationship between organs are not regulated. And this is what I call an army, right? And again, you see the social context a, this is exactly coming from uh, the empirical reference point. Rural young people get on the train and that, uh, get off the train in God's Love Jar San Lozar and then they walk into the street in Wyatt, Paris, the sinful city of Paris, and they are lost.

Speaker 1:          28:32          Suddenly their value system, what they were told back home in the village collapses right back in the village. They knew exactly what they are supposed to do. Everybody knew them and they also knew if they are breaking the laws right of the community to have your be immediately punished because there'll be a big gossip spreading it around and get back to home. And Mom and dad will exactly here, but you have done on the street what you've were not strict post to do. Now you are in Paris, more buddy has the finger study or who, what, who you are. And even when you don't know about other people expect from you, right? It looks like this is the realm of freedom. You can do anything, right? Well, back home in the village, uh, if you've really engaged, you would bash her, go, not hold hands with another partner on the street, right?

Speaker 1:          29:31          Because then the gossip, you're back to your fiancee and her parents or his parents and your parents immediately. And Darryl, there'll be a scandal. Now if you are walking, Gone Bull Mish, uh, you can do anything. You can't hold the handle of anybody. You can kiss anybody, right? Nobody knows who you are. Right? So that's it. You know, at that is the problem, right, of anime that people enter in a [inaudible] society in which they are lost. Um, uh, well, uh, let me just labored a little longer on the idea and here again see that even the notion of anime, uh, I mean it's probably, I don't know whether how much it is making, he's making his argument too complex or Mark's idea of, uh, uh, uh, uh, area nation was too complex. But you can see here against some similarities even between anime and the Marxian notion of alienation. He said the division of Labor may reduce the worker to the role of a machine.

Speaker 1:          30:48          He's not over here of where the operation required of him are leading. And he does not link them to any AME woo every day. He repeats the same movements, monotonous regularity, but without having any understand the interest in understanding that, oh, how interesting. And that's where, uh, in, uh, uh, during games thinking the lack of norms or values, the collapse of the value system leading to, uh, and for him, of course, that's a big difference. The solution is to fix the system of value, to fix the system of norms and then you solve the problem of alienation. But he also said that look and Ami is not an inevitable consequence of the division of labor, right? Um, uh, very, he has a conception that, you know, live division of labor can be forced and can be excessive, right? There must be in elements in the collective conscience, which moderate, right?

Speaker 1:          32:08          The competitive elements of the division of Labor. But if those institutions, you know, cultural, legal, moral, ethical institutions are in place, then in fact, uh, the division of Labor will not produce anime. It only will produce such if there is no such, um, uh, systems. But then he said, don't do not read to me as a romantic. I don't want to idealize the village community that these boys and girls and God, Lazard are coming out of the train. Right? I don't want to send the back to the rural village. I'm not advocating Yeti turn from organic solidarity to mechanical, sorry. That if the all the time showing under what circumstances that are pathological contact fancies, right? Uh, in organic solidarity and therefore we have to find the proper medication, the proper cocktail of drugs by which we can cure these disease. Right. That is the key idea.

Speaker 1:          33:24          Well, and now another very interesting, uh, argument, uh, which is usually neglected and reading at the time. He said, look, that are pathologies in society which are coming from overregulation and forced division of Labor. Uh, well this is, uh, already in, uh, the uh, uh, division of labor, but a crucial text is in fact the so-called second introduction into the division of Labor. Uh, doodle can receive a lot of criticism of the first edition of the division of Labor was criticized of being too conservative politically and that's when he wrote her, um, the second, uh, uh, introduction to the division of Labor. And if you are interested at all in Durkheim, you have to read the second introduction, the introduction to the second edition of the division of Labor because here he tries to offer, uh, some quote unquote progressive solution to the problems of uh, uh, uh, uh, an Omi and the nature of a solidarity in organic, uh, societies, uh, um, uh, um, uh, how to overcome the problem of class conflicts in modern society.

Speaker 1:          35:11          And that his idea is that reality is solid, that it is, this is the idea. He develops in the, uh, uh, uh, introduction to the second edition that we are becoming a solidaristic vision. Our professions decided to professional organizations in which reveal, find our identities and solidarities. So he sees the good society as a woven into multiplicity of professional organizations in which people fit into this professional environment and do have a strong professional identity and solidaristic attitudes towards the profession. Uh, uh, this is right. A radically different idea right from the mark. It's not dealing with markets, not messing up with the markets or not, not messing up too much with the Americas to put it this way. And I, uh, you know, professional organizations, if they are effective, they do mess up with the markets, right? American Medical Association does mess up because it's the kind of trade union, right?

Speaker 1:          36:23          Which, um, uh, make sure that, uh, um, uh, uh, the doctor's interests that are being, uh, particualry raptor incentive. Um, anyway, uh, this is, uh, uh, the second introduction. But what is interesting in, in, in this citation is that he said, well, uh, the autology can emerge actually from excessive level of, uh, of, uh, uh, uh, regulation or force, division of, of, of labor. And he introduces an another notion here, and this is fatal asthma. So there are these two different pathologies, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, modern societies, uh, or one is emerging in the transition from Bethanny got to organic solidarity given the absence of a commonly shared values. Uh, and that's an Omi. And that is another basketball on the other end of the scale. You have to excessive regulation. And then people become fatalistic because then they think there is nothing they can do, right.

Speaker 1:          37:40          And Ami is when you can't eat anything goes, you know, I can get her wavy tenor thing, right? Or are you are desperate, you know, because you don't know a Vato nurse, uh, um, uh, uh, you, uh, uh, Avanto duvet yourself. A fatalism is a, when you think fell, um, I have no control over my life. I am overregulated right? And then you'll become fatalistic. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters because, uh, uh, it's overregulated. Okay. Uh, now let me just very briefly, I compare, uh, uh, these, uh, uh, uh, three ideas, uh, uh, for, uh, uh, uh, Mark's a Viber and Durkheim.

Speaker 1:          38:36          Uh, I hope I did not confuse you too much with some of the citations which are quite contrary, intuitive, but it's important to see the sophistication of the analysis. Uh, the bottom line of all this, he said, look, my unique contribution to the study of pathologies of modern society is the theory of anime have each says that temporarily in this transition, uh, we have, uh, a problem of absence of rules. This will be overcome because there is no reason by a properly moderated competition and division of Labor could not create actually very high levels of solidarity. And the mechanism he suggest in the second introduction is, you know, creation of a professional organization and slotting people into professional communities. As such, they are not going back to the villages, but they will be sort of belonging to professional communities and having solidaristic ideas and identities there.

Speaker 1:          39:50          So this is the kind of a bottom line. He is sensitive to the problems of is talking about, he understands that yes, modern society does create class conflicts and this is a problem because they're working class very often feels ill cheated, uh, doesn't use the term exploit it, but you know, it's um, uh, unhappy with the position assigned to it. So she sees this is a problem. He also sees the problem that an excessive, um, uh, um, uh, division of labor may create a sense of, it doesn't use the term, but really what he means alienation, right? Um, and he also, his flight over here that too much regulation also can create a pathological state of mind fatalism. Uh, so, uh, but the major contribution is, as I've said, and on me as a insufficient regulation in society, this is his unique contribution. Now, alienation as we have seen, um, is more like theory collision, right?

Speaker 1:          40:58          In Durkheim it comes, uh, from, uh, too much that you wish. And then we have a Weber's notion of this enchantment, right? The loss of the enchanted garden. This is all, all coming, you know, the kind of mood or feel the human condition under modernity, right? These are three different dates for vulnerabilities. The loss of magic. All right. Um, and, uh, the way the conversion of the dance all sided, you know, human relations, the ships into instrumental relationships. Um, I think I briefly mentioned, uh, and, uh, the lecture on a LDR nation or, and probably also lecture on, uh, uh, uh, uh, v Bieber. Um, uh, that this is actually very similar to the ideas of a George Lowe Kotch who was a Marxist if he lost a fair and who developed the theory of Rafe. He, Keisha, uh, the Labor is developing the theory of descent chance, man, what is the problem of moved?

Speaker 1:          42:16          Only thing that's the lost the enchanter the garden. That's The r two rationale is stick to colds to instrumental at a time when look archer is shifting from, Hey, y'all two marks and invents the idea of life vacation. And they happened to bull live at that time. Um, in Heidelberg and, uh, George look arch, when was a young man at that time in his twenties. It was a freak from the gas and the house in the Viva House in the saloon around by Mariana Weber's. So that is clearly a mutual influence on low arch, unique interpretation of Marx, theory of alienation. Uh, that's human relationships are becoming re fied and, uh, uh, [inaudible], uh, for, uh, you know, instrumentalization of life, which is, uh, uh, I think distinctly different and worse from the theory of an army and alienation. Okay. Uh, um, uh, a final law and the, uh, [inaudible], uh, our human nature.

Speaker 1:          43:33          What was his theory of human nature? And here, um, uh, uh, uh, the, uh, can see a sharp distinction between, uh, Mark's and, and Viber. Mark's meanly following a Russo's line. Basic God. He believed that, you know, he did not have the notion of a state of nature to any longer. By the mid 19th century, people got tired and yet trad off it. Um, uh, but, uh, uh, he used the term a species being of what is the essence human essence. Uh, uh, well he said, uh, the essentially humans are fine. Uh, uh, uh, it is the society which is the problem, not the individual. Um, it, uh, so this is exactly, you know, Daryl soy yen, uh, uh, inspiration in Marx society core apps and the state of nature of the very good at mice, even ads. I think I ordered, they made this point, but let me underline one more time.

Speaker 1:          44:50          He goes beyond, um, our last show because Rousseau, so the um, uh, lobos savage as a savage, as, as a, as an individual who has to be brought into society at that point. March disagrees with Rousseau. He sees we were born in society, they are social by nature, right? So are we are not only good, but there are also social and it is so sad. Eve, each quarter up sauce which creates US egoistic individuals will compete with each other and kill each other, right? This is exactly the opposite, right, of hops and a big step beyond Russo's theory of human nature. Now, Durkheim is actually much closer to hops in his notion of uh, uh, uh, uh, human nature, uh, because he believes tonight that's social pathologies and merge. And that is a vacuum of control over people. That's when you have crime and Swiss shy, the prosecution and whatever. Uh, uh, and therefore, uh, uh, he had a skeptical view of human nature. Unless we are controlled, then we can be easier, right? That is the fundamental issue, right. What you have to fix, uh, uh, is, uh, uh, uh, making sure that the individuals,
