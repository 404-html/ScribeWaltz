Speaker 1:          00:01          And see dental in my discussion sessions, people got too excited about charisma. So we did speak a lot about galleys. Ba I asked your patients recover some of the same grounds, but I hope I can give you a new jokes about charisma. Uh, this is one of the most exciting features of the labor theory and probably run off next to the Protestant ethic, right, the wrong and entered the common language more than anything else, right? That we all talk about get asthma and the people's getting smart charismatic leaders all the time, just like the Protestant vert that date be entered to the popular vocabulary and everybody who has not tried any vapor still uses the term. Uh, uh, it's also very important to come to terms with the idea of charisma because, uh, uh, a neighbor was a suspected, uh, uh, in the 1930s, forties and 50s, to be actually a protocol fascist and with the idea of charisma advocating a, for a strong leadership for Germany, calling for a charismatic leader for Germany and in Ebay, almost demanding out of Hitler.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Now, of course, he died in 1920. He could not do that. Uh, about, uh, especially, um, at a philosopher George wrote clutch. I accused him to be an irrational, just, uh, and, uh, uh, being a portal fascist, laying the ideology for a narcissism and add of Hitler. Uh, I have to tell you that I am not absolutely certain what the Labor would have done in 1930 or 33. I hope for a, like his brother who would not have gone for the fascists or Nazis. Um, but it's complicated. Ivo tried to make a case that in fact, the concept of charisma is not quite what I'd have. Hitler was. Um, so, um, uh, the main major themes of the presentation today. First of all, we will dov the definition of charisma. Um, what is Gary's magical authority? Uh, then we've, you're talking about the sources of charisma very carries mice coming from, and this is particularly important, uh, to see why vapor is actually not a plot on assay.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Um, uh, then the viewer will be talking about, uh, uh, uh, the followers, the charismatic leader. Um, then we will talk about, get his Ma as a revolutionary force, get his Ma as, uh, the, uh, vehicle of change. Um, and I think this is an interesting idea in Bieber or one of the Vika points, I think, or fever dearly. Um, I think, uh, Karl Marx, uh, has a much more coherent and much more best ways if tivity about historical change as class Tragal, you know, and the contradictions between forces and relations of production. Um, this is, uh, uh, uh, historically invalidated, but a very coherent and very best soil as it kind of argument. Vaporous idea of charisma is that evolution on force actually has an bitty car, um, irrelevance, but, uh, it's, uh, it had an aunt pass swears even love your Clark about this.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Um, and then become to a big club with the cat is a smart, how charismatic leadership can be routinized or transmitted from a charismatic leader to the next. Uh, and what I do maquettes of succession for that charismatic leader. Uh, so I mean, those of you who've heard in my discussion section, as you can see, it feel not to be just a regurgitation of the, uh, uh, um, um, discussion sessions. And I don't know what happened in other discussions sections. Also, the charisma may have come up. This makes people move. Uh, um, uh, uh, mine's mine. Smooth equity deal. So I just a step back a minute and again, revisit the idea of different types of domination and what [inaudible] and a, this is the simplest scheme. I can come up fit, but I think this is a good one. Uh, I copyright it. I did it.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Uh, so the question is about, is OBD as youtube. It can be you two rules in person or rules or it can be useful to a person or master to an individual. That's the big story, right? And if it is youth too loose, that's when we are talking about legal national authority. And this will be the topic, uh, and bureaucratic rule, a modern liberal democratic system where a mother, not that democratic system, but systems which don't steal, do, have, um, uh, rules. Um, uh, of, uh, uh, uh, our floor, uh, that aren't actually a authoritarian systems and, you know, operate, uh, uh, that, uh, uh, uh, uh, rules of law that authoritarian leaders actually themselves for all the law and take law seriously and implement laws, uh, seriously, uh, that lead got national authority, does not mean liberal democracy. It simply means that this is a system in the village.

Speaker 1:          06:14          There is a, um, uh, at all or flaw, even if the leader itself can be not particularly democratic, then we'll classier democracy as we understand the try. There's a very recent phenomenon, a universal suffrage in the western world became why spread since the 1920s. And it really became the dominant form right, of them, uh, of, uh, uh, political rule a much, much later. And I would say more like after the Second World War, um, I'm in Switzerland for instance, you have rights, uh, for women. Two wars just very recently. So, well, you know, democracy is a liberal, democracy is a very new intervention lit and the Legal National Authority is not such a new invention. Uh, there was a rule of law, um, in England moving back to, uh, the odd ocean evolution, right? This is going back to the late, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, 17th century, um, that it was doable off law, uh, in the United States.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Uh, uh, before the late 1800 [inaudible] 19th century, though, there was no liberal democracy as we understand that, right? There was no universal suffrage at all. I saw, I mean, you could have a, uh, a rule of law. We saw democracy, but that's still very different from a system very well be and master. And that are two ways. How you are the master, Eh, you will obey because the tradition and pointed that master and that's what they were talking about, uh, Tuesday or because the master is believed to have some charismatic features. Uh, I also mentioned it last time that the difference is between the three types of authority, legal, rational authority, traditional authority. It d and charismatic authority do not have the same, I use the term ontological status. All right? Um, the two big forms in history, our traditional authority, which through rationalization eventually become Sligo national authority and charismatic will quality usually is a transitory pays stage.

Speaker 1:          08:51          Uh, charismatic leader quality is the charismatic leaders. Emerge is a, in times of great times of great need, desperation and need for change. And charismatic leaders if they deliver, you know, as long as they deliver, they remain leaders. If they stopped delivering, cat is my cat is my steak and away from them. And it's extremely difficult for charismatic leader to establish an ongoing system of charismatic authority, right? Because, uh, um, uh, it would be very difficult to transfer that own personal or charisma to somebody else, right. And to keep running a charismatic system. Okay. So that's about generally, you know, what it is, get it as smart as I said, this really, we keep using the term all the time. The last 18 months, we use it a lot, uh, because of a candidate and later President Obama, and, uh, there is probably nobody in this room who at one point the Nafe say, uh, something about Obama scaries Ma or you know, if you did not like him, the lack of his charisma, right?

Speaker 1:          10:11          Uh, but uh, you know, this was a gum on, they use sturm. Now this is coming from vapor because he did this germ out from at a rather obscure. They are logical language. I charism. I actually refer to some super human qualities of individual laws. I would say almost semi guards who have some very personnel, an exclusive relationship to God. And therefore, like any other human beings, they kind of can't talk to God and then they can interpret God's revealed to the people, these very charismatic leaders. So in the most classical definition of charisma, Murray first ride that to the great founders of great world religions, that's what charisma in initial meaning men. Uh, so Muhammad Morzas, uh, or Jesus, uh, the headgear is smart because they had a special access to God, right? Um, Moses, God, the two tables from God, he could not see the face of God, but nevertheless, the God that through Deimos won't God, nobody else could walk up, ride that on the mountain and get these tables, you know, and are people, this is the law, right?

Speaker 1:          11:38          Because only Moses who good, right? And Jesus had a very specific relationship to God, right? Christian believe was even the son of God, embodiment of God. And undoubtedly, you know, it is believed by Christians that Jesus could actually, um, uh, convey to us what God wants us to do. Right at this very special, unique, charismatic, the Epi and Mohamed, uh, had the special appeal, uh, to, to God, or if you are more and more than Mr. Smiths had these very unique right relationship to God, right? At one point, an angel came, you know that a new sacred book, a continuation of the Bible, left it with Mr. Smith. He translated it. And when the transition was, God, you know, the angel came and took it away that this was a charisma. Write a very specific superhuman. It did not happen to any other human being. Only two Smith, right?

Speaker 1:          12:44          That's uh, um, uh, that is the initial notion of the meaning. But now they were very city, a little, kind of a broader conception. And he said all that charisma will be applied to a certain quality of an individual. Personalities, important, still an individual with considered extra or the metric, um, uh, and treated as endowed with super natural, super human. The sounds like the original definition, but then he was on and he said, or at least exceptional powers and qualities, right? And these are the guarded as of divine origin. That's the founders of the Greek religion or exemplary. He modifies, tried. It can be just exemplary. You don't have to believe that this is Sammy God or the embodiment of God. You only have to believe that this is an excellent blurry being, uh, uh, who has some exceptional he abilities, exceptional qualities, um, and that will qualify that uveal call somebody.

Speaker 1:          14:04          Uh, attached is matic Burson or the charismatic leader. Uh, uh, let me also underline one more term from these, uh, um, uh, quotation, which is extremely important. Um, but, uh, he said the person is considered to be extra ordinary and three teeth as endowed with super human or an example of the features. So in, I think what is extremely important to see that we bear does not tell us that this individual is actually extra ordinary that is actually super human in a way. It is in the eye of the beholder. It is among the followers who at [inaudible] tried to these qualities to somebody. So in ave a charismatic leaders are being made by the followers, uh, well what is, uh, what is the source of charisma? This is now making it even more clear and more precise. It dressed in recognition. You have to recognize it.

Speaker 1:          15:24          Charisma. So the relationship of charisma is in the interpersonal relationship between the leaders and the followers. And in this interaction is charisma being created, right? It is not given by the grace of Lord, right? To an individual person. It is created by, uh, uh, doors who are subjected to authority, right? And it's also important that the cat is, uh, those who follow the charismatic leaders are usually scenes as followers or disciples. Right. They have some extra ordinary commitment to this ledger, right? Um, uh, these leader creates excitement in them and these excitement, but creates a, uh, the community of the followers or the community of the disciples, right? Um, uh, well, uh, this is was one of the reasons why, um, uh, many people in the last 18 months, uh, regarding the, uh, uh, Barack Obama as a charismatic leader because he was keepable to appearing in a crowd and moved a crowd, right?

Speaker 1:          16:47          Create excitement in the crowd, right? He created followers, right? You know, almost one would say disciples, uh, um, uh, such a, now what the charisma can be, we drove, this is again, a very important idea and vapor. He said, if the proof of success allude the leader for too long, it is likely that the charismatic authority will disappear, right? So the charismatic leader gives you right promises that it will produce miracles. And when the charismatic leader does not producing these miracles, right, he must work mirror. Cause I said, um, uh, vapor. Then the people we drew, the recognition of charisma from the leader and the masters simply becomes a private person at an ordinary person loses its, uh, in the vigil at Pr. Well, uh, what is, uh, uh, very important, right? Uh, so that, uh, uh, the cat is matic leader has to promise you miracles, right?

Speaker 1:          18:14          Has to promise you that it will deliver something but you desperately need, right? Get is my, is deeply rooted in the conditions in the situation in which charismatic leader is being constructed by the followers. When you are in a desperate need, then you are looking for a charismatic leader, which can solve this problem, but you think is almost unresolvable then the charismatic leader of your calm and your promise, you that this problem, uh, that the charismatic leader will be able to solve because it's extra ordinary characteristics. Um, and again, if I can come back to the last elections that was, you know, clearly, uh, the case, uh, um, uh, uh, the v how a candidate Obama was, keep her two of them, the elections. You remember one of the key words, right? Uh, cataract, Chad eyes. The campaign, um, uh, haul change. Yes, we can.

Speaker 1:          19:31          I mean, these are very typical elements that I had to have a charismatic appeal, right? You are in need. You want hope. You want to have businesses, not usual. You want to live a new type of business. Now, this is what I promise you, right? A change and hope and I empower you. I'm the person who can empower you, right? It can be done right. We can do it right? Yes. It can be done. Who Change? Yes. Can Be done. These are very typical elements, right? What a charismatic leader, dusk produce. Um, in recent history, other charismatic leaders, which are probably not as attractive, uh, in historical perspective as Obama did, became charismatic leader. The same way Fidel Castro established Kelly's is my Ford himself. The Cuban society was in desperate need for change in 1960 and Fidel Castro appealed. And he said, well, I'd be or blink, pinch a change to you.

Speaker 1:          20:44          Ivy would get rid of this corporate government, Ivo, create equality, right ivy, and help the poor. The poor really get developed here. I will create effluence, right? I'd be or created Justin Affluence Society, right? And therefore he came up with promises, what people are looking for. And then charisma was attribute it to Fidel Castro. Uh, I'd off Hitler emerge as a charismatic leader, right? A Germany's suffered a humiliating defeat in the first world war. Then it was hit with a great depression, which he Germany even verse then he, the United States and then out of Hitler appeal. Um, and or he was not quiet as an attractive personality as Obama was, you know, quite a ridiculous guy. But he actually said, well, I can solve the problems for you. Right? A defined an anime. It's, or Jewish conspiracy, CB, get rid of the Jews and I veal churning sat around and you know, we, we have, uh, we, we all have a new empire and that it was he capable of it.

Speaker 1:          21:58          This problem. There was a need in the situation that people were looking for leadership and they were looking for a strong leader. The charismatic leader and the attribute Id. This charismatic leadership feed people to them. The problem comes when they cannot deliver a, certainly Hitler, when the Russian troops were already fighting, get out of Berlin, was no charismatically done any long. Right? You must hiding in the bunker considering suicide and he's got his Mo was gone all together cause he did not deliver. You did not do the miracles. Right. And therefore his charisma was we drove, um, now about the followers, right? Uh, he said the followers of a charismatic leader, um, are often often bound together by emotional ties and they are create an emotional community with each other. Uh, vapor uses these German for term fatty gemeinschaft too. They become kind of a community.

Speaker 1:          23:14          There is a real religious leader with a charismatic appeal. It creates overs. Communities of people. I don't know if any one of you ever had experiences of some fundamentalist religious experience. I did when I was a teenager. There was, you know, a preacher. Uh, interestingly, he also did not look charismatic. He was even not a great speaker. I don't know how a nurse, he had these curious charismatic Epi or, but he did and he did have an impact on me. I attribute it to charisma to him and he's kind of created a community around himself, right? The all were brothers and sisters together who's kind of believe in the charismatic guest preacher. This is very often in kind of sexy area and fundamentalist religious groups be Christian or being Muslim, being evangelical. There must be people in this room, right? Who in the, at least when they were a teenager, the experience that right.

Speaker 1:          24:24          And you are a teenager and you want to get out of your family and you are looking for a new community. I mean this kind of religious communities very often offer an alternative one. Some of you may still be in such a a community and if you are, I envy you. I think it is, uh, you know, as I recall it was a wonderful experience in some ways, fairly demand shafto you had your family, right? You have your spiritual family that you belong to. Does it make any sense of that saying, I think there must be people I had to experience that are still experiencing it. Right? Um, so that's what he calls fell gemeinschaft doing gemeinschaft means community. Then the mass society relationships becomes our relationships like a community. And indeed, in even in charismatic political campaign, you have the sense that we belonged together. The coma con calls right there was fairly gemeinschaft and in civil right movement right now there's this charismatic leader, Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, right? And, uh, the whole idea of civil right, and that'd be cool together, right? And we go to the south and we demonstrate, right? And we demand city will rise from this bloody raises, right? That created a sense of community among people, right? Who had this belief, uh, on change.

Speaker 1:          26:05          Uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          26:11          if you want to actually in such a community, you have a kind of personal devotion to the leader, uh, and that is a certain degree of an twosie asthma of what emerges in you, right? Um, uh, are bitches of occasionally coming out of their spare, uh, that you are desperate and then you hope to have some salvation, uh, some solution to an end result football problem by the charismatic leader. That's how in communism and charismatic leaders like learning or Mao or Castro emerged, right, is over all societies in deep trouble after humiliations after wars in Vegan aid for soc made some major structural change and then they were looking for a savior, right? Review, solve these unresolvable problems and we lead out to better dies. Now, it's also interesting that you know, in a charismatic communities that is usually relatively little hierarchy, not all that much of a bureaucracy.

Speaker 1:          27:30          Um, uh, um, uh, doors who are actually serving the charismatic leader usually do not, uh, yet, uh, uh, salaries or benefits. It's again, chew, you know, even for a charismatic political leaders that they get a whole army of volunteers because they are so strongly believe right in the course that they volunteer that time and money. Now here comes a, an entrusting and, uh, uh, uh, uh, disturbing proposition that he said about, but because [inaudible] is such an extra ordinary form, it's as it as a system of charismatic or Traditi, it is all paused to a rational and bureaucratic or quality, right? Uh, therefore it is kind of irrational in the sense of being foreign to all establish rules because what is a charismatically that about to change? And the change means that there will be new rules of the game and you don't know exactly what these rules of the Games are.

Speaker 1:          28:47          And this what makes if the charismatic or quality is a horse system is up or the eating a high level of uncertainty to the system. And now forget about American politics because in the United States, um, we clearly have a legal rational system, right? That's what characterizes the United States of America and occasionally the sea and merging, um, uh, politicians who actually do implement some level of change or promise change whether they can deliver or not will greatly affect how long v attached [inaudible] this before. But from Roosevelt to JFK to mark and military king, uh, to, uh, uh, uh, or Obama, there were politicians which this charismatic happy about the system itself was not charismatic, right? Um, cat is my health leaders to get elected. And charisma actually may help a leader to be able to make some strong. And the important changes early on in life. Those who are critical of president or Mark Obama usual are critical of him that he has not moving fast and forcefully enough, was not cashing in, in his charisma early right in his presidency.

Speaker 1:          30:20          Um, and that is, you know, some science that in fact, you know, his charisma charismatic at beer, uh, is weakening, right? There are some people who say, well, I feel betrayed. You know, I was promised change and I see a lot of politics as usual, right? Uh, so this is of course an inevitable problem if a leader who has these charismatic at bill finds itself in the legal rational authority, right? That actually it's very difficult to implement the change. You want to change the rules, the law, alls you have to walk through Congress to do that, right? You just cannot declare that from now on of ours. That is a new game, uh, rules of the game and that is sounds very much like politics as usual. That's a very different, uh, from about Lenin or mouse tone there. Right? Lenny in and Moussa took, were not guided by the rules.

Speaker 1:          31:27          They established the rules. I mean, mouse or Duke is a particularly interesting character, right? He established first I bureaucratic rule in China and then he launches the culture revolution, right? He launches an anti bureaucratic movement and the top leader of the bureaucracy is becoming the major popular leader of an anti bureaucratic movement. I mean, this guy was really quite something quite extraordinary. And then I may, he did that, you know, because his charisma was weakened by the 1960s first. He promised greatly four of our, you know, in no time they will catch up and we'd be look like the United States. And what happened with the Greek lead for Var disaster, people were starving to death. So he was not delivering the miracle. So what does he does next? He shows us here is a real change, the rules of the game. He launches the culture revolution and he's, he suddenly becomes the leader of people who actually should be, or pausing Kim, uh, you know, he is generating this kind of miracles, you know, the last miracle, but he's driving to January at all age that he goes rimming in the young chair river. You see, you think I'm old and I'm dying. No, I'm super human. I still can serve him. Alright. This is the kind of, you know, trying to rescue, right? You are charismatic Aptio and it is about to be taken away from you.

Speaker 1:          33:10          But on the whole, as we see as they established these charismatic leaders established as charismatic system, they can change the rules. And you know, if you look at Chinese history every five years, everything is completely different, right? Um, uh, first a hundred flowers, four ish. We all that every body will then, you know, greatly for them. You know, cultural revolution. He is changing the rules all the time. This is an unpredictable environment. Candle economies work in this unpacking unpredictable environment. No, it cannot. The same goes for the Nazis. And the same goes for the Stalinists. Right? It was unpredictable. Environment was not good for business. Business needs a predictable environment, right? It needs to rule of law. That's why capital is business at least, uh, lives, legal, rational or authority. They don't necessarily lie democratic system, right? Capitalism can leave nicely with authoritarian figures and capitalist to love the peanut chair, right?

Speaker 1:          34:25          Uh, God, you know, peanut share was, you know, reasonable, illegal Ashman authority. I mean, at the beginning, you know, he was killing people like crazy, but then he established a reasonably predictable system and capitalist loved it. And for the vile, you know, the Chilean economy partially had wise by Milton Friedman, you know, both Steve. So I mean, about capitalism really wants is a predictable environment. And in many ways, you know, democracy is not all that good for the predictable environment because every fourth year we go to the pools and then we elect other people and then they come up with other ideas. And this is a bit of a mess. So in reality, I would almost say that a good free market economy lavs rule of law, Evita kind of authoritarian and a longstanding policy because the ability, they don't like this big changes right in the political system.

Speaker 1:          35:26          Uh, well, um, no, and charisma is that evolutionary force. This is very important. I think we were first before for making some very specific argument. He said it is all of us in traditional historic barriers, right? Traditional Authority, when charisma is the great should rally for us. So in fact, in a modern legal, rational authority, it is not so much charisma, which cat is the change through. It is technical innovation and it is a kind of routine and boring elections every four years, which brings changes by gradually and incrementally the big changes occurring from one type of traditional authority to another type of authority. And in order to change the value system of one type of tradition to another type of tradition that's venue neath charismatic leaders. So he said, I bureaucratic rationalization ears to major it evolutionarily for us. But you know, in a bureaucratic system like what we have, it is a reality.

Speaker 1:          36:37          A revolution from the south. It is coming from technological change. We have an evolution or yes, I'm in the first time when I heard that his staff like Internet is, was uh, uh, an email. It was 1976 and now I'm an inter, you know, uh, uh, email, uh, at that addict does many of, you know, you sent me an email and occasional in five minutes you get an answer from me because I always checking my email like crazy. This was all I knew. All this was coming from the outside. Now a charisma. On the other hand, this is very insightful, very important. It is revolution from within, but charisma is doing is changing the value systems in you, right? That's what charismatic leaders do achieve to persuade you that you have to have a different kind of value system. And that's why I think charismatic leader, she does play a role not only in traditional societies, but you know, charismatic leaders in a legal, rational authority do play a role to change people's value systems, uh, in substantial ways.

Speaker 1:          37:55          Again, we discussed that in discussion section as those who are not in my discussion section. Just uh, let me involve the civil right movement, right? The civil right movement in 10 years in the United States produced the change in value systems, our attitudes to race relationships and gender relationships, which otherwise would have taken a hundred years, right? It happened in 10 short years that we completely resold a race and gender relationships in this country, right? Uh, and it's to a large extent the mended, right? Charismatic leaders, it demanded, right? Uh, Martin Luther King, right? Uh, who had a dream right, about the society where there can be a different type of value system and in no time, I mean, you were too young to experience that, but your balance and but, and six billions and talk to them, they will tell you, right? How fundamentally their word outlook and looking at a person of another race or how they begin to cheat a villain in their family or girls in the family.

Speaker 1:          39:11          How radically change almost instantly, right? Because it was a change from the thing, right? That's what charismatic revolution is all about. Um, and well, this is uh, uh, of course, uh, uh, has everything to do against routine. Charismatic is not doing things as they used to be. That's why it is the opposite, right? Of One type of traditionalism. And the problem is what happens in the charismatic leader disappears and die. So that's when we have the problem. How can the charismatic leader be replaced as a very big issue? And there are different matters of succession. And let me just walk you through all of this. It's not fight on interesting. Again, be sure search, it can be biased about it. He Shun. It can be designation by the origin or leader. It can be designation by a staff, which is particularly qualified to decide who is the next charismatic leader. There'll be loud. The issue is how can you maintain a charismatic, the system Goin gon it can be had at that Terry that's some had that they on is established and it can be office charisma. The office itself. Get Kelly charisma. Now, let me just briefly talk to each one of these church.

Speaker 1:          40:47          Um, the best example is how you found the Dalai Lama, right? It happens to US church. The lie alarm or dies, you know that the da Lai Lama is reincarnated. So you send out to people and looking for the child who is the become nation of the Da Lai Lama. There must be just one child who is the incarnation of the Da Lai Lama. Then you have experts who can tell, go around and then they find this child. This is the new Dalai Lama. And then if you'll be brought up and will become the Dalai Lama, and of course we'll have a greed deal. Uh, af charisma. You can't see it. The barracks, uh, the Da Lai Lama does heck a lot of galleries right now other than you believe in reincarnation or not? That's another story. Uh, uh, probably most people in this room do not believe in it, but if you do not believe it, it even more miraculous why the Dalai Lama has this white extra ordinary care is not, there are people who just get wired if they can get near to the Dalai Lama.

Speaker 1:          42:10          I had a student in Taiwan who actually turned into a boat his and became a great follower of the Dalai Lama. He got a phd from Ucla. What he's following, whatever the da Lai Lama, who was his, all of us there because he has these charisms, his charisma, his attribute it to him, right? He was found in the right way and he was established as a charismatic leader can happen through revelation. Revelation actually means that, uh, there are some people who believed to have some kind of access to some divine authority. Who can that clear that this is a person who is the next scan asthmatic leader? Well, I don't think in contemporary reverse revelation is all that much though were, I mean, newspapers do it for you, right? The newspapers do create charismatic leaders for you. They attach charismatic, they build up. The charismatic powers are for half a person in the media does it for you and certainly their charisma attribute it to um, a rock stars, rock stars to have charisma, right, is created through the media.

Speaker 1:          43:39          The media has the oral call, right? He knows who the grade guys are and whom you, you'll have to get absolutely the ABS excited when you get to the accounts shirt. Now that can be a designation by the origin or leader. Uh, if the charismatic leader is dying, then the charismatic leader has a problem to find a successor that very difficult to do because charismatic leaders are bloody scared that if they designate a leader, then they will be poisoned or merge. Uh, the new leader wants to take it over to often. Very often we see charismatic leaders designating leaders and then murdered in them. That's a long history in human guide. But you know, an interesting example was that styling tried to build up his charisma by thinking a testimonial off [inaudible] learning ambitious. You normally 11 said that stallion, there'll be the successor. This was all lie landing in.

Speaker 1:          44:49          Actually the slight, uh, uh, uh, starting a great deal and was very reluctant to name a successor, but he forged his letter and try to save l I inherited the charisma and he had a lot of problems actually to establish his charisma. Eventually. In fact, during the Second World War, he managed where merged as a charismatic leader and not in only in the Soviet Union, but even in the vest. There's a lot of people in the United States as a, the, the Soviet Army defeated the Germans first in Moscow and then of course in styling Grad that they begin to see starting as a great leader, right? As a charismatic Greek leader, we probably had nothing to do with the success of the Red Army now, or it can be designated by a qualified staff. Uh, this is the way half, for instance, the poop is being, uh, selected and the boob thus have lie the charismatic authority.

Speaker 1:          45:55          If you are all man catalytic, you know that the pope has some access to God, what you ordinarily Roman Catholics do not have and how is, but it's going one from bomb pop to the next. The character of the book will matter, right? There are some more, you know, charming more passwords if books when we, you'll see more charismatic leaders that are other groups who are more like middle Kratz but never the less, even the bureaucratic kind of Forbes art assume to be charismatic and they are Sellek then, uh, by a designated staff that is a certain set of archbishop's men. One Paul dies, they gather together in Rome and they cannot leave, you know, the room until they agree the achieve their consensus. Who is the other person who will have dispatch shoddy relationship to God? All right. Uh, that is also had other attitude, that charisma that you try to pass a charisma on to your children.

Speaker 1:          46:59          Very hard to do a North Skoda is trying to do that, right? Himi was shown passed, uh, uh, his, uh, charisma onto Kim Jung Il, which is an absolutely ridiculous guy. But nevertheless, you know, somehow, yeah, it looks like you know that in Korea he does have some kind of get is matic at bill. So I mean this is not totally impossible. I mean that's a bad idea. You know, if you are charismatic leader to brass charisma on the spree buying, not the office got his Ma, this is very important in combines of an office is supposed to have some charismatic depending on the office, but the office of the book of course it's supposed to have charisma, but we actually do use this very often. We do barely into your aunt to for you we call this leadership right? That we expect people in put us in position of certain authorities to offer leadership to have vision.

Speaker 1:          48:03          Right? And this is an a kind of a charisma which goals, uh, via with the office. And you know, I have been department chair, uh, quite a few times and uh, it's so interesting moving into the position of department chair and more meaning out of it. But your relationship to your college change agreed there. You know when you are the pen, the and chair that is southern is Sammy charisma is attribute it to you right now. You are a support to offer some kind of leadership annual, I believe, to be able to bring in songs change. I just remember, you know, one of the institutions and I was an incoming outside share our people say, ah, you came in life fresh air early in two years time. It was all gone. I was not Rochelle. I was a little tee in, you know, I was operating, you know, bureaucracy, massaging the mirror accuracy to get the exam. My charisma was all God. But there is, right. I think it's a very American thing, right? That you attach an expectations to an incumbents of the office, that it can actually carry out change, bringing fresh air, right. To have a vision and to do these better than it was done before. Okay. That's about charisma. Thank you.
