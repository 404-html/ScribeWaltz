Speaker 1:          00:02          Good morning. Uh, today's stop the keys Weber's a theory of legal, rational authority and his theory of bureaucracy. Uh, uh, this is one of those questions, those topics. Faber is probably the best known for. Uh, it's also that they're a complicated issue when we are saying legal rational authority be briefly referred to the rule, the rule of law. And we tend to associate in our mind that the rule of law a bit liberal market economies and the liberal democracies, well they bear has a very complex argument about this. Um, uh, in the League or National Authority is the kind of system of authority which is predictable. Uh, because there is an observable law. Everybody's, uh, a subordinated to which in fact has the, uh, most, uh, uh, um, uh, the clearest elective affinity with a market economy. Um, nevertheless, uh, um, uh, as video see, he will argue that which is very counter intuitive that a bureau stype of Frigo National Authority is bureaucracy.

Speaker 1:          01:29          And this is usually what we don't have in our mind when we are thinking about, uh, uh, uh, a market economy that it is bureaucratic. So, um, uh, we have to deal with Weber's interesting claim that the purest type of legal rational authority, which goes together with and Monica capitalistic economy is actually bureaucracy. Um, it's also interesting that vapor does not make an assumption that I'm a bureaucracy legal rationale authority or capitalism necesarrily goes together with democracy. How democracy fits into the picture is a rather problematic for him. Of course, we have to appreciate that in Weber's when vapor was writing, um, uh, about these issues somewhere between a 1914 or 1920, uh, um, I mean, virtually none of the countries in the world where liberal democracies on universal suffrage and, um, uh, the political systems of the world changed so much in the last hundred years. But he problematizes does relationship and it's actually quite useful.

Speaker 1:          02:44          So this is, uh, uh, the, um, uh, uh, guideline for today's lecture. Again, I strived with, uh, uh, the definition of the ideal type, the purest type of legal rational authority. And then I tried to dig into these, a unusual but very influential Avebury and argument that bureaucracy in fact is the purest Stipe, a fleet, rational national authority. And then Ivo look at various kind of, uh, limitations of the exercise of bureaucratical authority. One is called the reality. The other is functional division of Labor that I, the separation of various branches of government, which is a limitation on bureaucracy and representation. Democracy as a limitation on government. So you can see that he sees, um, attention, right between democracy, bureaucracy, legal, rational authority, and capitalists. They do not go as easily together as usually we Americans tend to think about this. And then a couple of ideas about, uh, uh, his, uh, his view about, uh, uh, uh, democracies.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Okay. So let me start with what is the pure type, um, uh, for, uh, illegal rational authority. And, uh, there are really two issues. We have to very briefly talk about, um, that are different ways how laws and norms can be established. You already beginning to feel our way into the problem. Whether the rule of law and democracy are identical order, you know, it can be democratic or does not have to be that democracy democratic. Um, and, uh, uh, then the question is, uh, who obeys a wallet and home on the legal authority. Um, so, um, uh, and a, a bit about, uh, I leave that Asher authorities. So the, uh, the argument years rather, there are various ways, um, how, uh, uh, laws or norms can be established. Uh, um, uh, and, uh, well he said, you know, uh, legal or quality or rest on the acceptance of the following guy ideas, right?

Speaker 1:          05:11          Well, the norms, he said they can be established by agreement. That's what we usually think when we think about rule of law or by imposition. It can be imposed on people, right? And it can happen on the ground of expediency. And it can happen because these are the most useful laws. And therefore the either agreed that this is what we want to obey, or there is an authority which we impose on us. Or it can be based on value. Rationality may not be that expedient may not be necessary, immediately useful, but on the basis of shared values or the values of those who impose those laws, and we tend to believe it. Uh, uh, uh, reveal, uh, this is the way how it will be established. And then, you know, of course, the legal system, it has to be a somewhat consistent, uh, uh, right?

Speaker 1:          06:14          Uh, this is important for the predictability of the system and it has to be intentionally established, right? Is Not coming, uh, uh, or from, uh, uh, um, accident, but intentionally established. But the major point, what I wanted to make right, that a legal, rational authority, uh, in Weber's view, um, can be actually an authoritarian system. Uh, uh, let's say, uh, uh, chiller under Pinochet the later times after he established, so consolidated his power earlier on it was a tire and Nicole, ooo, but later on, you know, Pinochet establish the, uh, Ellie got rational order though it was not democratic at all, right? It was operating a weak legal system. We tried, he imposed on people. And you know, in history we have a, uh, a number of instances. Then we can say, you know, this country is a country of law and law and order.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Uh, we know what the laws are. Uh, we actually think the laws are not unreasonable. But it was imposed by some power upon us. Now the next question is, uh, who obeys a home and, well, I don't want to develop on this along. This is quite clear. You already are familiar with this. What is important? Add the person who is in authority, we issues orders, uh, um, um, um, is himself subject to an impersonal order. So we are all subject to the same order. This is the essence of Frigo rational authority. Um, uh, um, uh, uh, at least in the IDR type, right? Uh, we, we know the exceptions to this. Uh, uh, you know, that will scorn if for instance, in Italy, Italy really are illegal. National Authority for a long time managed a right to pass a legislation which enabled him to escape prosecution.

Speaker 1:          08:26          Though he's probably involved a number of criminal activities, but somehow he managed to escape criminal prosecution. Uh, but that's the exception. The rule is right that even the person who is, uh, uh, highest in charge is subject to the same mortality and it has to obey the law. Uh, and this is again, very obvious. We already covered this. A the opposite, the mirror image of it, right. Uh, the members of the society, uh, over or obedience, uh, uh, uh, not to the superior, not as an individual, but to an impersonal order to, to the law as such. That should be quite obvious now. Um, uh, so what are the major characteristic of a system which is based on legal, rational order? That is a continuous rule bound conduct? Uh, it's again, you know, I think it does not a call for too much, uh, uh, clarification.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Uh, it is continuous. The same rules, the rules, uh, change slowly and with great deal of difficulties as we see how congress is struggling to pass a law about how secure that for him, you know, it takes months or years before an important let new piece of legislation, yes, into a place and usually new pieces of legislations, uh, in legal action or authority. Our grandfather, right. If you pass a new law, you change the rules of the game. You're usually grandfather them. Those who entered the game before the new law are still under the rule of the old law. But you do that at the universities all the time, right? If for instance, a degree requirements do change in our university almost overs, this degree requirements are these, uh, these new legislation is grandfather are, you know, the, the, the terminology, right? It will not apply to people who are already in the program.

Speaker 1:          10:36          It feels only applied to people who are entering the program or at, or, you know, one way of grandfathering, get that v if people are choice, you know, if you want to operate under the new order or you can opt for the new oral, uh, or if you want to stay under the old rule, you can stay on the old rule, only do four dome. Those are the new rule binding who are entering the system now. So that's very important, right? That is continuous and uh, and uh, um, and roll band. And he's also said in Ligo rational authority, uh, there must be a very clear separation of stress of competence, right? Uh, who is, uh, uh, competent to carry out what, uh, and then you can have as a, uh, figured out how you will navigate in that ego rational order. Uvl Be told, well, this is not my table or you go somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          11:32          So you go and you ask something, um, from, uh, the director of undergraduate studies and the director of undergraduate studies might say, go and see the dean of your residential college. Right? Because that is this fair of competence of the residential college. That's the way how legal rational or ESC pose to operate. And the same, you know, occasionally the dean of college will say they are, you have to see, um, uh, your sociology professor or your economics professor, right? You want to get transfer credit, for instance, for a summer course. And then the dean of college, they all said, you know, it is the department be political science or economics or anthropology. They will be able to tell whether this is, can be accepted as a, uh, uh, an economic scores at year. Right. Um, um, and this also implies that that is over as a hierarchy and the right to have appeal.

Speaker 1:          12:34          This is, again, you are very familiar with, you know, exactly. Uh, if, uh, uh, you get a grade from your discussion section leader, you can appeal to the, to the professor to say, well, I don't think it's a fairly not grade. I deserve a better grade, you know, uh, and my section leader and made an an error. And if you are unhappy with the response of the professor, you go to the chair of the department and at the old, the cello and they had is a whole hierarchy of Aptio. Right? But you can try to correct what you think is, uh, uh, are not right. So I think it's extremely important that you know, you, you know exactly what is the chain of appeal and how far you can go up, but was surely there is also some specialized straining, uh, which is, uh, uh, expected for people to do, occupies certain positions.

Speaker 1:          13:31          Uh, so, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, discussion of section leaders viewed all of us be, um, at least graduate students. Uh, um, uh, uh, usually hell people can teach their own course once they were past, uh, um, uh, uh, they had, uh, a phd students, but all of over they have is a dissertation to finish or they must have that phd and I, so that is a specialized training and that's history, uh, to perform certain functions as such. Um, and that's, uh, an interesting and very complex idea here. Either the staff has to be separated from the ownership of means of production and administration. And this is even more important for, uh, for, for Weber's argument being separated, you know, it's, uh, not, not that easy to penetrate what he exactly wants to saving this. What does it mean that you do not own the means of administration?

Speaker 1:          14:36          It basically means that the source of rules and laws are outside off the administrators. As such, if you want to have any change in the rules, then must be some procedure which is beyond the person who is administering that rules. How the rules can be changed, right. And this, in order to, you have, could prevent, uh, um, uh, unpredictability in the system. And that's why, you know, rules change all the time. Uh, but, uh, the, the, the fundamental principle is that these rules should not be allowed to be changed, uh, um, by the person who administers the writer though those rules. Um, uh, so, uh, you know, just to give a very trivial example, once, uh, you got your syllabus and the course requirement, then, uh, you know what kind of from assignments you have to, uh, uh, they'll liver during the course in order to get credit in this course, then a welder Verking out these rules, uh, uh, professor plays a role.

Speaker 1:          15:47          Uh, but you know, we have to be get approved by the courses and curriculum committee and then innovative. We are bound by those rules. So on Dovey, I could not announce you today. Well, I changed my mind and that will be an unseen, you know, final examination. Maryville have, you will have to get a final examination, right? And Uv or not know what questions I will ask him. I can ask any question for the whole course, right. If I would change, right. These, uh, these rules right now, uh, you have or would have app, I'm sure appeal, you know, against me, my, against my decision, right? I'm bound Baru, so that, that means that I don't own the means of administration, right? I am, I am administering, right? Uh, what is, uh, in, in, in the syllabus that is a little Levy, right? Occasionally, I can give you an extension, for instance, uh, uh, uh, if you come to me, I mean, therefore, it's, uh, uh, you know, that is a little flexibility in the system, but fundamentally, you know, the course should be taught as, as it is, uh, uh, in the syllabus.

Speaker 1:          16:55          And the requirement should be like it is in the syllabus. That's what, what it means, right? That you do not own a ride. The means of administration, unlike in traditional authority where a feudal lord does have a dog's own, appropriated some means of administration from, uh, the, the monarch and, uh, you know, uh, British or the French, uh, of high aristocracy, uh, could, uh, make rules, um, and not implemented those, but would make rules as well. The unique feature of modern, uh, uh, legal rational authority is that this becomes an impersonal process, uh, by which is, uh, uh, uh, uh, not done. There is a separation between those who implement the rules and there's a separate procedure. How the rules are being established. Is that reasonably clear about ownership of means of administration? Means has not appointed out is a very, very, very an idea, right?

Speaker 1:          18:01          For four Mark Strad, the whole issue is the means of, uh, uh, ownership of means software production for vapor. This is everything about the administrations, uh, um, the, uh, the means of administration. Okay. Now we come to this very interesting way, very and theory of the bureaucracy, very interesting guy, very controversial in many ways. Very counter intuitive. Uh, you may say it is false. Uh, uh, well, uh, see, uh, and uh, that is a nice stop before discussion sections. Um, and, uh, Ivr, this is what I veal will through a number of issues. What is a bureaucracy, a vapor and makes these, uh, uh, quite incredible claim. But first, a UVL completely reject that the most efficient organization is the bureaucracy. Right? That's exactly the opposite of what you think. You know, when something is very inefficient, then you say, well, this is so bureaucratic, right?

Speaker 1:          19:04          They were never that US claims that the most efficient organization is bureaucracy. Then, you know, the question is how is bureaucracy related to capitalism? And socialism is really capitalism, a bureaucratic organization, but is the relationship between capitalist market, economy and bureaucracy, but are the consequences of bureaucracy and also then some contradiction of bureaucratic position. Now let's just quickly rush through a for what are the characteristics, um, Afa and bureaucracy. Now he said, ah, the purest stype of legal authority. This is, as I said, counter intuitive, is that one dish employs a bureau Katich administers if staff, and, uh, well, uh, what are the characteristics of the staff in order to qualify to be due to bureaucracy? They all, they have to be personally three. So it cannot be clients, writer of a mentor, right? Uh, there are legally free individuals that makes it so different from a traditional organization.

Speaker 1:          20:18          That's why a family is not a bureaucratic organization because you are not, uh, uh, uh, there are by choice. Right? Um, uh, and then, and bureaucracy is organized into a hierarchy of offices is something which basically we already covered. Um, under the offices are a field by a free contract. Um, and, uh, in this contractor, what your qualification is, that's what we call that meritocracy. People do have as it grows to a certain degree and that degree qualifies them to be incumbents have a certain office and the receiver a fixed salary that's, uh, uh, uh, it's not quite a bureaucratic organization. Um, if you're working for a commission, right? Uh, you are really in a bureaucratic organization when you sign a contract and you know exactly what you are fringe benefits will be and what your annual salary will be, will be. Uh, uh, typically the office is, uh, is the sole occupation of the incumbents and it constitutes a career.

Speaker 1:          21:30          This is also very important, again, very different from a traditional organization where people could, uh, actually we incumbents have a number of positions and could draw in fact, even incomes from a number of position. In a pure bureaucratic organization, uh, you really can't have only, um, uh, a single occupation. Um, uh, uh, you know, if, uh, uh, for instance, uh, uh, somebody is appointed, uh, uh, with tenure to Yale and, uh, is coming from another institution will have to resign from his or her tenure at the other institution. If you are employed by year, you can be only a year employee. You cannot hold the multiple jobs at the same time. Uh, and uh, and it constitutes a courier and the courier and means that is a letter. You have some sense, you know, how you will progress in these bureaucratic hierarchy. Uh, again, the universities are classic raw bureaucracies.

Speaker 1:          22:38          You know, that you entered as an assistant professor, then you are seven to nine years depending on the institution of is south tenure. Then you are being promoted to tenure. Then you expect that one point of time to become a full professor, blah, blah, blah. Right? I, this is what it meant. It is a career and in many bureaucratic organization, even in the business world, right? You'll have a sense, you know, how you progress, uh, in a law firm, right? Uh, if you entered a law firm, right? Uh, you have, you have a pretty clear idea that it's actually very similar to the universities. Usually for seven years you are working for the law firm and that's when you can be gone right. At partner in the law firm. Right. And, um, the, the crowd, you know, so you, you, you, you have a sense how your carrier veal unfold.

Speaker 1:          23:29          Um, uh, well, uh, this is something we order the kind of, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, cover dry that you are separated from the means of administration, uh, because you are subjected to this zipline and control now comes the very controversial idea. And what do we have to talk about this, uh, Weber's claim, you know, which is against very much against common sense, uh, that, uh, uh, the purely bureaucratic type of administration he was capable of attaining the highest degree of efficiency. Uh, uh, well, uh, led me on the other hand from the citation on the line and important point here, and this is a, you know, uh, uh, of course we were, was talking about a very specific type of organization, you know, bureaucracies which are relatively speaking historically quite efficient, slide the plush and type of bureaucracy. But here, here he emphasizes, and this is, these are two very important words from the technical point of view, right?

Speaker 1:          24:47          The bureaucracy from the technical point of view is the most efficient organization. It does not necessarily means that it does achieve the highest valve fail for people who are seeking to not navigate in a bureaucratic organization, but technically speaking, it is the most efficient. Why? Because it has a very high degree of predictability. I mean, this predictability might suggest that it will take you a long time to get through of that bloody Red Day, right? What the bureaucracy was, is on you, but you know exactly the red tape and you know, if you are stuck, you know how to try to appeal and to get the process moving. So, and therefore the crucial issue. He said by the bureaucracy is so efficient because it is technically competent now. And it is, it is predictable. And, uh, this is what makes it, uh, actually, uh, so to fit so well with the, uh, uh, uh, uh, a Marquette, uh, uh, well he said, what else?

Speaker 1:          25:59          If, if it is not bureaucracy, how can you advise, organize an organization if it is not done bureaucratically than it is dilettantism. Right? Uh, um, uh, and you may want to think about this now. Uh, uh, here comes the question about how does a bureaucracy and capitalism are, uh, fits into, um, uh, and now he makes a very intriguing, very provocative claim. I think it is very deep and deserves your attention. He said the primary source of superiority in a administration, uh, life's in technical knowledge. Uh, right. Uh, bureaucracy is domination through knowledge. Now, a very provocative, very important claim, right? Bureaucracy is right. The par exsalonce medical cratic organization, right? That people who are issuing command artist showing command did the assumptions that they are the most competent people to carry this out. Well, whether this is the case or not, I, I, you know, you remember Vba is all of us operating with idea of taps or pure types.

Speaker 1:          27:23          The concrete cases may be a different from it. Uh, you may have people who are not competent, uh, to exercise the authority, what they do exercise. But I think it is important that you have the idea of tie because then you can be upset and you say, these bloody bastard, right? It is incompetent, cannot do their job and then you can appeal and to say, why don't you remove this person because this person does not know about his or her job is, and actually such an appeal. Very often it's consequential people. Occasionally I removed that position if that in competence is being demonstrated. Um, when all this is very difficult with the university because universities, we have the system of tenure, you know, um, after I use a software for seven years as an assistant professor, you are promoted to tenure and then it is very difficult to get you out of the job.

Speaker 1:          28:22          But even at the university is possible if you find out that I'm completely incompetent, right? You'll document that I am incompetent, right? That I'm just misinterpreting all the orders you had here. Um, and then you can appeal right to the university and you can say that I really should be removed. I, you know, my, uh, tenure should be involved and if I found to be incompetent, I will lose my job about the only way to do it. Yeah. Look, prove my competence. Actually University is very rarely do it because a very painful exercise, but because they are bureaucracies, their is right. The rule that it can happen and it should happen in these cases. And then he said, well, from this point of view material, it does not matter whether an economy's organized as a, um, a capitalistic economy based on private ownership or whether it is organized as a socialist economy based on public ownership.

Speaker 1:          29:26          Right. And in fact, now he goes even further and it's very interesting what he's, he got to say here in the, um, uh, he's writing the some that in 1919, 1920 a the Soviet Union already exists, Russia or the exists that is already as society, which costs itself Socialist, which eliminated private ownership and he said the hell socialism of would require a still higher degree of former bureau categorization then capitalism. That's a very interesting idea though. Antio now he's suggested, right that uh, the bureaucratic organization is the best bit free market economy. Now he said, actually socialism, you be even more bureaucratic. And then I think what comes very, it's a very intriguing idea. And he said, but the big problem with socialism is that there will be a big conflict here between, uh, the former rationality and substantive rationality, but the bureaucracy carries out and you'll know by now, right?

Speaker 1:          30:33          Or do you have at least a hunch, but he's getting get between formal and substantive rationality, right? Former nationality is that you are simply implementing the rules of the game. Um, uh, substantive rationality is you are actually concerned with develop fair, the substantive goals of the action. And he said, well if you have a publicly owned economies, centrally planned economy, then the central planners make substantive decisions about the economy. They decide for instance, their government or taxpayer money should go off. We'll go to you know, which branches of the economy should be investment. We're going to write in a capitalist economy. Governments you typically cannot do that, right? They said the rules of the game, well the best, you know, they manage interest rates and you know they may be able to manage the currency exchange rate but they cannot allocate resources across the economy or if they do, uh, then people there save, we are on the road to socialism, right?

Speaker 1:          31:40          To the extent substantive rationality is involved, but he said, well if it is socialism, that will be this big tension, right? You cannot be at the same time for money, rational and substantively rational. You either consider that content of your decisions or you are concerned simply the the procedures of the decision. If you are concerned with the procedure that is former rationality, if you are concerned with the content that is substantive rationality. Let me just give you one example about the legal system. Uh, indeed in Communist societies, uh, uh, and probably to some extent even China today, uh, uh, too much less so than it was at say 30 or 40 years ago. Uh, well, uh, when justice is being served by the court, the court is not blind to who of people who are being accused of committing some crime is um, uh, uh, the communist, the legal system called itself a class law that in fact, the purpose of the legal system is not to be blind right now.

Speaker 1:          32:57          Who committed the crime. The purpose of the legal system is that was the kind of legitimacy see claim and their communism to defend the interest of the working class. Um, right. And therefore that was, uh, specifically illegal system based on substantive rationality right now, uh, um, uh, capitol, this legal system then to be procedurally right rationale is the former, the rationality in principle. It doesn't matter who the person is. Then you are serving a justice. This is again the ideal, right? In concrete cases actually, um, uh, uh, judges might consider some sort of substantive characteristics of the person who is on trial and not simply to implement the law, uh, may consider as mitigating circumstances, right? For instance, when they are passing the law. And of course there are other reasons how actually substantive considerations entered the game. You know, um, if you are white and rich, you can hire a better defense lawyer and your chances to get off the horse.

Speaker 1:          34:15          Basically, we've seen the same rules are veterans. So substantive considerations centered the theme, but that's the exception. That's not supposed to happen. The are angry when it, this is happens, right? We want to have a faceless legal system, right? A justice is blind, right? These blindness of justice means radices simply, procedurally just right and not substantively so. Right? This is why justice is shown. We had blind eyes. Now what are the consequences of bureaucratic position? Uh, here are some of them. He said that it is a tendency of leveling of interests since everybody's in principle equal before the law. And therefore interest will be level. You are not supposed to take the intellect down people's position in it. Um, well there is a tendency Medico cratic tendency that people, uh, higher up feel have higher levels of training or more training guest such, uh, and uh, uh, the, this is again, you know, justice is blind.

Speaker 1:          35:27          Uh, uh, what is important is, uh, that uh, the essence of a bureaucracy has to be a formalistic impersonality a Sienna era at studio, uh, this out hatred, then passion, right? Uh, this is why occasionally you are kind of upset when you are confronted with the bureaucracy. You have a special problem, you know, and then to bureaucracy tends to be insensitive to your special problem, right? Uh, uh, van it is audio bureaucracy, right? Uh, you can't say, you know, I just had a fight with my, uh, uh, [inaudible] and this is my, I cannot take the test. Well, see, you're not either a studio. I mean, ah, in our yard, bureaucratic, a discussion leader or professor of you say, too bad, uh, you know, this is your person or business. The test is right now, uh, you take it or leave it. Well, I mean, uh, APP usually not that stupid bureaucrats, but that's the spirit of bureaucracy, right? This, our teacher, that passion, that also means that you are not motivated by, um, uh, uh, various or no,

Speaker 2:          36:45          uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          36:46          feelings. You know, you don't differentiate. This is a person I like and then I give preferences Rodesh light and therefore diva, uh, adverse grade. Oh, right. That are and number of contradictions of bureaucracy. Uh, uh, if is, uh,

Speaker 2:          37:03          ah, ah, AH,

Speaker 1:          37:07          Betty formalistic. Yeah. Uh, um, and he said that is also another interesting tendency do it is formalistic and it's supposed to go by, uh, at the, um, uh, simply by the rule arose occasionally not only under socialism, in all systems, the bureaucracy then to have, uh, uh, some sensitivity to substantive rationality to the welfare of the people who are under, uh, the bureaucracy. And then it can turn into a client that is stick system. The bureaucracy can, can have these, uh, uh, these standards can think about that fared bureaucracies, right? Miss, you do have a great deal of client that is Steve. Dan Dance is built into them well, and that are these various limitations of bureaucratical authority. Vaughn is collegiality, a division of powers and representation. Well, um, I don't want to dwell too long on the notion of collegiality. Collegiality says, really grows out of, um, uh, uh, Watch v you as a,

Speaker 2:          38:21          uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, um, as a, okay.

Speaker 1:          38:39          The fashion all or groups or professional or organizations. So, um, that are different ways how collegiality, uh, can, can operate, uh, uh, one, uh, they, uh, uh, that that means that you are interacting with other people in the same, uh, organization on the basis of collegiality. Uh, you can get a good sense of these collegiality, collegiality, for instance. Uh, uh, it's very important in the medical profession. Um, if you go to a doctor for a second opinion, uh, this doctor is really not supposed to say that his or her colleague, the other doctor, uh, uh, video, the school data and he gave you the wrong diagnosis or, or the or the wrong territory, right? Uh, collegiality means that you stick together rather the profession, uh, sticks together. Um, uh, that is a very strong sense of collegiality among lawyers or at least supposed to be. The attic of legal profession is very much collegiality. And it is also, um, uh, uh, incidentally in, in, in the universities. I mean,

Speaker 2:          39:55          okay.

Speaker 1:          39:56          Faculty is not supposed to bad mouth each other, right? They, uh, uh, certainly towards students they have to show that they have a collegial relationship with each other. Mutual respect, balance them together. Uh, occasionally that is a, what he calls me talk all the reality. The collegiality does, Does Give Vico right? To certain people to do run this organization. A single person can veto a decision. Uh, uh, such a, again, very typical in universities, uh, um, uh, vanee comes for instance, to decision whether somebody's view will be granted a permanent position in a university. So called tenure. That is actually, I'm the president of the university usually has a veto right? And can veto no matter that all, uh, bodies, uh, approved that the president usually have a vitro, right. Can veto that to decision. It uses it very rarely, but occasionally it does use a, it's a veto or, right. Uh, so, uh, in, in even in a collegiality, organized, uh, uh, uh, a bureaucracy that is these,

Speaker 2:          41:06          uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          41:10          individually [inaudible] score, the GLT usually operates through different committees and advisory boards. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          41:18          Uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          41:23          I mean, collegiality, you surely is emerging in a situation where you have a common trade or a common profession. That's when a group is being organized as a collegial bureaucracy. And as such, um, and, uh, uh, uh, many or few Vlm Dapa and professions in the bitch, uh, UVL have, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, such a collegial, um, uh, uh, uh, an environment as such a, um, uh, okay. Uh, the other issuers, which is also a limitation of the functioning of the bureaucracy, right? A collegiality man tried that though. Uh, the bureaucracy is supposed to be blinded to individual differences. It's not all of us because we have lawyer off the stove was each other based on our profession. Lawyers, solid legal to lawyers and doctors and loyal to fellow doctors and professors. So I have a degree of loyalty. Um, now the other one is a, um, uh, uh, uh, division of, uh, off Bowers.

Speaker 1:          42:40          Um, uh, now there's division off Bowers, uh, uh, law, uh, and Montesquieu. And there was silver was talking about the, well, it's a function or system. Uh, he cites Montesquieu about the separation of power, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, uh, that, uh, creates some degree of unpredictability, uh, in, in, in the system, but necessarily, but creates some degree, um, uh, for entree. Addictability. Nevertheless, uh, this is a very hard to prevent diarrhea and he's so therefore it is good for the economy by what he means for the market economy. And then comes the question of representations and different forms of representation. So, um, well that are very, again, you know, what representation can be democratic and, but is not necessarily all that bloody democratic. Uh, uh, uh, in fact, that is a possibility of that presentation when the representation is happening through some, had a deterring means, uh, uh, uh, u s you know, in the additional authority, uh, people who were born in Sudan position like Montesquieu, he himself, uhW, was supposed to represent certain interest, um, and have each is beyond the, uh, the personal interest of the person that was supposed to represent the interest of the whole estate.

Speaker 1:          44:26          The what it did for standing for um, well it's also, or in modern times, we do have our representation, well, representations can be selected by, by rotation or, or lot, um, uh, in ancient Greece this happened. Um, uh, and that can be a limited, uh, mandate. Um, uh, they are not representing, uh, uh, uh, necessarily the interest of their constituency and they can be, uh, can be recalled. Uh, this was typical of a communist bureaucracies, uh, or that it can be what he calls free representation is what people would associate to democracy where the representative is elected rather than, uh, selected or appointed. Um, and, uh, it bought, it is also not bound by instructions, is only obliged to express his own conviction. Uh, so, uh, this is what we have seen in the congress happening, right? The Demo Democrats, um, uh, [inaudible], uh, uh, uh, Republicans because those Democrats argue that I'm not under party discipline, right?

Speaker 1:          45:45          I am acting out of my conscience. Um, now, uh, um, uh, a couple of ideas about three representation and how it goes with a capitalistic economy. Well, what is cool short item, they were, keeps coming back and back to this, but is vital for a capitalistic economy, has to be a cocktail ability and reliability. Um, uh, uh, um, and uh, uh, well in, uh, early stages. In fact, there was property qualification who could actually water and that was implemented in order to make the system more predictable for the property classes. There was a great deal of concern by the bourgeoisie to give universal suffrage because they felt then this view would be unpredictable who via, um, via the elections. Um, in fact, uh, very often these were monarchs and absolute monarchs who were pushing for extension, right, of suffrage. Because they wanted to use this against their property, uh, was Razi.

Speaker 1:          46:58          That's against something very counterintuitive, but I think historically a very accurate, uh, uh, uh, uh, understanding Grad. So one has to be very careful. Uh, what exactly the relationship with the capitalist economic order and democracy is. Uh, uh, uh, so, uh, Weber's fundamental argument is what many people who do the history of democratic movement feel, Agri others view, disagree with him. Again, a good subject for discussion. Um, a parliamentary fee representation was the product, uh, between, uh, struggles actually struggles between monarchs and the bourgeoisie. Um, uh, well, I think I'll just leave this here or probably gave us enough food for the discussion. Thank you.
