Speaker 1:          00:01          So Adam Smith's, uh, and this is what I want to rush quickly through, uh, his life. You don't really know all that much about his life and it's not as colorful. And George, uh, who saw and then you know, his major contributions, uh, eh, his theory of self interest and how self interest is related to come and good is labor theory of value. His idea of distribution, of value between Labor, capital and rent. And finally, what is the most often cited with his theory of the invisible hand. So here it is. Adam Smith about his life. He was born in 17, 23, um, uh, in Scotland called the just outside of, at the Moro, which is a beautiful city if you did not visit it yet. I like all mental you do. Uh, he entered the University of Glasgow and interestingly at that time in the mid 18th century for reasons which is beyond me and next to Paris and London.

Speaker 1:          01:11          And Edinburgh was the center of the Scottish enlightenment. Um, uh, then he also went to Oxford and a in bio or college. Um, uh, and the, in 1751, he was appointed, um, at the University of Glasgow as a Prophet Glasgow. I would not recommend as a tourist destination by the Va. Uh, uh, um, um, uh, he became a professor of logic and then he became a professor of moral philosophy, believe it or not, right. The person who is known about self interests and the invisible hand is major for a job was professor of moral philosophy of ethics. And in 1759, he published a book, the book called the theory of moral sentiments, which is a book on ethics. Uh, well, we've, you'll see this is a big issue whether this book was written out of Expediency, uh, he wrote it just because he wanted to justify that he's a professor of moral philosophy and he didn't really believe in it because he was an economist, a rational choice economist or of us urea, a moralist as one of the big questions.

Speaker 1:          02:32          I think what, um, uh, scholars on Adam Smith a debating, he traveled in Europe and this may have been a turning point in his life. He meets Voltaire and kills me, a major economist off his time and other representatives of French enlightenment and French enlightenment may have actually influenced him and pushed him, uh, uh, after the return of Glasgow, uh, to, and the guilt card, what have I leave him back. And that's what he mainly wrote the valves of nations. Right. And that's the most important book. But I think in order to understand, uh, Adam Smith's, we have to come to terms with, be the appearance, tension between the theory of moral sentiment and a vessel of nation. Is this the same altar or these are two different authors, right? Is it the same theory or there are two different theories offered to us. And that's, I think very complicated.

Speaker 1:          03:31          He passed away in 1970. Well, I wanted to find you some figures about pictures about his life. The only thing, what I could find this, um, a memorial on the site where the house jewel in Kilgore devout, he wrote a diverse of nation. So it's not only a university VG, sterning building downs, even the British do turn or the beer, the exam, even if they should not have done so. Right. Would be so nice to visit the house. That diverse of Nation of was written. Like if you were to kill Cordey well you can visit that site and to have a lot. Okay. So as I said, Adam Smith seemed to have two faces regularly. Normally today if you take economics classes right, he is presented as the person who is advocating the self-interested individual and uh, uh, uh, committed at theories of the self regulating Marcus of the invisible hand as little government as possible.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Poor soul, just yourself interests and your self interest will leave to the common good. So he is the sort of inspiration for now classical economics and rational choice theory, right? And methodological individualism to put in this way. But he has this book, the theory of moral sentiment in which he's writing about sympathy as an important motivation for human action. And is this just a concession to his job or is there something deep in him which also showed the need for a helping hand by the public authorities? That's the big puzzle. You know, we have to struggle there. Uh, there are, there are other people who are more qualified to give you the most authentic interpretation of Smith. And I try to do my best. Okay. There are, um, and indeed, you know, diverse of nation looks like about self interested individuals and the invisible hand ivy present you enough citations that you see it.

Speaker 1:          05:46          I will also show you why it is possible. Some, some of, uh, Smith's interpreters. I will suggest that this is the same mill and the fact the vast of nation is just an extension of the theory of moral sentiments rather than I come the addiction to it. I, this is not the majority view right? Today among economists in particular, the majority view is that, you know, you should not really pay much attention to the theory of moral sentiment. The vast of nation gives you the real source and inspiration. And this is what the guides, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, no classical economics, but you may find some economies to disagree and you'll be fined a number of, uh, political philosophers who will disagree and will say that this is not the real, uh, um, Adam Smith's was presented to you by now classic economist. Um, and I don't want to take a position in this, uh, uh, I'm not a sufficiently, um, uh, Smith scholar to be able to do so.

Speaker 1:          06:58          What have you presented the argument both ways and you can make up your mind right there. You stand on this. So the theory of moral sentiments just very briefly, but this is, he does ask the central question, how can we make more or judgment? How can we tell good from evil, good for bad. Now, it's a very important issue and question. Uh, there are many, uh, uh, founding theorists of modern social theory. We're dealing with this. The most important one we've, you're talking about him at great at, you know, in 15 minutes is Frederick Nicha of course, the genealogies of morals. This is the central question there does, right? Um, uh, our conception of good and evil come from. But Adam Smith's already here asked this question and he said, well, what does solution that inside you, that is an inner person, you are to people, right?

Speaker 1:          08:03          You Act and there is somebody inside you is watching you and they're the inside you will, the hotel you, you did something wrong. That was not the right thing to do, right? Um, I think you should be able to relate to this. I can, you know, there is very often and in nurse shelf in my shelf, which tells me that was a mistake I did. That was a foolish things I did. I should not have done. So I know people who've are very small, right? Uh, uh, in, in, in, in, in, in impartial internal SPEC teacher. I know people who have very great difficulties there in ever that I made a mistake, right? There are some people who all of us blame others. If things go wrong right now and I, they have a moral problem, I would say. So watch yourself. You know, you may have a moral problem if your inner self never tells you that you were wrong and you are all those lucky to be others, right?

Speaker 1:          09:08          If the is being spent wrong, then you have a problem. Ethical problem, at least this is Adam Smith's argument, right? Simple and persuasive. Then he says, this is something which is kind of inspired by hops, right? The are led by passion, but now he is not emphasizing fair. He said also by Sin Buddy. That's crucial and that's the crucial motion for those who emphasize that. In fact, Adam Smith's in the vest of nation is the same. Adam Smith's as in the theory of moral sentiments because Adam Smith's, those who argue for Vaughn Adam Smith's rather than to Adam's misses, right? Say that he has a theory of humans, which is a sympathetic theory of humans. What drives us, uh, that we have sympathy for others. Other people's sympathies that in interacting with others, the are seeking others, people's sympathy, right? We try to please people, right? We want to impress people, right?

Speaker 1:          10:20          The want to have a reputation. We want to have good reputation. The want to act honorably, right? So we are seeking sympathy, we have a sympathy, they have that understanding of other people's human conditions, but we are also expecting others to understand us and value us, right? Um, and I think this is a very important and intriguing idea. This a Ivr show that to show you later on may not be completely inconsistent by the idea that seeking self interest is leading to the common good, right? Because indeed if self interest implies that I all show wronged, right? Uh, others to respect and evaluate me, that self interests also implied that I want to good do good to others, right? This is in yourself interests that you can say, at the end of the day, I am a good person. Right? Then in fact, pursuing these self interest, right, may not be all that different, right from the common God, right?

Speaker 1:          11:31          Because it is inside you. And that's I think, uh, the way how he is being read. And he introduces the notion for the first time of the concept invisible hand in the theory of moral sentiments. But here, the invisible hand is not what you know. You are told Adam Smith's theory of invisible and this it's not the laissez faire free market. It's the hand of God. God guides us, right to have a proper balance between passion and sympathy and that is somehow God's will. But we follow. That's in fact, you know Ivy, we'll talk about this later, dawn. A big a deal is made out of Adam Smith's theory of the invisible hand, the term diversity, invisible hand, the term calm sub three times in his work, right? And in each time he's using it in a different meaning. The way how we understand invisible hand comes from a section lungs in one sentence in the vast of nation and in fact it is specifically about foreign trade, right?

Speaker 1:          12:52          And International Trade. Not a mug and more about the role of the government in domestic affairs, but it is about free trade, free international trade in. This is the context in which he's using the invisible hand as it is being interpreted mostly today by Adam Smith's theories, right? So it's intriguing, isn't it? Watch yourself, then you are coining a term because a term occasionally can stick and then it will be all that repeated to you even if you use it once right in your life. Okay. They're the vast of nations. Where are, these are the kind of table of content you guys about the division of labor and the termination of prices, a accumulation of capital. He talked lots about the evaluation of societies hunting, grazing, agriculture and commercial societies. Um, uh, he never used the term capitalism. A modern economy was commercial industrial society for him.

Speaker 1:          13:59          And then he offers a criticism of mercantilism and that's where he offers right? An argument for free international trade and that's where he introduces the notion of the invisible hand and then something is on taxation. What I've y'all not talking about? So the self interests and the common good, right. One of the biggest Jews and we have to discuss when we are faced with Adam Smith's and the arguments are if you are interacting with each other, do not expect Benner valance. Right? Do not to expect that somebody else, there'll be charitable to you. Um, there is also say if you are seeking self interest specifically in the citation sites for instant choosing your employment, if you choose it rationally, this will be in the common good. And that will try to explain why you seeking self interest in finding them job, which is best for you is also the best for society.

Speaker 1:          14:54          And then, uh, he says, well, the individual are the better judges of their own interest than any statement of law giver as little state as possible. That's very, it is coming from and we will see how he argues the case. So do not expect Ben Valance. Uh, okay. This is a very frequently cited sentence, uh, uh, from Adam Smith's. It's not in the text. Uh, um, uh, I assigned for this course, it said, well, it is not the Beneville ranch of the butcher, the brewer or the breaker that we expect our dinner from. But the very self interest of the, of the, um, of the butcher, I go to the restaurant, right. I do not expect died, the cook, right. Uh, to give them a bpm me a good meal, uh, because, uh, you know, I need a good meal and you know, I, you know, I, um, uh, I expect the cook to like me, right?

Speaker 1:          15:55          I want him to cook a good meal because then I will give a tip, right? It is in the self insurance, right, of the waiter to serve me well and certainly good food, right? Otherwise I'd be not to go back again and be, and not give her a tip, right? I've, you're punish, right? It is appearing to the self interest, right, of the person for whom I expect something, right? And not, it's been a valance. Now he said, well, the address ourselves and not to the humanity of the people right now to their self love, but we want people to uh, uh, take advantage of this. This is an interesting issue, by the way, even in everyday life, right? That are, I'm sure in this room that are people who think about this differently. Just to give you a very personalized example. Uh, my wife occasionally tells me this person is not a good friend of yours because this person only costs you when that person needs you or this had, this does happen.

Speaker 1:          17:04          And my answer overseas, and I think in this way, deep in my heart, I'm a Smithsonian. I don't want rents. I don't want anybody who do not see an advantage in interacting with me. I want people, right? Who Ha, who actually act out of self interest, seeking my relationship. It will be a bad relationship if my friends or the things that it costs them to talk to me and they do not benefit from the relationship with me, right? I don't mind. Well, my children, right? Just to act out of love and sort of be a pain in the neck for them, right? I want my children, right. Uh, to uh, see that having me as a father, it's beneficial for them. Right? That's a good relationship, right? Good relationships are all of us based on self interest, right? You don't want to have a lover, right?

Speaker 1:          18:04          Who does not enjoy being your lover. Right? Therefore you want right people acting out of self interest. And I think that's what is getting get here. He said, even the Bagger here, actually the citations as the beggars are the ones who are dependent only upon Benner ones, but then he qualifies it. He said that's the even for the beggar is not quite true. Right? The beggar view make some tricks in which in in fact it's actually a veal appeal to yourself, interests that you are a charitable person. The robot. Now self interest in employment. He said, well, it's a very good example then you are, he said, then you are choosing an occupation. Of course you want to have a big job, right? You want to be well paid, right? Um, those of you who are in economics major, you know, you may want to have, you know, some nice job, you know, some a brokerage firm in Wall Street, you know, and every 10 years, you know, um, bachelor's degree, you would like to earn $100,000 a year, right?

Speaker 1:          19:14          But why would you earn $100,000? Because the employer gets a lot out of these skills. What you get out of year, right? And therefore it will be in the interest of the society that you had the highest possible salary because you made the greatest contribution to the common good. Otherwise you have done, we've paid that high. Okay? So therefore you, they'll try to find that occupation in which you get the highest possible reward, but you will get only the highest possible rate we about because you make the most contribution. You can bitch your talent with your hard work and it's your skills to the common good. Right? This is Adam Smith's argument. It's a persuasive argument actually. Right? Um, uh, well, I can go home. It's not all that important. Now, this is very important to individuals have the better charge of their own interests than anybody else, right?

Speaker 1:          20:15          And, uh, uh, uh, Bell, this is, I think, uh, again, extremely important and I'm sure this classroom is divided 50, 50% along these views, right? He said, well, uh, uh, the individuals in their local situations are simply better, uh, judges, uh, to what is that interest then? Any statement or, or, or log either, right? People should the judge for themselves what they want. And it should not be a government, which is imposes it on them right now. This is, you know, a big debate right now for instance, about the house, good insurance, the Husky reform. Should we let it up to people to decide whether they want to have an insurance or not? Uh, should we expect people to be individually responsible for themselves to take charge of their life? Or should it be the government or should it be a statesman? The log you, the congress who takes care of people and he, he clearly takes a position.

Speaker 1:          21:18          No, I think, you know, people are the best judges of the theories. Now, the Labor theory of value, and let me run through of it. This is important, right? His point of departure, uh, comes from, uh, uh, John Locke as we have seen. And it is leading directly to Karl Marx, Karl Marx, radicalizes, um, his position. But the point of departure is clearly Adam Smith's and the argument about the little bird theory of tell you the Labor is the measure of all values. And then he said, the whole produce belongs to the Labor. And so far Mark's completely I crazy right? And event we will be discussing marks. Um, uh, but then he departs from it because he has a question. Where does the profit and revenue come from? Mike's as discretion as well. And he says, exportation right? Those who earn profit explored the workers. But Adam Smith has a different view.

Speaker 1:          22:22          He says, well, those who were land capital and those who offer land also deserve part of the value. Now let's see how this contradiction can be resolved, how he's dealing with this. How can that all value is created by labor and belongs to the Labor? And nevertheless, the capitalist podcasts, profit and the landowner packets rent for the land. Then here, this is really a very much John Locke, right? The value of any commodity is uh, uh, uh, uh, bell belongs to the person, uh, you know of, possesses it. Uh, um, and, uh, if you know, if, if it is not for use or consumption, but exchange, then the value of this commodity is equal to the amount of labor which has to be put into this. Libor is therefore he said the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities, right? Commodities can have a use value.

Speaker 1:          23:27          They can be very useful and they can have very little labored in it like fresh air. But go by now we know fresh air needs some, quite a bit of laborers do. Um, uh, but, uh, the exchange, Javier Exchange it, you'll be guided according to Smith, by Labor. A few people accept today the Labor theory of value, smiths or marks, no matter what I did, it belongs to the whole labor. This is a very interesting argument, right? He said, and this is where, again, now John Locke, right? The property of every man is his own labor, right? And therefore every value is created by these labor and therefore it has to belong to the person who, uh, has, uh, these, uh, w own the labor. But he said, this is true, or societies be for capital is being accumulated and the four land is privately owned, right?

Speaker 1:          24:26          So this is really an argument for ancient societies, the south capital accumulation. And we saw private ownership of the land, uh, in these conditions. If there is no capital accumulation and no private ownership of land is commonly owned, then the whole producer of labor belongs to the Labor. And this is where he marks the beauty part dramatically from Adam Smith's. So where does the profit and Ramcom now, uh, uh, our capital is simply exploiting the workers. He said no, there is a distribution of value between Labor, capital and Rant, right? Um, and this is reasonable, uh, because um, the capitalist, uh, offers capital, uh, in order, in fact, advances capitol to the Labor takes risks with this advancement of the capital. Supervise is the labor process and therefore it should claim, right? Some profit from capital. Otherwise we'll be a fool, right mark to advance its capital.

Speaker 1:          25:35          And the same goes for, uh, um, land that shortly, uh, land owners also have, you'll have to give the land site in which production takes place. Um, and therefore they really should be able to, um, uh, collect some rant on this land. Well, uh, finally the invisible hand that are three conceptions of this, uh, uh, I briefly pointed this out in the theory of moral sentiments. He said, this is really God, which gives us a sense of sympathy. And 38 is a balance between passion and desire and hunger for more and self restraint to respect others and earn respect from others. Um, and then of course in diverse of nation, this appears to be the, the Bri marketplace. And then finally he had the manuscript, his goatee off drawn on me, and he said, the invisible hand is the hand of Jupiter, the hand of Jupiter. Um, because people at as long as the are ignorant, um, uh, phenomena lightening for instance, but they don't, cannot explain attribute to the wheel of Jupiter, right? Superstition, the invisible hand is superstition. Okay. So what is fun, right? That three instances where the notion of invisible hand is used in each case with different meaning and in none of the cases exactly the same meaning as we normally understand it. Okay. I think I am now moving over to, uh, John Stewart male and the two, uh, uh, utilitarianism.

Speaker 2:          27:30          Um, and uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:33          he's a wonderful

Speaker 2:          27:34          man.

Speaker 1:          27:35          Um, and it makes a lot of, uh,

Speaker 2:          27:44          well I'm on the long, long fire.

Speaker 1:          27:58          Okay. So this is all about,

Speaker 2:          28:03          okay.

Speaker 1:          28:04          Utilitarianism and liberty and, uh,

Speaker 2:          28:08          uh,

Speaker 1:          28:10          the long growth from Jeremy Bantam to John Stuart Mill. Uh, um, utilitarianism is a fundamentally important proposition. It informs a modern economic theory and 18 forms political and social theories be charged in the kind of rational choice mod or the theorizing. And the point of departure, um, is a Bantam, um, uh, who in many ways is the founding father of utilitarian is though he never used the term. Um, and he influenced the life of John Stuart mill in a major way. A meal. Father was James Smeal, um, uh, quite an intellectual. He wrote the big three volumes, history of um, uh, these, uh, in India and a British involvement in India. He met Benton in 1808, and he fall in love with the theory of Italian and he asked him to supervise the education of his son, what he did and sort of where, um, John Stuart mill grew up under the influence of a very strong father and a very strong teacher.

Speaker 1:          29:27          Um, and uh, uh, uh, he invented the term, uh, John Stuart Mill, the turn utilitarianism in 1822 at a very young age. Um, then he suffers a nervous breakdown when you see what a utilitarian is. Ms You will not wander. I mean, uh, if you are a real yes, children, sick, utilitarian, difficult to survive this out and nervous breakdown. Uh, alright, so what is Bantam theory? Right? Um, he published the book the principles of morals and legislation in 1789 and there are some very important claims in this book. Uh, Andy at first instance, they sound very reasonable. Uh, but uh, he may be pushing his luck too far. He said, well, uh, the are created to seek pleasure and to avoid pain, right? We, and therefore, if we can minimize the pain and maximize the pleasure, that's when the achieve the greatest happiness. And that's what we called utility.

Speaker 1:          30:39          Right? Um, so action is right. If it is leading to happiness, we all want to be happy. Uh, okay. Um, well, uh, and this can be actually quantified. The action is right morally right. If the sum of blessures minus the sum of paints mildly Levi by the number of person affected by action is positive. Sounds reasonable, right? Uh, if more people are happy in society, then unhappy, then the society does as well as it can. Uh, that's uh, you know, the, the argument, uh, well there are a couple of citations. I don't want to fail on this too longer. I will put in on the Bourbon. It's not in the tech side require from you to read. Um, so he said, you know, the two big masters, our pain and pleasure, somewhat of the kind of similar argument to hops. And he said an action may be said to be conformable with the principle of utility.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Man, the tendency is to augment happiness, right? Um, uh, and that is greater than to diminish it. And what is utility utility? Is that principle Meijer approves or disapproves of reaction to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question? Right? This is a notion of utility, which is not all that far away. What economists start using eval at this time. Then he comes something. But I think nobody would accept now that simply he said that it's easy therefore to calculate it. Right? Uh, and I already pointed this out, you just count the number of people who are happy and who has been a kind of a number of people who are happy with it and have pleasure. And if more people have pleasure, the sum total of pleasure exceeds the sum total of paints. Then you got the good society.

Speaker 1:          32:45          That's a utilitarianism, Allah Bentham. Now, John Stuart Mill, um, here he is, uh, uh, he was born in London and he never attended school. He was a lucky one. Uh, but not necessarily all that lucky because his teacher was Benson and John Mill who were tough people and yet had to start learning to hack in and Greek man, he was three years old. Well, if there are anybody who is an Asian American in the room, uh, Chinese, you may have to start actually how to read and write in Chinese pretty early. But he did the v the street, Latin and Greek, which to my mind is a bit easier than to then, or the characters in Chinese. Anyway, 22, we established a utilitarian society and invents the term utilitarianism. And then he suffered him a nervous breakdown. I mean, too domineering people in his life. And then he also becomes very, um, sort of unhappy, right?

Speaker 1:          33:53          With the expediency in emphasis on Utilitarianism, right? Instrumental Ism, the coldness of the arguments, right? Uh, he actually beginning to, becomes interested in poetry. And then he meets a Harriet Taylor, uh, at wonderful lady, um, and a friendship, a very close friendship is formed. Uh, uh, Harriet Taylor was a fantastic, uh, intellectual as far as we can judge, uh, uh, one of the very first radical feminists and had an probably extra ordinary impact, uh, on the verge of Jon Stewart Male, if you would have been at a zero feminist, he probably should have put on, is very, um, uh, Harriet Taylor as a quarter. She probably quartered this work. I mean, she was married and this was an interesting triangle, which did develop, I mean, uh, in what way? We don't quite know what they were traveling together. The threefold, uh, entity. Quite interesting. I said, well, uh, 51, Mr. Taylor basses of, and then, uh, John Stuart Mill, immediately Mary's Harriet Taylor.

Speaker 1:          35:19          But unfortunately, she has a very short life and dies after the short marriage. So his, uh, undisturbed happiness to put it this way, did not last very long. Um, and he died in [inaudible] 73 in Avignon. Now about the work, uh, briefly, uh, we'll be talking about three pieces of work on liberty. Uh, utilitarianism, uh, uh, uh, ivy or not talk about his role as a member of parliament without actually, he was one of the first advocate for a female suffrage, um, of which did not fly at that time. And he even lost reelection probably because he advocating voting rights for women. And then he wrote a 69 a subjection of the man, which is in many ways is a feminist book. Uh, quite a radical feminist book. Um, a feminist book, you know, you can really read four for men and especially the not in 1869.

Speaker 1:          36:25          Um, okay. So what are his major contributions? He redefines utilitarianism, right? As I said, he felt it too cold. He needed, you know, more sentiments, right? Uh, poor tree had you tailor, you know, if him of sense of the verb, which is richer in 70 months. So he has a says, well, there are, that is higher mass, right? That is a lower level of happiness and then a higher level of happiness, uh, to have a good steak. Uh, well it is pleasurable, but to listen to, uh, the ninth symphony of Beethoven manage greater happiness, right? It's a higher level of happiness, right? When you hear the concluding core out of the ninth simply right, you are through the roof of Blusher, right? You have a higher level of happiness, then he'd be eating a nice rare steak. Huh? That's the higher level of happiness. And he said, and he, nobody argues it more forcefully than him.

Speaker 1:          37:42          Individual Liberty is the ultimate value and expediency. And you know what he means by experience? You right? That you get there by using the least means and you maximize a dirty term. Expediency cannot justify intervention against individual liberty. Very interesting issue and very accurate. Very up to date issue. Right? Uh, uh, uh, just, uh, think about, uh, uh, mine, the lava, right? This is exactly the problem after nine 11, right? How much of we can act against individual liberty in the name of expedience, right? How much we are willing to accept the limitations, individual liberty and a bell of Evo. See he said, expediency is not to be ignored, but, uh, um, Ben, the chips come down. He said, it is individual liberty. He's a libertarian, right? He is for the sanctity of the liberty of the individual. And he's the ultimate of British individualism, right.

Speaker 1:          38:59          And the sacredness of British individual, isn't it? And finally, the third major contribution, he said, the most legal situation resembles those of slaves. The are only verse off that slave side. And he argues that in a very articulate today, and you know, women should heavy for rights in jobs in public life. Uh, the same kind of education, total confrontation. We drove up close. So, um, uh, but he believes that in marriage, the Gan create a friendship bond with males. Well, Harriet treatment did not quite agree with this door. She married twice. Uh, she boasts times did it probably reluctantly she did not believe in the institution of the marriage though she did Mary Rice. Okay. Uh, well let me see whether I can still do this. Um, his, uh, staff on utilitarianism and leave the rest for, uh, uh, Jersey. I think I have some three more minutes to go.

Speaker 1:          40:08          The teams in the work, utilitarianism is the concept of higher happiness and human beings have faculties for more elevated, right. Um, uh, advertise that animals have. Then he talks about justice and legality. It's a very complex issue, but he's thinks that the law is a more restrictive notes and then justice and he stands for the idea of justice, uh, uh, and show some contradiction between law and justice as such. And then he talks about justice and expediency, why justice cannot be simply explained by expediency. Uh, well, uh, again, something, it's speaks from very much through the issues which is on our mind. Just expediency makes it just that you Kocher and l bladder or a business owner or a suspected their quad a prisoner to get information out because this way you save lives. I, some people will say yes, this makes it just others who say, no, it is unjust and therefore expedience.

Speaker 1:          41:25          You should not use expediency that you, that you get better information out, uh, from, from Doris. Sure. Well, I think I probably leave it here and then you continue with them. Uh, uh, uh, uh, Tuesday and I hope it got you up in speed. Right. Um, um, uh, usually Italian is my John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith's. And you see how actually, um, uh, uh, John Stuart meal and utilitarianism radicalizes one stream of thought of each. He is in Adam Smith's, but Adam Smith is not quite ready to go as far as Benton then. And even not as far as just your meal, Matt. Okay.
