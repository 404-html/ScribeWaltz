Speaker 1:          00:01          So today Vivia we'll be talking about the German ideology and Mark's becoming a historical materialist. Um, I just wanted to make a couple of more comments about the thesis on the fire of our marks is on the edge moving away from naturalism or to historical materialism or, um, but uh, the emphasis and the thesis on fiber is not so much on materialism, but it is much more on a praxis. Uh, action change. The lack of determination marks as I materialist is usually seen as a determinist. And if you took other courses where march was, march was stashed upon, you were probably told marks is a determinist economic determinist and there's a lot of to it, but half truths and he's struggling in the dcis on fire. But, um, as I said, he's on his way from naturalism to materialism. And the central idea is, as I said, Baxis human practices.

Speaker 1:          01:35          And that's why I put down on the slides that it is a kind of dialectical about Mark's represents in the thesis on fire back now might seem self very rarely used the term dialectic. God. Uh, he had a clear enough mind to be suspicious about the word dialectics, a valance at an old age. He wrote a letter to angles and he said, uh, you know, Frederick, what that I don't know what something. Then I say it is dialectical, right? So the I on insulin, you couldn't really find out what the relationship between two phenomena is. Then you say, well this is the car. Well, it's a bit too simplistic. Don't derm dialectical as I am sure you all know, go, go back to Greek philosophy. But even in Greek philosophy, the idea of dialectics was emphasizing change and the process, a theme as Greek philosopher once said, and that jazz to capture the essence of dialectics, you cannot in the same river twice because if you step in the river five minutes later, that is not quite the same liver because the water is gone.

Speaker 1:          03:11          This is a different water, right? So the dialectics means that the word is in flux is in change. That's I think one important idea. Dialectics. And in the thesis on Feuerbach, Marx emphasizes right that we are changing the world now they're just taking it right in this sense he is dialectical and this is why he still has this materialism. And the tournament is there is another, um, uh, um, more contemporary adaptation of the word dialectics, which comes from Garel Kagel. And Mark's again was shying away to use it very often, but his friend Frederick Engels use it. He even said that it's a dialectical materialism and me, the distinction between historical and dialectical materialism. Now, what was dialectics in Hagar? He got us trying to capturing the process of change right? Already in Greek philosophy, the dialect auditions emphasized that if you are looking at the verb, this is not a picture, it is a movie, right?

Speaker 1:          04:34          And every minute you see something different, now he go try to come to terms with what is the essence of this change and this essence of these change. He was looking at contradictions, contradictions, drive the change. So he got made a big distinction between these, these entities is and synthesis. So the change, what dialectics captures normally in social life, it starts with the thesis, right? An actual conditions and entities is which is the negation of their situation and then it leads to a synthesis, which is the negation of the negation, right? In some ways the original condition is reconstituted but in a different way as Hagar put it, reserving good by abolishing yet right. That's the he'd Guardian inside what actually was a, this kind of logic was a attractive to marks and a Marxist. Anyways, so this is dialectical and marks from dialectical, from the philosophy of practices where praxis is the crucial eventually move stove arts and more clearly the terministic positivistic social science in which you have a very clear idea of what is the key because, and the concept Vance's right. Uh, doing very much but positive is social science is doing today identifying the dependent variable and independent variable to come up with a hypotheses, how the dependent variable veal cause variation in the independent variable of your cost variation in the dependent variable and then to describe it, that is very much the mature marks.

Speaker 1:          06:50          And because march was moving into, uh, today, Viveo call it normal science, he becomes a real scientist. Evolves is becoming so much of a scientist that that volume point, he began to a doubt that is much sense to make a distinction between social sciences and sciences. He himself began to see himself as the Darvin of social sciences. You've are so much attracted with scientific reasoning, delete marks the second mark. So maybe we'll start talking about that. He actually fought a vile consider to dedicate the book capital to Charles Darvey because he saw himself as doing for human history. But Mark's did to the evolution of the species. He wanted to do an evolution of human societies. Now, luckily for Marx, he did not do that, right? He did not become a social Darwinist. Right. He resisted that temptation, but he was stemmed it. Okay. I just want to go back very briefly to, uh, to thesis on fire bath because they are very important, right?

Speaker 1:          08:23          And this is the idea, right? He is now criticizing cried Feuerbach. And the problem with fire back, he said that foyer Feuerbach and other people who've are materialists before him, right? They thought that there are the things outside their objective decks, the are outside of the subject. This creates and knowledge about these object. He crawled that Gig and stomped object and the knowledge is nothing else but a reflection in human mind of the object outside that this is a very typical theory of truth, right? Uh, very vitally share today and probably our theory of tools, but many of you in this room share right then is your knowledge accurate? You think about your mind as a mirror. If the image of the object or the objective world outside is accurately reflected in the mirror of your mind, then you got it right. So what we try to do is to have the most perfect mirror in our mind and capture the objective reality as precisely as much in detail as possible.

Speaker 1:          10:02          Well, mark says, this is simply a ref, uh, uh, you know, reflection and this should go beyond that, right? He said, what is good about what Feuerbach dead or what is good about a phone, for instance, what Hmong desk cured did. These were the two people we discussed so far over clearly, you know, um, material it slammed me and hops was pretty much and materialist as well, right? Believing that this is sort of biological conditions, did you dive us and makes us what we are? So they all start the throne sensuousness right? That the, the reality is something what we can get that through our senses, right? We smelly it to be touchy to see it. And unless we touched it, we see it, we smell it, we doubt read that it exists. Right? There's the difference, right? Between materialists and idealist ideas. You don't get through your senses, right?

Speaker 1:          11:14          Uh, you get it through your mind, but he said, this is, these materialism is censures only in the sense of contemplation. The object is outside of the subject and you get a grasp of it through your senses. And he said, well, but what I am suggesting in my new approach is sensors or, right, but a census, human activity and activity as such. I mentioned very briefly that this last lecture, let me just may come back to this point again. This is what you're going to harbor mass. Um, the, uh, arguably the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. Well, he's still alive, but you may, you know, the 21st century has a long way to go to the side. Oh, the will be the greatest philosopher, but many things that you're going to, harbor mass was the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. He said, well, yes, uh, uh, mice in the thesis on fire Bar is right hip.

Speaker 1:          12:29          At one point. I mean, hubber must had his culture turn moved away from materialism, but in most of his life, he said, I am a material list because I also believe that the ultimate reality has to come through sensors, experiences through the senses. Right? But he said, Mark's literature on the mature marks became reductionist because the sensors activity, he identified the, the economy, right? We production the economic activities. And he said in the thesis on fire, but he got it right. Oh, sensors activity our material. So therefore he says, let us not simply limit our analysis to production, but let's look at human interaction then the interact with each other. And this is also as sensors activity, right? So he creates peace between Zygmunt Fried and Karl Marx. Many people try to do that right now. This is not an opposition that it is either production or your sexual drives.

Speaker 1:          13:54          You know, you're a sexual drives. Your sexual interaction with others is very much sensors. Right? It's actually more sensors than doing a job. Right. Then, you know, being in a Mac Donald's and serving hamburgers, that sensors activity, but or, right. You know, sexually introduction is very much sensors. That's a harbor must point and marks in the thesis on fire, but opens this book possibility up. It's a very open argument. Okay. Uh, this is actually one of the reasons why he does not publish it. It's still vague. He wanted to be more precise. And then he wanted to go, he was reading Adam Smith and Ricardo and spent all of his time in the British library, these economists and she volunteers to be bang, bring it back down to earth to echo the economy and economic interest. And now let me start to this because I think that's very important.

Speaker 1:          15:06          The theory of truths. And I want you to think about it. I think this is very interesting. So what is true and to be very simplistic, right? You have two competing theories of truths. One theory of choose, but I think most of you have in your mind is the kind of reflection theory of truths that our mind is a mirror more accurately. It reflects the objective reality out there. Uh, more chew the knowledge. What we have in our mind is, um, marks in the thesis on fire bar says not. So the choose is a practical question. The problem with the reflection theory of choose is that it is positive list and it is. Eliana did I throw in another word coined by a major Marxist philosopher of the 20th century gorilla glue couch. He guarded. This is re fied consciousness re fied. You know, Lucas was writing in German and in German he used the term fair Dingley Hoang they ink means to thing.

Speaker 1:          16:42          I think ratification is a very good translation. Only those of us who speak English about Dumas speak Latin don't necessarily require get it right. [inaudible] in Latin means the think ray fication is the process in which return stuff, but she's what is not a thing into an objective. Think it's a kind of fright look Kashian reinterpretation of Mark's notion of alienation. Mark Stern, right in German for a vacation was and three [inaudible] framed. That means, uh, alien, right? So alienation is a good translation, right? You are alienated if you feel alien, if you'll feel homeless in this world. Now I think, but look, uh, look, arch has an interesting idea, right? That the essence of alienation is when we're beginning to see the world. But actually we created the work. It worked, this out creation. I this as this objective world via rules. We do not see ourself as the masters of the world, but we see ourselves as ruled by the verdict, right?

Speaker 1:          18:07          And this is the ray five consciousness. When we beginning to see the objective reality, we cannot do anything about it, right? And the essence is the philosophy of practices of the young Marx ending with the thesis on fire. But the point is to change it. The point is to change the world. So, uh, in contemporary, uh, this course, we usually call this positivism, right? Positivists are those social scientists who think that our objective facts out of there and the purpose of social investigation is to establish the most objectively and most concretely what those objective social facts are. You are an economist. You describe the objective facts, right? You say, Val, you have to maximize profit because if you do not maximize profit, then you will be vived out of business, right? This is almost like the force of nature. Again, if I can recall, uh, uh, yarrow glow catch, he coined these wonderful term, second nature, right?

Speaker 1:          19:35          That's the beginning to think about social life as if it were natural, as if it would have the power of nature. The economic laws look like lightening, you know, like, you know, this forced really like earth scrapes you. We can't do virtually nothing about earthquake. I, if we can predict what we can't predict, we just can't get into our car and get out of it, right? But even we cannot really predict earthquakes. That's one of the problems, right? Well, now we can predict when a hurricane is coming, what can we do? You get in the car and get out of there where the hurricane and we are calm now, you know, uh, the point is that positive is, does posts, it's social phenomena as if they had the force of nature. And that's what [inaudible] called the coronate, the social of word, as if it were second nature.

Speaker 1:          20:42          As if had the force of nature. They said, this is all wrong because this is the road. What we created this should the rule it all right? That's the idea to overcome Aliya nation to become the master of your fate, right? To be able, right, to change the objective conditions. And you know, in the German ideology marks puts it very, very powerful. It's, I will say it is almost the last word, but in this debate he sat bosses sad. I don't think anybody really improved on it. He said, well, humans change their conditions, but we were born under certain certain conditions and we can only change the conditions we were born into. Right? So it's an interesting interaction between, yes, I mean the county to do anything, right, because we were born into conditions, but we seen some limits. We can change those conditions by the vase, not all that different from hops, right?

Speaker 1:          21:51          And voluntary action. The theory of voluntary action. There is a similarity here. Now I finish this and get on to the, uh, German ideology that that is one thing, but I cannot leave out, uh, uh, I think too insightful and important to leave it out. So let me come back to the subject and object shoe, right? What I've suggested. It is so extremely important, not only for marks but for the whole critical theory and the in fact a four NT positivism of all sorts in the 20th and 21st century. Uh, I mentioned for instance, cultural theory, which is very strongly anti positivist, right and rejects social science as normal science. So what we have is right, uh, subject and that is you, right? The, the person who has a consciousness and

Speaker 2:          22:58          okay

Speaker 1:          22:59          is a cognitive south. A subject is involved in cognitive activity, creating knowledge and then that are objects about which be create a march,

Speaker 2:          23:13          uh,

Speaker 1:          23:15          ref lecture on theory of, to sad that this is a mirror and if the objects are accurately,

Speaker 2:          23:23          um, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          23:26          described in the mirror of our mind, that is true. This is the whole test of having verification of hypotheses, right? I develop a hypotheses, then I go there and test it on the social reality and if it is matches, then it is verified. I got through right now the philosophy of breath. She says the tools is not simply a reflection is an introduction between subject and object. That's about through cities. And that is this a wonderful, a few Lasha for not that easy to read. Uh, but still I think Vonda flew mind. His name is Adora. No,

Speaker 1:          24:30          I don't know. Belonged to the Frankfurt school and was active mainly in the 1940s and sixties there. Theism sixties and Bella, he formulated the soul power fully. [inaudible] sad what is true. He said, the truth is the force field between subject and object are not simply a reflection of the object, but it is between the tension of subject and object. Right? I think this is beautiful. The darn right. It is in the force field of subject and object. Uh, so, uh, let me also add one more point and then we can move away, uh, the theory of truth. But I want you guys to think about what East Jews, right? Ben, can you say an idea is true? In fact, Adorno at one point says about Nazis, man, you know, he, he said experiencing, he was Jewish. Shan's Manny off his family, killed right by the Nazis. And he said, the reality [inaudible] reality is so measurable that it does not deserve to be called true. You see the point,

Speaker 1:          26:05          you also say that occasionally when you say something horrible and you can say no, that cannot be true, right? This is exactly our door. Most point, these can be so miserable that you say it cannot be true. And the idea is that the are sure miserable that you are completely bow or less nervous about this nature like forces do. It is unacceptable, right? You should be able to do something about it, right? They should have been able to do something about Auschwitz and they could not do anything about it. And that's what our door, no sad. These are reality was such that it should not be called true. It cannot be throughs. You see what it is getting a very final point about this theory of truth and this is through another guy, Karl Mannheim.

Speaker 2:          27:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:17          This is very much along these line. He was very much not a Marxist. It was a conservative philosopher. Uh, his major work was done in England. Um, and Manheim once said, the truth is not being the truth is becoming

Speaker 2:          27:40          Bingo. Right?

Speaker 1:          27:42          Wonderful reports, right? The juice is not simply that you describe how things are, you really know about. The truth is when you know what it can be and what you can do about it, the real purpose of cognition is, is not simply to describe the word, but to change it, right? To make it a better world. That's when you have real truths, when you know how to make the world better, right? So the truth is not being but becoming. And that's the philosophy of practices. But I think that's where Mark's is, um, in, uh, uh, uh, writing that these are some fire buff and that's what he is moving away from when he, uh, beginning carite the German ideology,

Speaker 2:          28:40          uh,

Speaker 1:          28:41          what is he writing together, which read Frederick Engels, uh, and now you see he has to abandon, he, he cannot publish the book, the thesis on fire because it is too voluntaristic. Right? He abandoned the Paris manuscript because it was fluffy, right? Nobody would believe me that the revolution Viacom because the proletariat is alienated. And then when he finished, I think this, I mean, not all 11 sentences are great, but some of those sentences are really great sentences. He wrote it down and he never published it because he said, well, this is still voluntary stick, right? I have to come up with a more curative, which we approved the Paul that the level of [inaudible] meal come capitalism has to fall. It is not only a question whether we decide to change it or we don't have to change it, right? I have to come up with a theory which we approve that capitalism will have to fall, right?

Speaker 1:          29:50          That's what puts him into the deterministic mode. He actually never becomes real in deterministic. It's uh, uh, a very simplistic reading of Marx. You know, after all this guy is a theorist of the revolution, he sold that revolutionary idea should be put into people's head. Hit this idea. I did not think that ideas do not matter if he would have believe ideas do not match her. He will not have spent, you know, all of his Sam eight in the morning, nine until 9:00 PM in the British library. And writing books, right? If ideas do not match her, if I do, you write down ideas because he believed that ideas for change the world, right? So he was never completely a deterministic. But in the nature of divert, he's moving Dover's economic determinism. And the reason is that now he wants to blue that capitalism. Yes, it had great achievement.

Speaker 1:          30:51          If during the time of capitalism society developed more than ever before, uh, capitalism, but nevertheless it, you'll have to come an end. Capitalism, they are not last forever and now he has to prove that these, that it must come to an end. So that puts him on a deterministic trajectory. That's what makes him, he has to become, he has to accept materialism, that material conditions, that term mine, human action and consciousness. So that's what he does. He, they are beginning to develop in the German ideology. And this is the structure of the book. The first ship that is a critique on fire. Uh, Dave's on from the thesis on fire back, but by tens the argument and becomes strictly materialist and gets out of these voluntary stick element. He has some introductory remarks, him about critique of idealism and the premises of the new materialism he is proposing now, but he's beginning to call him now.

Speaker 1:          32:04          He's StoryCorps materialism stays away from the word dialectic the car and then he develops thrive and material. His conception of history and historical development. Uh, he replaces Adam Smith's categorization of societies as hunting, gathering, um, uh, grazing agriculture or commercial. But I knew type ology these new type Ology of you will be the type Ology of the modes of production. Uh, not in fact in the ideology. He stays pretty close to Adam Smith's cyber. Your point, the south, and this is one of his problems. This is one of the reasons by the German ideology was also left unfinished and unpublished. Right as I, as I indicated it was first published and not the complete text, only in 1903, well after the death of Marx and Engels, then he was right. It's about the origins of idealists, conception of history. There it is coming from, uh, he's rights, thinking about the development of productive forces and eventually, uh, this covers the notion of relations of production.

Speaker 1:          33:26          I've you make a big deal out of this because I, I think that's one of the reasons that the German ideology fails that until the very end. He does not know the term of relations of production and he, uh, he runs into some very big problems and then he dies on lunar bower and Mexico in there. These are young here. Galleons people usually don't read these chapters and volume two, I mean, you must be a Marx Marx expert to read this. This is reality. Basically irrelevant. Not Very interesting. Okay. What are the major themes in the German ideology? First he offers a materialist view of history. Then he offers a theory of modes of production. Then he beginning to develop forces of production. Um, and initially division of Labor. And this is a problem. This is very much Adam Smith. She's still very strongly on under Adam Smith and understands the evolution of society as the evolution of division of Labor.

Speaker 1:          34:37          And then he describes, uh, ties to describe the forces of production and division of Labor, uh, more so production and describes subsect fan most of production and give her view about how human history and then he develops. But I would call, he's the first who creates a sociology Maraloge, how to study sociological. He's socially how you can understand conscience who human consciousness. Okay. So the materials view of history. And now here you can see marks the positivist social scientists speaking and in mice is the first of positive is social scientist rigorous positive is scientists. And what he's describes here will be subscribed and accepted. Most of the positive is stipes in your political science or sociology or economics or psychology departments, right? This at the premises from which we begin with are not arbitrary once now dogmas about real Ramesses from which abstractions can only be made in the imagination.

Speaker 1:          35:55          So you start from the objective conditions and then you speculate from this. So what we start our, our real individuals and the activities of these individual actual activities of these individuals. Um, and then he moves what most, a little Ford, their, their conditions of life both for the find already existing. And those were the produce by that activities, right? So he said, German philosophers there send it from uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, the heaven to earth. Now the artists sending from Earth to have her right, you do not deduction. We do induction. This is the inductive method. What we use. And if you add a positivist, Uva, love it. You see, this is real serious science, right? Looking at facts. And then he said, well, ideas have no history, no development man developing the material conditions and their material intercourse, uh, uh, altered their thinking.

Speaker 1:          37:09          So it is really our material existence, which has a history and ideas reflect doors, material conditions. Then then he beginnings to develop the theory of most of production. He said, well man can distinguish from animals in different ways. But most important is that we produce that we change the environment in a purposeful manner, right? That he had an image, how to change the physical environment for us and what lecturey actually mattress is not simply what we produce. And this is a very important idea, but the mood of production, how the produce, how the Yankee gauge each other. Because this will change in history since not simply what we produce. You know, this is a revolutionary idea. Again, this is completely new. In March, before Numarx you went into a museum and the museum was about great people, right? These were kings and Queens and genitals and boobs, whose pictures for presented that, and this is the way how history was described.

Speaker 1:          38:26          Now you go into a historian, now you can see this is the living room, how people lived in a Roman times, and this is the way how they ate. This is the way how they cooked. And these are the instrument by which they produce the stuff, what they cooked in the kitchen. All right, this is how a modern historical museum look slide. And this comes, this is really a revolution from March. History is not the history of great ideas and great man or great the men history is the idea of the actual they, how people lived and produced and reproduced their, uh, ideas. Now he said, well, we can distinguish therefore a differences between nature, how the productive forces and he means by technology is developing and how he uses initially the term the Inter intercourse internal interest course is changing. And by this here, the first two division of labor, that is Smithian idea of Adam Smith's idea, right?

Speaker 1:          39:35          That history of wolves, of greater division of Labor. They will see in Emil Durkheim also the central idea. You can see the evolution of society by increasing division of Labor. Um, and then he cries to come up with subsequent he molds of production. Now he said, now I actually can discard the history as different types of mood of protocol production. Uh, moving from elementary forms. So most elementary form is tribal society in tribal society that the technology is very simple and that is very little division of labor. He is sexist enough to say there is a natural division of labor between man and a man. Man, go hunting and women go collecting goods in the forest and that he calls natural. This is of course a sexist proposition. Loud, you know, he was writing, it's, you know, in 1845, uh, was not the only man who was sexist.

Speaker 1:          40:44          Now the second four ms, he said, ancient communal or state proper, the antiquity. Now you have development of forces of production and in fact you have a separation of ownership and greater division of Labor that now people can produce more than necessarily for their survival. Therefore there will be slaves who were working day and night and there there'll be philosophers who sit in Athens and Rome and have great ideas, right? They caused the slaves producer stuff, what they can eat and they can enjoy. So the division of Labor evolves and then the cure. Now we have the evolution of few dollars. Well, slaves, you're a great producing, cheap bog. The problem with sleeves that they did not have Nazi Shin Incentive to use a very complicated technology. You had to supervise them very closely because they really hated your guts. And if they could, they didn't break right?

Speaker 1:          41:49          The instruments, if they could. So he will did not want to give them complex technologies. Saw you invent, served on, you say, you know, why don't you become a surf rather than a slave. You can have your house and I give you a piece of land and if you behave yourself two days, you were on my ass stage. Right? And you produce stuff for me and I let you to spend the rest of the week producing for yourself. But the big problem is that the evolution of few dollars, the fall of Rome and Greece, um, and uh, you know, rise of Sharla mine. Yeah. And you know, the dark and Middle Ages, the division of labor, the not have a law that was last division of Labor in the 11th century, 12th century than it was in the first and second century. So the methodology breaks down. She was in deep trouble and as you can see, you can either text, he leaves after this, the page blank, he said, I'm in trouble, right?

Speaker 1:          42:59          I have to start this all over again. And he starts all over again and tries to come off. It's something better now. Sociology of knowledge, very important contribution. This is on the fortunately completely wrong. What you say, but the methodology is extremely important and informed people who were studying cognition and knowledge ever since. And he makes these very important a suggestion.

And the other argument, which I think is desperately wrong, uh, but very insightful ruling class, uh, all of us, uh, debtor, your ruling guardians of each epoch now live debtor minds consciousness and this is a kind of the essence right of materialism, right? Definite individuals who are productive, reactive in definite way, m curled into definite social and political relationships. The production of ideas is the first directly interwoven with material activity and the material intercourse of men.

Indeed, we know that is a strong class component. For instance, in voting behavior, not so much in the United States because in the United States, if you are poor, you usually do not. Whoa. Right? And therefore, you know, the Democratic Party's kind of scrambling to get a little working class road or a restyle scaring, right? The middleclass of a for voting them as a big traditional trouble of the Democratic Party. But if you look at Europe or you look at Australia, the Australian Labor Party was getting righteous shortage, you know, very keen classroom. So tell me, you were what right. He will cast position is, and either you're Kelly, you how you reward in the next elections.

Speaker 1:          45:29          As I said in the U s doesn't work, but it doesn't work in Sweden. He did work in England for a long time. It by enlarge worked in Australia. Right? If you are, to some extent even works in the United States where there are some very rich people who are Democrats, but typically those guys who are very rich, don't, they tend to be Republican, right? I think they probably do. All right. So, I mean that, yeah, this is what Mars is like Yeti. And yeah, try to tell me, you know, what your material interests are. And then I tell you what is on your mind. The reductionist, again, Vivio read Zigman Fried. He said, well, true, but this is not only economic interests. There are me, the history of your sex life. And I tell you what is on your mind, right? Uh, you know, it's analogous argument, right?

Speaker 1:          46:28          It is existence, which determines consciousness, right? Most of them said, well, it's not necessarily true that what you is in your mind. True. But I know that it is coming from right. You are, you've earned in Lovick your mother, right? And we have, if you were a man and your soup last or your desire for your mother, and that's where you have, you are these false ideas in your mind, right? Well, you look good. You have a shy girl and he would allow him factor. You could not food field these lava. So press your desire and you have all these strange ideas that that's why you are neurotic. Right? And I can tell you right. That's the way how it Marcel are you, it sort of, you know, this is also reduction in spite of it, but that is a common interesting idea.

Not speaking about, through to affirmative action, right? Well, of course, Vr in a liberal university, few people dare to speak up against affirmative action, but you know, I'm all may have EITs, males, well that is usually less articulation, right?

Your interest for your ideas. That's the idea. I think this is a very important idea, right? Put in a simplistic way. And that comes to the idea that the ruling class, um, uh, is, uh, really producing the ruling ideas bell. Not quite true, but that is an element of truth street, right? There is an ideological hegemony and, okay. Um, that's about it for today. Thank you.
