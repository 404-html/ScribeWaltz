Speaker 1:          00:02          Good morning. Yeah. I want to do what I did it last time around the test just to walk very quickly through the test questions and a sort of test myself. How would I respond to them? Uh, uh, there's a lot for today to cover, so I'm Ivo rush. Um, uh, oh, let me just one more time emphasize, uh, uh, you have plenty of time to do that, right? I have a discussion section at seven, so I don't want to reach the, something is going on their own with the Internet. So I will post this before my discussion section, uh, before seven. Exactly. Then I don't know, I mean I have these anxieties hops was talking about and therefore I don't want, I, I prefer to be five minutes early rather than being an hour late. Right. So some, sometimes before seven UVF find it. Then you have to send you around set around nine o'clock.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Uh, if, uh, uh, you know, some of you communicated that you need another time because you are a already engagements, uh, um, uh, it is all of us, you have to vary the south beach. You're a discussion section leader, right? Um, and your discussion section leader of yours take care of you or your needs. Um, uh, and we be brief, right? Sort of the two questions should be about more like four to six, um, a double space that babies that had did and much longer, I mean, maybe like Sept Eight, so we are not, you will not be penalized if you are longer, but the point is not to be long, but to, to be, to be crispy. And again, the point is, you know, you know, you try to show, uh, the different views of the auteurs and then comment on it further, which is more sense of law, right?

Speaker 1:          02:10          And I toured that you're the cure that have had paper goes this way. You spend a turd presenting run water after about an opponent of that altar, and then, uh, your reflections on it, right? That's about it. So let me then rush through. This is not an easy question, right? Marx theory are fairly young nation Nicha or fried theory or from a civilization. I mean, that is a common feature right? Between the three orchard. Uh, um, uh, the city or the ask to create a controversy between the two. Right? You can be too. Um, usually, um, the common featured is that they are all concerned about modernity and people's sense of being lost and being result control in modernity and the problem of modernity that we are too much control and the control is increasingly inside us that, uh, then outside and coercive. Right? I think that's the common feeling.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Uh, uh, I think I made, uh, this point, uh, uh, in, in the lecture, um, if you read a 20th century literature, particularly first half, you find these feeling expressed by a lot of novelists. You read Franz Kafka, right? Uh, uh, you, you read the Albert Kami, that's where you get that same feeling expressed, uh, to what Mark Snitcher and fried artists bonding too. But there are big differences, right? Uh, Mark's, uh, tries to move away from Hagar and wants to come down to earth and offer a theory of value our nation, which is rooted in the economy, in, into the production process. And Marx has a view of what emancipate that society VOB and he even has a historic agent will get us there. Uh, to emancipation, the proletariat, uh, now nutri is about it different. I, the genealogical matter does not really offer you the right solution, right?

Speaker 1:          04:33          The genealogical method a orally shores you about his unique, uh, uh, in modernity and modern morality in the Judeo Christian morality, but you think is so attractive and so mobile and he shows, right? Um, how, right in the workshop that ideas are produced, it's actually torture and the pressure and what operates right. So that is no a good society and no agent who will get you there, right? You have to do it by yourself. Now fry, there's all sorts is civilization, um, as a coming from repression of sexual drives and I saw a years and a critique of civilization, right? Um, but at the same time, pride has these dual attitude about civilization, right? A civilization is coming from repression, but it is still sublimation and the most beautiful things in human society. The Art and science are coming from the sublimation. And he is also reflecting, he's writing in 1932 the rise of Nazism and NT Wright civilization.

Speaker 1:          05:55          And he does not want to support that. Right? So in a way you, no one can say that. What he does not have, he does not offer you, um, uh, uh, division of, with society to some extent. He is with Nicha. He said you have to emancipate yourself. You have to figure it out for yourself, but your problem is, uh, uh, and he does certainly does not fit the head of our historic agent. Like mark says. Anyway, this is the bay, Hawaii would be dealing with this and I've got Vietnam there. You have what my opinion is. I want to hear your opinion about them. Okay. The second question, uh, that's not, uh, not easy either. Practical theory of to send nature genealogical method there, there is again, a common Emela LMN between marks and Nicha. Neither of them believes Ian. Objective, abstract throughs, right? Um, uh, mark says there is no objective abstract tools.

Speaker 1:          06:57          Uh, truth is like practical question throughs is being achieved by the end by human practices, right? Uh, and Nichelle, of course, does not believing in objective truths, right? Uh, he's trying to find truth, but truth is being accomplished by comparing, you know, different notions of mortality and to show that in comparison with each other, most heavies, upsides and downsides, right? So that is, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, he by the very nature, don't misunderstand him. He is not a knee healist. He doesn't, he does not see everything goes Nikki elitism or is, is, is a very negative term for nature. So he does not want to say that is no two said, oh, he said, truth is just relative and you can arrive at critical understanding of your situation by comparing your situation with, with an order bomb. That is of course, a very fundamental different, again, between a marks.

Speaker 1:          08:06          I'm a niche here because what is this practical truths? These are human activities. And Mark's basically arrives at this human activities, uh, uh, thrill changing the physical words through the system of production. And again, he has the agent who is a, uh, this is the revolution and the practices of the product diarrhea, which really get you to the truth. That is nothing like that in nature, right? Nature does not have a history. Got Adrian and does not have the society, uh, where after or, uh, uh, or uveal yet to through society. Well, this is actually a very simple question. Can't, you know, many of you did not like it. So I'm, you know, I'm thinking very hard that had to put it on. It's a bit narrow, but very simple. Um, a German ideology under good. Andre's a very simple, there are two unique features in the German ideology.

Speaker 1:          09:09          One is when he def, he does develop the notion of mode of production for the first time in this book, 45, uh, 1845, but he does identify the nature of, uh, uh, uh, uh, mode of production, primarily by division of Labor. And this doesn't serve him very valid because the division of labor does not capture the conflictuous relationships between classes, which eventually will have to lead to revolution. So he abandoned since it does not finish the book because only at the very end of the book does he realize that uh, uh, the two component of a mode of production as a forces of production technology and the relations of production and the relations of production, uh, for most of the German ideology is division of Labor. And then he realized his, no, no, no, it is not division of labor, but a [inaudible] relations, the relationship between those who have property and those who do not have property.

Speaker 1:          10:17          Um, and he also has a very deterministic view of history in the German ideology. All societies have to go through the same modes of production. Um, dry bullyism slave mode of production, a few dollars, man capitalism, uh, in the ground he said that are two big innovations. Now the center is property relations. Uh, he studied the beak of history. If capita is van, the producer is separated from the means of production completely. Um, and he breaks from the, uh, a deterministic view of history. Right now he has, he, these Marty linner development of history. Not every society has to come through slavery. And feudalism, the Asiatic societies in a glares, I communal society can move directly into capitalism. Okay. So that's basically a very simple question. I probably did a very bad job in the lecture that this did not become clear. A set form. Mark's is a historical materialist and compare him with Frye.

Speaker 1:          11:34          Now, uh, I actually am inspired here by, uh, Juergen Habermas and you're going, Habermas says there are marks in the thesis on fire Buck. Got It. Right. Then he said that the real point of departure is sensors, human activity. Uh, at time then harbor moss was writing this. She was still a material is then he had his culture. Turnon is probably not a material is standing wrong. He said, materialism is, if you point of departure is what you can get through your senses, not through your ideas. But he said, Mark's made a mistake. Uh, namely that he reduced census human activities to the economy, um, and to production. And there are, he said a fried is more interesting because he has a different kind of sensors, human activity and this is census, human activities between people, right? Sexual relationships. In fact, harbor must makes it more complicated.

Speaker 1:          12:36          You know, it's, I don't want to get into harbor mass, but he's interpretation of Fridays at fried is also starts from sensors. Human activity to understand what is in people's mind. But it is not economic reductionism. If anything it is sexual. Uh, uh, reduction is man, it is a ban erotic explanation of history, but in some ways, you know, they all stars for sensors, human activities in explaining what can it be in people's mind. What is our ideas though? The starting point is material sensors experience, right? And the product ad ideas that this is in the sense the are most material is but in different ways. Is that I, I suppose it should be pretty clear now. All right. Okay. Uh, classes, well, you can have different views on this and especially whether in Marx theory of classes are still applicable. You know, Marcy find classes in terms of property relationship.

Speaker 1:          13:42          He had two classes, uh, in the communist manifesto. The bourgeois has the younger proletariat. Uh, the question is, does it still matter and you have to reflect on this. Do you think property relations still is a major antagonistic divided in American society or not? Andy longer. And of course, Marx believed in the communist manifesto. Yes, that is the lower middle class. But it will be that of a middle class of you'll become either bourgeois artwork, it'd become a proletarian. And of course in the United States, the Vista received wisdom is that Vro or middle class are the or middle class. Uh, I would love to hear your view about this. Right? But that's the big question. Clearly marks the it wrong. That's undoubtedly, I think everybody agree. I think Karl Marx, if he wouldn't be alive, he would say, ah, I screwed it. I made a mistake.

Speaker 1:          14:36          Of course, that is a big middle class. Right? Um, so I mean, uh, you don't have, you don't have to really, uh, hate marks. You know that there is a middle class. He believes he made a mistake. Right. Uh, anyway, but you can, you can ask the question, who is the middle class are indeed V or middle class? Is there, is this sensible to talk about the big bourgeoisie that I know, big Buzz Razia any longer. This is people's capitalism. Bolivian as these other questions. I would like you to deal with it. Okay. Labor theory of value and that I'm Smith. I thought this is a very easy question, right? Uh, Adam Smith Sad, uh, that you know, or uh, well value is created by labor, but then he said when it comes to distributing, yeah, uh, uh, Val's so or income, it has to go to labor capital and uh, land.

Speaker 1:          15:31          Uh, Mark's on the other hand set, val, this is contradiction. If all labor goes to a four, value is created by labor, but it should go to labor and therefore it is taken away for labor. Should be understood as exploitation. Is this an advance or is this a misunderstanding? And you can say, well, this is a misunderstanding because a Adam Smith's was right. He said, Oh, labor is, or, or value is created by labor in societies where capital is not accumulated and the land is not privately owned. And therefore this is a consistent argument. Or you can say, well, Mark's actually got a very important point because there is indeed exploitation there. Alex brought to relationships and he does drive history. I mean how you take your position, this is up to you. You have to argue consistently that and the argument of consistent they've, you'll be revived at seven.

Speaker 1:          16:32          Well this is again, a lot of people said don't do it because we have not talked about domination. I probably alleviate because I've, you're talking the, uh, in the next, uh, uh, uh, how much I have got 40 minutes about this, um, uh, domination and of production and world domination is where Protestant ethic cross, he is an ideal is some people think that this is a too narrow question. Then I think you kind of, um, we can, um, uh, ask the question, is this really an Nadia is few, some people said, but vapor is saying that it is, uh, Calvin is in which created a capitalism. Is this his view? What is exactly his view? Uh, um, is, uh, he's uh, is very critical of marks. Um, uh, is, uh, uh, he believes that, you know, Mark's has a simplistic, a materialist explanation. It is consciousness which letter it is existence which determines countries and has that are then the other way around.

Speaker 1:          17:38          Um, is a vapor saying the opposite. It is a consciousness bitch debtor and man's existence or capitalism. And uh, that's, that's what, uh, the Patterson that is trying to do. Uh, and of course he has this interesting notion of elective affinity questions about that that is really a causal relationship between ideas and the economy. And you can labor on this, uh, what he might mean and what you think. This is a cop out, right? That he actually, uh, um, uh, his marks more of a contemporary social theorist because he has a causal explanation. He tries to give scores, I'll explanation and that's what you are taught in political science or economics, but we are social science comes up with causal explanations, right. And Mike VBA shy survey and mark stash to do causal analysis. Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Uh, did I miss [inaudible]? Well, this is very much a very, very similar to the previous question here. Only I ask you to compare the two is mark three yearly, a simple minded economic determinist, the the term minister. It is a existence which debtor and mass consciousness, what is, he has a, has a more complicated view. Is that a contradiction in Mark's right or the philosophy of Praxis, that yard making history. He also makes that claim. How does it fit? That's just simply contradict himself or is this a consistent ideology and you know, Labor is, he and I are the of the store. He is not really an idea. This, what does he mean by these elective affinity? And then the final, the final question. I think people seem to be liking this and now the easy by the vape, Mark's clearly has a notion of um, uh, uh, uh, human nature, right?

Speaker 1:          19:37          Mark's beliefs is a real soya and an even more radical than Russo. Ian Theory of human nature, especially in his theory, uh, of, uh, alienation, right? We are good. And the problem comes as society, uh, makes us alienated. But I think he goes a little beyond the, uh, uh, Rousseau because he thinks that in the state of nature, we are actually social being social is in our nature, a full ride. Rousseau did not think so. Um, uh, the mobile savage has to be socialized into CVS society. Mice believes that this whole idea of state of nature is an abstraction. We are all born in society and by nature we are social. All of the capital isn't, which makes us competitive. Competitive Bourgeois individuals makes us our short, he saw Straw and egoistic now does vapor has a theory of human nature. It's a more difficult question to pose. I think if, if I would argue, I would say they [inaudible] last have one. It is closer to hops because he does believe that people are the, the history of human can is a struggle for power. That yeah. Unending struggle for power. And that's, that's why he explained human history with power struggles. That's about it. That's the way how I would do that much shell try to deal with this. I hope this was somewhat helpful.

Speaker 2:          21:14          Uh, and, uh,

Speaker 1:          21:17          makes you relaxed, right? That this will not be a difficult test. Uh, uh, it will be actually a lot of fun to deal with this, uh, intriguing, interesting issues. Okay. Uh, and believe me, id or he wants you to have fun. I,

Speaker 2:          21:36          uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          21:39          I think these are interesting questions. Uh, okay, now we come to labor theory of domination and that's almost impossible, but I'm trying to do now, but we'll try to rush you through. Um, and first of all, if you have to understand VBA theory of action, uh, uh, which, uh, uh, has some similarities to Hoppes, what Hoppes, Yardi or voluntaristic action, uh, but then, uh, we also have to deal with Weber's a notion of rationality. Uh, and then, uh, his distinction between power and domination. Uh, he's sturdy of legitimacy. This is very, very important. Uh, it's, um, uh, one of the most fundamental, uh, concept, uh, in particularly in political theory but also in economics and the in sociology. Um, and finally his Stipe's off authority Viveo deal at great lengths with different types of authority. I just give you a sense of what this is in the next 25 minutes.

Speaker 1:          22:50          Okay. The four types of economic action, he makes a distinction that that question is how can, how are the orienting with each other about motivates us, van Vr interacting with other people. He said where we can act instrumental, the rational, the end. I'd be like spelling it to you, what he means. And then he said, we can or you also act very rash and Molly and again, we all come explain what this means. Uh, in our interaction we can, uh, led by our emotions. And he said, this is well, this is rational. He said, this is not on the rational thing. It, it is not necessarily on rational that we act out of our emotions and ivy will tell you then he thinks this is becoming irrational, acting out of emotion or in our, we can be led by tradition. Now to understand this, that you know, that we actually interact with each other in very different ways over time.

Speaker 1:          23:57          You know, be the same person. We can act occasionally instrumentality or occasionally we can act them a factually right or occasionally we act over somebody because we have a great deal of emotion or feeling love or the hate and occasionally they can act instrumental, right? The use somebody in order to achieve somebody. Can I borrow $20 from you? Right? Then the Act instrumental, uh, but we also can act out of a heat or, or love, right. Um, in a discussion section, I really hate the guts of somebody with all of us speaking right in the discussion section and then I just will contradict because, you know, I just, it is my antagonism or I just sympathize with somebody and therefore I also tend to disagree, basically driven by my emotion. And now I even not talking about love of which combines people. Uh, more. Now what is behind this is Weber's fundamental methodology.

Speaker 1:          25:07          He calls his approach to society. Uh, interpretative sociology. The term interpretative sociology is translated from German. The German term is Featherston. Verstehen means understanding occasionally they also translated into English. That fourth vapor does is understand Weber's strong commitment. Is that social analyst be eaten? Economist be a political scientist. The sociologists be a historian, a be an anthropologist is not two plus value judgements on other, but to try to understand what drives other people don't assume that other people because the egg differently than you would have in that situation, that they are done evil or irrational. Right? This is particularly a debate with economists. Economists tend to have very strong conception that that is one economical, irrational behavior they ever said. No, I mean that are the values stype of this, how we can act and my job is not to say now you've already irrational.

Speaker 1:          26:27          My job is to try to put myself into your position and to understand why you did and why you did do they, how you did it. This is interpretative sociology, right? This is understanding fash there, right? That I am more sure. Naughty tried to put myself into your situation and rather than saying, this is what I will do, Ivs, obviously if I were you right in your situation, would I do the same thing? Why? Why do you do that the way how you do, do assuming that you are not acting irrationally, but try to understand by you, activate you act. Okay. Now let's talk about instrumental irrational acture. This comes through the closest, but, uh, most economists, especially now classical economists regard as rational economic action. He said instantly, mentally, uh, rational actually cross it. Sabec Roseo naughty date. Um, uh, uh, uh, is when the ends and the means, uh, or rationally taken into account and they did right?

Speaker 1:          27:40          This is kind of utility maximization, right? When you utilitarians defined this as the rational way to act, right, that you have, you are striving for happiness and you tried to achieve this happiness. And in this process you maximize utility. You try to reduce the expenses and you try to increase the return on, uh, what you try to achieve. But let me also emphasize that Weber's notion of instrumental rationality does not say that the ends are irrational, right? Uh, and they were very much like John Stuart mill is quiet or via, that's the actually do have preferences and there are some ants. What we find more valuable than other lans. Instrumental rationality only means if in order to achieve this end the is too costly for us, then we probably revealed wolf for our second Beth and answer that there. Then our first [inaudible], right? Uh, so uh, there I would like to date somebody.

Speaker 1:          28:53          Um, uh, I very much would like to date that person, but in order to have a successful date, I have to take this person into a Forbes five star restaurants bell that Bill did dinner will cost me $200. Now there is another person whom I would not mind to date with, you know, my second preference and that would go over it a two star restaurant and would cost me only 50 bucks and therefore, you know, Ivl vate you know, is this my preference for the first day it is so strong that it is verse for me to pay $200 or it's actually not that much stronger. My second preference is actually pretty good and therefore I actually go for the $50 at dinner. You see what I'm getting at? So you are waiting rational, the balls, the ends and the means, and you'll come to a conclusion again, you know, not all that far away from hops, right?

Speaker 1:          29:54          And hops idea, right? Uh, that we are, you know, we do have these drives, we have these appetites and we have these fears and then we arrive at a veal. This is instrumental rationality, but he said people can act value, rationality. And if somebody adds value rationally, I am not willing to call them irrational there you rationality. If somebody says, this value is so important for me that I don't care what is the price, I will have to pay for it. Right? Um, uh, let me give you a very simple example, right? You actually made think that human life is particularly valuable right now. Uh, you or your partner may the expectation get shy and then you will have to make a decision where you give birth to this child or do you have an abortion? Right? And then it can come back to value rationality.

Speaker 1:          30:55          Right? People can say that the life of an onboard shine is so superior for me. They'll do. I know it is a very crazy stuff for me to have a child or my partner to have a child right now, I will do it, you know, because I am active value rationally. I know it is instrumental, irrational, right? I may have to create cool school, you know, in order to earn an income or to take care of the baby or something. And I actually screwing my life. But I don't mind. I because I have such a strong value commitment. You see what I'm getting at? And you cannot say this is irrational behavior, right? This is rational behavior because people has a commitment to an alternate value. And these ultimate value occasionally is so high that you are sacrificing your economic interests. And occasionally you sacrifice your life.

Speaker 1:          31:49          You are willing to die for noble causes, right? And you do it right. Um, uh, um, uh, uh, rationally you vague but you low that uveal die. And if you know that you'd be a die for these noble course, one cannot say that you are acting irrationally, uh, uh, factual orientation affect [inaudible] mean that you are led by emotions. You said it can be on the border line because if it is simply an uncontrolled reaction to a situation, then it is irrational, right? If you simply acting out of anger, then you vote irrational, right? Um, when you are drunk, uh, in that party and you are saying something to your partner and your relationship is breaking up, you'll, you'll actually wanted this relationship to go on. Next morning you wake up and said, my goodness gracious. What have I done? Right? I was dumb. I was irrational.

Speaker 1:          32:51          I was led by emotions. I said, thanks for that should not have said, in this case a motion was irrational. It was, um, an uncontrolled reaction to a stimulation. But otherwise to act out of love and to make sacrifices for love is very rational, right? We do this all the time, right? Your parents do it, you know, they send you to, to Yale and they paid $200,000 to get you a year degree. Right. Bell very well over there that probably they've, you'll never get anything right that back from you, right? They hope they view it. Get some love back from you. What they might or they might not write bots, you know, they act out of love. And you know, some people may say you are crazy why you invest so much to your children. Maybe we'll put you in a home of hell down right when you get old [inaudible] right.

Speaker 1:          33:50          All right. That day. But the answer is, but I love my child and I will upon the best word that my child, right. This is a very not irrational behavior. They'll justify it. That'd be great. These are traditional orientation where you have talk of tradition, right? Um, uh, now some people actually still believe in arranged marriages, right? Uh, certainly if you are Islamic or even if you are an Orthodox Jew, you probably wanted to chip, choose your partner through an arranged marriage, right? You go to the rabbi and the rabbi villa arranged a marriage for you. You are, you have to be pretty orthodox. But there are some words that don't shoot. So do manage Boston should do that. Is it irrational, irrational? Actually, Yvonne can say romantic love is not all that bloody rational. You know, the whole idea that you see somebody fall in love and next day you propose that seems to be pretty shitty thing to do is not, it is much better to go to the rabbi who knows you, who knows your prayer potential partner and arrange the marriage what you anyway, the point is right tradition can guide your action and that's again not irrational.

Speaker 1:          35:04          It is only irrational. It is completely on thinking. That's, I think that's very important to say that not if it is self conscious, you know what you do. I do it because I am a Jew. I am doing yet because I m f fun, you know, because I am at the born Christian and that's what reborn Christians do, right? If you follow this way, you know, then you are acting rationally. What not acting irrationally to put it more now, what is rationality now? I think the key, it's a very complex notion for me and that you can have different interpretation. Now I will give you my interpretation. I think what is importance, right? That the rationality means that you sub substitute on thinking, uh, acceptance of a situation and uh, um, uh, uh, uh, not thought out or uh, spuntinos or the actions do deliberate adaptation.

Speaker 1:          36:11          So when you are conscious about what you are knowing a then you are actually acting rationally ordered, at least you are not acting irrationally. He makes a distinction between rational, which is, uh, giving a great deal of thought and non rational. Where if actually there is still some reflection of warring ground, uh, Schlichter a major, uh, Weber's scholar who knows much more about [inaudible] than I do. Do I have read this book cover to cover a couple of times? Um, uh, I haven't tried order 60 volumes soft faber cover to cover, but have left quite a bit of it anyway. I'm not sure if they'll have read everything more than once. This is his interpretation. He said the question is means and aunts instrumental rationality is the automat rationality because you consider most means and ends. And he said, value rationality is a lower level of rationality because you do not consider a really, um, uh, uh, means annual longer that I'd ans dominate and try the shrine and the factual nationality are more marginal types offered nationality.

Speaker 1:          37:23          Well, um, I would offer you an alternative interpretation. This is my reconstruct and sure enough Yurigan harbor mass, we said Vale, the VBA is emphasizing is what is the level right off your reflectivity. Do you really think about what you are doing? And also to what extent you can communicate to ardors what you are doing. And if you do it this way, you can have reflexivity which is very high. So you think very hard while you are doing and you are over there, but the motivation of your extra knees and you can explain it to a grade due to others if this is, so I think this is really hard by mass there your rationality is the highest level of rationality, right? Because you can really explain your values. Very were instrumental rationality. That is not much to say this is all in the I am making more money this way.

Speaker 1:          38:19          Right? And therefore the level of communication is relatively low door. You'll know very well about you are doing anyway. I just leave it for you don't want to elaborate on this anymore, but the bottom line is for Vba rationality is he has something to do. How conscious you are of what you are doing and how conscious you are of the consequences of your action. You are irrational then you are, you don't know what the consequences of your actions. Now, power and domination a ver makes a fundamental difference between power in German, mocked and domination. And this is a very important citation, right? Power is the probability that an an activist and a social relationship of you'll be in a position to carry out. He's only the oldest spy to resistance. You can resist and never had their last. The person who is in power can force you to do what you want to do.

Speaker 1:          39:24          He said that these actually vet rarely happens in social situations, but typically defined social. What's the situation? Is relationships of domination. That's about he costs, had a shaft. Um, uh, um, uh, don't mean nation. Uh, is the probability that a command VOB obeyed, right? Uh, the difference right between, uh, um, uh, uh, bow the nomination. This is sort of my little like lesion here. Nomination is nothing else but power and legitimacy, right? The people who hold power try to legitly mate, what they do, you know, I was trying to do this in the first 20 minutes. Oh fuck. You know, you have these questions, three sounds and if he got the, I'm not difficult. They are exciting. You know, they, I tried to legitimate myself. This is sensible that you try to answer discretion. You'll learn, you know, you will understand society better. You will understand yourself better if you think about these questions, right?

Speaker 1:          40:32          I was trying to legitimate the process letter then just acting out of, or if by nine o'clock to be or not be here, you've, you'll get an F, right? And then you've, you'll be in big trouble. Rajeev, you'll not get your degree. No, I did not want to legitimate. I try to legitimate what we will be doing this afternoon, right. By the legitimacy saying this. If it would be sensible for you to do, you benefit from it, right? I try to internalize, right? But I want you to do between seven and nine that you will be getting to believe. This is good for me, that I'm doing it. It is fun, right? On the learning and the teaching myself, this is my self development, right? So I was trying to corn verb, right? Power into domination, um, and right. And that is legitimacy. A claim that what I'm doing then I'm asking you a seven clock. You know, not to have a, um, uh, uh, a cocktail. But to sit down in front of your computer and to write a test is good for you, right? And if you internalize it and you're beginning to think how wonderful you know that I can delay the, these, a cocktail for two hours, right? Then I achieved, then I, you know, then it was domination rather than power. Right? Is that clear?

Speaker 1:          42:01          Now what is legitimacy? This is a very tricky question. Under the veil. I have my own view. Many people will then mentally disagree with to me. Uh, he said, and that's very important. Every January one, form of domination implies a minimum of voluntary compliance. That is an interest in obedience, right? Uh, unless I could persuade you that you will feel, they'll, um, uh, I actually, uh, uh, could, you know, I could drop this course and not to take this stats. This is too difficult. I just dropped the course. I can live with Saudi scores. Uh, uh, you, you, you can have a kind of voluntary compliance and most important, and in us, you beginning to sing, well, ivy learn something by doing this. If I achieve that, then this, this is really domination.

Speaker 1:          42:57          Uh, uh, now this is also extremely, uh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, important argument, right? Uh, that, um, uh, um, uh, every privilege, globs of our people in position of power are developing and myth, uh, of their superiority. We are devil thing emit, uh, that this is, uh, uh, useful for you to obey. So the essence right of legitimacy, that it has a certain, expect you to believe in the reasons, but those in position of power try to justify their power. But also an understanding that this is a myth because this is a light comes to very close to nature. This is the niche is sticking his head out here. All right? Uh, it is a methodology. It's not really true, right? You just internalize your own a submission to the authority, right? But you, but the tendency in histories that you will internalize it.

Speaker 1:          44:09          So this is very different from what we normally say, legitimacy because by legitimacy in contemporary political discourse reefers well, uh, uh, [inaudible] is not legitimate because he was faking the elections. If elections are fair, um, and three, then the person who is elected is a legitimate glue ruler. No, no, that's not Weber's view. It's not a universe of uh, uh, suffrage and free and fair elections. What makes the ruler legitimate but maze the ruler legitimate that the ruler is capable to develop metallurgies to justified that you better obey the orders, what is given to you because you have some self interest to do so and you have some level of belief that it is actually not bad for you to do what the ruler wants you to do. Right now, there are different types of domination and authority and this is bad. He clashes right with my, as you as we have seen Reich's Mark's developed his diaper ology of societies from economic systems, economy drives history.

Speaker 1:          45:27          Uh, um, vapor is a new chair and hops, yen or Nichier, right? But drives history is power, struggle for power and the nature of our, how power is constructed and how our power is a sublimated right into a domination to put it in the Friday and way. Uh, that is how she, you should understand how societies operate. So it is not more so production. What describes the evolution of his 30, but types of domination, which describes the evolution of history and that are really three types of, uh, uh, uh, what he calls legitimate authorities that are three days, how rulers in history legitimated their rules. It can be legal, rational, uh, easily. You can say liberal, uh, traditional and charismatic and Vivio spend the time on this. Each one of them are just very briefly tell you what, uh, these different authorities are legal or National Authority is a system in which that is a belief in the legality of enacting the rules.

Speaker 1:          46:49          Um, uh, and the doors who are actually issuing the commands, they themselves are bound by those rules. By this is the rule of law. That's why he caused legal, rational authority. It is rule of law administered in a bureaucratic manner. You do not have a personal master. You do not obey a person. You obey the rules of the game, right? And the, and these rules of the game I prescribed, you know, in advance because before you act, it is sad and you followed these, that is legal, rational authority. This is not identical with the avid democracy. If can be democratic or it can the authoritarian, it can be actually a constitutional monarchy rather constitutional monarch pass laws by a separate legislature, which was or was not democratically elected, but everybody knew who the, who the rules of the game are. Right? In our constitutional monarchy, 18th century, early 19th century England, no democratically elected parliament.

Speaker 1:          48:05          Right? But the laws were there and the monarch followed the law or laws that was legal, rational authority. Uh, uh, then you have traditional authority, traditional authority, he said rests on the established beliefs on the sanctity of in memorial traditions and the legitimacy of those exercising the authority under them. In some ways, you know, when you are obeying, you are father, you are acting under traditional authority. The authority, what your father has is ascribe to your father by tradition, right? The know that this is something, but fathers do have a legitimate right to say, right? Uh, that in fact, you know, fathers do have a legitimate right to say that by midnight you have to be at home, right? They kind of are not very happy about this. You know, when you were 16, you started to the vote against this, but you know, you accepted this is normally what you know, fathers or mothers to say, you know, and you know, you also said, well, uh, um, are you did something and therefore for this weekend you cannot go out.

Speaker 1:          49:22          Right. And they are acting out of traditional authority or authority, which ascribed to them by tradition. Um, uh, and finally, that is charismatic authority. This is a very complex issue. We will talk about this a great deal. Charismatic Authority refers to the fact when a leader is trying to, um, uh, legitimate, it's right to issue commands that he's has some extra ordinary character that he's some single, like a, you know, an extra ordinary, unusual person, but is also very important to see, uh, that the are often seen as super natural or events superhuman having exceptional qualities. Uh, but what is also very important to see, uh, that charismatic authority in Labor is not really the characteristics of the individual. This is what we attribute to the individuals to have these extra ordinary characteristics. In the most recent US history during the electoral, uh, uh, during the presidential campaign, uh, Barack Obama of it, he's a charming personality, which is extra ordinary skills of delivering speeches, was capable to create a, um, a kind of charismatic aura around himself, right?

Speaker 1:          50:56          People got excited, you know, almost like around the rock star, right? They, and his whole, uh, arguments for trying to legitimate himself was very much, uh, uh, passed in charismatic terms, right? A whole you can believe in. Right? This is a very typical charismatic appeal. You have to believe in me because I'm offering you hope in a hopeless situation, right? That's what creates charismatic authority. How much charismatic authority President Obama's still has. This is another question, right? What you may want to discuss in the discussion section is also a problem better. You know, uh, uh, uh, candidate Obama was really a charismatic leader, a vapor, basically define charismatic leaders as the great leaders create the makers of create world religions. Jesus Christ was a charismatic leader. So in some ways to say modern politicians, they are charismatic. It's a bit slippery. But I think the emphasis on hope and, uh, the call, you'll believe me because I, they'll be able to deliver. Yes, we can. You know, I remember when I first heard him saying that, I said, yeah, that's exactly the charismatic at Dia, right? It's not quite reason. Doubt, right? It is. And it moved me when when he, when Barack Obama came out and he said, you think nothing can be done, but yes, we can hope you can believe in. Right. This is very much a charismatic appeal. That's what got is medical product is all about.
