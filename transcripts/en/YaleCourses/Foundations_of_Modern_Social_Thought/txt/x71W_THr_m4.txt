Speaker 1:          00:02          Uh, I would like very briefly to come back to Weber's theory of domination. I deleted it from the questions, but I promise IVL get this back in one way or another for the next test. So probably the last thing you want to think about now is a test. Uh, but let me still talking about the theory of domination. I think there's is a very important to Uri, extremely influential and extremely insightful. So, uh, led me just very briefly sum up where we left it last time and then I move into Weber's theory of traditional authority. And the last time we were talking about the Crucial Distinction Vapor makes beats being mocked and hair shaft a martyrdom is translated in English as power. That is no question about this, uh, the translation of hair shaft to various, uh, if there's, uh, translated either as authority or if this translated as domination.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Um, and I think most translation, uh, are good. Um, I think, uh, people, um, or whom I feel closer in my own vapor reading a translated more like domination rather than or authority. Um, uh, and in fact, uh, I think, uh, just to emphasize you, the importance of the, uh, translation or difference, um, in the notion of hair chuffed, the first four letters, Hara means the Lord. So I think the notion of hair shaft, uh, uh, has a very strong implications of asymmetrical power relationships. Uh, uh, but I think domination captures better than authority. Those who translated Weber's notion of how shaft as authority, like a dark world, Parsons wanted to emphasize that vapor, um, uh, uh, uh, looks at hair shaft, uh, as something which is authoritarian ride for somebody x out of authority, right? Um, uh, this is, uh, uh, not a false translation but misses an important point.

Speaker 1:          02:35          And namely Weber's Interdis Indivi how power is being exercised, uh, invested in a VA misses a Max Weber's rules in the Frederick Nicha, uh, or blah, blah, blah. Eva and I made there. So in the hops, uh, right, human history is all about the history of struggle for power. That's in mighty think, Weber's fundamental idea, bow RV, that important modification. And I gave you the citation a last lecture, but let me come back to this. Power means the likelihood that people will obey order, uh, even against resistance and domination means the likelihood that people, veal actually follow orders, these are being coerced to do so. Uh, so the notion of domination or hair shaft does imply a degree of voluntary ness and minimum level of belief that in fact, those who issue order do have the right to do so or at is at least it is reasonable that they issue orders and I follow the orders or to come up with an even more minimal definition of how shaft that I cannot see any real alternative under the present circumstances, but to obey the orders to the volume who issues these orders.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Right. Uh, so, uh, and this has everything to do with the idea of legitimacy. And I put a, uh, at last lecture at his little equation, right? Um, uh, on one of the slides, uh, that power plus legitimation adds up to domination, uh, or, or authority. So what is legitimation? Viber said power is really an extreme case. That very little, very, it happens very rarely, uh, that the von who exercises or authority exercise is simply by exerting power coursing people to obey those who are in position of authority, uh, or try to legitimize rate, uh, that autonomy or authority and tried to come up with reasons by people subjected to these authority should obey that authority. It's again, very niche Yan, the idea, right, that those who are exercising power tries to internalize your, a subjugation to power in one way or another and try to create in you, in you and mortality, right?

Speaker 1:          05:51          A set of principles by which you would say, well, uh, this may be the right thing for me to do. Or as I said, the minimum that finish. And even if you don't particularly like obeying order, you say, what else can I do? The alternative if I don't obey order would be verse, uh, or about the person who issues or totality. You may not lie the person who issues authority, but you've, you'll say, but the alternative is verse, right? So you can pick a course. You may not lie the lecturer or that March or the way how it creates, well I've done other of course is you did shop for and they've hurt even worse. So you will be the least verse course, right? You pick the lecturer who seems to be the least boring and too seems to be the most reasonable grading you or assignment, right?

Speaker 1:          06:55          That does mean that you are all that thrilled to be at lectures and to do assignments, but you have to do it and under the circumstances you go for the last email, right? That's I think the kind of most extreme interpretation of Weber's idea of legitimacy. But we were also, I pointed this word out to you. They were sad that all legitimacy contains an element of a myth. It doesn't mean that the person who tries to justify its accorded the is studying the troops, whether it is through. So naturals is almost besides the point, the most important issue is that it creates a methodology about the reason why you have to obey authority. So what I would cry to underline already in last lecture, that Weber's notion of legitimacy is so much more sophisticated, so less liberal and so much more me chair. Then the idea of the normally hear, then you hear the word legitimize Shan by legit dimension.

Speaker 1:          08:12          We see something very good, right? A power is legitimated because it was somebody who was elected in fair and three elections, uh, to an office. And we believe that this person will do a great job. Having been elected, well have a verb would be more likely to think something like our shy, uh, uh, under the circumstances barberry, there is no alternative to Afghanistan. But to have this guy as the president though it's very doubt for, you know, what all those claims and bowed, the legitimacy of the system are being made, the APP 50 march and the ecology created around it. Uh, but, uh, the advice, the alternative is cow horse and even these guys probably better than chaos, which would happen. Other vies and I, this is, uh, you know, my dark leading our next neighbor. Now, as you can see, of course the difference from Marx is fundamental.

Speaker 1:          09:25          Uh, marks did see human history as unfolding of more soft production. It was all struggle around ownership and means of production, clash of economic interest for vapor. It is not economic interest, which drives human history but struggle for power. And he can describe different systems of authority over time, but it is all described, uh, on the quality and the nature of those mythologies, those in position of power come up to legitimate, but they are trying to do to you. Right? Uh, so that is one fundamental difference between a marks and the vapor. That is an other fundamental difference. And uh, you'll be, you'll have to, uh, uh, bear this very much in mind as these lecture on traditional authority on the floors. Though Weber's develops these different types of a domination, uh, primarily to describe historic gotta change, grander societies, traditional authority, charismatic, all loss authority, legal, rational authority kind of describes the evolution of humankind and has a similar kind of flavor than marks a subsect van, small soft production, but vapor does more than that.

Speaker 1:          11:02          These three types of authority do describe or kind of organizations or social units, uh, and today the Ken Clark about legal, rational authority, traditional authority or Charismatic Authority in Contemporary Society, though he will call liberal market capitalism as the purest Stipe. And what pure type is, I've, you're talking about this in a minute of legal rational authority give you say that even in Contemporary Society, the have organizations which are based on traditional authority. The most obvious example of traditional authority, and bear it in mind when we will be talking about this, uh, uh, today is the family you'll live in had the family is primarily bound together by tradition, but the very institution where you are in now, universities do have a flavor of traditional authority, right? Uh, it has a kind of ethos with at least three teachers believe that you have to pay some respect to the teachers. And we have core kind of traditional rituals, right?

Speaker 1:          12:26          Which makes, uh, uh, the making the functioning of our university. Uh, in a way a traditional organization, right? There is the graduation ceremony when you, there will be varying all these funny, you know, um, uh, uh, um, uh, academy dress and then you are awarded at the Gri, which is happening almost like a, of wording. Um, uh, Lord chip by the cream, right? The president of you'll say by the power invested in me. Uh, and then by this power, the o Cornforth do you ride the degree of Bachelor of arts or a Bachelor of Sciences? Right? Uh, this is very much like confirming the title of Lord ship a on somebody by the queen of England, by the powers vested in her. Uh, okay. So therefore vapor is more flexible. It marks, it doesn't simply describe society, but in every society it does describe a certain organizations and in contemporary society, the often talk about charisma.

Speaker 1:          13:46          And we have been talking a lot about Carrie's mine the last 18 months. And we were talking about, uh, um, um, um, barrack Obama and, but Aqua Obama being gift charismatic leader, right? So the charisma is also something what we very often in a walk today, um, describing the nature of authority, uh, somebody, um, is, uh, exercising. Okay. So that's again, you know, just the backdrop to the notion of authority and I hope it feel, help you to locate it, uh, more, uh, in, uh, uh, the, uh, uh, literature. Now as I mentioned also in last lecture that are c major types of authority, traditional authority in which basically the, you have a personal master in charge and dispersing our master somehow pos to old age or, uh, sank a sacred rules, uh, to ask you to obey his or her commands. Mostly yes. But occasionally her commands after all that is a green in England that were queens in England for a long time.

Speaker 1:          15:16          Okay. So that's the additional authority. Uh, the other one is charismatic authority where the person in charge, um, uh, cause for obedience on the grounds, uh, uh, that, uh, that person is believed to have some supernatural, extra ordinary powers. Uh, um, um, uh, uh, and fine, not illegal rational authority or authority in which the person who is a, um, uh, issuing command is also under the same law as people who are obeying orders and in legal, rational authority, you do not have a personal master. You do not obey a person, but you obeyed the rules and laws. That's why waiver costs legal rational authority as a shorthand. I think it would be more obvious to call it liberal or authority or liberal system of authority. I just want to make one more vote. One very brief comment. Um, as we proceed to traditional authority, namely that the three types of authorities are not exactly have the same, uh, ontological status, uh, vapor basically have two major types of authority, traditional authority or legal rational authority.

Speaker 1:          16:47          Charismatic Authority does not have the longevity of our traditional or authority or legal. Rational Authority has charismatic authority as we are talking about this. A great deal is a revolutionary force. Charismatic Authority usually occurs for the relatively brief period of time. Typically the charismatic leader is a one person and it is very lucky if that one person can maintain the charisma for all the time this person is in charge. I mean, uh, just after nine months of the election of President Obama, we see a level, right, a withering of his sort of strong charismatic Aptia. So in order to maintain your charisma for while you are in office and a specialty for the lifetime is very difficult and even more difficult to transfer his mom to another leader. So charismatic authority is really a change basically, as I will argue later on from one form of traditional authority to another form of traditional authority in the Maxim Baber.

Speaker 1:          18:05          So therefore are the two big types, traditional authority and legal rational authority. And what Mark's God, the transition from fewer dollars into capitalism or what the understand modernization is really nothing else but the movement from traditional authority to legal rational authority. Okay. Uh, now let me go, go, uh, into today's topic and dark about additional authority. And uh, at first about pure type by Vr. Describe his definition of the pure type, but it needs a, a fool to north about pure type is all about uh, uh, as I already pointed out, Max Weber's was a Kantian. Uh, that meant that Max Faber did not believe that a human knowledge, which completely describes the reality is possible, right? The reality is so infinity the rich that the concepts, what we develop is only mental images of these objects. What we are developing concept about, right? It can be never be fully describing the subject.

Speaker 1:          19:26          So these mental objects, what we have in our mind about the object from which we tried to develop knowledge is what he calls a ideal types or they are abstractions from the bird, not a precise description of diverse world. So therefore what he said the best, what we can aim at to develop ideotype pure types and or realities. We all of us, some are different from the idea of type what is in our mind and as human knowledge is progressing and that's what makes actually be, but at difficult reading is that the, in the process of knowledge, we develop an ideal type at conceptions. About the world. And then we go back to reality and we see that he does not exhaust the reality as it is the reality has other important features. The miss in the first instance. So we go back and via Redo our ideal type and rich, the idea of type to fit to create a better fit with reality, right?

Speaker 1:          20:37          That's the fundamental idea. And that's what makes Weber's so difficult to read because he often comes up bitten idea of type a pure and he said yes, but when I'm reading get historical reality, it does not quite fit. So therefore I redo a little my idea of type and and rich it. So you can easily get lost when you are reading vapor. And this is not accidental, right? This is the methodology, how he proceeds. You does not believe that we can attain absolute knowledge. Uh, what, what, what, what he believes that we have to strive to be able to describe. But we want to describe as precisely as we just skim tech as we can. So this is the idea of pure types. So what is the pure type of legal, rational authority or for traditional authority? And first of all, if you have to talk about the basis of legitimacy, uh, just very briefly, something also about the veterans, how Assaf is being recruited as such.

Speaker 1:          21:50          And we come with a very clear and simple that definition, uh, in traditional toricity legitimacy is claimed for and believed in by virtue of the sanctity of age old rules. So the person who rules makes a claim that this has been all of us this way, and that is some sacred mess in, in effect, obeying the person who by age or tradition was assigned to a position of authority. And again, let me just go back to the family. This is a classical example. The parents, uh, do, uh, uh, have some sacred law rights to issue some commands and the do obey barons because it has all of us this way. Children, all of us had to obey barons to what extent they have to obey. And what parents can do to children may vary a little over time, but the parents are in charge and they are them.

Speaker 1:          23:00          Uh, uh, um, uh, in fact do have Darius to issue certain kinds of commands, is widely accepted, but avert believed in is also very important, right? So the parents do not have to force you to obey you beginning to believe that if it is indeed right thing that the parents obey order. It happens also if you, particularly in this life, but they try to order and occasionally you may not like, uh, uh, one of your parents or both of your parents, never the less you think, some degree of obedience is necessary unless you really break the law and you ran away, right? Um, but that is, uh, uh, certainly, um, and extreme case as it is an extreme case that parents will force children. You will squashing, uh, of children to obey that rule. Well, occasionally they use some degree of coercion. It's also very important in, in Viber.

Speaker 1:          24:10          You know, that question is all of us present in every type of a domination neuro thing. That legal rational authority does not have coercion in the United States. Over 3 million people are in jail, right? They are being coerced in the United States. People, occasionally I killed by the government, right? The are executed. So there is coercion, even in legal, rational authority in the most liberal democratic society. If you break the laws, you have your B course, and if you are not breaking the law, that is always the promise of coercion, right? It said, well, under certain circumstances you'll hear because, um, now the second important point is right that the master who obeys the order is designated by traditional rule, right? And the are obeyed because of that I convert that, um, well I to do day is translated into English as traditional status. Uh, it's not a very good translation.

Speaker 1:          25:19          I can build the really means that they are believed to have virtuous by themselves, that they have a virtue of what they themselves carry out. So there is honor and I think the term honor is extremely important, right? Um, uh, uh, for understanding traditional authority, uh, the traditional master is always assumed to be an honorable person, right? And if that person becomes non honorable, it is likely that it will use each authority. Again, think about balance, right? Um, the parents are supposed to be honorable and if they are not honorable any longer, that is a crisis in the family. Um, have you seen Arthur Miller's play? The Das have the sales man? This is exactly what happens in the depths of the salesman when he song catches the father whom he admired so much is sketching him, uh, that, uh, uh, another woman, then his mother, right.

Speaker 1:          26:24          Then suddenly the father loses his honor is not honorable any longer. Right? And that creates a lifelong crisis for the child. So, um, uh, I think honor is very important to understand traditional authority and uh, it is based, a traditional rule is based on personal loyalty. You personally feel that you have to be loyal to this person. Again, all of these issues do apply to a substantial degree in institutions like a university. Right? Uh, uh, it, there's also the kind of assumed, right? Uh, that professors should act in an honorable way and if they don't, uh, they are cold or being not honorable, they are VOB losing their, uh, uh, a legitimacy. And that is a great deal of personal loyalty. Uh, in university situations there are, particularly in graduate school, the relationship, the mentor and the phd student is a highly personalized relationship off neutral loyalties. Uh, right. Uh, um, there is so much a mentor you'll be able to take that a PhD student in the dissertation will be true critical of the professor who is supervising the dissertation. It accepts some degree of loyalty right from the student and the student would be very disappointed and if he turns out that the mentor is writing bad letters for him, right? There is an expectation, right, of mutual loyalty in every type of traditional authority.

Speaker 1:          28:16          Uh, and what is therefore important. That is also a personal element whom you obey is a kind of a person or master, not simply a supervisor, not a boss, but something of a person or most of a master, an honorable person to whom you are linked. The two, uh, by uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, loyalty. Well, how do you recruit staff under this, uh, uh, a system that are really two ways to do it. That is a so called battery morning or recruitment, um, uh, namely that people are selected into position, uh, because the are related to the chief, uh, uh, by tradition, uh, because they are known to the chief. Um, uh, this happens still green deal in various organizations even today. Um, especially university organizations do exercise, uh, substantial, uh, patrimonial system of recruitment, but there are extra petrie morning or vase when persons are judged to be loyal by the master.

Speaker 1:          29:28          And I pointed to the office because all of their expected loyalty or such. Again, I can give you the example of the universities that are, a lot of recruitment is happening through battery morning. Our recruitment, uh, you are well in the u s universities, you are not supposed to recruit your own students in Europe. They do, uh, uh, in the U s few universities. Do you recruit the students of your body, so your, your friends or your colleagues, right. It's a lot of battery morning autism going on in university, uh, recruitment and in fee. In fact, loyalty is very important when it comes particularly to the appointment of administrators in the university system. Uh, now that odd I let me move on and let's have the broader historical view. There are various historical variations. So after additional authority, uh, VBA is very messy in terms of terminology.

Speaker 1:          30:34          I was trying to make as much sense as I could. I think that our two major forms of traditional authority, one is Scott Patriarchaly Zuma and the other one is Scott Beci morning. I'll domination. The big difference between patriarchal systems that it does not staff, um, uh, that uh, what is being the authorities exercise directly by the master and does not need a staff in order to exercise, eat authority. Patrimonial domination on the other hand does have a staff, it is a larger scale society on a larger scale organization, better staff view or carry out the commands of the master. This is the distinction between masters staff and the people who obey is extremely important for Max Ray. But, and try to get deep down in your brain these comment because you cannot understand the vaporium visa. This, as I pointed out, the neighbor said, that is of us a degree of belief or faith involved in legitimacy.

Speaker 1:          31:41          But what kind of fate depends a great deal. Whether the fate is by the staff in the master or by the people in the master they burst. Fundamental idea is that the system is legitimate. As long as the staff has a positive belief in the master. I had the masses. The people you shortly do not have a positive belief. They don't. You'll surely love the person who rules. Then they just accept it as the lesser evo, but the staff has to have a positive belief in the master. Then do to come at revolution comes then the staff is losing faith in the master, then the Shah of Iran a fail. Then the second unity services in Iran begin to lose faith in the shock. The people of Iran, he was short. He did not lie there shot all that much. They just could not think of an alternative should they accepted it, but the regime fell when the security services lost faith in them.

Speaker 1:          32:48          The same can go for the fall of communism, communism fell of and the Communist Party staff and the specialty. The secret services begin to lose faith in the system. Not that most people who lived under communism, all that bloody communists, right bath, bow the staff Os than the staff turned out to be again coming on his best when communism fell, they'll be three. Patriarchal is my view and make to this distinction here. Primary Patriarchal is man get on top crecy and then about pitch and morning of domination about pure patrimonial Islam that the staff is purely a personal instrument in the master. And finally, SD type of domination. It wasn't, we normally call few [inaudible] event, the administrative staff and appropriate certain powers from the master. Uh, and now what I do or you to show, I think what Weber's theory of history is how these different types, uh, for systems evolve.

Speaker 1:          33:58          He said the history begins with B three or charisma. So, but relatively small societies, for instance, kinship networks, they're the elders or the fatter can rule the society and does not need policemen. Jailers, you know, judges, administrators, stack school actors in order to run the SAF, it does indirectly, uh, then it moves to a primary Patri morning. Al Islam, they're, the society becomes larger. Uh, there is staff, but the staff is individually selected by the master and the the completely depend by their master. Their most extreme example of this is as I view a dark about this in a minute, salt on Islam and that the salt and can actually get credit and we'll typically get shreds of the staffer at Veale and very frequently then it is moving to feudal type of nomination that the staff appropriate certain powers from the master appropriates those powers because uh, um, for instance it has lent holding what is given to a noble family not only for life but also for the laminate family, for the life of the family.

Speaker 1:          35:18          Right. The feudal property has been inherited and then the staff appropriate certain powers, uh, from, uh, the master will act as a master, for instance, even serve justice. And finally, legal rational authority. Uh, there, the of coercion is the monopoly of the stage. No individual has the right to exercise scores if power except the state. Well, this is not quite true. Bet. Dance, for instance, still I have summarized, we ha we feel uncomfortable about this, but parents do have summarize to exercise coercion, but generally you cannot exercise any coercion, only the state can. So as you can see in a way the history of humankind is an evolution of the means of coercion by four marks. The question was the evolution of the means of production for the bird history live in by the evolution of the means of administration and coercion. Again, a very niche area and idea and that dark read of the history that history actually is getting worse because those who will have more and more sophisticated means to suppress a larger number of people.

Speaker 1:          36:43          And what makes it even worse? They internalize you, internalize your own submission internally. You believe that this is the right thing, that you are not free, right? That's again, I think the [inaudible] view of history in my reading now about patriarchal asthma is the most elementary form. As I said. Um, uh, um, when, uh, we believe rider that is one master without the staff, uh, who has, uh, the right to exercise or there's a, because that it is no staffer, uh, it is, uh, uh, assume that the members of the group, which is under patriarchy, charisma, for instance, a kinship networks, um, uh, has a, uh, substantial, uh, feeling, uh, that they actually should obey these master of Aber caused them. They are there no set. They are comrades. There is a camaraderie, right? This is a family, right? The family has some degree of pharmacists.

Speaker 1:          37:50          They are not, uh, uh, he said [inaudible] they are not subject to authority, but they are comrades, right? They are members of our community. Um, uh, but I'm very patriotic. Holism means when there is a, uh, uh, typically, uh, father, uh, kind of rule, uh, the father rules, typically it's that there may have been maternal authority as well. Uh, the historical record is a bit unclear whether there were matriarchal societies, uh, we can assume the reverse. So then they have their patriarch or matriarch has societies. It was a mater who ruled the family or the WHO ruled the family. And uh, uh, uh, the relationships, we are not necessarily based on blood relationship because actually it's what I, very long time we did not know that the sexual act may have, uh, or that Mush duvet procreation. It, uh, recent, a reasonably recent discovery of human scientific knowledge that this happened. And therefore in very early societies it was not known at that there is blood relationship between the father and the children. Um, uh, even then it did hold, uh, uh, well once up cases of course slavery, I leave it out, but let me talk about getting get on ocracy. There are some systems in which the elders rule, the older person has the authority. Um, uh, Valerie get on docker oracy is against something which is not on her door for a modern societies as well. Now let me move on to battery morning. I'll domination.

Speaker 2:          39:41          Um, yeah. Um, and uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          39:45          uh, it does emerge. Typical, yeah, merge fan and administrative staff is being created. This is a larger societies. You need armies on policemen than tech school actors. In order to operate, and the members who are subordinated to your authority are treated as subjects. Uh, I mean, I'm also her majesty's subject. Uh, you know, when I got to run, so Australian citizenship and then, uh, um, uh, you know, the Korean is the other Korean of Australia, so I'm her majesty's subject, not simply an Australian citizen. Right? Uh, then there is a person with whom I'm, the authority is relied on in some days in England and in Australia. It's the figure of the queen who does that, right? Uh, uh, well, uh, I don't want to deal with this because I'm running out of time, right? Uh, initially, uh, three are called domination, but patrimonial domination. It was really just a large household and the, in fact, uh, but the, the, you know, ruler the king or unburned did he event from one village to the next and be the staff and was fat for life in a household and moved on. But then of course, uh, it became more complex. Uh, and then, uh, had to create a state. I had to create a state in which a moves beyond the oil costs and taxes are being collected.

Speaker 2:          41:20          Um, um, um, and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          41:27          it, uh, it's surrounding [inaudible] be like kind of, uh, a bureaucracy, um, now, uh, in a pure type of battery morning, all domination, right? The, uh, the, uh, staff are purely, uh, instruments in the hands of the master and life. I'm mentioned. Salt on Islam is bad. That is virtually on the restaurant. The power for the ruler to replace, uh, uh, uh, duals under each authority as it pleases, but then, uh, uh, uh, evolves in history and more complex system, um, SD type of domination or a few dollars, ma. And it is a system in which, uh, um, uh, uh, um, uh, cost it to SD type of domination, uh, uh, in which, uh, uh, uh, the staff has certain degree of stability. Um, uh, uh, uh, now how much stability, uh, it has, uh, um, uh, if you're depend, uh, uh, how the staff is being rewarded and a vapor makes a crucial distinction between benefits is and fiefs.

Speaker 1:          42:50          Uh, these other two ways, how the staff, uh, uh, uh, can be, um, at evolved deed, uh, in, uh, an estate type of donation, a fee for a uveal easily remembered that, right? Avi Use the term in ordinary language we say somebody has a fee for Dorma. And by this we mean if somebody has a fever dorm, it means that somebody created the, uh, a subsystem Uber, which it has gone through, uh, virtually as long as that position is alive was as that position is at least in the same organization. Uh, so again, if I can use the university examples, you may not be as familiar with this as I am, but in universities, for instance, a office space for faculty is a typical fees long. Uh, once, uh, you know, in faculty got an office, it's virtually impossible to take the office away from somebody.

Speaker 1:          44:02          It created a fief Dong a over the territory of what that, uh, what that person has a, this is, uh, uh, only for the time of the tenure. Of course, somebody retires that officers will be immediately taken away. The fiefdom is lost. But you know, the notion of fiefdom means that you have lasting powered on it. Benefits on the other hand means that you get certain, but all of the, under the conditions that you actually do the liver, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, to the ruler. And there are really two types of feudal, uh, uh, systems. Uh, uh, one is, uh, uh, a base. The, um, on benefits is, um, and this is a, a kind of a Rubendall for forum, a few dollars. That means, uh, the ability we serving the SAR. For instance, Russia was ruled, uh, typically, uh, after Yvonne the terrible, my namesake, uh, and until, uh, uh, the Russian revolution by a kind of prep Bendel's system in which a desire, uh, gave, uh, um, uh, as data to the Lords as long as they were loyal to it.

Speaker 1:          45:29          Uh, Eh, we see this now happening in Russia again. Um, President Putin actually to the billions of dollars of Val's, uh, what people receive the from President Yeltsin as private property because he did not think they are loyal. So these people ended up in jail or they were sent into emigration. Their property was taken away. So even contemporary Russia in a VA operates almost like a breath and, or type of few dollars more, right? Uh, President Putin as a kind of Evander terrible right to sort of reinforces loyalty. Uh, uh, and, uh, I made the point, right? That was exactly as in Russia changed, uh, the, a few of those system. Um, and then, uh, [inaudible], uh, uh, were turned into Polish chics boilers in Russia before Ivan, there's charitable, had inherited valves, um, and Evander terrible and Peter the great took that obey and turned them into serving nobility in exchange for loyalty.

Speaker 1:          46:42          Uh, if you have a listen to Mussorgsky's fantastic opera, Boris Godunov, you get the story that he, exactly. If you have not listened to it, do right. Don't get a year degree not having known both. Uh, uh, uh, and we saw us is fantastic. Upper Boris Godunov. Um, all right. Uh, well, uh, western a few dollars more on the other hand is based, uh, uh, on, uh, uh, uh, uh, long glass thing. Get powers of the staff. Uh, a vest and feudal lords received a property for lifetime and it actually was inherited, uh, by the, uh, children. Uh, and the fell. They also exercise a great deal of administrative power, light, uh, feudal lords in France or England did held court and made judgments right over there. They're serves those who belong to that authority. So the, uh, and the kings were rather limited in their power. Uh, Valerie have seen this struggle earlier in this scores, right?

Speaker 1:          47:56          Uh, between, uh, the king's trying to gain more authority, take it back from the feudal lords. That's all that, uh, um, uh, absolute is versus constitutional monarchy was all about right now, of course for a constitutional monarchy was not simply the, uh, feudal lords who are assisted, but also order the, the bourgeoisie who wanted to have a constitutional monarchy to limit, uh, uh, uh, the rights of the monarch. Now a traditional Tori or Tony does a authority, doesn't go very well with the economy, right? Because it is primarily oriented towards satisfaction of needs and not the generation of the profit. Uh, right. And, uh, therefore, uh, uh, traditional domination is likely to prevent the development of business oriented activities. And that's, I think, again, true for the more traditional type of system. But we are familiar with like the family or the universities. Uh, they do not fight, operate, lie business corporations, um, uh, and, uh, therefore the, uh, uh, uh, may, uh, make, uh, uh, calculate economic calculation and profit seeking, uh, difficult or impossible. Um, uh, they can be a defense against market Mac market mechanism, but do not promote, promote a mark Marquette mechanism. Uh, uh, um, uh, and of course in all of these organizations, that is a larger degree of arbitrariness. Then in modern, uh, organizations, uh, uh, uh, and of course in traditional organization, that is all of us a greater, uh, um, uh, respect to the vowel fear of those who are subjugated to authority. So that's about traditional authority and the extension of its modern capitalism. Thank you.
