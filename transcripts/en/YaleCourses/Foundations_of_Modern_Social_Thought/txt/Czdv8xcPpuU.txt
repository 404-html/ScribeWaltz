Speaker 1:          00:02          So today is John, Jack Lew. So, uh, I mean one of the most fascinating people, uh, in terms of his life and his ideas and the way how he reasons he is a provocative right approval culture, uh, and uh, uh, an extra ordinary genius in more than a rom base, um, that our fuel people who buy this agrees so strongly than in Manny proposition or zone Jockers so that, that are for people. Few people who turn my mind off up was to own so much that John Shock. So who was this character? And let me just give you a very brief overview. He was worn in Geneva, which was a city state at that time, uh, ruled by Calvin. Uh, for awhile. Like Calvin is strong clue, uh, reveal. Talking about this around it comes to Max Labor and the Protestant ethic. Calvin Rule Geneva with an iron hands.

Speaker 1:          01:25          That's right. He was born, his father was Isaac crucial. He was a watchmaker and the Calvinist, uh, well he did run into some trouble. I don't know exactly what the trouble was. I think he was in that. So he jumped the boat and vent to Istanbul disappeared. We don't know much about him beyond that. So, uh, at the very early age of them, it was a kind of orphan. Then in 17, 28, he moved to France and there was a wonderful lady, uh, about 10 years, his senior Mrs warrants was running at home. Um, then are actually more seats over here, you know, and uh, that are, um, uh, VIP seats right here. So you can come in here, right? This is specific are these are for you that are four seats here, right? And that our fifth and six over there, don't be embarrassed, right?

Speaker 1:          02:42          You still can see the power points from here. It's not like in the bad movie that when you sit in the front row, you don't see anything of these. So he mad. Mrs Warren's, who was a Roman Catholic and her mission was to Cornell Vert, right? These, uh, um, Calvin is through the wrapper fate, Roman Catholicism and two young boys into her home, but through nose it looks like she had more interest in people rather than religion. So, uh, um, he arrived 28, two Anansi, right? Age of 16. Good Looking, nice guy. Uh, modern warrants is still a young little lady here. You can see, you know, uh, um, I know Warren's as Ron's rock rise meeting in 17, 28. That is romantic stuff, right? Uh, uh, well, uh, you know, and here another picture, you know, ah, ah, I don't blame drawn shock, right at the age of 16, a tool called birth to Roman Catholicism, right from the coal to Calvinist religion and me and vile, uh, being got Beth through a mind tick, right?

Speaker 1:          04:26          Well, as long as Jack is one of those few people, uh, who ruled Akon fashion, very funny book, he has a sense of self identity and self criticism rather. This is genuine. Or he thought this will be the way how to sell their book. Hard to tell, but it's worth reading. It actually was published posts to, and he said, madam [inaudible] arms shaped his character. Undoubtedly she did. Um, and this affair have here, who knows, Marty, it looks like it was an affair. Fascinated people. Uh, later on. Um, uh, I think I already flagged his joke in the introductory lecture is Rhonda for French writer, some diarrhea and he's superb novel La little rules along the wire was inspired by these interests in your fear, right? A 16 year old boy and mth age year old woman. And in fact, a story off Julianne Shore Rather Means Jones, Jacques Rousseau and Marge. I'm there and I own the right, um, as three La the core of the story.

Speaker 1:          06:03          So if you have not read little's Alot, why this is a must for an ivy league graduate, you'll do until I'm to get that degree from Yale, not having rat Staun died. I had a rule, Sha Alon, the why it's of course in English then, but you know, enough is enough, uh, in 40 to seven or a year of slasher rules saw has a now bigger aims and he moves to pays and he becomes the secretary of [inaudible] who was a French ambassador to Vantis and that out a lot of Nice things about, uh, interesting things about little sore, but he was not an easy, um, and not, not an easy guy. And somehow he all, there's run into trouble. So he run into trouble in the vanish and in order to avoid avast and probable, I don't know exactly what he did, probably something shot in, not quite correct.

Speaker 1:          07:23          He had to jump and leave vanish and corn do more on tech. Google, uh, he most of payers and he knows how to find good friends. He also will know how to make Greek enemies from his gut fence. So he meets a digital and if he already know these wrong and we know already all sequel p d and the French and light demand. Um, and uh, he was asked to write an article on the music from the [inaudible] the, and this is Deidre. Um, okay. And then he needs, ted is a lot of sure. He was saying, you know, tell and tear is lava. Sure. It was a need in these hotel and a long lasting relationship develops between the two, which, well, I already told you, don't throw worry if you don't marry instantly. He was not mad. It instantly either. Uh, if took him some time to decide that, that these date, uh, should act surely column in eight in our legal marriage, um, she became a companion for all of his life.

Speaker 1:          08:51          Uh, uh, well I would not bet my life that she was for that essence of life, the only women in his life, but suits only as she lost his Bandana. I don't know about her. They married in [inaudible] 68 so you can see it took some time, uh, for Russo to say, thou this is something, it should end up in a manage and here is a cave yellow here. You can't see that, right? That as Jacques, uh, well I hope you don't mind. I'll show you these pictures. They don't tell all that much. John Shock, as I said, was an extra ordinary genius is not only a philosopher, not only as social scientist, not only a scientist, he was writing on science as well. He was an artist and their, you know, anybody can write a novel, right? I am sure half of this class considered at one point in your life that you will write poetry or uveal Rato model.

Speaker 1:          10:07          Right? That's easy. You're, you, you sit down and you write a novel. My life is a novel, right? Most people say that Matt Jones, Rock Road, art, Farrah, probably a few of you considered right. And after that Nice kills, right? And he did wrong. Lou, the event, if lash, I own a CD, it's Alonda wonderful. Okoro he's a great composer, right? Um, well that's quite unusual. And to make it even more interesting, he was in an intensive Beatty was all of us an intense debate with everybody, but he was an intense debates with Ron Hall. And those are few are level familiar with music. You know, Ron Moore, Ron Moore was the Gri test French composer of the 18th century and they had a big debate because, and rules so believed in the Italian Aaker, right? Um, he, he believed that the melody should have a precedence over Harmoni and raw mall.

Speaker 1:          11:38          Um, one volunteer to create a French upper and Vic, you know, um, um, mellowed. These not so important. And in fact, uh, the morning is morning put on. It was a revolutionary break. Um, uh, Ron Moore, the sea, you know, creates a new space for the new music. In some ways. He beginning to Dave, the vague what we eventually, we all know as modern music and extra ordinary composer. Well, I Rousseau believed in bear country. True [inaudible]. I know, of course they're not, it was no Pavarotti at that time. They, but you know what Bel Canto is of Amaria, right? You create our cry, you can sing it, right? That's what he really believed in. And unlike a Rameau who was much more analytical, right, and emphasize Harmoni inch and assisting the person whom I think is the greatest composer of Ooh, history of Wolfgang Amadeus, Mozart loved and he wrote an opera but can be very rarely, same scene who quetsion or you can catch it in the metropole in not done upper of arts once in a decade. Bastianich and Bhasin niche actually inspired by the Devin.

Speaker 1:          13:29          Go on amazon.com you can buy Rommel, you can buy a Bostonian and Bostonian and you can buy led event and you can see the differences. And of course, publishes a novel. It does, uh, Vishy Ha Julie and uh, or the new hair loss, which at that time was an influential novel. I don't think too many people read it today. Now this is Rambo and he is Rameau for shadow and modern music Gluck in particular, uh, uh, follows, uh, from Rommel. In fact, you know, more sad there'll be changing in his lifetime. Um, Vivia of talk of how, you know, just I thought if that is a musician you can read other. Yeah. Um, interestingly, you know, more, uh, did not stick quite to the Italian upper over his life. Um, uh, you, um, um, probably her Saba flirter, the magic flute is a first, sure.

Speaker 1:          14:51          Oppor Ahh, you earlier mortality is very much Italian opera lace shirt in life. More sad prior to create German opera, which has some theme you allowed if these, the French music, not quite thousands is more romantic. Okay. He is also a philosopher, scientist, political theorist. I will also will say sociologist and Bali think got a scientist. The first piece of work is actually science or art. Um, and the study of society. Uh, then in 1755, he writes some very interesting work. If you have spare time, read it. This course on the origin of inequality. Uh, again, very provocative worker in some ways. Uh, that is some sort of hop Sian idea behind that is sad. Well, it starts with love, but if you are really in love now, um, you'll tend to be jealous, right? If you are deeply in love, passionately in love, then you don't lie that the person who is the object of your love May, however, all log in somebody else, then you are jealous.

Speaker 1:          16:25          And the idea is this is the origins of your neck quality, right? We are jealous. All right, there is a long pressure's good to put it with hops, right? The old design. And if somebody else is ours is that well and it has a shot at it to get it, then we become jealous, right? We want to grab it, move on to monopolize it. So this is the source of inequality, right? Sort of sink idea. All right. Uh, have you ever experienced that? Did you have occasionally a level sense of jealousy in you and thinking no, these other ones should not have the one I do have.

Speaker 1:          17:15          I think you probably did. I did. Okay. And then comes the big here. 62, he publishes two major books in one year. Two big scandals, social contract and Emile and Ivo draw to social contract today. And email social contract is really a culmination of the contract area man hops lock Andrew was so bit some extra ordinary important innovations. All right. Um, as we have seen, uh, right, uh, in the first contract, Cesarean harps had a somewhat limited idea of social contract. Probably realistic. Uh, but not what you necesarrily life. He said the social contract is not something what you conclude the video authority, right? Social contract. What you answered by fear and social contract, which was done previously before you run that to have a new contract is binding on you, right? Law Dan, to see that consortium contract as sort of between the individual. Right.

Speaker 1:          18:54          And the Common Val's, uh, this is a nice idea, right? That you are bind by a contract you signed. Wow. You know, um, those are you at least two were born in these United States. Never signed a contract to accept the constitution. I am a naturalized citizen. You can say I signed a contract, I had to swear allegiance to the United States at that time I was supposed to read the constitution. I have not read it from cover to cover. But anyway, I signed the contracts, some VOD on scene, you know, suspecting what the contract is signing. But most of you rad worn in this state, never signed the contract. Right? It's still binding on you, right. Unless you decide to abandon the u s citizenship and become a citizen of North Korea. Right. Then you are buying by the social contract. So that, that is, you know, the difference between um, um, uh, uh, harps and Lark as we discussed now who saw as reviewers see s new, new, new interesting element is that, well it's not white.

Speaker 1:          20:10          The individual was, and he introduces the notion of general there. There is a general Ville which is well above, uh, the individuals extremely important idea has a degree of um, insights and realism. It's also a very dangerous idea. Totalitarian regimes very often advocated General Ville that you and re Ivf Croak, uh, um, John Jack for you when he's sad that individuals have to be forced to be free. That follows from the idea of General Vale. Well, he is a complex thinker, liberal in Ronaghan, that contact area and on the other, the other hand and paves the road to totalitarianism that he was loved by many liberals and he was loved by many totalitarians like God, Mark Sloughed, him and like Vladimir Ilyich. Lenin loved him because of the genital about Durkheim loft him too. And he was a little bit off. So, uh, that is Emil Ivy was talking about this I already mentioned and Yvonne or fewer that are probably a few people who will end up in education.

Speaker 1:          21:48          You have to read this book cover to cover that is no modern education theory. The south, the book in meal, this is the foundation of modern education or teary. Okay. He has a big impact, a big impact on the American constitution and the French Revolution. He one of the bass breaker or, or on on the French revolution, he was also the first who advocated pop, Suva, serenity, um, um, uh, the abolishment of the Turd, the state and creating warm puppy elected body, right, strong conflict. It Montesquieu who want that to have right to chain barriers. Uh, one for the aristocracy and one for the people. A rooster wanted to have one universal suffrage except for the man. He was a male chauvinist pig in one way. Well, and as Vivia see the idea of gender veal over picked up by the radicals of the financial evolution. Uh, the Jacobins and Vos speaked up by later communists of video, Skype would be Atlanta in his store.

Speaker 1:          23:14          A malaise. No, the genital Ville and French radicalism a led to bloodshed, uh, Robespierre the major disciple, I'm believe her of gender, all veal. His hats for us also chopped off so much about it. Now, uh, Rousseau did not live the French revolution. His ideas there then that he had to move in 62 in exile because both books created an outrage, particularly by the church, first event to back to Geneva. But figure it out. It doesn't [inaudible] Ronnie longer. So David Hume, the conservative philosopher who admired is very invited him to come to England. And like with everybody else who was his friends, right? He had a fall out of your day. If it was really a difficulty guy, right? Uh, this is David Hume, and therefore he left England and he return to France, uh, lived for a long time on the [inaudible] named to make sure it doesn't get into trouble flying all the 68 he married [inaudible] ivo talking about this a meal. They have several children and the greatest educational theories to tells you how to raise children. He put all of his children an orphanage. She was a real bastard, right? Do that. Um, and then he was writing his confessions, um, which was published, a boss almost Lee, and he died in [inaudible] 78, uh, July the second. So this is the orchard maybe he will be discussing today. And vivio be also discussing,

Speaker 2:          25:27          uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          25:30          choose today and I hope I have enough time,

Speaker 2:          25:36          uh, via TV and

Speaker 1:          25:39          I get home, I'd before the Leibow comms so I can put this on the intern match. So you can read the songs. The ensurer match. Uh, this is fried the social contract.

Speaker 2:          26:03          Yes.

Speaker 1:          26:06          So Shaw contract 1782 and I don't know why, but I like your show. You the first additions,

Speaker 2:          26:17          uh,

Speaker 1:          26:19          doesn't take me too much time to find it on the intranet. Whatso occasionally does. Okay. So what is the social contract is all about a book one, uh, as a, a description. How you move from natural right from the state of nature to politic or, um, uh, the second book is who is the Silver Silverman and how does silver and should be constructed? Created. This is an issue which, uh, law did not pay much attention to. Right. Um, um, um, reveal, see, you know, Rousseau himself likes elected, uh, selected aristocracy about, he beginning to think about universal suffrage and proper constitution of the silver. And then he has a big section on government. Um, uh, a section on ancient Roman CVO religion Ivy. We'll talk now. I don't have much time. I have your try to talk about cvs Allergan as well. So what about other major themes?

Speaker 1:          27:32          One question is what is legitimate rule? And he said rude is only legitimate when it is, uh, uh, uh, at, I have that consent. Bart. He said Justice has to be the Lou Tiede because genital Ville has to, could have there I will have to talk a little about justice being diluted. The problem is that is no universal justice. What you can arrive at from the individual veil that is a General Ville, right? And the conception of the comment and gloves and the individual that the individual is done justice to, it has to be diluting. It has to be restricted by the demands of the collective Ville of the collective good. Now this is a provocative statement. It certainly has a kernel of tools. It's also very dangerous argument because it opens up the rule for a totalitarian state which will tell you, oh, you think this is your interest, but you think is your interest is not really your interest me the server and knows what is in your restaurants and ivy or force you to be Free Ivy or force you to understand, right?

Speaker 1:          29:04          What is in your interest. That is a bit of a tricky argument, right? It had, has been abused in history. That's what the notion diluted refers to. Now perhaps your he advocates for popular serenity and the need for convention. Um, uh, well the argument is that individual will express only individual interest and therefore the general deal is not the veal of simply the sum total of Indivi individual veils. He is a metal door, logical collectivist, right? Uh, uh, as I already pointed out and then it comes to the law giver, uh, it is the law giver who is actually can inspire what he goes are more pro per. You need a law giver. He sees himself as a law giver who act surely will be able to tell you why your selfishness is no good by the law of your country. Younger community is the right thing to go.

Speaker 1:          30:20          Okay. And the good government means a pop jewelry elected legislature and the executive is still by an aristocracy, uh, by a device man. That's what he really means by aristocracy and intellectual aristocracy. Who is elected? Well, I may have some bodies notion, right? That people in government should be smart, right? And we have a bit of concern. Uh, you know, in the past there were some presidents in the United States, some people in the United States through the are not all death smart, right? I don't want to name names, but you can think, probably have some, right. Uh, who buys? Some people thought they are a little on the dumb side, right? And they did not earn real much respect right. By those two things, they are not smart anyway. That's it. So legitimate through a, they all legitimate rule cannot be amazed or natural title lot aristocracy has to be, um, uh, authorized by consent.

Speaker 1:          31:36          Um, well, I leave the family issue. That's a family he said is the only natural society. Um, uh, Bart, he said even the family does not come simply from nature. That is a social contract in the family. And in fact, you, when you, when you grew up, um, uh, you know, when you are not as smart shot anymore, then you will realize how much of a contract it is eventually. I mean, I hope that is nobody in this room, but I suspect that I probably a very few who at one point thought enough was enough. You know, my mother and father is really a pain and therefore I don't want to do much with them. Need to break the contract. Right. It does happen to some people in their life as a father, I hope it will never happen, but on, fortunately, it occasionally does.

Speaker 1:          32:41          A Brown people are teenagers. That's when you beginning to think about the natural right of the family, right as a contract, right? And you're beginning to answer, or some people begin to answer some kind offer, uh, your relationship in the parents and try to corner worth the natural dependence on parents on a contractual relationship. Right? Uh, saying, what do you mean I have to be back home by 11:30 AM you remember that? I remember that. And try to negotiate the towel. Oh, not 11. [inaudible] a am right. I am already 16 or 17, you know, um, that span, you walk on the birthing national. Right? Okay. Uh, now that is a transition from state of nature to the nature of civil society.

Speaker 2:          33:46          All right. Uh, uh, uh, eh,

Speaker 1:          33:53          that is the transition from the state of nature to cvs or is NASA shut? It is just a remarkable change right now you substitute justice for ends thing. Uh, I've contact, um, avid more reality, which was lacking previously in the state of nature.

Speaker 2:          34:17          MMM.

Speaker 1:          34:19          And in CVS society, you know, we deprive ourselves from some of the advantages, but we enjoy in the state of nature. Nevertheless, this is a great progress. What has to be taken on. If you see this also in Emea,

Speaker 2:          34:37          uh, now, uh,

Speaker 1:          34:42          the second theme is about the question of the looted justice. And he said, you know, at the order add to admit, justice among us has to be diluted and diluted means, you know, uh, our individual sense of justice has to be overruled by the general veal and a silver sedan, uh, needs snow guarantor, uh, and the individuals will have to be rash constraint, our device, the R and [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          35:21          MMM.

Speaker 1:          35:23          And here, um, uh, here is the argument why the individual of you'll have to cross strange individuals cannot adjust, follow the south in showed us because the genital veal have to prevail. The common good has to overrule the selfish individual interests and very different type of argument. But from the British liberals, uh, then he are used for popular sue vanity and he's the first to do so. Um, and this is his single most important, uh, uh, a contribution right at this has to be based on a convention and the convention has to be arrived at by the rule of the majority. Um, uh, there must be an assembly of people, right? And, and this is also a very radical, controversial argument that the must pull the resources. It is almost a communist idea of having common property of major resources, very problematic argument. Uh, and he also makes this interesting claim that in the state of nature be are the, are not equal.

Speaker 1:          36:48          That's a very different view from hops, but we are being made equal by convention. What we, uh, uh, uh, do with each other. And the problem is this is really does it lead to totalitarianism is also advocating for public possessions as a superior form of procession, uh, stage procession over a resources. Very problematic argument. Again, paves the foundation drove was Marxism and communists ideologies. Um, and uh, well, uh, many of the, you know, all the citations VOB on the intranet so you can read it much more carefully. Then you can do it down. Then we arrive at the idea of the genital veal individual. This is something you believe in Adam Smith's or you believe in the law. You will be very disturbed, individual, expressed only private interest. So there must be a public interest and the genital Ville is sort of a, it's unclear where it is coming from, but it is certainly coming over and above.

Speaker 1:          38:14          Uh, the individuals. And this is the, uh, the general veal, which is represented with what we call the common of, right. The federal authority. The federal interest expresses the genital veal. It is not the veal of all is the bill, which the interest of everybody rather than the view of everybody. Um, as I said, you know, that is an element of true stewards in discussion sections. Vivio can talk about this. The class will be divided better. This is acceptable or not. But those of you who believe in methodological collectivism, we'll have to take very seriously the idea of General Ville. And now comes the question of the law givers. And this is a very important argument. Well, viaud only free event of the obey the law, right? The freedom is a under south impulse law. Uh, they, uh, hey girls said that, uh, freedom, uh, is, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you are free.

Speaker 1:          39:32          Then you are recognized necessity. And therefore a UVL have to go by the law and this field and inspire, uh, proper, uh, the love of the country that, uh, that are more the swap, which is self love. He makes this distinction. Yeah. I am afraid I've, you'll have to come back to this, uh, um, uh, uh, cues today. I've, you'll have to leave it now. Um, uh, the distinction between Amore proper and Amore the SWOT is a very important distinction. And I have to elaborate on this, uh, um, Tuesdays. So I will come back, uh, to, uh, to a social contract before we go on to Mel.
