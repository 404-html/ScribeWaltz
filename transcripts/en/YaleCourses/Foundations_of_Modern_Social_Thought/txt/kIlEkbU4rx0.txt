Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, okay. So now the move into, um, uh, the 19th century, it's unclear how long these 19th century lasted, whether it lasted from 70 and 89 until 1914 or 1815. [inaudible] 14. Right. But it was a relatively long century. Uh, and yeah, John Stuart Mill was already 20th century, but it, Karl Marx, we get into the middle of it, right? He was born and, um, 18, 18 and died in 83. Uh, um, and I tried to find a picture of Mars, what you may have, may not have seen, uh, when he was still a quite a good looking guy. All right. So, um, a few verses about his family background. His father, Carl Heinrich, I don't know, Marx himself was born in 1918 in three or Germany. And his father was Heinrich marks, uh, who was actually a lawyer, quite a successful lawyer. Uh, but he was very much a man of enlightenment.

Speaker 1:          01:12          He liked Voltaire, um, and, uh, uh, brought marks up in the spirit of liberalism and enlightenment, Voltaire and Russo and, uh, uh, John Stuart Mill. Uh, these were the guiding lights of the time. The paternal grandfather was Mark's Levy. It was a red by off three air, but he died early and before cavas born. And in fact, a, his father converted to Lutheranism. It did not matter much. He was not really religious. He was a, uh, quite secular and Marx. Karl Marx brought up and, uh, uh, uh, a secular family. So I found you a picture of cheer in the 19, early 19th century. If you look hard, you'll probably see some where young Karl of walking around, right shopping in the marketplace of chair, um, or it is education. Uh, he attended of course, high school in Chair, then 35. He was admitted to the University of Bonn, but he a, he studied the Greek and Roman mythology and history.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Um, uh, already became involved in student politics about, he really was born in born and was attracted to go to Berlin of each at that time. His big bet was becoming a fascinating place. Um, and uh, he was attending the lectures. Uh, Bruno Bauer. Uh, Bruno Bauer was a disciple of Gower. Cagle, um, uh, bower belonged to a group of philosophers who called themselves the young k galleons. They were the cross of their time and marsh already wanted to be a radical. He just did not know what kind of radical he VOB or should be. Um, in fact, he received his degree from the University of Vienna. I think I cracked or that it is joke in the introductory lecture, they fails, assume bluntly. It was easier to get a degree from Vienna then their lien. And Mark's was more interested already in philosophy and radicalism or than legal studies.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Uh, but he got his degree. Hell, so he his here as Gauher Cagle uh, uh, one of the most important philosophers of the 18th and 19th century. Um, um, uh, he was a German philosopher. Um, and ivy, we'll talk more when we get into Mark's owner work. Uh, he basically saw human history as the unfolding of human consciousness. Um, and uh, um, he also characterize the human condition as in the state of alienation, um, in which a subject and object, we are separated from each other. These are big words, you will get comfortable with it as I'm lecturing and marks because this is very important for he galleon philosophy. Also a for Marxism rather distinction that there is the subject you itself, right who are observing and the object the others or the material Virg upon which you are there. Flecting that is also another big word you will learn in the next door.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Three lectures, the verb of totality. Totality means that subject and object are together in one unity. There's what is meant to be a totality. Now, um, uh, he goes idea of Oz. That subject and object became separated and the separation of subject from object, then there is seen as weird outside after the subject as a, a separate object. Uh, um, that is the state of alienation. Alien, right to be a stranger danger in the world because what is around you looks like strange as different from you, right? That's what he meant by alienation. Uh, but you know, uh, human consciousness is increasing and as consciousness is increasing, uh, a, you've overcome the separation of subject and objects. There are, I'm sure that if is not clear for the time being, but Vivian laboring ground this in more detail, uh, with mark sent, hopefully if you become little more clear, Bruno Bauer, he is this charismatic lecturer, the young Kid Galliano who's lectures march at 10 did and that is no Marx and Marxism beside Bruno Bauer do most of his work is vitriolic criticism of Bruno Bauer.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Uh, well, Marxists was quite a vitriolic guy. He liked to use over 80 the language. Okay. Finally. It's very beautiful. The language he's using. Uh, occasionally, uh, this is, uh, pretty, uh, our trajene outraging okay. But about Bauer and the left he galleons. Um, um, uh, um, as I said, you know, he kind of, uh, [inaudible], uh, he's a, uh, a Hagar disciple about, um, uh, um, he cashed to move beyond Haig island, offer, um, uh, critical theory of Hagar and the he galleon system itself. Um, uh, these guys, the young kid galleons, uh, uh, bower and his brother and address like fire buff called themselves the critical critics. This is a term which comes Sapian Mark's work sometimes, ironically, usually. Why was it so? Because he got a is seen in modern philosophy as the founding father of critical theory. You may have heard the word if you studied philosophy, I'm sure you have heard the word.

Speaker 1:          07:38          What is critical theory? I could, the essence of critical theory is that in beliefs that the major task or philosophy to subject human consciousness to critical scrutiny. Now there is some discrepancy between a human consciousness and the human condition, right? Our consciousness does not reflect properly the human condition and therefore we have to criticize consciousness and get the right consciousness. A Val who is actually the first of critical theories. There is some controversy about this that are some people who actually named Emmanuel Kant, the German philosopher as the first of critical theorist con to me then very interesting distinction between uh, uh, uh, being get andZ and Dinga forsee things in themselves and things for themselves and Vernoff important contact idea of us that all the ideas, what we have in our mind are things for themselves and they do not to the word that around us, the Verdun around us is so rich that the concepts what we develop cannot completely fit therefore, in the act of cognition, right?

Speaker 1:          09:08          When we try to understand something, these select from the world stuff, which is important for us. This is where it thinks for themselves, right? We select, uh, in the process of cognition, of learning from the world elements but is useful for us. So I mean in some ways already count as suggested that there is something problematic with the human consciousness, right? We have to subject this human consciousness to critical scrutiny and to be over there that the inner exhausted, the richness of the world and reality cannot be ever captured by the human mind. Now, uh, others do. Seriously girl Cagle as the real critical theorist because now the central point is alienation, right? He in the central point is that this is a big problem. And unlike, uh, Kahn who was an agnostic, he did not think we ever can develop concepts which capture the world, right?

Speaker 1:          10:16          He got to believe that if you guys, you learn my philosophy, you there'd be alright, right? Then you'll all over camelia nation. You've, you'll get the appropriate consciousness. Read my worry. That was in, uh, you know, I'm too simplified to a grade year. So anyway, uh, he was seen as a kind of, um, critical theorist. Now the young kid galleons where the critiques of the critique, right? They wanted to apply. He goes, critical method on Hagers theory. They said, why on Earth Georg, uh, uncle Darryl or griped believes that his theory is the right one. Why don't we subject this system itself to the same critical scrutiny. But he goes suggest everything should be subjected to critical scrutiny. That is really the fundamental line of argument, but greatly influenced Marx. Marx is in many respects, a critical critique. Now, this is another young kid galleon Ludwig Feuerbach who had another very important impact on the marks.

Speaker 1:          11:30          Uh, Feuerbach caught his approach. Naturalism, this is a term but marks the young Marx also used for a vile to describe himself. I think most of you in this room of would think that Mark's was a materialist and their venture, any marks use the term materialism and more specifically historical materialism to describe what he was doing. But in his early work, he was shying away from materialism. Uh, and he used the term naturalism and natural is Maria the meant that you do not underestimate the important of consciousness in spirit. Just in the introduction with consciousness and spirit and the nature itself, you pay more attention to nature. Now, firebox most important book, I don't think it is in English. That's the reason the Kristen plume the essence of Christianity. Um, he also suggested that rather than God creating man, men created the idea of God and they created the idea of God is actually not all that far from Grunow bower, just a more radical position.

Speaker 1:          12:52          Right. Um, um, because it found that to project the desperation of alienation, uh, into the idea of God. Uh, so I mean, uh, via, uh, um, uh, so to say Bauer was not ready to drew the, if I may use this term, the ontological conclusions of his criticism of Hagar Feuerbach vent into ontology, right? Ontology means the origins of things. And he believed right, that in fact, the spiritual, the is a reflection right, of humans as such. That's why he called this naturalism as this thing from idealism. And Vivian, talk about the distinction between idealism and materialism or ideal isn't as an a church naturalism, which is very important for Marxism and has been an important distinction in philosophy in the 19th and earliest strengths. Uh, 20th century. I don't think in the last, you know, 50 or a hundred years, uh, that, you know, in philosophy, discuss too much ice though.

Speaker 1:          14:02          I mean, I don't think it describes a useless distinction who are idealists and who are materialists and well Vva. We'll talk very briefly about this. Uh, um, let me just foreshadow, right? I you know what, you are an idealist when you think that the material of word is coming from an an idea, right? If you believe that there was a, um, a transcendental being like God and this transcendental being by its act of veal created the word and created humans, then you add an idealist. If you believe rather the ideas are explaining human behavior, then you add an idealist. Materialists are the ones who start from the material conditions and tried to explain the ideas from the material conditions. Uh, right. Fire back mid is a provocative statement that we invented God rather than God creating us mark schools further and he will say, well, you have ideas on your head.

Speaker 1:          15:10          I can tell you why you have these ideas. Then I look at your material conditions and he will later on say, when I understand your position in the class structure and I understand you would economic interest, then I view, be able to tell you why you think the way you think, right? This is the material is separate or should I then you explain ideas from the material conditions that versus the other way around. Um, and this comes from, uh, uh, um, uh, Feuerbach Feuerbach inspiration, right? So you bring together are the critical theory of Hagar and a young kid galleons radical critique, critical theory and natural isn't, uh, for, uh, Feuerbach eventually pushing it further and say, let's not fool that out. And it, it is, material is more, right. Okay. Now what about, let's continue with the lifer. Um, 42, uh, he moves to colonia the city of Catalonia and becomes a journalist for [inaudible] side to him.

Speaker 1:          16:18          Eventually even becomes the editor of this journal. And what he's writing is just liberal journalism. He's not a radical yet, is a bourgeois liberal. Uh, he is writing articles about, you know, the freedom of the press and civil liberties. He's writing staffer about to John Stuart Mill would not object to at all. Right. And then 43, he marries a, I again, correct this joke before, after a long engagements, uh, Yanni phone invest Farlane who comes from, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, a normal family, a very high class family, not, not Jewish family, a high class family here. Here is the picture of, of them. Too many. It was going fast, right? Um, uh, he was running into some, uh, uh, political troubles very soon. Uh, now the veal very quickly see some extra ordinary years in March, intellectual development, 1843, 44, 45, just three years is quite extra ordinary.

Speaker 1:          17:41          What is happening in Mark's mind and how far he goes or that in 43, he is beginning to some very important pieces of work. I've, you're talking about them in a minute. [inaudible] get to Mark's work, Bonnie Scott, our contribution to the critique of Hegel's philosophy of the state or fit a fit, he goes philosophy of law or writes it translated differently. Um, and then he's writing a very provocative essay on the Jewish question in which he beginning to distinguish himself from the young key galleons, uh, was of the speed of bcs, especially on the Jewish question, are an unacceptable to the German police and political establishment. So he had to leave Germany and he escapes and he moves Sperry's and here it is totaled. He Arriva No, that's where he lived. And that's where Marc Serota and his extra ordinary unpublished manuscript for this God, the Paris manuscript of 1844 what form, which you have read something.

Speaker 1:          18:56          And some of them are the jewel pieces of social science literature. Some of them is impenetrable, but some of them is quite penetrable and still blows people's mind. Okay. 1844 in Paris. He, um, uh, abandoned this book, the critique of Hagar, but he wrote an introduction, and I will talk about this later. Uh, this in many ways is quite an extraordinary piece of work. It's a wonderful piece of poor poetry. Um, and he sort of beginning to lay out his philosophy. And then in the summer of 44, he completes a high heel, not doesn't complete. He abandons the Paris manuscripts. Um, and for good reasons, and we will talk about this, why, uh, he never published it and never finished it though. I mean, it is quite, quite a brilliant piece and he needs a young man, Reddick angles. Um, uh, just 24 years of age and became lifelong friends and they beginning to work together.

Speaker 1:          20:08          They are writing this book, the Holy Family. I strongly recommend you do not read it. I have read it a number of times and suffered a lot, so I want to save you from suffering. But there are some very important things in the holiday family. Just uh, uh, the price you have to pay to find the jaw is very high. Okay. Uh, and then they write many other things together. Uh, the communist manifesto, the, they ride together, the German ideology, they, they ride together and many other things. Mangoes wasn't brilliant mind. Uh, in fact, he was a much more clearer analytic mind then. Karl Marx, and he had had a much better sense of empirical reality than March. March was a bit of an abstract guy, but Marx was really the genius, right? Um, uh, Fredrick Kango swells just a kind of year professor, you know, that Karl Marx was a sort of fact genius.

Speaker 1:          21:07          Really, uh, 45. Well, uh, even in Paris, the on, on bare above what they are doing. So they kicked out from Paris and then they go to Brussels. And here his angles when they met, uh, uh, uh, there is, uh, you continue to work a big change in, in 1945, there is some people say the epistemological break until 45 until the Paris manuscript, uh, uh, marks is still in some ways I hear galleon. Um, uh, now he's changing and he's becoming a list and he coins the term historical materialism to describe his, uh, position. One important piece is that exists on a foyer bar. I make you to read that. I think it is a fantastic piece of work, yet again, did not publish it. And I will explain to you why though it is brilliant, why he shied away and did not publish it.

Speaker 1:          22:09          It's intention with the main message about he tries to get through. Um, and then 45, five 46 together with angles they right again and other unfinished manuscript which was published only in 1904, uh, and even in 1904, only partially, um, the German ideology. Um, and again, uh, there are some extra ordinary pieces in this incomplete manuscripts then comes to year of revolutions. February 22, 24 and 48, a violent revolution in France. They sit down with angles and Viseon Ivy, they write the manifesto of the Communist Party. They just tell about the revolution should be doing. Uh, well this is enough. Bam flat, a pamphlet with a lot of disturbing statements, but the pamphlet with some very insightful, very important social analysis as well. Uh, a piece of work which cannot be ignored if can be hated. Uh, it was loved by many, but usually now it is hated.

Speaker 1:          23:22          But even if he hate you, hate it or love it, you better read it and you pay attention to some of the very important statements. And what is extra ordinary? This is a pretty long manuscript. They've were writing like crazy. I mean I think I'm a fast writer, but I could not do it in a week. Um, uh, reasonably polic punish a polished, especially in comparison with these other very, now he's expat from grasses, but he moves to the evolutionary Paris right on march the fifth or ready bud. That evolution continues. Mazda thirteens Vianna is in fire, right? Uh, but you have to wait on it to two days and Budapest in Hungary is in fire. The revolution is spreading all over in Europe. March eight, 18, it's already in Berlin bows, Vienna, Budapest, Berlin, whole Europe is in via, this is exactly what Max was saying.

Speaker 1:          24:23          He'd will be happening. Why there it is happening indeed. So Maurice and Angus returned to Germany. Now they will carry out the torch of that evolution. Now he doesn't class for, that's a picture of backbeat shirt of some of the revolution in bat is what's quite a bloody event. Uh, and here is a communist manifesto, the first edition and a February, 1848 when it was printed heart and distributed widely. Now, you know, when evolution doesn't last too long, in October 48, uh, Austria carries out a contract evolution. Uh, they are pressed that evolution in Hungary. Um, November the eight, there is a controlled evolutionary cool, uh, in Prussia that evolution is a, uh, depressed. And then December, 1848, they are, this is not a violent country revolution, but the French go and vote on elections. And the elected guy whose name is Louis Napoleon Bonaparte after as president of France, it was a very stupid way to vote.

Speaker 1:          25:39          Uh, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, whatever was the nephew of not, not pull down. Uh, uh, his father was Napoleon's brother, younger brother, and he was the king. He was meet King of the Netherlands until of course, Napoleon fail. And he was out sitting, uh, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, um, uh, grew up in Switzerland in exile a, it was not particularly smart person, um, uh, and cause a lot of trouble in France. Now here he is when he was president, later on he became right. Um, uh, uh, emperor of France, not Polandra hundred cured. He renamed himself and kept causing trouble. Yeah. Um, now, uh, remarks, uh, returned to Paris briefly and was hoping, you know, the French, eventually you will come to their senses and oversee over, through this jerk. Now, the French did not come to them that Sam says, right? Uh, it looks like the French occasionally do, do, do silly political things.

Speaker 1:          26:54          Slide the Jacobins electing Gooey, uh, uh, not, uh, not, uh, Napoleon Bonaparte. It was not a smart thing, but you know that for they have to move to London and that's where he published, spends the rest of his life. This is about, he has another go at the big book he wants to write. It is called the ground Resa. And Ivy, I'll ask you, which will be a little sweating to lead it. Uh, but I Braum is, I ask you to read the most readable part of their going to sir. So if you will have troubles reading what I asked you to read, remember the rest would be much, much worse, right? So you have to enjoy right reading it. I think I asked you to do the to read is extremely important to understand who the real mark says, right? There are many faces of Karl Marx and one of one article most clearly in different on this.

Speaker 1:          27:51          Then he has finally the book, but he overs wanted to do the scrappy tab in 1867 a. Then there is another revolution in France said the commune, and this is a real proletarian revolution. They're very much following what Marx and Engels wrote in the communist manifesto that are a few instances in history when two people can claim, we wrote it down and hear the masters put it into action. They did it in, in France and then order the NCC for marks created a political organization, what he called international international diverse organization. Eventually we refer to this as the first international with a Russian anarchist whose name is Bakunin a 70 Vonda is this proletarian revolution inspired by the communist manifesto. They proclaim our communal, uh, in Paris. It's not all that different from Soviet Russia or malware is China. The same ideas does not last too long, right?

Speaker 1:          28:56          In two weeks it is suppressed and overthrown. Um, and uh, Mark's dissolves the international, uh, that is a big fight between Bakunin and Marx. Uh, I think in this big fight mark Bakunin who is actually not very smart, but in the, I think in the debate Baconian is quite right about Mark's statism or too much believe in Marx about the government should do and Baconian is bottom up, right? Uh, Baconian is an anarchist. He believes in the ordinary people and he wants to get read of the State rather than doing stop by the state. Uh, anyway, they, they solved the first international. Now Betty, the defeat of Paris commune was a very ugly affair. Uh, people who were mass murdered, we, south tria not very nice stuff. Do, I mean the Paris commune, of course, you know, if you're as the anarchy staff saying now if you want to have scrambled eggs, you have to break a couple of eggs, right?

Speaker 1:          30:05          Uh, so if you have a revolution, occasionally you shoot. All right, well, it was shooting on the canoe. There was a lot of shooting after the you right. Uh, well after the commune, uh, uh, we have a conservative epoch in Europe. Um, Bismarck in Germany, right? The iron chancellor, Queen Victoria, right? Uh, uh, ethical conservative is a Kaiser France Joseph for the Blue Down Hole, right? So operetta uh, but very conservative guy. I have so many nice anecdotes about him. Too bad the course doesn't last two semesters because I could entertain UBIT, create stories about Kaiser Franz Joseph, uh, big trouble. The Guy, he primarily because the first world war out of completely stupid action and caused the deaths of millions of people, uh, in a bloody terribles cupid's war. Well about that is no room in this conservative time to revolution, right? The Revolutionary Marxism, Marx dies in desperation.

Speaker 1:          31:23          Actually, if you read the later very, his mind is gradually disintegrating. Yeah. Um, and he's buried together. We, Jenny, uh, in London Highgate cemetery, uh, you probable it. It was just, um, be some New York review of books on Highgate cemetery. Also names the Tom of Karl Marx. We stands that and Marxist goal now at postscript to the, then all the create a second international, uh, after his desk, uh, and NGOs created it, it eventually became what we call a social democratic international. It's still exist. Social Democratic parties occasionally meet on an international meeting for that via vendor. Democratic Corp Bharthi was a kind of Gfk Liberal Party. Even the American Democratic Party sent observers to the second international meetings, right. Bobby Kennedy was a kind of very sympathetic to second international. We're kind of considering, should not the Democratic Party join, right? The social democratic international movement, 1917, that is a communist revolution in Russia and 1919, they say second international.

Speaker 1:          32:49          This really sucks. This is not about revolution. This is about reform. We need a real revolutionary organization. They create the third international communist international, which lasts until the Second World War. Then Russia and the Soviet Russia needs the help of the United States to defeat militarily, Germany. And the US said, all right, but you dissolve the international. So they did this, solve the international, uh, that is actually a force international. I don't have time usually to talk about this created by their own Trotsky or, right. So that's about the life of a, um, one of our major author Karl Marx. And let me go on and talk about his theory of alienation. And I have my goodness, 12 minutes to do that though. I could spend, uh, in fact the semester on this, uh, uh, hell no. But let me try to economize with my time and I just very briefly run through what is, what is leading to the Paris manuscript and the theory of alienation.

Speaker 1:          34:02          And I really have to talk about alienation. So I, you'll skip a lot of stuff leading to the alienation. So I said he got is the point of departure for Marcy, theory of alienation, but there is a kind of intellectual project for the young Marx. Um, as I said, he writes, tries to write this book. He goes a critique of Hegel's philosophy of write this book. He got suggested that there is a, a, the CVS store servants constitute a universal class. It is a critique of the French revolution and the bourgeois society in which Hagle felt the workers and the capitalists are in athletics. That's representing particularistic interest and order can be brought into this only by civil servants, by the government who represents the universe of point of view. And Mark's criticized is this a book? Uh, then he writes on the Jewish question that he said, well, the state bureaucrats are not universal, but we need a universal standpoint.

Speaker 1:          35:12          We need universal [inaudible] emancipation. Uh, as such, that's the point of view. Then he writes this wonderful piece, introduction to the critical figures philosophy of ride. And he said, but Julio Curry how this, uh, uh, in, uh, you know, universal point of view. And it is the introduction for the first time in 44 January. And he said the proletariat, but people say, lie the proletariat. Goodness Gracious. That's when the manuscript comes here. You said to put all that Talia because the proletariat is the ultimate of alienation and because they are alienated, they have the interest to overcome Eliana nation. Well, I think I just have true Rushall IBM put this stuff on the Internet, but I really don't have time to get into any detail. I want to get, uh, in the last few minutes into the Paris manuscripts and this is the structure of the Paris manuscripted of 1844.

Speaker 1:          36:14          You can see the line of argument, right? How he's developing, right. Um, uh, his, his argument, um, what is really interesting from the parish manuscript is the first manuscript, which is 27 pages. It is on wages, profits, and rant and culminates with the idea of alienation. Uh, again, unfortunately I don't have more time to work more on a, on a, um, uh, um, uh, especially, uh, section four is crucially important. Now, the second and the third manuscripts, uh, uh, are of lesser important. Now the major teams, they, each profit and renter and private ownership, they all culminate in alienation is a reinterpretation of Hagle. Uh, alienation does not come from ideas. It comes out of material conditions of the nature of capitalist economy. And as I said, he does not have the notion of capitalism. It comes out of the nature of commodity producing commercial society, right?

Speaker 1:          37:25          That's where alienation is coming from rather than ideas. And the problem can only be solved if you fix the problems of commodity producing societies. And then he identifies four characteristics of alienation. And I've even talked to this, uh, wrong alienation is from the object of production. The second is the alienation from the act of production than any other nation. From species being, again, a very big word, God trumps reason in German. Uh, what, what makes us human? What makes us distinct from animals? That's what the notion species being refers to. And finally alienation from fellow man. Well, I have seven minutes to Labor on this. Let me do that. Um, okay. Um, cause I said he reinterprets he goes alienation. Uh, he got, wanted to overcome alienation in thought. Um, uh, alienation was a problem of the state of consciousness. Mark's wants to ground the theory in material practices.

Speaker 1:          38:35          Right? Um, uh, and uh, then, uh, and merge you said Ed alienation when Labor is becoming a commodity, right? Uh, uh, uh, uh, and uh, uh, [inaudible], uh, profit drive. So he come on me that span to be enter the stage of alienation. Um, uh, and the, uh, private property emerges. Well, I just leave this section out and let me speak to the four dimensions of Neisha and the next six or seven minutes. So the first point is that is um, you know, we are talking about commodity producing commercial society is to put it with Adam Smash. All right. Uh, or Marksville call it later on. If you take him one more year to figure it out. What is really the nature of the society is talking about, about already in the German ideology as we voc it Tuesday or a Thursday, he coins the term the capitalist mode of production.

Speaker 1:          39:43          So in the capitalist mode of production in a commodity producing society, um, the, the object which leads, produces labors product conference, the Vickers as something alien, uh, from him as a bower Elian of the producer, right? Under these conditions, this realization of labor appears as the loss of realization of the very care in sharp contrast with petty commodity production. The work of the Artism that diverse, what you produced is part of your own life. You identify with the part what you produce, right? You are a shoemaker, you are producing a beautiful shoe, right? You are proud of the shoe. You go to the church Sunday and you saw a nice lady walking in this beautiful shoes and you proudly say, this is my shoe, right? Then you are not alienated, right? When you are working on the production line and you are mass producing, uh, you know, uh, Toyota Camry, ah, you don't know what you produce shite.

Speaker 1:          40:56          It's an alien object from you. You put a little bit of worry, cried into the product and the product is not you any longer. It is something which is alien from you. Um, well, uh, of course not all of our work is national story. Aliana ate it. You know, if you are an RF, just if you are a scholar, you identify the right can you have copyright for the verdict, what you produce. But ordinary workers usually do not have copyrights, you know, they cannot license. They're very well Dave told you was it becomes alien from them. That's the point or the product. Well then you are also becoming area and in the act of production is that because Labor is external to the work at our different points in this, right? External of were Kelly does not belong to him. His intrinsic nature in his work, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not really develop itself.

Speaker 1:          42:01          You know, you say, well that's already uh, four 45, I have only 15 more minutes to go and then I am free. Right? Life begins when work ends. Right. You can see it, you go to the supermarket and the cashier hardly needs, you know, to get out of here. I was trying to buy, uh, last night, you know, a little beer, you know, and it was eight 45. And the cashier said, sorry, I cannot sell it to you. I said, why not? I till nine o'clock. He said he's ninth, nine. Yet she wanted to get out of there. Right? So it's alienated from the process of production, right? And Labor is not all on 30, but for us, right? Well for us, not legally you can starve, right? But if you don't want to strong and you want to have a place, a roof over your head, you have to work.

Speaker 1:          42:53          So it is forced economically. So it is not one. It is. Here is the right. Um, uh, uh, and uh, you were activity belonged to somebody else. It's somebody else, you know, go mass you who is the boss who tells you what to do and then you shut up. Right? Uh, and this is why, you know, in the act of production you have Eliana nature. The third one is that you are alienated from new species being off your human being. And now Marx has a teary of man in nature. What is man? And they in natural conditions, what makes us man as distinct from animal that are very different answers you can give. Uh, well, uh, Sheeler the German poet said, what makes us humans that the mo how to play. All right, pray makes us human. Mark said, what makes us human that via Varick labor, that the transform the material work to meet our human needs, a plan in our head, that's what makes us humans.

Speaker 1:          44:05          There are animals which kind of work like bs, but they don't work. Vieta plan it. There are only humans who have an idea of what my house, meal Beal. And then you build a house as you had the idea about it. That is the essence of human beings. And he said, the problem is that we in a commodity producing society, VR alienated from Labor but makes us human. So we are alienated from our very human essence. That's the most horrifying thing for marks in a commodity producing society. Right? Uh, and then finally the odd alienated from our fellow man. This is probably the deepest, um, uh, idea in the whole theory, right? Uh, namely that we are beginning to treat each others as object, right? As we are entering the world of commodity production, profit maximization, self interested individuals, right? Maximizing utility, right? And thinking instrumentalist around the world, right?

Speaker 1:          45:15          What are the most less expensive means, which gets us the cheapest to this end than the beginning to treat each others as instrument right? Now he said this is the versed alienation, which is new, right? It has, this is very important to see in marsh theory of alienation. It's not a general condition of humankind as Hagar thought it. Alienation is emerging in modernity. He does not have the term capitalism yet, or the capitalist mode of production. This is the characteristics of modernity and modern industrial and urban life that we are not interacting with each other as human beings, right? In an all sided personal relationships, but we tend to treat each others as objects, right? Between the other person as a sex object, right? Uh, the erotic complex relationship is reduced to a brutal act of sex, right? We treat each other as an instrument to reach an end, right?

Speaker 1:          46:24          The call, the others only then they need that person for something. Right? The act out of simply self interest in interacting with the others, the lack compassion that we lack love. Right. The lack sympathy. Right. We seem, you know, he probably did not read his Adam Smith's care of fully enough, right? It has not been reading Mark Smith until 44. This is where he's beginning to reach Smith's very carefully around this time in 44 [inaudible] you see the point that he's making and I think what Mark's describes in alienation, particularly alienation from fellow human being is something that probably some people in this room can respond to and to say, well, yes, I did experience that. I have been treated right as an object when I go to the admission office occasionally. Right? Um, an administrator like treats me like a piece of work that a piece of paper, right? That's when you are alienated, right? Then you becoming an abstract that than a human being. So that's in a nutshell, the theory of alienation that has to be will be up on the Internet, and you may want to dig into the whole intellectual development, which brings you to the beak of what he called the young Marx. Marx. The he galleon marks who is not a material is less yet not a historic on materials. He does not have the idea of exploitation. It does not have the idea of the capitalist model reduction yet. All right.
