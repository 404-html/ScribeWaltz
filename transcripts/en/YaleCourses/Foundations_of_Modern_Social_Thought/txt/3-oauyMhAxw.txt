Speaker 1:          00:01          Now let's go on to drone shot crews, soul and Emile and interact with me today. I need your help. I came back from Helsinki, Finland yesterday. I was 16 hours on the road. I then too bad 1:00 AM so I need your help. You know, I want you to interact with me and Emily is a good, a good opportunity to interact and get excited because it's a very important tax. As I pointed out, there is no education or theory base out the Russo's mal and uh, everybody who does education has studied Amiel from cover to cover. Most of them will disagree with most of his ideas, but you'll be provoked by his ideas. Um, uh, he is intentionally provocative, says date switch. Do upset you but makes you think and don't dismiss it too easy. Now, before I go into a meal, that is one more issue I would like to come back about.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Uh, uh, um, Russo, social contract. I made this point briefly in last lecture, but let, let me make it sharper because in the questions I am asking questions about the General Ville and I feel I may not have eva give, uh, give even enough meat to you, um, uh, about the notion of the General Vale now before I go. So I have to come back because there is one more um, uh, Chore Household Chore. Um, one of the teaching fellows that reminded me that the smiths lecture of come at the day. Then the test is you. So what to do with this? Uh, but I suggest, uh, uh, I will do a preview of Snitch, a jurist day this week and I will put my powerpoints before the lecture, um, on the Internet so you can read the powerpoints. Okay. That feel yet you up in speed. I hope you still, they'll come to the lecture though. Those of you who are also in varieties of capitalism course can skip because out of the 50 lectures I'm giving this semester, this is the only bond which overlaps. It is the same lecture, but I was given in the varieties of capitalism course. I hope you won't ask for a discount, right. That the professor did sell the same product twice. Right. Uh,

Speaker 2:          03:00          uh,

Speaker 1:          03:03          but anyway, so those who did that lecture that they feel very comfortable with Swiss can miss the lecture, but I hope everybody else, we will come Tuesday. Alright, now, uh, Emile and this is something, uh, uh, no, no. Does the gender reveal the gender reveal? I didn't finish this file so that it is right. An interesting, uh, um, corn, Shasta development in little show, in the theory of social contract, uh, because it was so especially emphasizes right that the social contract has to be arrived at, uh, uh, by uh, um, a universal consent. Uh, so he does emphasize that in that I've into a social contract. Um, we actually, uh, have to exercise some popular Suva identity and this is an idea which is only an element in lock, right? In some ways, Russo moves a big step forward, contract theory and theory towards democratic theory, popular silver ethnicity.

Speaker 1:          04:19          And in fact, universal suffrage I mentioned he did not advocate suffrage for women, but advocated otherwise universal suffrage. Uh, what block was not willing to do. But there is an interesting other idea in Rousseau, which is, uh, has, uh, important Kennel of tools and a very disturbing the audio at the same time. And this is the idea of the genital Ville. I talked about this as a good example of metal dialogical collectivism, right? That Rousseau unlike, um, uh, uh, Hobbes or Locke or vive you'll see later on meal or Adam Smith does not believe that studying the individual actions, we can understand what is society and what the need of the society ears that is a general veal over society, which is more than simply adding up all individual bills. Um, and these idea carried on in social theory among those whom reveal, discuss, particularly by Emil Durkheim. And that is clearly an element of truth to it, right? That there is some universal good, right? Uh, what is more than just a sum total of individual interest?

Speaker 2:          05:54          Um, uh, when we are, uh,

Speaker 1:          05:58          you know, talking about how scared that form, right? And the needs of government's right to provide health care for everybody. Right? Uh, then the actually do believe that it should not be left to individual responsibility whether they have house get insurance. That would have to be, some people in this room probably believed that. Right? Uh, then you believe that that is a General Ville, right? That you have to overrule rather individual, uh, to, uh, uh, to, uh, make a decision. And you know, that is the genital veal everywhere. When you go to the college, you have to get certain shots. So that was, you are not allowed into the college, right? It, it is not living up to you to decide, right. Whether you are, had certain shots, they cannot, you have to demonstrate to be in residence, right? That is a general veal. It's not assume that every individual is a rational actor and people will not be foolish.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Right? And be irresponsible and not to be up properly protected. You see, this is a strong case that the idea of genital veal makes sense. That is some collective good. Uh, but we can understand that individual's occasionally has to be forced to go by these general bill right by the public. Good. But there is a big carb. Love it. The general via namely if that is a general veal as such their own earth, will it come from a how they will know what the general deal is. And Russo is an explicit about this rat. He confronts it. That's why he talks about the law giver. He said, smart people like me, we know what is good for society and therefore we should figure it out. But the genital Ville is and then the popularly elected parliament will pass. It is a law, but we are the law givers.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Right? Well this is a very disturbing idea, right? And and disturbing idea, which opens a Russo up to a totalitarian interpretation that he argues that the government knows better. And in fact he argues that not the government but the device philosophers, v the intellectuals, we know better but people into the star. You think this is your interest? No, I tell you, this is not your interest. I know. What is your interest? There are, this is a very disturbing idea how owners do I know what is annual interest. Uh, and of course, uh, Russo's notion of general veal appealed a great deal to Karl Marx and Raji middle each learning and Moussa tone. They love the idea that it is the central committee of the Communist Party who knows better than ordinary Chinese or Russia what their needs are. There must be a central planner rather than individual actor, which tells people what their needs are. So the problem of genital Ville is highly problematic, right? You can hit, you can make a case for it that you need an assumption like that. As I pointed out, that our people in this room, right, who believe that that is general villa and the common good, right? Other people here,

Speaker 1:          09:39          anybody believes ah, that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. There are people in this room of course, uh, uh, and that other others who would not be Dave, that, I mean, if you add an econ major, I think you got enough in economics to say no, no, no, no. Never, ever. Uh, um, okay. Now let's go to Mel because it's actually has something to do it, a different formulation with the same idea. So what is the story about Mel? It's uh, of course he himself is shock. Um, and uh, he doused us that he is a cheater, a Alpha boy, Mel, and educate him from the early age is on theall reaches adult hood and finds his wife Sophie. I told you of course that this is a very idealized Rousseau because he put all of his children in to orphanage, employ a very lousy orphanage and probably most of them or all of them very early died in this orphanage. But you know, uh, he's still has ideas what he should have done if he would not have been a bastard and will not have that band on his children. So what is the table of contents first? He says, well, we have two rare, a civilize savage, a child born in the state of nature in infancy and Chai. Two and three of the lessons is a gradual transformation from the state of nature into society. Uh, then, um, he, uh, Ben, uh, adolescence comes then we have a fully form App Tomeki individual by now and we have to bring that person into society.

Speaker 3:          11:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:47          And then, uh, he has these very complicated idea that this transition from the anatomic individual and state of nature to severe society is that transition from our more the salon to are more pro per a val. This is a very complex concept. Russo could have been more lucid about what the difference is. Then he laws, uh, uh, also, uh, from English. You think you understand it more easily than you actually do because proper in a, in a franchise does not mean proper. Proper also means myself. Proper only means myself in consideration with others. Soya beans myself, besides consideration of others, right? So be careful, right? Uh, um, were proper is not proper love, right? It is a self lava, but of a self love in which I do take into consideration. I have had not only Egl to put it with, uh, uh, Sigma Fried well, and it has to happen otherwise we will not have citizens.

Speaker 1:          13:19          He links this idea of AML proper ivy. We'll have to talk about this more in order to have citizens. And he makes a crucial distinction between the citizens and the bourgeois. This is again, uh, the two faces of who saw, right? One phase of loose. So is, uh, uh, a radical Democrat, uh, deeply democratic individual. And the other faces, uh, uh, left radical and he's the first really as far as I can tell, but I reasonably know, uh, the literature of the slams, the first who is using the term bourgeois in a pejorative way and makes this crucial distinction between citizen and Bourgeois. Uh, and [inaudible] are the selfish businessman, right? Who wants to have money and do not have a commitment to the collectivity who do not obey the genital Ville, but pool, so selfish, narrow economic interest. That's bourgeois in some ways. He gives the tool to Karl Marx, right, to develop his theory, as we will see later on. And March, of course, loved Rousseau. Not only Marx, Durkheim love to sue as well. I mean that are many people who love this character, the, his,

Speaker 2:          14:58          um, uh,

Speaker 1:          15:00          shortcomings of his character. Well, uh, what our domain teams, uh, the first important tms nature is good society Vichie score rops very important proposition. Um, very powerful proposition. This is something what the marks also takes from Rousseau. And this is what Durkheim also takes from, from those short, uh, fear of death is not natural. He continues, uh, if the, it is forced on us, forced on us by please, philosophers and doctors. And the first task is Magothy education. Bell Ivy will elaborate on this. I'll just foreshadow these block of ideas. The second one is, now the task is to turn the savages, mobiles, savages. That's a noble savage, right? The value, we'll show you an idea into social beings and from Amada swap to I'm were proper bell thought makes our social, it's a lovely idea. Provocative, ironic. And I just love it. What makes us social is pity.

Speaker 2:          16:23          All right.

Speaker 1:          16:24          And Ivo labored on this. It's really so, so wonderful.

Speaker 2:          16:29          MMM.

Speaker 1:          16:32          And the big question is, can the be citizens out being bourgeois? What is the distinction? And then, uh, he said, what is civilization? Civilization becomes coacher them sexy sublimated into imagination. It's very important. Yeah. I feel labor on it then. I, I hope you will be able to relate to it as much as I am. Um, uh, the right, uh, he said that are really two processes which makes us so shot, pity and love, but not sex. It is Aerotek love, which is in your mind as much as, as, as, as, as a newer sexual drives. And then he suggest love develops in three stages. Uh, and I think that this is absolutely wonderful. Uh, uh, again, and I didn't know, I certainly, I, I can relate to this rally, val. Right? Um, the first stage is that you, you aren't in love, but you don't know yet it home.

Speaker 1:          17:50          Uh, you write an ad d for love and you are looking for somebody to be loved, but you don't really know yet. You did not identify it. But that is a sense, right? That's your art in law. Well, uh, it happens certainly for the first time in adolescence when they are 13 or 14, and we suddenly realize that there is a romantic stuff, but we don't have the object of our romantic feelings, right? We have to find this out, but it happens actually overs them. Uh, one force in lover. Can I tell you as an, as an old man, it will happen later to life as well that are rarely one love in life. Right? Okay. Then, uh, he says, um, a lot of brings different people together on the basis of differences. Uh, this is very much a dear Connie and idea, right? Uh, for what binds people together can be, there are differences and it makes it very provocative argument.

Speaker 1:          18:59          Uh, men and women are different. It's mostly, he's mostly Rad as a mere shoving his bastard. But, uh, it's more complicated than this. And I can your show you text, but we will make you think, ah, this out completely dismissing him just on some very damaging quotations. What I also will show you, all right, so nature good society corrupts, uh, well. People in nature are good. Uh, society corrupts well, this is the opposite. Are you man, uh, uh, to, um, uh, hops or in fact, you know, Durkheim's, uh, idea that you need, um, uh, uh, uh, more control over our society is also post to, um, uh, uh, Russo's fund on an idea. And he said, well, in a child does not know vice and doesn't know error. Um, it is introduced to the child by society. And then he got though he was not much of a believer.

Speaker 1:          20:15          Uh, he, uh, gives a bit of theological argument. Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the author of things God and everything degenerates, um, in the hands of man, um, mandarins everything upside down, right? He wants nothing as nature made art, we are being cool to get rid of our national national now national natural instincts. Um, uh, and this is again, lovely, right? Men must be trained like a school horse. So it's a lovely also, I think you sense, right? [inaudible] is very important distinction between training and education. Right? Um, once I had a conversation with Danielle Bell have famous social scientists and he said, we were talking about graduate students and he said, you know, my colleagues said, all of us talking about training graduate students, he said, what an outrage. You educate students, you don't change them, you train a dog. Now that's through source point, right?

Speaker 1:          21:39          Training Sydney to giving skills and telling them how to do things right. A is changing. Uh, the point is education and I hope, you know, we tried to do in discourse a bit of education. That's why I don't emphasize that you have to go back and memorize, you know, the citations from the orders come in and in the blue book quickly copy in, but you memorize and bill immediately forget right after the test, what often are expected to do that is training. Education is the process in which we force you to think on your own, right? That is education. And he said, well, the problem is that that is too much chaining. Right? Uh, like, you know, cutting back to cheese, French garden, you know, they caught back everything. What grows right. Uh, to fit, you know, the, what they flew, mutual beautiful image. It is or there's not unnatural.

Speaker 1:          22:42          And I also like this a great deal then you have, you will not agree with this is a theater of death is not natural in nature of unaccept sits right. Russo agrees with hops. Yeah, indeed. Driven by the fear of this. But this is not natural. He claims that animal accepts deaths right now by that it is true or not. That's another question. I mean you're, you may have seen, uh, you were a dog die. You go and you have seen fair in the eyes of a dog. So I, I'm not so sure how correct Russo's observation is, but there is an element of true story, right? That uh, uh, Bob follows when they know it is time to die. You know, they go on their own and they lay down and wait for death in a peaceful way. That's what he suggested. He said, what is put into us? I think it's a wonderful deep idea. The fear of theirs by philosophers, doctors and great idea, right? It's an a very important idea that we are ruled by people who will not Polis different type of knowledge. And the essence, the, the power of knowledge is that it put fair of Daesh into us. The doctors who will say, well, ideal cure you, right? Uh, the right and the police who will say you will burn in Hell and therefore you will, uh, fear of this.

Speaker 2:          24:16          Uh,

Speaker 1:          24:18          he said, you know, naturally, uh, he would know how to suffer and how to die, but we are being sort of indoctrinated to fear this and have anxieties in my life. Now, uh, this is why we need the negative education. This is a very provocative idea. Became extremely popular in the 1960s and seventies. Those of you who do education probably know Yvonne earlier trick, right? Is pushing it to, uh, to the, as far as you can, right? But in the kind of counter cultural educational theories, it was very important that what you need is negative education. You have to get out of doors. Silly ideas from people's mind was so sad put in there. Uh, and he said, this is again, a lovely citation, how didactic and pedantic craze is all of us to teach children, but they would learn much better by themselves and to forget what via long could teach them. All right. Uh, so this is again, education is giving an opportunity for people to use their mind rather than indoctrinating them.

Speaker 2:          25:42          Uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          25:46          and therefore he said the first act of education should be purely negative, right? It goes, it's not at all in teaching virtue and a true sales, but in securing the health from vice and the mind from error, that important.

Speaker 2:          26:07          That's right. Uh,

Speaker 1:          26:10          the task of education, not training is not good. Tell you what the truth says. Right? The task of education is to help your brain operate sufficiently to tell what is an ever right and to figure it out. Then you are making gun at her.

Speaker 2:          26:31          Uh,

Speaker 1:          26:32          that's why that is no easy solutions. That is no right answer to the question. There are competing answers to every important question, right? And the task of education is to consider the pros and cons to consider what speaks for and against the evidence. And then to make a judgment, what is the proposition? Uv like set, right? To try to eliminate error. That's what education is all about.

Speaker 1:          27:07          Okay. Now, and I'll do an issue is about commands. And he said, and again, I love it. There shall be no commands. The words or bay and command, there'd be proscribed from the lexicon and even more so duty and obligation that he provocative. But again, I think very deep thinking about it very hard, right? He said, what we really should be in the process of education do is to emphasize your strengths, right? The emphasize necessity. We emphasize in we without we, we tried to figure it out. What is outside of our reach, what we cannot do, we emphasize constraints, realistic constraints upon our action, right? Um, uh, that is the idea of what should happen in, in education. So, uh, the argument, this is your duty to do that is the wrong way to approach, right? It's not what the educators should do to appeal to people's, uh, um, uh, guilt feelings to create deals in them.

Speaker 1:          28:28          Maybe I'll talk about this more in Nicha right there. The guilt feelings. It's coming from a no, don't create guilt. Uh, but on the other hand, there are people what is necessary? What are the limitations of your action? Emphasize what you are capable of doing and cottage them to get the best out of them. But all of us warn them that I don't see that you can really go that far. Don't push yourself too much because you won't be able to make it. That's what he believes education is. Now this is a turning savage. It's into social being. Moving from our more this swap to are more proper. The labile. Seth, I'm more, dishwasher is all of us good. That is nothing wrong about it. What Adam Smith's view call right, south internist. Um, now, uh, the child is bored with [inaudible]. [inaudible]. [inaudible] it's mine, right? Chad? We say this is mine, right? This is on ward the swap. I want it right. I'm more just swap as you will know from

Speaker 2:          29:50          uh, um,

Speaker 1:          29:54          fried. I Vonda abreast of my mother. Right? I want to monopolize. This is mine, right? That's amore the swap.

Speaker 1:          30:07          Well, both on the other hand, uh, we have to extend our relationships, we have to interact with other people. Um, and I'm more, uh, the proper, the then v realize that is another people who are also led by our more dis swat and the figure it out, the way how to live with them, uh, by interacting with them. Now that are, how does it, well, does sociality them come from our more proper valve? Does it come from? And there are the first maximum is it is not the human heart to put ourself in the place of people who are happier than the, but only of those who are more pitiable. It's so ironic, but as far as I can to a whole neuron, this is a home run, right? Think just Betty honestly about yourself. All right, man. You know, somebody was more successful that which you can't. Very hard to love that person. All right? If somebody is less successful than you, you feel pity for them. Suddenly your hearth farms op Sadhana in youth theater responsible, right? Suddenly you want to call.

Speaker 2:          31:40          All right. Uh,

Speaker 1:          31:44          the second maxim, one bit is the others, only those eels, Ron, which one does not feel oneself exams. So we don't necessarily led by [inaudible] van VC misery. What is sort of outside of our possible experiences. We, we have love for pitiable people than we think we can actually end up in the same situation. That's where the will have a more approach. And the third maxim is now the pity one has four, another misfortune is measured not by the quantity of that misfortune, but the sentiment, one attribute should Dortch who suffer it. Right. Um, so I think that's wonderful idea. And now about compassion and pity. One more time. You said the airborne twice once to exists and second time to live for Spanish. If species reproduction and the young adults become sensitive before knowing what he's sensing, uh, is now a man truly born to live fan it beginning to experience the others.

Speaker 2:          33:08          MMM,

Speaker 1:          33:09          soil. It is actually our weakness. What makes us social not that stinks. It is our common miseries, which turns sour horse. You feel managed, I think really ironic but very deep ideas. You can disagree with it, but you have to think about it. This, that is clearly an element of tools in the argument.

Speaker 2:          33:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:35          Uh, okay. Uh, and I also love the last sentence here. He said, PT is CV. This is one of my favorite of sentences or so. All right. If he's so sweet to feel pity for somebody. Oh, I am so sorry for you. Right. Then you were heart this overflow, right? Yes.

Speaker 2:          34:01          All right. Uh,

Speaker 1:          34:06          no. And then the citizen and the bourgeois, this is again, fantastic

Speaker 1:          34:15          [inaudible] dot Astros. Ron's fourth council of 300 ads. Here's the fitted not elected in the 300 representatives in Sparta. He goes home, then lies tid, uh, that were 300 men, verse Yoda, then he to be founded Sparta. This is the citizen are U s citizen. Uh, when you only got a B minus and there are 30 people in class who got an a, do you feel how fortunate I am? The time is such a great class. The 30 people are better than I am. Right? If you'll figure it out today, you are a citizen, right? Then you'd have a lot onward roper, right? That is his point. And then another woman had five songs in the army and was VT news of the battle. The hallut arrives scrambling. She asks him for news. You were five songs very killed, and now she answers this slave. Did I ask you that? The volume, the victory the manager runs through the temple and gifts thanks to the guards. This is the female citizen I children died, but the warm the genital Ville.

Speaker 1:          35:56          Well, uh, he who in a CVO order wants to preserve the primacy of the sentiments of nature, does not know what he wants. All of us in contradiction with himself. If you will never be either a man or citizen, he view would be a bourgeois. He, there'll be knotting. That's what Karl Marx loved, right? People who just pursue their own self interest is not much. No men be men. Sexuality and love. Now symbolization becomes sculptured when sexy sublimated bodily desires turned into imagination, they will see that is greatly inspires Zigman fried. There are two mechanisms which constitute social compassion, pity, and love. And he also adds a, a very provocative idea. His time in the kind of foreshadows postmodern. So enlightenment, the Metal Giles is the hoods deprived from its meaning. It's a cool, the rational world of the marketplace, right? And competitive, isolated individuals. That's what modern word, enlightenment, produced and delivered became unerotic and poetic.

Speaker 1:          37:28          This is something which will be a big row in Mexico. Weber's idea of this enchantment. Uh, or if you know mark, who's a wonderful book Arrow since civilization come straight out of Rousseau, Rousseau wants to bring back the Aerotek, not sacks, the Aerotek experience bell. The lab develops since three stages. As I said, crest versus a dressed. You are in love, but you don't know yet to be at home. Again. Think back, you were 13 or 14. Uh, you begin to search for somebody to love. Then comes the discovery. You found it. That's it. That's the person I am love with Emil. Find Stuffy, but brings them together. He said, is the differences right? That they compliment each other? Uh, Durkheim be lag you. It can be similarity. What brings us together. Uh, it's a more complex argument, but the origin of the idea is in rows.

Speaker 1:          38:34          So then the company's Dean bought them by once you fall in love, dawn thrush, right? As I said, not sex ed course is what is really the leaf, right? I don't trust you. Two beds go to channel. All right? And then when you travel, you think about the person you love, you idealize that person and your mind and that's when you is this love becomes an erotic experience. Then you can go home and you can consume the love, right? I think this is reality. A wonderful well and here comes a problem. Ah, his views on gender relations.

Speaker 2:          39:22          Oh,

Speaker 1:          39:25          bell men and women a difference. And that means that they ought to be told differently.

Speaker 2:          39:34          Uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          40:08          All right. Uh, um,

Speaker 1:          40:11          who wears the hat in the family? This is the kind of argument right now. The men are the bosses after at all,

Speaker 1:          40:49          hard to say. He's not the sexiest pastor. The man is me. It's specialty to please man. Ah, Val, I'm sure at least half of the man in this room are also outraged and I think probably often outraged. Uh, but I hope that other man in this, you'll not only me who is upset by this statement. Well, he said the men and men are made for one another, but that mutual dependence is not equal.
