1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,850
If saw that med school on to John Locke,
um,

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,870
uh, an order major, uh,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,760
scientist and a,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,890
another major founder of political
and social philosophy and theory.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,680
I do again, what I did
with hops, a Vr, again,

6
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:31,260
do briefly for those who are not
interested in lives and history.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,150
So first I introduce you,
uh,

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,740
are a friend today, John Locke, a,

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,950
he was born in 1642 in Somerset.

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,090
Uh,

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,090
his father was a captain
and a parliamentary or army
are kind of small gentry,

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,540
uh, uh, math, particularly
ballsy but not poor either.

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,610
Uh, uh, in 52, uh, he went to Oxford.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,980
Um, and uh, it was noted, uh, that, uh,

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,250
he was idle unhappy and on the
rare mark Qubole in Oxford,

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,101
well,

17
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:21,660
if you do not have a
4.0 at Yale bonds panic,

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,740
right? You still can be right. John Law,

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,920
there are somebody who blossom later.

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,780
He was lead blossom or a,
but he,

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,700
by the end he was doing
well. Um, and in fact, uh,

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,640
he, uh, uh, became, uh, an, uh,

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,780
official, uh, you know, uh,

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,310
English universities
called teachers officials,

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,360
officers, even at Yale, you know,

26
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:59,250
we are called officers
of Yale Corporation, uh,

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,320
kind of, I think your old
English tradition. Um, anyway,

28
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,780
he was admitted and then in 64,

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,110
he gave an address to the college.

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,650
And this is a very important
address because this is
when he can learn the views

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
of younger John Locke and cried
career from this address that in fact,

32
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,950
early in his life he was very
traditionalist and quite authoritarian.

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,740
The kings are good and
the people are beasts.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,900
So in a way he was hopsy
and, um, in fact, you know,

35
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,901
in the two tatties he
stays away discussing cops.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,150
But of course the ghost of
hops is all over the place.

37
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,280
Right. Uh, there are actually more
seats in here and that's okay too.

38
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,790
So you don't have to sit on the
steps if you want to. That's fine.

39
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,693
Uh,

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,530
uh, a little about the times, uh,

41
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,450
49, I already mentioned
Charles first was executed.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,340
Um, uh, the monarchy was abolished
for that time. Oliver Cromwell,

43
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,920
um, uh, uh, became lord
protector of England.

44
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,150
Uh, um, but, uh,

45
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,880
he was very popular among many.
Uh,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
he really could not control the struggle
between the military and the parliament

47
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,440
and the cows. Uh, a hops experienced,

48
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,590
um,
in the 30s and early forties.

49
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,640
In some ways continue with the past,
probably not as bad as before,

50
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:57,380
but was still very bad.
Belvin Colombo died.

51
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,640
His song tried to become Lord Protector,

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,350
did not succeed.

53
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,940
And finally it was decided to
call back Charles First Song,

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,210
Charles the second to
become king of England.

55
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,790
So the monarchy was restored.

56
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,623
MMM.

57
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,380
So these were remained turbulent years
and of course the kind of turbulence,

58
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,920
a dusk color of what,

59
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,380
uh, uh, uh,

60
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,120
lock stood for now,

61
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,260
just a picture of Oliver Cromwell for you.
Um,

62
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,730
and then Charles Second,
uh,

63
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,580
who have a skin graft
England for a 25 years.

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,840
Um, now that is a new haven
court action to all of this.

65
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,660
And not all of you may know that,

66
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,653
uh,

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,740
but I'm sure everybody knows about it.

68
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,780
They really have anu Wales
and that a golf street is now,

69
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,040
this has something to do
with England and John Locke.

70
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,243
Uh,

71
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,950
two of the judges of the
trial of Charles Wong,

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,450
Edward Bailey and Villiam Golf,
uh,

73
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,780
we would accused of regicide and they
escaped England in 1660 and they went to

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,450
Boston. Uh, now they did their own choice,

75
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,290
right? The event where horror Var this
rather than going very earliest. Okay.

76
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,023
Uh,

77
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,780
but Boston was an unsafe place,
uh,

78
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,250
too much under the control of the crown.

79
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,410
So therefore the went to the right place.
Right. And that can it be, of course,

80
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:48,244
new haven.

81
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,680
So they came to new haven and you
probably know where West rock is.

82
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,610
Anybody was up on restaurant,
few of them.

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,400
Now Invest Doc,

84
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,400
you'll see a sign be tess Josh School.

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,150
So if you go that,

86
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:11,151
that is a little cove and that according
to the legends Vallely and golf high

87
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,220
did in these school. So here you go. Uh,

88
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,260
history comes back home.

89
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,850
Then they moved actually to
Milford and lived in a house there.

90
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,680
And I have the picture of this house.
I don't spare my life on it,

91
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:32,100
that this is the house in the
day did, but that's what, uh,

92
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,960
uh, some historian, they'll me. Okay.

93
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,040
But that is a turning point in the life
of John Locke in 66 when he meets a

94
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:47,771
formidable person whose name
was Anthony Ashley Cooper.

95
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,810
Um, bell, he was a high Aristo crat,

96
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,950
but he never, dls was anti royalist. He,

97
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:02,600
Joe joined the parliamentary
forces against Charles the first,

98
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,980
um, and was also a member
of the State Council, uh,

99
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,710
during the republican times,

100
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:14,711
but he supported the restoration of
the monarchy in 66 and held very,

101
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
very high offices between 60,

102
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,040
60 and 76 three,

103
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,690
including the position of lord chancellor.
Uh,

104
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,360
well, um, uh, he became, uh,

105
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,040
the Earl of Shaftsbury, uh,
out of the grace of the king.

106
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,240
And usually he's referred to as
the Earl of chefs spirit. Uh,

107
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,190
they only in 60, 60 event
to Oxford, um, at Duke, uh,

108
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,130
have a cure for his liver disease.

109
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,350
And this is when he met
John Locke as a doctor.

110
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,500
Um, and, uh, John Locke
became a, his physician.

111
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,540
And let's put it this way,
his friend,

112
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,630
probably a bit of a strong statement
because the social status difference was

113
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:10,850
too big to really call it as a friendship.

114
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,650
But Ivo say a word
about that relationship.

115
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,450
And here is, uh, um, uh,
the Earl of Shaftsbury, uh,

116
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,570
now, uh, in [inaudible] 67, uh,

117
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,640
lock move to Ashley's house at Exit
Your House in this trend in London.

118
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,810
And I'm sure those of you who visited
London knew exactly that this trend is

119
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
that still where sort of the legal
establishment can be found in London.

120
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,780
So he lived there in his household,
like, you know, in feudal times, uh,

121
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,070
clients live to the master's
house and eat on the master stable

122
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,960
or with other servants, stable,
even a high ranking people.

123
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,010
Occasionally we're not a
little to eat right. Uh,

124
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,270
with the Lord.

125
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,640
Now he became Ashley's
confident advisor and surgeon.

126
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,860
He performed a surgery.

127
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:18,270
And I think medical scientists
are still puzzled, uh,

128
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:23,271
whether this was some
pathbreaking surgery or vetter.

129
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,280
Uh, he just had good luck,
uh, ad that it helped. Uh, uh,

130
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,240
um, um, Ashley, um,

131
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Ashley had a surplus production of his
liver and he implanted a tube into his

132
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:45,051
abdomen area to let this surplus flew
out and certainly actually felt much

133
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:49,590
better after the surgery. Well, uh,

134
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,570
we know that occasionally the doctors
say the surgery was successful and the

135
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:59,460
patient died. Now this was a
case when the patient was cured,

136
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:03,410
but we don't know about that. The surgery
had anything to do with it. Right? Uh,

137
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,440
but, uh, uh, for those of
you who are in sciences,

138
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,540
this is just a proof that in
the 17th century, you know,

139
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,630
there was really, I didn't know
distinction yet what sciences are,

140
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,250
what philosophy is and what
the social sciences are,

141
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,630
was a difference,

142
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:25,620
what theology was and the
rest of the knowledge was.

143
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,230
But the rest of the
knowledge was all the same.

144
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,010
And sort of lock was also a scientist.

145
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,770
67. He wrote an essay,
the essay on toleration,

146
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,810
and this is a departure now from
hops. These actually advocates, uh,

147
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,060
uh, uh, the right to dissent
as we have seen. You know,

148
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:53,210
not that hops at all costs would
have resisted every descent,

149
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,250
right? You remember we discussed
that that hops also conceited.

150
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,620
If the king does not deliver,

151
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,690
you can't transfer your loyalty from
the king to another stupid fun. But,

152
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,110
uh,

153
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,110
the essay on tolerance does not simply
make it as a such an exceptional case,

154
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,730
you know, uh, but it makes a,

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,760
makes a big argument that the right of
the sand is an important individual.

156
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,570
Right?

157
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,570
He was also then elected in [inaudible]
68 as member of the Royal Society.

158
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,390
The royal society is like
what in the United States,

159
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,780
we call the American Academy of Sciences.

160
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,950
Pretty hard to get into
it. Uh, it was then,

161
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,130
and it is now and 79,

162
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,060
and he was already working. And, uh, uh,

163
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,410
the second [inaudible], um, uh, uh,

164
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,140
or assume or lead to some of,
are talking about this,

165
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:56,050
there is some debate when
the first studies and the
second draft is well written

166
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,460
and that's not irrelevant actually.
The timing of the two essays,

167
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,160
they all, they've also,
uh, on the other hand,

168
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:07,600
that conflict between Charles the second
and the parliament. And Earl of chefs,

169
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,560
birdie. And of course by
implication, John Locke,

170
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,930
uh, Charles the second had
only illegitimate children.

171
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,780
He had quite a few of them, right? Uh, uh,

172
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,190
I don't know whether he liked children,

173
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,090
but it looks like he liked
the technology at least.

174
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,190
Uh, they are, uh, uh,

175
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,680
therefore, you know, since the
children were all the legitimate,

176
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,390
the legitimate here to the Troon Vasa,

177
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,010
his brother James.

178
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,550
And the only problem with James was that
he was Roman Catholic and we already

179
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,660
know from hops that this was a big
trouble at that time in Britain.

180
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,520
So,
uh,

181
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,820
the parliament and chefs Bertie
himself fear that Roman Catholics will

182
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,460
restaurant that influence and that
for the parliament's role there'll be

183
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:14,110
reduced. Um, um, and then in 70s, three,

184
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,300
uh, they, uh, the parliament was
considering a Socon test act.

185
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,330
And this is really an ugly act,
right?

186
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:26,740
Because test act man that you have to
be tested whether you are Roman Catholic

187
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,610
or you belong to the Church of England,
and if you are Roman Catholic,

188
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,610
then you should not hold certain offices.
Right?

189
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,690
This is just still discrimination.
But you know,

190
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:42,130
at that time it was kind of
defense against the Vatican
and the role of the pool.

191
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,440
Uh, well, uh, um,

192
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,893
uh,

193
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,390
because Shaftsbury support for this,

194
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:54,680
he was dismissed as lord chancellor.
Nevertheless,

195
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,150
a few years later, uh,
the parliament, uh, uh,

196
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,390
does pass the exclusion bill
and they asked reporting,

197
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,140
uh, James, one of the
illegitimate children, um,

198
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,040
are for chars as a successor to the truth.

199
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,460
Now, um, and this is James Stewart, uh,

200
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,700
the blood or of Charles the second,
and this is the other genes,

201
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,840
the Protestant Shaftsbury sprouter Gee,
well,

202
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,480
the Commons facet of law and Charles,
the second death,

203
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,430
he dismissed the parliament. Uh, uh,

204
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,830
well Shaftsbury was at acid,
a boot into the tower of London.

205
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,360
Uh, you probably, if you've arrived
in London, you visited the tower,

206
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,080
or at least at the look at it,
um,

207
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,020
and after he was released was smarter
than to stay in England who went to a

208
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:58,960
right place. I actually have like his
stage, the event to the Netherlands. Uh,

209
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,170
if I had to be exiled, I would prefer
it to be in Amsterdam before places.

210
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,140
Uh, okay. Uh, um, uh, in, uh, uh, uh,

211
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,640
83, uh, uh, the Vix,

212
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,890
the vix at that time where the kind of
the Democratic Party by the Tories were

213
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,510
the Republican Party,
right.

214
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:24,740
And the vix were the equivalent
of the Democratic Party. Well,

215
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:29,741
the big swirl accused to
have been involved in a plot
to overthrow the king and

216
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,020
some of them we would execute it.
That was the right, right house plot.

217
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,120
There are lock was smart enough,
he knew he may be next in line.

218
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,430
So he also made the right choice.
He van to answer that.

219
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,520
Um, well, again,

220
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,870
I don't swear that this was exactly
the house where the plot took place.

221
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,920
I even not sure if the plot took place
at all or whether this was an invention

222
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,360
by the authorities there.

223
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Then there is that evolution in 88 and
William of orange becomes the king.

224
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:11,930
Yeah. Uh, um, uh,

225
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,740
well the problem was the gym's a second
did not realize that even the Tories,

226
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,220
VNF support his religious agenda.

227
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,110
So he was actually overthrown.
Um, and, uh, uh, then,

228
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,470
uh, the Republicans and
Democrats, I'm sorry,

229
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,370
the Tories and Vicks came
together and, uh, uh,

230
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,160
they invited William, uh, uh,

231
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,970
to become king of England.

232
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,560
And here it is a very
unstructured and the, uh,

233
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,150
the color, uh, Queen Mary, uh, uh,

234
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,110
uh, uh, his wife, uh,

235
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,520
was very much involved in politics and
important and locked down now can return

236
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,430
to England. Um, and, uh,

237
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:05,410
he felt safe and, uh, uh, uh, uh,

238
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,380
60 90 to do so. Well, uh, I've,

239
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,990
you've talked about this later.

240
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,020
The second Chatty's May actually be a
reflection of the change to the house of

241
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,833
Orange,

242
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,220
which is a change from absolutism
to constitutional monarchy.

243
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,870
And therefore the second track,

244
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,920
this can be read as an ideology for
a constitutional monarchy rather than

245
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:36,710
absolute designer, but that this
is the case. It is being debated.

246
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,970
A lock died in 1704.
Interestingly, uh, you know,

247
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,970
he is a major booker and the two
charities on government was published,

248
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:50,830
uh, um, uh, and, uh, uh, uh,

249
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,243
uh,

250
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,150
60, 90, but, uh,

251
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,090
is it was published anonymously.
You've was concerned enough,

252
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,310
even at that time, uh, that, uh, uh, uh,

253
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,730
he made on in could trouble if
he publishes his book. Okay.

254
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,360
Now I'm here, we'll be talking about
the, the two charities and the,

255
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,980
and the Varick now.

256
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,550
Whoops.
Oh,

257
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,393
of course.

258
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,980
Yes,
of course.

259
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,993
Yes.

260
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,580
Okay.

261
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,290
So this is the duties of government,
uh,

262
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,300
reject. Shorty was appeared
in print in a 60, 90,

263
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,870
as you can see on the
first edition. Now, uh,

264
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,880
as I said,
that is a debate about it.

265
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,860
When the first and the second shut
these was written and, uh, uh,

266
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,470
there are two major
locked scholars, uh, uh,

267
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,240
bull spent all of their lives studying
loch beat. The last letter, uh,

268
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,320
suggested that the second Chatty's
was written really first in the 1679.

269
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,590
It was all engaged in the debates
about the exclusion bill a while.

270
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,730
Um, the Chubb Ashcraft to, uh, uh,

271
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,110
he was, my colleague at Ucla at
one point died. Unfortunately,

272
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,840
very young billions scholar.
Uh,

273
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,350
actually he argued that the second
year this was written in 1683.

274
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,620
Um,

275
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,620
and it is an evolutionary work that this
is really the theory of constitutional

276
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:50,021
monarchy and kind of popular Suva entity
is being formulated for the first time.

277
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,550
This is really in strong crash,

278
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,570
almost absolute negation
of, of hops. Well,

279
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,600
not quite absolute disgust at some
overlaps between the two arguments,

280
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,770
but they both agreed that the first,
that this was written in 1680,

281
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,850
that's on uncontroversial,
um,

282
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,410
and was published anonymously.

283
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,480
So, uh, the first, uh,
tease, uh, um, uh, well,

284
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,880
um, IVL not to speak too
much about this. Uh, uh,

285
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,220
the second that it is really the big text,
uh,

286
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,400
everybody reads and sites. But
the first that these, uh, uh,

287
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:39,050
takes on a book, uh, published
by 16 and 80 by Robert filmer.

288
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:42,440
This looks to me,
to me and very arcane book,

289
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,130
but surprisingly it is still in print.

290
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,010
You go on Google and you can
buy a robot filmers, book,

291
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,330
Patriarchy. There. I don't
necessarily recommend it a,

292
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,430
because I think this is really archaic
and I don't think it got any major

293
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:05,851
contribution beyond challenging lock
to formulate a strong position against.

294
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,240
That's, I think the only reason why
you may want to read patriarchy.

295
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,800
Now.
Uh,

296
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,410
he was very much for absolutism
and the absolute monarchy,

297
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,810
and he advocated actually inequality.
He said,

298
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:27,340
God said some man above others
and he meant men, right?

299
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,110
Men are set over women,
right? Uh, and, uh,

300
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,610
older people like me are set over
younger people like you, right?

301
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,670
And the king over everybody else,
right?

302
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,630
So this inequality of
power is coming from God.

303
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,860
God decided that Aiden inherits the earth.

304
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,860
And then the sentence of Aden,

305
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,910
the sons and grandsons received
their share of earth's right.

306
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,760
So you'll have to show your family tree.

307
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,530
Going back to Adam who
received the, the, uh, uh, uh,

308
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,820
word as a grant,
and who was the first king?

309
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,780
So the king should trace their
family trees back, right?

310
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:14,960
To the first person of grace of God.
All right?

311
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:20,010
So there was a scripture argument that
God vested Paternal Authority in Aden,

312
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,930
uh, gave the earth as a grant to him. Um,

313
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,800
and the monarchical absolute
power is inherited this way.

314
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:33,070
That is the scent of the
monarchy go power. So I said,

315
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:37,390
I see very little right
relevance of this argument.

316
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,310
Uh, so I, I,

317
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,830
but certainly it was important
for luck to have a astrue man,

318
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,650
right? He could fees his
argument against, um,

319
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,520
uh, probably spent too
much time, right? Um,

320
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,050
debating filmer.

321
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,110
And you may have been a bit concerned
about this theological controversies and

322
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,320
theological arguments in the
book, but otherwise, you know,

323
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:10,321
he's really formulating the first big
ideas for modern democratic theory.

324
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,990
Okay. So, uh, uh, now Lark as,

325
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,740
uh, engages, uh, uh, filmer, uh,

326
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,180
on a number of level,
um,

327
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,160
it actually engages him on the
theological level and he said, well,

328
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,920
it's Anshu, uh, that Aiden,
uh, received the land.

329
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:38,720
There's grant,
it was mankind who received the,

330
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,900
the land is a grant from God

331
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,320
and then he moves on and he,
uh,

332
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,780
kind of, uh, makes, uh,

333
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,490
a more technical argument
is that they are,

334
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:57,491
even if we assume that it was one single
male who the of land and all authority,

335
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,500
uh, how a nurse, you can trace
your yourself back to this.

336
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,920
This is not a real good
way to legitimate somebody.

337
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:09,530
How can Charles the second
shows, that's, you know,

338
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,370
he has the answers to the survey now,

339
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,160
so that is not the right way
to do. And then he said, well,

340
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,760
even if it could be done, it
would be silly to do that, right?

341
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,790
Just because somebody is the
proper ancestor should not have,

342
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,030
should not be this juvenile. What
if that person is a jerk? Right?

343
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,430
Then you really want to have the right
people, right to exercise authority,

344
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,050
right? It's a right in his Stan, you know,

345
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,700
a very daring argument.

346
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,650
Now let's have a look at the second
Chatty's and the major themes.

347
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,660
What he's like, like, uh,
uh, engaging. Why cops,

348
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,550
he begins with the statement,

349
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,920
we are all born equal and he has free,
free and equal.

350
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,120
But as we voc he throws a very
different conclusion than hops,

351
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:08,240
dead or by and large,
different conclusion.

352
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,250
And then here does equity.
The clock that we need,

353
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,930
um, uh, uh, common
superior, uh, uh, a silver,

354
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,150
silver and a superior is
necessary to avoid, uh,

355
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,450
the state of war.

356
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:29,150
Then he develops a fascinating theory
of property, what we have to deal with.

357
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,370
Uh,

358
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,370
and then he makes these
pathbreaking aren't humans,

359
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,460
um, that, uh, uh, what we
need is a rule by majority.

360
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:45,140
He does not quite identify what
that, that majority is, right?

361
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,080
This is not popular sue veracity yet.

362
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,530
But the idea of rule by majority for the
first time is formulated by John Locke.

363
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,850
And acceptance of authority can be done
only by consent and what is needed.

364
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,150
And this is the very
big contribution of law,

365
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,140
a separation of powers,
checks and balances, right?

366
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,230
This is what is completely
missing in hops.

367
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,070
And he's making these past
breaking, um, uh, argue man.

368
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,510
So yeah,
are all born free and equal.

369
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,500
Let me speak to this a level now.

370
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,240
What is political power?

371
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,590
And he defies these three elements
of political power, right?

372
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,690
Well, uh, this is, uh,
uh, the right to make law

373
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,740
that is also execution of law.

374
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,640
And that is also politics means the
defense of the common vast against outside

375
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:49,730
enemies that are these
three functions, right? Uh,

376
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,860
politics is serving and this will be very
important in his sort of divisions of

377
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:59,040
powers as such. Now, ah,

378
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,180
Bell, if he want to understand
their political power,

379
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,630
political power is we have to see at the
origins of political power and to try

380
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:14,880
to understand why owners,
people from the state of nature,

381
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,890
where they were free and the claw move
into civil society where these two

382
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:20,864
rounder,

383
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,770
some of their freedom and veal Vivia
CVL surrender some of that equality.

384
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,380
So, uh, what is the origins of this, uh,

385
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,500
uh,
equality bell?

386
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:38,190
The first argument is very
much counter hops, right?

387
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,060
Men all well at all made
by God the omnipotence,

388
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,560
right?
And we are his rapper.

389
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,910
The account of theological
argument and the are not,

390
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,660
have not been created for
the pleasures of one another.

391
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,120
So there should not be any men who is
a superior, right? But then support.

392
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,920
All right, because we are free,
right? The lock is a liberal,

393
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,400
right?
Hearts is a conservative.

394
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,130
So what we are experiencing now,
right,

395
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,400
is the transition of philosophy
wrong conservativism to liberalism,

396
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,580
right? And liberalism, of
course we'll emphasize,

397
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:25,440
but particularly freedom
is the primary, uh, uh,

398
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,510
uh, value. Uh,

399
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,610
and in the state of nature,
he said,

400
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,420
we will all governed by reason and I eh,

401
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,870
and that actually sort of
because we are all reasonable,

402
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,760
the are born the reasonable you
are born to be able to be rational,

403
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:48,843
right?

404
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:54,000
They should be able right to understand
that they are not supposed to harm each

405
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:58,820
other is it is a very different
arguments. But what we have seen, uh,

406
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,270
uh, uh, on from hops on Tuesday, right?

407
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,680
A hops said that we are
actually learning more reality,

408
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,210
uh,

409
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,160
out by interacting with others
who are desiring the same stuff.

410
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,850
What we do, we are learning
it from struggle, right?

411
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,170
He does not assume that this
comes out of our rationality.

412
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,980
That we are reasonable and by nature good.

413
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,530
He does assume that we are reasonable.

414
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:32,550
Therefore why owners be should not
know that we should respect others.

415
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,800
Well,

416
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Bot and this then is where law comes
the closest to converge with the hops.

417
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,530
Well that is on the other hand,

418
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,620
a danger that that ear will be have
a war and in order to avoid war,

419
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,470
this is why the real subject
ourselves to an authority.

420
00:29:56,081 --> 00:30:00,370
And leave the state of nature.
Uh,

421
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,623
uh,

422
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,730
but he also makes a claim just
to distance himself from harps.

423
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,380
He said, that's not, that's the state
of nature is necesarrily war. Right?

424
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:15,460
They have to make a distinction between
the state of war and state of nature.

425
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:19,980
We've got no state of nature of are
good and reasonable, but nevertheless,

426
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
uh, it, uh,

427
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,610
it can turn into a state of war and
that's why we will have to join civil

428
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:30,820
society, um, and accept and authority.

429
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,500
Well,
and now comes again a very big difference.

430
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,260
So he accepts the danger of war.

431
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,410
He lived in times of war and he accepts
that we need an authority because,

432
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,960
um, after this, uh, now, um, but, and,

433
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,560
and now you come to the
big differences. Well, uh,

434
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,840
the live, uh, we, we
subject ourselves to, uh,

435
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,290
authority, uh, of others,
but this has to be,

436
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,370
has to be done by consent, right? Uh,

437
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,500
those who are,

438
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:13,530
who are accepting a server and have to
consent to the subjugation to authority.

439
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,040
Uh, and the last citation
is also extremely important,

440
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:21,281
right?

441
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:26,281
Freedom of men on their government is
to have a standing rule of liberty,

442
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,173
right?

443
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Come on to every one of that society and
made by a legislative power erected in

444
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:38,620
it, right? So the legislative power,

445
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,920
now this is the source of [inaudible]
is somehow in a proper way constituted,

446
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,243
right?

447
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,350
This was not a problem really for a hops.
Not much,

448
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:50,980
right?

449
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,980
He could see that that will be simply
confirming a silver entity to a single

450
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:57,634
king.

451
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,850
Now lock is very interested how the
silver and the source of power to pass

452
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:07,090
legislation is being constituted.
And again,

453
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,480
he's emphasizing which was
not in hops but is important.

454
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:14,560
The standing rules to assure liberty,
right?

455
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,990
Not simply survival,
right?

456
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,360
Davino hopes had it a more complex way,
but liberties the major issue.

457
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:22,990
Uh,

458
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,990
but we are seeking for now
and then he comes to it,

459
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,220
an interesting guy.

460
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:34,810
The or why do we submit ourselves to
authority and seek protections for our

461
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:38,680
liberty because we want
to protect our property.

462
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,780
That's the role of the public
authority to Platek covered the,

463
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:48,781
it's a very realistic and the important
assumption aggression and which he and

464
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:52,010
Karl Marx would probably agree.

465
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,170
What is that all of the governments
do guarantee the sacredness of private

466
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:58,004
property.

467
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,600
And he has an interesting ideas about
what property is that it is coming from.

468
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,220
Very important.

469
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:12,221
This foreshadows Adam Smith's in some
days also foreshadows Karl Marx in another

470
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,610
day.

471
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,410
Now he starts with this idea that men
had given the word two men in common,

472
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,070
and therefore all the fruits belong
to each member of the society.

473
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,320
It's almost trite a socialist
ideology, right? Um,

474
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:35,000
uh, and, uh, he continues
along these lines.

475
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:40,520
He said every man has a
property in his own person,

476
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,390
right? And, uh,

477
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,470
the label of what you produce is yours,
right?

478
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,900
The productive you labor belongs to you.

479
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,750
And you will see this is
the first formulation,

480
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:58,751
what we bill learn from Adam Smith and
Karl Marx as the Labor theory of value,

481
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:04,100
right? Libor belongs to
the Labor, right? Um,

482
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,760
uh, as, as such, uh, uh,

483
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,200
because it was created by what is yours,
the only thing,

484
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:15,050
what certainly is yours, and this
is new. We're on body, right?

485
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,910
And you labor in capacity.

486
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,620
He's had an for this labor being the
unconventional property of the Labor.

487
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:30,380
Uh, and then this is a beautiful
citation. I just love it, right?

488
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,423
Uh,

489
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,760
do the water running in the fountain
be every once yet who can doubt?

490
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,210
But that in the picture is
his only who do with that.

491
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,910
Bingo. Right? How crisp
Billy in once sentence,

492
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:50,480
right?

493
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,480
He can capture these wonderful
idea that libor creates the value,

494
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,420
right? Wonderfully done. And of course,

495
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,070
great influence on Adam
Smith and Karl Marx

496
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,310
there, but there are also limits
on private property. Again, he,

497
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,810
he almost reads like a socialist.
Uh,

498
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,030
he said may anyone and gross
as much as CVL a dovish,

499
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,160
shy answer, not soul, right?

500
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,400
God has given us all things richly

501
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,060
hell, but how far has he given
it to us to enjoy, right?

502
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,770
And whatever is beyond this is more
than your share. You have only,

503
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,560
uh, in your, uh, belongs to you.

504
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:47,070
What you can actually enjoy nothing,

505
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,790
but you accumulate these radical idea.

506
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,250
If your back paddle in a minute,
right?

507
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:57,690
I'd be show you how he backed
out of this very radical idea.

508
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,810
But, um, uh, um,

509
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,090
now I,
and the chief Macha is of course ers,

510
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:10,790
he said it's absolutely obvious right
at the property belongs to those who can

511
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,080
cultivate it,
right?

512
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,790
As much land as mental plants improves,

513
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:21,230
cultivates and can use the production
of so much. This is Blah burpee.

514
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:26,600
So the land belongs, it's not another
notion of private ownership of the land.

515
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,530
It's an ownership by the cultivator.
And also,

516
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:34,910
let me just point out why running
out of time there is a very important

517
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:39,620
difference here, right? But essential
for four look argument is the abundance.

518
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,570
He can make this argument because the
primary assumption is that what we desire

519
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,390
is available in great abundance to us.

520
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,690
We have seen that hops had
the opposite idea, right? Uh,

521
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,960
we are fighting each other because what
we actually desire is a scarce good,

522
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,430
too many people want and then we
kill each other to get it right.

523
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,640
So that is a scarcity assumption in hops.

524
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,350
And there's an abundancy a hypothesis in,

525
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,440
in lock and you have to make up your
mind who is appealing to you more. Uh,

526
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:19,770
do you think that the scarcity assumption
is a better one or the abundancy

527
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,300
argument is an empirical
and more dealing one?

528
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,570
Well, and then he, as I said, now he back
backpedals he knows he's going too far.

529
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,640
He said Bud Brigade, remember God
gave the word to man in common,

530
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,260
but since she gave them for
the benefit, uh, well, uh,

531
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,260
he basically did it to
the industrials once.

532
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:46,070
So those who are very hard there
shouldn't get more rather than who does do

533
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,310
notary that hard.
And then he actually will go,

534
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,920
um, uh, uh, further, um,

535
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,100
labor creates value.
Right.

536
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,900
And the argument is right that everything,
uh,

537
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,390
what has been created as a
value has been created by a,

538
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,450
or almost everything. That's
interesting kind of equation at the end.

539
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,450
Uh, right. Um,

540
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,030
the products of the earth's
used food to life of man,

541
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,320
he said nine tenths are
the effects of labor. Well,

542
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,330
I don't know if we felt that be
it certainly about, well what,

543
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,830
what that really means and why or nurse,
she makes a claim.

544
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,300
But now and here comes a
very big qualification.

545
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,280
The invention of money at cumulation
of property becomes possible,

546
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,200
right? And therefore, as a
accumulation of money occurs, uh,

547
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,020
well,
uh,

548
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,970
then wells can be hoarded up
the south injury to any wall.

549
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,380
And this becomes, again, very
important, right? For liberal theory,

550
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,600
you can't do anything by which you
do not injure somebody else, right?

551
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,370
But shouldn't be prohibited.

552
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:08,350
And where government should send in when
they sense injury against somebody else.

553
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,273
Right

554
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,570
now,
in order to preserve property,

555
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:20,320
you will have to transfer power to
the community, to civil society.

556
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,010
There are some very important arguments
here. It has to be by settling.

557
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,010
Standing rules has to be written down,
has to be agreed upon,

558
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,120
and it has to be permanency.

559
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,350
There must be a permanent
suppose goes through.

560
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,030
You need a predictable environment,
uh,

561
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,600
and it has to be the same to all parties.
You cannot make a law,

562
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,920
which applies to the surface and the law,
which applies to the noble man.

563
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,120
It has to be the same law
for everyone. Um, uh, uh, uh,

564
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,330
such, uh, well, um,

565
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,400
and this is the origin of a legislative
and executive power of civil societies.

566
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,620
Well, uh, there is a difference
between, uh, uh, absolute manner.

567
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,910
He, uh, and constitutional monarchies.

568
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:17,760
He said in an absolute monarchy,
you can appeal to the law, uh,

569
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,140
to restrain violence against you
by another subject of the crown.

570
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,240
But he said in an absolute monarchy,

571
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,230
you cannot really appeal against the king.

572
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,140
That's what, you know, in
communist societies, you
could not sue the government,

573
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,970
right? Even in Stalinist Russia,
you could saw your neighbor,

574
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,360
if your neighbor did school
steal something from you.

575
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,970
But if the government is
steer anything from you,

576
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:48,280
you could not sue the Soviet government,
right?

577
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,960
But a democratic system means
this is foreshadowed here.

578
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:55,000
If you can sue the government,
right.

579
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,320
And of course in the United States
they can sue the government. Well,

580
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,800
you can try it. We are not
over. It's very, but, uh,

581
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,870
good luck avail.
Um,

582
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,440
and then he says, this is
fun and very, very good.

583
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:15,843
Well,

584
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,850
the thing that men are so foolish that
they care to avoid plus miss chiefs can

585
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:26,170
be done to them like your
neighbor polecats or focuses,

586
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:31,590
but our counter not to think of the
safety of divorce by lions as crazy lions

587
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,560
are the kinks, right? The big authorities.

588
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,990
So don't just seek,
um,

589
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,120
laws which protect you against
your neighbor. See Clause,

590
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:48,950
which protects you against those in
position of authority and power. Uh,

591
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,200
right. Uh, and that not we would
be no civil society unless,

592
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,770
uh, uh, this, uh, uh, bands, well,

593
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:02,510
he advocates than the principle
of rule by the majority, right?

594
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,910
Uh,
well what we need,

595
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,040
I can't sent of every individual who
made the community in order to create

596
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:14,920
legitimate through, um,
uh, and once these, uh,

597
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,860
is, uh, uh, arrived at
and that you're bound, um,

598
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,173
everybody,

599
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,060
uh, uh, uh,

600
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,270
and the bond can be subjected
to authority only by consent.

601
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:36,150
They are, this concept can be passive
is not necessarily all of us. Uh,

602
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,410
explicit. You are born in the
United States. You did not approve,

603
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,840
right? The constitution of
the United States, never.

604
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:49,240
The less you have to obey the
constitution of the United States,

605
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,020
you have one chance not to do so.
Uh,

606
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,300
you can move through Afghanistan
if that's what you prefer, right?

607
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,600
So you don't have to go by American law.

608
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:03,100
You can live under Islamic law.
Then you move to a country,

609
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,040
the world by Islamic law.
Uh,

610
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,660
and then the final major contribution,
the separation of powers.

611
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:15,430
And he makes a distinction between
three types of powers, legislative,

612
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,950
executive,
and federative powers.

613
00:43:17,951 --> 00:43:21,940
That's very different from Montesquieu
and different from the American

614
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:26,470
constitution right there. The three
branches are legislative, executive,

615
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,810
and judicial power. Uh,
he makes that claim, uh,

616
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,310
that the turn branches federative power.

617
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:38,530
Federative power is a defense
against outside enemies. And he said,

618
00:43:38,531 --> 00:43:43,270
look, but it's important that legislative
power and executive power has to be

619
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:45,420
separated from each other.
Uh,

620
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,430
it is absolutely as if it is the same
person or the same authority which passes

621
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,760
the law and which also executes the law.

622
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,700
We have to separate those. Um, uh, and,

623
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,310
uh,

624
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,143
oh,

625
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,660
val, I don't have time to go
into this. Uh, uh, uh, uh,

626
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,750
it's clearly enough. Uh, and then
that is the kind of federative powers.

627
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,460
As far as the federative powers
are concerned. He said, well,

628
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:21,461
the federative powers may not be
necesarrily separated from the executive

629
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:22,850
branch.

630
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,200
It can be actually held by
the executive branch as such,

631
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,690
as in many ways,
it is the key.

632
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,960
It's very unclear in the United States
who actually has this federative powers,

633
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,880
right? By law, it is the congress,
which can declare only laws, uh,

634
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,530
wars.
But as we have seen,

635
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:48,000
the United States was engaged in a
number of major military actions,

636
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,710
but commonly we call wars,
though the war was never declared right.

637
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,350
And it was the executive branch,
right,

638
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,180
which they fuck to a declared
war and conducts war.

639
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,220
Uh, occasionally we saw the consent
occasionally against right. Um,

640
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,300
the, uh, Bill, uh, of the, uh, uh,

641
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,600
of the house and the Senate.
So it's a complex issue,

642
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:17,480
but I think he was quite
right that, uh, uh, often, um,

643
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,780
the federal active power and
executive power are the same.
