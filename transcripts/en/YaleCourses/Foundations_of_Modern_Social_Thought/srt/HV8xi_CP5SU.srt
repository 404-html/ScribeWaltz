1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,940
Okay.
So today is about the notion of anime and,

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,630
and Anna Amuse seems to be
a very simple notion. Um,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,410
um,

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,410
animal meat means the state of normalness
ness and therefore it's very easy to

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:23,030
interpret. It looks like it is very
easy, easy to interpret them and Ami, uh,

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,050
ivy or show that's far from
the case. Uh, uh, in fact,

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,590
Durkheim has a pretty
complex notion about, um,

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,830
uh, abnormalities, uh, um, uh,

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,190
in the transition to and market economy,
uh,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,210
in the transition to modernity.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,390
But before I do, so let me come back
to the issue of the division of Labor,

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,610
uh, in, uh, in Durkheim, um, uh,

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,260
um, uh, though, um, you know,

14
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:03,180
he stages the book,
we had the idea of collective conscience,

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,220
um, and, uh,

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,610
goes along blanks explaining why he's
using a law as an indicator of collective

17
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,531
conscience and be discussed at great
lengths when it comes to describing the

18
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:24,270
different of the crucial differences
between mechanical and organic solidarity.

19
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,260
He doesn't make much out of it are,
uh,

20
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,850
what drives the analysis of the,
this, this distinction, right?

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,020
Bri, modern and modern
societies. Uh, to put

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,110
the closure criteria is
actually the division of Labor,

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,710
but drives the story is
the division of Labor. Uh,

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
so in this sense,
in fact,

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,440
I think Durkheim can be understood as
being greatly inspired by Adam Smith.

26
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,210
Right?
Who also,

27
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,020
so evolution of human
societies as you recall,

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,260
as a gradual evolution
of the division of Labor.

29
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,940
I do again just does not offer such
a complex or sophisticated Betty or

30
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,220
digitization of society's flight hunting,

31
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:22,221
gathering and animal husbandry
and agricultural and commercial.

32
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,190
He just makes these bipolar distinction
between mechanical and organic.

33
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,290
But if you ask,
well yes,

34
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,110
there is a difference in the legal system,

35
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,280
but what is fundamentally
different is the division of labor.

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Mechanical Solidarity has little division
of Labor based on similarity of the

37
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,580
actors in the society.
Uh,

38
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:52,290
organic solidarity has a great
deal of division of Labor and,

39
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,590
and uh, uh, uh, agreed
deal of the Similac,

40
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,930
the similarity of the action.

41
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,940
And this is puzzling
because the question is,

42
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:05,941
if it is such a high level of division
of labor and such a great diversity there

43
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,470
on earth, solid additive will come
from how we hang together. So that's,

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I think we should appreciate how important
the division of Labor for Smith from

45
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,210
Durkheim was. Uh, by
the way, in some ways,

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,250
even the early Mark's, uh, in, uh,

47
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,240
uh,
the,

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,240
the German ideology also tried his
stereo digitization of society with the

49
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:40,450
division of Labor. So I think this is
also the influence of Adam Smith's.

50
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,070
So I seen that as a clear
Adam Smith impact, uh, on, on,

51
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:49,870
on the vertical of Durkheim,
uh, on, on, on the types of, uh,

52
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,780
uh, a solidarity. There is also
another issue I would like to, uh,

53
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,530
mention. Um, uh, uh,

54
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,220
I pointed out that how important,

55
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:04,780
right Montesquieu avast
for Durkheim and uh, um,

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,400
it's, it's obvious. He ethnologists
is that two Montesquieu,

57
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,420
uh, start, uh, the book,
uh, Vietnam, uh, uh, um,

58
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,510
uh, uh, uh,

59
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,230
collective conscience and the
notion of, uh, um, uh, and,

60
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,240
and law as the best empirically a
observable indicators of this collective

61
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,540
conscience comes of course, directly
do Montesquieu, but that is an odder,

62
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,310
uh,

63
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,970
less frequently notice
the impact of Montez Cure,

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,820
uh,
on Durkheim.

65
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,190
And that makes actually a very
interesting orderer for us today.

66
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,440
Uh,
as I mentioned,

67
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,450
I met really has an impact today with
his later Varick as the cultural or an

68
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,970
analyst.
But in his early Virg,

69
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,990
he responded to an
other, uh, Eh and eh, uh,

70
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,350
stimulating idea of Montesquieu.
And that is the, uh,

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,950
uh,

72
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,950
interaction between social system and the
environment and the ecological system.

73
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,460
Uh, I mean, uh, I vent at some lengths
in the lecture on Montesquieu, uh,

74
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,470
to show how important it was and how
unique Montesquieu his contribution was.

75
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,790
Ellen, how important it is for us today,
though he made it in a very naive,

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
a Durkheim actually has a much more
sophisticated and complex understanding,

77
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,100
uh, off the relationship
between an environment.

78
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,170
Um, and, uh, uh, uh, society, uh,

79
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,230
and the type of source of solidarity
and the Division of Labor in society,

80
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,360
uh, or on, unfortunately,

81
00:05:55,361 --> 00:06:00,361
this is a sort of a neglected
element in Durkheim too bad because,

82
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,960
uh, in fact, uh, you know,

83
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:07,961
the problem of environment and studying
and environment should be a central

84
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,600
issue in economics,
political science,

85
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,880
sociology and anthropology.

86
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,050
And it is not quite as
central as it should be. Uh,

87
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,110
especially I think in political
science and sociology and anthropology,

88
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,970
the study of the environment is too
narrowly focused on environmental social

89
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,440
movements. There are, there kind of
has a different interesting thing,

90
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,310
uh,

91
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,310
which I think a should inspire a
social researchers be the economists,

92
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,020
political scientists, sociologists
and Anthropologists. What is it?

93
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,450
Their time in the division of
Labor has a core of an idea,

94
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,350
but one can call the ecosystem,
right?

95
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,731
Uh,

96
00:06:55,731 --> 00:07:00,731
he sees a interrelationship
between the physical environment,

97
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,130
the size of population,
which lifts in this physical environment,

98
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,620
the technology which is used, uh, uh, uh,

99
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,750
in these environment and the division
of labor and the type of social

100
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,440
organization,
what we have,

101
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,310
what kind of social solidarity you have.

102
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,680
Let me just put this on the blackboard.
Uh,

103
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,950
I think this is a rarely naughtiest.

104
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:32,951
You will rarely here in
Durkheim's lectures or rarely
read about this when you

105
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,700
read, uh, uh, uh, about Durkheim. Uh,

106
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:41,840
so the idea here is that you
have, uh, uh, the environment.

107
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,640
You have the population,
you have technology,

108
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,250
and you have social organization,

109
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,700
and it's constitute a system

110
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,110
which interacts with each other.

111
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,693
It's,

112
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,730
and what ought to be studied is reality.
This whole system. And you know,

113
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:10,810
of course technology has a lot
to do with the division of Labor,

114
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,813
right?

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,420
And that's what can be called the
ecosystem. I, he doesn't call it this way,

116
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,680
but environmental researchers would
call it today as the ecosystem.

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,490
Um, and I think this is an
extremely productive way, uh,

118
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,420
for social scientists to think about
the problems of environment. Right? Uh,

119
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,580
and let me give you an example. Uh, uh,

120
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,890
why don't you think about
southern California, right?

121
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,420
Southern California,
uh,

122
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,560
before the Europeans
appeared on the scene,

123
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,580
it was a very, uh, uh,

124
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,020
dry climate suffered from
the lack of water resources.

125
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,350
So the Los Angeles basin probably could
accommodate a livelihood for something

126
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,420
like 20,000 people,
right?

127
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,320
These 20,000 people,
right?

128
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,350
Lived in this very arid environment,

129
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,790
loose used very elementary technologies,

130
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,430
and very had a very limited
division of labor. Uh,

131
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,270
so the population size was greatly
affected with the technology and the

132
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:31,050
environment,
and they had mechanical solidarity.

133
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,050
That was the way how
society was organized. Now,

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,640
today, uh, we figured
out how to solve the, the

135
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,100
hydraulic problems for the Los
Angeles basin for the time being.

136
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,653
Uh,

137
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,610
don't hold you abreast because in
no time we may have a major crisis.

138
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,050
So in the same bed as it based
in 20,000 people live now,

139
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,760
20 million people live,

140
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,960
but the live with a very
high level of technology, uh,

141
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,530
we successfully pollute
the air, which is, uh, uh,

142
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,110
write a hard,

143
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:14,970
hard to breeze in downtown Los Angeles
during a hot summer day. Right.

144
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,520
Um, uh, and we have of course, um, uh,

145
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,390
organic solid Daddy Thi
operating right large and the,

146
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,050
you know, manage to screw the environment.
Thank you quite nicely. You know,

147
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,720
and we keep doing it in no time.

148
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,690
The La base in VOB on inhabitable.
Right.

149
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,980
That's why I think it is
interesting to think about, uh,

150
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,970
these do Camian idea of ecosystem,
how it interacts. As I said,

151
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,130
it would offer you a very rigorous
scientific field framework,

152
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,690
uh, to study the interaction
right. Between Social Organization,

153
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,640
the demographic pro problem, the
technological issues, right. And,

154
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,230
and uh, um, uh, and it's a
relationship how we can leave,

155
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:06,180
if he can be useful, if it
the environment. Anyway,
it's just a backdrop because,

156
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,070
uh, uh, uh,

157
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,470
to show again the sensuality of
the division of Labor for time.

158
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,660
Now today I will talk about,
uh, um, annual me. Um,

159
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,580
and anime is one of the abnormal,
uh,

160
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,230
concept Vance's, uh, for,
uh, the division of Labor.

161
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,820
Uh,
and well,

162
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,070
this is a one off the troubling
aspects of Derek Hansen. Eric,

163
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:37,410
uh,

164
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,410
the whole idea of abnormality or
social better ologies and he has been

165
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:47,240
criticized about this. I agreed the, um,

166
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,200
how do we know of what is abnormal and Ho,
Ho,

167
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,770
Ho how on earth can we tell what
is the normal state of sociality?

168
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,350
Pathology does assume,
right?

169
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:04,351
There's social researchers has some
way how to judge what is the house see

170
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,450
condition for society.

171
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,530
And this comes from Durkheim's,
uh,

172
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,660
early functionalism as I said,
right?

173
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,990
He was greatly influenced by biology.

174
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:21,220
It was not a biologist my any means.
But as I pointed out,

175
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:25,780
the whole metaphor of organic
solidarity uses the human body,

176
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,210
right? And as the example, right? Uh,

177
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,330
how in the human body,

178
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,370
divers or guns depend on each other to
reproduce each other and therefore better

179
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,940
divert pathology is also
borrowed from medical sciences.

180
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,960
So [inaudible] we all have
better logic or features as well,

181
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,350
and there are abnormalities in society
and somehow believes that social

182
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:58,381
researchers will be able to establish
what abnormality is and what better bet.

183
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,430
Bet apologies are. This is, I think,

184
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,620
troubling for most social
scientist, right? We first,

185
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,650
we seem to have some commitment to at
least value neutral type of analysis,

186
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,670
right?
We,

187
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,670
in which we do not labor
necesarrily phenomena out,

188
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,510
right? You know, labeling theory,
you may have heard about it,

189
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,920
uh, you label something as
criminal or abnormal, uh,

190
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,810
simply because it's probably
unusual in society. Um, what bots,

191
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:39,811
what was abnormal in one society may
become absolutely normal in another

192
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:45,240
society. So we have to be
extremely careful, right? We,

193
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,420
the notion of normal and abnormal,
uh,

194
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,830
let's say,
uh,

195
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,900
being gay until fairly
recently a vos scene,

196
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,360
I mean,
except a antiquity,

197
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,810
but for most human societies and most
of the cultures being gay is seen as a

198
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:07,990
kind of abnormal behavior.
Today,

199
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,870
very few people will think about this,

200
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,420
at least in a country
like the United States,

201
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,310
that somebody gay is an
abnormal, right? Uh, uh,

202
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,090
so what sexual behavior is normal or more,

203
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:25,690
more depends on the times,
right?

204
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:30,691
It's really not the job of the social
scientists to be able to decide,

205
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,980
you know, what kind of sexual behaviors
should be called normal or abnormal.

206
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,400
The best we can do.
Why owners,

207
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,440
some people call some sexual practices,

208
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,160
abnormal law and order's normal.

209
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Why is there differences in our society
accepting some kind of sexual behaviors

210
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,260
and not the others?
Right. That is a question.

211
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:02,210
Was social scientists good study
anyway, this is a, I think literally,

212
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,230
um, um, uh, a problem, uh, in, in, uh, uh,

213
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,840
for contemporary social
scientists, uh, uh, uh,

214
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,970
Durkheim's Rurik.
But anyway,

215
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:17,450
he did believe that he is capable to show,
uh,

216
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,430
that some abnormal development do
take place. He was a specialty,

217
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:27,380
as I pointed all that the last
lecture out on the transition from,

218
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,160
uh, um, uh, mechanical to
organic solidarity and the,

219
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,450
then that happened then,
uh,

220
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,540
pet pathologies good and merge.
And again,

221
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,060
put it into the social context.

222
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Durkheim is writing in the 1890s and
early 19 hundreds is in Bordeaux and then

223
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:53,180
he's moving to Paris. The
city of the sin, right.

224
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:57,680
And he sees all the science
of social pathologies, right?

225
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,940
Uh,

226
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,940
our core holism and homelessness and
prostitution and theft than crime,

227
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,400
uh, which was in existent or
much rarer in rural France,

228
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,950
uh,
adjust a couple of decades ago.

229
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,190
So he's confronted right with massive
phenomena which is being seen as abnormal

230
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,610
or petrologic car and he identifies them
as the results of the transition from

231
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:30,320
mechanical to organic solidarity.
Well,

232
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,480
pathologies can have two different routes.
Um,

233
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,403
and uh,

234
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,590
what we normally understand
from a Durkheim that he
identifies pathologies from

235
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:47,780
the absence of rules.
That's what the term enemy refers to.

236
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,840
But interestingly enough,

237
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,970
I have the citations for you and
if you have read the text scale,

238
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,140
you've found the citations as well.

239
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,590
He actually also does consider
that pathologies can also
reserve the result from

240
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:09,551
the overregulation right of
two forced division of labor.

241
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,730
I think it's very intriguing to see this
because we normally control Paul's Marx

242
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:22,481
theory of alienation and Durkheim's
theory of anime as Durkheim is complaining

243
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:28,871
that is not enough regulation in society
by Marxists arguing that it's too much

244
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,120
than [inaudible] in society.
And Ivy,

245
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,610
I'll give you a number of
citations now, uh, from, uh, uh,

246
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,630
Durkheim each actually,

247
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:43,631
we are sure that the difference between
Rice and labor is not such gigantic as

248
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,080
we initially made. I have salt on
generally of would assume that, uh,

249
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,260
uh, there of is quite sensitive
to some of the Marxian analysis,

250
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,240
even to the marks Jia notion of
alienation. He doesn't use the term,

251
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,890
but it gets very close to it.
So let me just move on.

252
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,170
Third and, um, uh, dark
about better largest bet.

253
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,140
Bet ologies may charge
coming from the absence of,

254
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,240
of rules. Now, uh, and
I've used briefly say,

255
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,810
uh, these interesting, uh, uh,

256
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,100
idea that in fact division of labor
can be the source of solidarity.

257
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,280
As I said, this is counterintuitive. Uh,

258
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,530
we did believe that solid the solidarity
crumbs from relatively small size

259
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,230
communities where people
are relatively similar,

260
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:41,430
share the same values and the same system,
same norms,

261
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,170
and then they will have a
solid artistic feelings store,

262
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:49,280
watch each other and people are very
different and they are competing on the

263
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:54,240
market place. There are the, uh, you know,
our strangers in this sort of cities,

264
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:57,870
they don't know each other. Uh, uh, the,

265
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,190
the separate subscribe to
different values, uh, uh,

266
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,600
or they even don't know what values
they should obey because the are fused,

267
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,790
they just left the village and ended at
the big end sinful city and they don't

268
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,730
really quite know can I do here anything?

269
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,720
Is that any control over
me or not? I, you know,

270
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:22,710
it's all up to me what to do.
Even stealing is all right,

271
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,910
sunny my buddies or, right. Ah,
I see other people who do that.

272
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,540
Why don't I do it? The are not
being quote, I probably will not to,

273
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,830
could be caught either.

274
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:37,010
So that is a kind of right under
these circumstances when that are no,

275
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,060
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, similarities.

276
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:46,390
Why owners, uh, will be solid that estate.

277
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,310
We don't know how other people, and they
have these stereotypes that, you know,

278
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:54,510
in urban industrial society, we
are not solely that estate. Right.

279
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,130
Uh, uh, this is the, yeah,
the usual stereotypes.

280
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,990
You say you go to New York City,
right?

281
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,770
And that is somebody who is dying on
the streets and other people are just

282
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,200
stepping over that
person, right? Who Cares?

283
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:11,460
You can die on the street and that will
be hundreds of passengers going by and

284
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,920
left to die. It's actually
not true. Right? Um,

285
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,590
if you ever have seen anybody, uh,
you know, feeling, feeling ill,

286
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,110
uh, uh, in Times Square,

287
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,160
I mean that are usually a lot of people
rush to it and say, are you all right?

288
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,050
Or that's kind of stuff. Um, but
anyway, but you know, the stereotype,

289
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:35,880
right? Um, uh, so usual
stereotypes about cities anyway,

290
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,910
so it's puzzling why a society which is
so different and nonmembers and such a

291
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:43,770
high division of labor
can be solid that asleep.

292
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,010
Then he defines various pathologies.
And interesting,

293
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,700
the battle laundry one
sounds very similar,

294
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,920
very close to Mark's Mel.

295
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,980
That is crisis in the system and that
is increasing class conflict and this

296
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:04,330
cross country to psychological.
Um, and the second one,

297
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,323
uh,

298
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,960
well against something which is
not all that different from walled.

299
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,620
Karl Marx,
uh,

300
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,390
division of labor can be too excessive
and too much division of labor.

301
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,520
Uh, can lead to better logical
consequences. And finally,

302
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,390
his unique contribution that pathology
can come from the lack of regulation.

303
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,550
And that's what he calls an
me. Oh, let me, um, uh, uh,

304
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,790
work on this and also the concept
of an anime a little more.

305
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,640
So here it is a the division of
labor as a source of solidarity,

306
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,830
right? He said, well,

307
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,200
normally the division of labor
produces social solidarity.

308
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,650
Uh, well, but it can happen, uh,

309
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,250
that that are the opposite results.
All right?

310
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,830
So therefore he said,

311
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,550
when we know when division
of Labor Creates Social Sa,

312
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,740
so solidarity,

313
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,730
then it will be better
equipped to figure it out.

314
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,320
Then actually,

315
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:19,180
social solidarity has
better logical consequences.

316
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,750
And as you can see from the
citation, he directly site, uh,

317
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,260
the medical, um, uh, uh,

318
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,320
metaphor right here as elsewhere.

319
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,410
But ology is a pressures
and Ciliary to physiology.

320
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,440
So you start with the
physiology of society, uh,

321
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,450
you identify when it works normally and
then you will be able to show than it is

322
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,570
better logic though, right?
That's the fundamental idea.
And this seemed that way.

323
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,530
How he tries to get off the hook of
the problem that he actually capable to

324
00:22:56,531 --> 00:23:01,270
tell. What is special logic pro.
All right now the first battle out,

325
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,980
but pathology,
it's actually about class conflict.

326
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,500
He said, well, uh, and
I think mark would have,

327
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,950
would not have been particularly
unhappy with this citation, right?

328
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,030
As labor becomes increasingly divided,

329
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:25,050
there are commercial crises that are
bankruptcy's that is hostility between

330
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,740
Labor and capital. And then, you know,

331
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,980
all these conflicts
become more frequent right

332
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,600
now in traditional societies
in mechanical solidarities,

333
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,590
well this class conflict
were rare and unusual.

334
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,610
Now, uh, today, uh,

335
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,640
they are not all that on the usual
and he uses the term Verking class.

336
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,503
Right?

337
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,840
You said part of the Virgin class two
or three really desire the state to

338
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:04,580
society, right? Well, not
quite a theory of exploitation,

339
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,470
but certainly,
uh,

340
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:11,471
an expression that do high
level of division of labor
in absence of other can't

341
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,890
create in dance class conflict,

342
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,390
which is a pathological consequence
of high division of labor.

343
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Then he goes on and he writes
about excessive division of labor.

344
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,140
Uh,

345
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,670
well he has not tread
the patties manuscripts,

346
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,650
which was not published
of course, um, for uh,

347
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,740
14 more years after he died.
But yeah,

348
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,510
you will have read the pedis manuscripts
and you can see this interesting pedals.

349
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,290
The individual will isolate
himself in his own activity.

350
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,110
He will no longer be over there of the
collaborator who Varick at his side on

351
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:05,750
the scene task he has even not longer.

352
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,810
And the idea at all what the common
tasks consists is not that's miraculous.

353
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,960
He could not have the faintest idea that
a work called the patties manuscripts

354
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:25,730
exists. Right. And hear what is
being described is getting very,

355
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:29,510
very close to the idea of alienation.
Right.

356
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,640
And in fact comes very close to
the Marxian notion of Eliana,

357
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:38,641
you're not the Hague Eliana run the
Marxian notion because he roots it into

358
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:43,590
excessive division of labor.
Too much market, right? Uh,

359
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,960
too much competition creates
this situation. Well,

360
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:51,460
I think this is me innocuous.
And very often, you know,

361
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,620
these sentences are kind of skipped
over as a kind of through over a line.

362
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,720
Uh,
by the time it isn't,

363
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:04,250
it is very important to identify
what his unique contribution is.

364
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,640
And this is indeed the emphasis that a
pathology can occur out of the lack of

365
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:15,290
regulation and lack of regulation means,

366
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,620
and on me now,
uh,

367
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,040
he said,
well,

368
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,690
if he's not necessarily for social
life to be visceral struggle,

369
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,530
struggle in itself is not that bad at all.

370
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,100
The role of organic story reality
is not to abolish a competition,

371
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,720
but to moderate it. All right. Well,

372
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,280
I just want to remind you,
um,

373
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,700
this Niv, uh, reminds us to Adam Smith.

374
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,220
He's sympathetic theory of
human nature, right? Uh, well,

375
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,113
uh,

376
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,830
on limited competition is not right,
right.

377
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,850
Unlimited egoistic behavior is not right.

378
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,200
They have to be sympathetic
to the other person, right?

379
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,860
The are struggling for
recognition by others, right.

380
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,250
That is the idea where that is a
similarity in Durkheim's and Adam Smith's

381
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,620
analysis. But, but then he
couldn't, but he, then he continues.

382
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:30,510
But in some cases, and this is
crucial, there's regulatory process,

383
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,540
which rates competition I there does
not exist at all or not related to the

384
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:42,480
degree of development of the division
of Labor. It is insufficient.

385
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,820
The that are,
I don't know,

386
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,360
regulations or not enough regulations.

387
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,590
If then division of labor
does not produce solidarity.

388
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,480
It is because the relationship
between organs are not regulated.

389
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,160
And this is what I call an army,
right?

390
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,340
And again,
you see the social context a,

391
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,090
this is exactly coming from uh,
the empirical reference point.

392
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,370
Rural young people get on
the train and that, uh,

393
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,540
get off the train in God's Love Jar San
Lozar and then they walk into the street

394
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:29,400
in Wyatt, Paris, the sinful city of Paris,

395
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,020
and they are lost.
Suddenly their value system,

396
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:39,021
what they were told back home in the
village collapses right back in the

397
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:44,040
village. They knew exactly
what they are supposed to do.

398
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Everybody knew them and they also knew
if they are breaking the laws right of

399
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:56,280
the community to have your be immediately
punished because there'll be a big

400
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,490
gossip spreading it around
and get back to home.

401
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,070
And Mom and dad will exactly here,

402
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,220
but you have done on the street what
you've were not strict post to do.

403
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,200
Now you are in Paris, more buddy
has the finger study or who, what,

404
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,160
who you are. And even when you don't
know about other people expect from you,

405
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,700
right? It looks like this
is the realm of freedom.

406
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,980
You can do anything, right?
Well, back home in the village,

407
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,920
uh, if you've really engaged,
you would bash her, go,

408
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:31,380
not hold hands with another
partner on the street, right?

409
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,870
Because then the gossip,

410
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,500
you're back to your fiancee and her
parents or his parents and your parents

411
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,960
immediately. And Darryl,
there'll be a scandal.

412
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,700
Now if you are walking,
Gone Bull Mish,

413
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,070
uh, you can do anything. You
can't hold the handle of anybody.

414
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,240
You can kiss anybody, right?
Nobody knows who you are. Right?

415
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,230
So that's it. You know, at
that is the problem, right,

416
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:04,231
of anime that people enter
in a [inaudible] society
in which they are lost.

417
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,980
Um, uh, well, uh,

418
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,080
let me just labored a little longer on
the idea and here again see that even the

419
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:18,310
notion of anime, uh, I mean it's probably,

420
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,760
I don't know whether
how much it is making,

421
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,620
he's making his argument too
complex or Mark's idea of,

422
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,110
uh, uh, uh, uh,

423
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,740
area nation was too complex.

424
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,230
But you can see here against some
similarities even between anime and the

425
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,240
Marxian notion of alienation.

426
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:46,170
He said the division of Labor may reduce
the worker to the role of a machine.

427
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,620
He's not over here of where the
operation required of him are leading.

428
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,250
And he does not link them
to any AME woo every day.

429
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,980
He repeats the same movements,

430
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,740
monotonous regularity,

431
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:11,550
but without having any understand
the interest in understanding that,

432
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,890
oh, how interesting. And that's where, uh,

433
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,290
in, uh, uh,

434
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,330
during games thinking the
lack of norms or values,

435
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:29,300
the collapse of the value
system leading to, uh,

436
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,750
and for him, of course,
that's a big difference.

437
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,500
The solution is to fix
the system of value,

438
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,690
to fix the system of norms and then
you solve the problem of alienation.

439
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,560
But he also said that look and Ami is
not an inevitable consequence of the

440
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:51,690
division of labor, right? Um, uh, very,

441
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,770
he has a conception that,
you know,

442
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:58,771
live division of labor can be
forced and can be excessive,

443
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,480
right?
There must be in

444
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,630
elements in the collective
conscience, which moderate, right?

445
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,280
The competitive elements
of the division of Labor.

446
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,800
But if those institutions, you
know, cultural, legal, moral,

447
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,270
ethical institutions are in place,
then in fact,

448
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,320
uh, the division of Labor
will not produce anime.

449
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,070
It only will produce
such if there is no such,

450
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,430
um, uh, systems. But then he said,

451
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,220
don't do not read to me as a romantic.

452
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,390
I don't want to idealize the village
community that these boys and girls and

453
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,990
God, Lazard are coming
out of the train. Right?

454
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,130
I don't want to send the
back to the rural village.

455
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,340
I'm not advocating Yeti turn from
organic solidarity to mechanical, sorry.

456
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,330
That if the all the time showing under
what circumstances that are pathological

457
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:07,180
contact fancies, right? Uh,

458
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,190
in organic solidarity and therefore
we have to find the proper medication,

459
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,610
the proper cocktail of drugs by
which we can cure these disease.

460
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,740
Right. That is the key idea. Well,

461
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,500
and now another very
interesting, uh, argument,

462
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:30,890
uh,

463
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,890
which is usually neglected
and reading at the time.

464
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,670
He said,
look,

465
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,670
that are pathologies in society which
are coming from overregulation and forced

466
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,270
division of Labor. Uh, well this is,

467
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,750
uh, already in, uh, the uh, uh,

468
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,460
division of labor,

469
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,490
but a crucial text is in fact the
so-called second introduction into the

470
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,950
division of Labor.
Uh,

471
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,210
doodle can receive a lot of criticism
of the first edition of the division of

472
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:17,711
Labor was criticized of
being too conservative
politically and that's when he

473
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:24,660
wrote her, um, the second, uh, uh,

474
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,470
introduction to the division of Labor.

475
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,150
And if you are interested
at all in Durkheim,

476
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,690
you have to read the second introduction,

477
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,710
the introduction to the second edition
of the division of Labor because here he

478
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:44,120
tries to offer,
uh,

479
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:49,150
some quote unquote progressive
solution to the problems of uh,

480
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,580
uh, uh, uh,

481
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:57,810
an Omi and the nature of
a solidarity in organic,

482
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:03,380
uh, societies, uh, um, uh, um,

483
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,150
uh,

484
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:10,150
how to overcome the problem of
class conflicts in modern society.

485
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,460
And that his idea is that reality is
solid, that it is, this is the idea.

486
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:19,050
He develops in the, uh, uh, uh,

487
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,130
introduction to the second edition that
we are becoming a solidaristic vision.

488
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,410
Our professions decided to professional
organizations in which reveal,

489
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,200
find our identities and solidarities.

490
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,410
So he sees the good society as a woven
into multiplicity of professional

491
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:48,471
organizations in which people fit into
this professional environment and do have

492
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:54,210
a strong professional identity and
solidaristic attitudes towards the

493
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:58,100
profession. Uh, uh, this is right.

494
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,980
A radically different
idea right from the mark.

495
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,390
It's not dealing with markets,

496
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,350
not messing up with the markets or not,

497
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,130
not messing up too much with the
Americas to put it this way. And I, uh,

498
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,690
you know, professional
organizations, if they are effective,

499
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:17,860
they do mess up with the markets,
right?

500
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,200
American Medical Association does mess
up because it's the kind of trade union,

501
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:28,200
right? Which, um, uh, make
sure that, uh, um, uh,

502
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:33,460
uh, the doctor's interests that are
being, uh, particualry raptor incentive.

503
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,130
Um, anyway, uh, this is, uh,
uh, the second introduction.

504
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:42,570
But what is interesting in, in, in
this citation is that he said, well,

505
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,840
uh, the autology can emerge
actually from excessive level of,

506
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,000
uh, of, uh, uh, uh, regulation or force,

507
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,190
division of, of, of labor.

508
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,390
And he introduces an another notion here,

509
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,280
and this is fatal asthma.

510
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,790
So there are these two different
pathologies, uh, uh, uh,

511
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,650
uh, uh, modern societies, uh,

512
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,900
or one is emerging in the transition
from Bethanny got to organic solidarity

513
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,100
given the absence of a
commonly shared values.

514
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,500
Uh,
and that's an Omi.

515
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,900
And that is another basketball
on the other end of the scale.

516
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,660
You have to excessive regulation.

517
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,880
And then people become fatalistic because
then they think there is nothing they

518
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,740
can do, right. And Ami is when you
can't eat anything goes, you know,

519
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,300
I can get her wavy tenor thing, right?
Or are you are desperate, you know,

520
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,220
because you don't know a
Vato nurse, uh, um, uh,

521
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,180
uh, you, uh, uh, Avanto duvet yourself.

522
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,900
A fatalism is a, when you think fell, um,

523
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,820
I have no control over my life.
I am overregulated right?

524
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,180
And then you'll become fatalistic.
It doesn't matter.

525
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,640
Nothing matters because,
uh, uh, it's overregulated.

526
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,950
Okay. Uh, now let me just very briefly,

527
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,040
I compare, uh, uh, these, uh, uh, uh,

528
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,690
three ideas, uh, uh, for, uh, uh,

529
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,780
uh,
Mark's a Viber and Durkheim.

530
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,773
Uh,

531
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I hope I did not confuse you too much
with some of the citations which are quite

532
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,220
contrary,
intuitive,

533
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:50,140
but it's important to see the
sophistication of the analysis.

534
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,710
Uh, the bottom line of
all this, he said, look,

535
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:58,711
my unique contribution to the study of
pathologies of modern society is the

536
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:04,531
theory of anime have each says that
temporarily in this transition,

537
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,690
uh, we have, uh, a problem
of absence of rules.

538
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,960
This will be overcome because there
is no reason by a properly moderated

539
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,200
competition and division of Labor could
not create actually very high levels of

540
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,310
solidarity.

541
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,650
And the mechanism he suggest
in the second introduction is,

542
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,140
you know,

543
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,140
creation of a professional organization
and slotting people into professional

544
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:40,510
communities. As such, they are
not going back to the villages,

545
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,340
but they will be sort of belonging to
professional communities and having

546
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:50,020
solidaristic ideas and identities there.

547
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,960
So this is the kind of a bottom line.

548
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,030
He is sensitive to the
problems of is talking about,

549
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,130
he understands that yes,

550
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,960
modern society does create class conflicts
and this is a problem because they're

551
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:09,560
working class very often
feels ill cheated, uh,

552
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,740
doesn't use the term exploit
it, but you know, it's um, uh,

553
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,390
unhappy with the position assigned to it.
So she sees this is a problem.

554
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,240
He also sees the problem that
an excessive, um, uh, um,

555
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,080
uh, division of labor may create a
sense of, it doesn't use the term,

556
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:33,930
but really what he means
alienation, right? Um, and he also,

557
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:38,970
his flight over here that too much
regulation also can create a pathological

558
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:43,710
state of mind fatalism. Uh, so, uh,

559
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,630
but the major contribution is,
as I've said,

560
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:50,530
and on me as a insufficient
regulation in society,

561
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:55,150
this is his unique contribution.
Now, alienation as we have seen,

562
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:00,390
um, is more like theory collision,
right? In Durkheim it comes, uh,

563
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,930
from, uh, too much that you wish.

564
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,810
And then we have a Weber's notion
of this enchantment, right?

565
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:13,870
The loss of the enchanted garden. This
is all, all coming, you know, the kind of

566
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:20,490
mood or feel the human
condition under modernity,

567
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,110
right? These are three different
dates for vulnerabilities.

568
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:29,680
The loss of magic. All right. Um, and, uh,

569
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,730
the way the conversion of the
dance all sided, you know,

570
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:39,530
human relations,
the ships into instrumental relationships.

571
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,110
Um, I think I briefly
mentioned, uh, and, uh,

572
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,380
the lecture on a LDR nation or,

573
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:52,990
and probably also lecture on, uh, uh, uh,

574
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,060
uh, v Bieber. Um, uh,

575
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:03,550
that this is actually very similar to the
ideas of a George Lowe Kotch who was a

576
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:08,700
Marxist if he lost a fair and
who developed the theory of Rafe.

577
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,940
He, Keisha, uh,

578
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,240
the Labor is developing the
theory of descent chance, man,

579
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,680
what is the problem of moved?

580
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,240
Only thing that's the lost
the enchanter the garden.

581
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,330
That's The r two rationale is stick to
colds to instrumental at a time when look

582
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,900
archer is shifting from,
Hey,

583
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,610
y'all two marks and invents
the idea of life vacation.

584
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,080
And they happened to bull
live at that time. Um,

585
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:42,860
in Heidelberg and, uh, George look arch,

586
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,770
when was a young man at
that time in his twenties.

587
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,160
It was a freak from the gas and the house
in the Viva House in the saloon around

588
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:52,950
by Mariana Weber's.

589
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:57,951
So that is clearly a mutual
influence on low arch,

590
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,150
unique interpretation of Marx,
theory of alienation. Uh,

591
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,890
that's human relationships
are becoming re fied and,

592
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,890
uh, uh, [inaudible],
uh, for, uh, you know,

593
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:17,100
instrumentalization of
life, which is, uh, uh,

594
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:22,100
I think distinctly different and
worse from the theory of an army and

595
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,380
alienation. Okay. Uh, um,

596
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,340
uh, a final law and the, uh, [inaudible],

597
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,620
uh,
our human nature.

598
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,690
What was his theory of human nature?
And here,

599
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,780
um, uh, uh,

600
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,160
uh, the, uh,

601
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,940
can see a sharp distinction between,
uh,

602
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,550
Mark's and,
and Viber.

603
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,090
Mark's meanly following a Russo's line.

604
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,820
Basic God. He believed that, you know,

605
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,810
he did not have the notion of a
state of nature to any longer.

606
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,340
By the mid 19th century,
people got tired and yet trad off it.

607
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,430
Um, uh, but, uh, uh,

608
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,410
he used the term a species being of
what is the essence human essence.

609
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,330
Uh, uh, well he said, uh,

610
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:26,570
the essentially humans are fine.
Uh,

611
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:31,350
uh, uh, it is the society
which is the problem,

612
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,890
not the individual. Um, it, uh,

613
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,870
so this is exactly, you
know, Daryl soy yen, uh, uh,

614
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
inspiration in Marx society core apps
and the state of nature of the very good

615
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:47,910
at mice, even ads. I think I
ordered, they made this point,

616
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:51,800
but let me underline one more
time. He goes beyond, um,

617
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,030
our last show because
Rousseau, so the um, uh,

618
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,480
lobos savage as a savage, as, as a,

619
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,570
as an individual who has to be
brought into society at that point.

620
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,140
March disagrees with Rousseau.
He sees we were born in society,

621
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,030
they are social by nature, right?
So are we are not only good,

622
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,780
but there are also social
and it is so sad. Eve,

623
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,820
each quarter up sauce which creates US
egoistic individuals will compete with

624
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:29,760
each other and kill each other, right?
This is exactly the opposite, right,

625
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:35,180
of hops and a big step beyond
Russo's theory of human nature.

626
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,250
Now,

627
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:43,250
Durkheim is actually much closer
to hops in his notion of uh,

628
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,670
uh, uh, uh, human nature, uh,

629
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,800
because he believes tonight that's
social pathologies and merge.

630
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:56,520
And that is a vacuum
of control over people.

631
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,370
That's when you have crime and Swiss shy,

632
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,400
the prosecution and whatever.
Uh, uh, and therefore,

633
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,900
uh, uh, he had a skeptical
view of human nature.

634
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:15,170
Unless we are controlled,
then we can be easier,

635
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:20,240
right? That is the fundamental issue,
right. What you have to fix, uh,

636
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,140
uh, is, uh, uh, uh,

637
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:25,650
making sure that the individuals,

638
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,243
mmm.

639
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,520
Develop the platform value system.

640
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,130
Thank you Rodney Marsh and
have a wonderful weekend. Yeah.

641
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,330
See you the last week of the semester.
