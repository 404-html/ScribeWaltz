1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,630
So Adam Smith's,
uh,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,190
and this is what I want to
rush quickly through, uh,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,571
his life.

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:14,571
You don't really know all that much
about his life and it's not as colorful.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,900
And George, uh, who saw and then you know,

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:22,290
his major contributions, uh, eh,

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,310
his theory of self interest and how self
interest is related to come and good is

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,310
labor theory of value. His idea of
distribution, of value between Labor,

9
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:34,620
capital and rent.
And finally,

10
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:39,621
what is the most often cited with
his theory of the invisible hand.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,270
So here it is. Adam Smith about his life.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,290
He was born in 17, 23, um, uh,

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,940
in Scotland called the just outside of,
at the Moro,

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,680
which is a beautiful city if you did not
visit it yet. I like all mental you do.

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:00:59,610
Uh,

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,610
he entered the University of Glasgow and
interestingly at that time in the mid

17
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:09,651
18th century for reasons which is
beyond me and next to Paris and London.

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,060
And Edinburgh was the center
of the Scottish enlightenment.

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,900
Um,
uh,

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,310
then he also went to Oxford
and a in bio or college.

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,350
Um, uh, and the, in 1751,
he was appointed, um,

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,700
at the University of Glasgow
as a Prophet Glasgow.

23
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:37,590
I would not recommend as a tourist
destination by the Va. Uh, uh,

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,320
um, um, uh,

25
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,950
he became a professor of logic and
then he became a professor of moral

26
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:48,060
philosophy, believe it or not, right.

27
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,570
The person who is known
about self interests and the
invisible hand is major for

28
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:58,200
a job was professor of
moral philosophy of ethics.

29
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,280
And in 1759,
he published a book,

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,290
the book called the theory of moral
sentiments, which is a book on ethics.

31
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,660
Uh, well, we've,

32
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:14,661
you'll see this is a big issue whether
this book was written out of Expediency,

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,330
uh, he wrote it just because he wanted
to justify that he's a professor of moral

34
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:25,020
philosophy and he didn't really believe
in it because he was an economist,

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,550
a rational choice economist or of us urea,

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,540
a moralist as one of the big
questions. I think what, um,

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,780
uh,
scholars on Adam Smith a debating,

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,880
he traveled in Europe and this may
have been a turning point in his life.

39
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,270
He meets Voltaire and kills me,

40
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,720
a major economist off his time and other
representatives of French enlightenment

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,670
and French enlightenment may have
actually influenced him and pushed him,

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,990
uh, uh, after the return
of Glasgow, uh, to,

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,790
and the guilt card,
what have I leave him back.

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,510
And that's what he mainly wrote
the valves of nations. Right.

45
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,000
And that's the most important book.

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,070
But I think in order to
understand, uh, Adam Smith's,

47
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,300
we have to come to terms with,
be the appearance,

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,870
tension between the theory of moral
sentiment and a vessel of nation.

49
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,580
Is this the same altar or these
are two different authors, right?

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,870
Is it the same theory or there are
two different theories offered to us.

51
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:33,490
And that's, I think very complicated.
He passed away in 1970. Well,

52
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:37,840
I wanted to find you some figures about
pictures about his life. The only thing,

53
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,640
what I could find this,
um,

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,820
a memorial on the site where the
house jewel in Kilgore devout,

55
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:48,550
he wrote a diverse of nation.

56
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,900
So it's not only a university VG,
sterning building downs,

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,350
even the British do turn or the beer,
the exam,

58
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,050
even if they should not have done so.
Right.

59
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,110
Would be so nice to visit the house.

60
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,100
That diverse of Nation of was written.

61
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,390
Like if you were to kill Cordey well you
can visit that site and to have a lot.

62
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,060
Okay.
So as I said,

63
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,250
Adam Smith seemed to
have two faces regularly.

64
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:23,020
Normally today if you take
economics classes right,

65
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,470
he is presented as the person who is
advocating the self-interested individual

66
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,980
and uh, uh, uh,

67
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,990
committed at theories of the self
regulating Marcus of the invisible hand as

68
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,300
little government as possible.
Poor soul,

69
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:44,620
just yourself interests and your self
interest will leave to the common good.

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,160
So he is the sort of inspiration for now
classical economics and rational choice

71
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:55,900
theory, right? And methodological
individualism to put in this way.

72
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,410
But he has this book,

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,800
the theory of moral sentiment in which
he's writing about sympathy as an

74
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:08,440
important motivation for human action.

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,040
And is this just a concession to his job
or is there something deep in him which

76
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:20,791
also showed the need for a helping
hand by the public authorities?

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,980
That's the big puzzle. You know, we
have to struggle there. Uh, there are,

78
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,250
there are other people who are more
qualified to give you the most authentic

79
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,880
interpretation of Smith. And
I try to do my best. Okay.

80
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,270
There are, um, and indeed, you know,

81
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:42,130
diverse of nation looks like about self
interested individuals and the invisible

82
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:45,830
hand ivy present you enough
citations that you see it.

83
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,590
I will also show you why it is possible.
Some,

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,590
some of, uh, Smith's interpreters.

85
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,930
I will suggest that this is the same
mill and the fact the vast of nation is

86
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,720
just an extension of the theory of
moral sentiments rather than I come the

87
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,760
addiction to it. I, this is
not the majority view right?

88
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,790
Today among economists in particular,

89
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,790
the majority view is that,
you know,

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,780
you should not really pay much attention
to the theory of moral sentiment.

91
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,940
The vast of nation gives you
the real source and inspiration.

92
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,330
And this is what the
guides, uh, um, uh, uh, uh,

93
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,810
no classical economics,

94
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,350
but you may find some economies to
disagree and you'll be fined a number of,

95
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:36,380
uh,

96
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
political philosophers who will disagree
and will say that this is not the real,

97
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,403
uh,
um,

98
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,610
Adam Smith's was presented to
you by now classic economist.

99
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,510
Um, and I don't want to take
a position in this, uh, uh,

100
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:58,340
I'm not a sufficiently, um, uh,
Smith scholar to be able to do so.

101
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,630
What have you presented the argument
both ways and you can make up your mind

102
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,670
right there.
You stand on this.

103
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,470
So the theory of moral sentiments
just very briefly, but this is,

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,380
he does ask the central question,

105
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,350
how can we make more or judgment?

106
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,690
How can we tell good from evil,
good for bad.

107
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,440
Now, it's a very important
issue and question. Uh,

108
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,470
there are many, uh, uh,

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,240
founding theorists of modern social
theory. We're dealing with this.

110
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,220
The most important one we've, you're
talking about him at great at, you know,

111
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:41,600
in 15 minutes is
Frederick Nicha of course,

112
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,730
the genealogies of morals. This is the
central question there does, right?

113
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,500
Um, uh, our conception of
good and evil come from.

114
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,450
But Adam Smith's already here asked
this question and he said, well,

115
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:01,400
what does solution that inside you,
that is an inner person,

116
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,320
you are to people,
right?

117
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,830
You Act and there is somebody inside you
is watching you and they're the inside

118
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,900
you will, the hotel you,
you did something wrong.

119
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,230
That was not the right
thing to do, right? Um,

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,050
I think you should be able to
relate to this. I can, you know,

121
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,380
there is very often and in
nurse shelf in my shelf,

122
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,570
which tells me that was a mistake I did.
That was a foolish things I did.

123
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,590
I should not have done.

124
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:35,270
So I know people who've are very small,
right?

125
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,810
Uh, uh, in, in, in, in, in,

126
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,970
in impartial internal SPEC teacher.

127
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,650
I know people who have very great
difficulties there in ever that I made a

128
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,920
mistake, right? There are some
people who all of us blame others.

129
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,860
If things go wrong right now and I,

130
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,800
they have a moral problem, I would
say. So watch yourself. You know,

131
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,330
you may have a moral problem if your
inner self never tells you that you were

132
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:08,730
wrong and you are all those
lucky to be others, right?

133
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,840
If the is being spent wrong, then
you have a problem. Ethical problem,

134
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,870
at least this is Adam Smith's argument,
right?

135
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,210
Simple and persuasive.
Then he says,

136
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,500
this is something which is kind
of inspired by hops, right?

137
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,960
The are led by passion,
but now he is not emphasizing fair.

138
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,680
He said also by Sin Buddy.

139
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,140
That's crucial and that's the crucial
motion for those who emphasize that.

140
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,670
In fact, Adam Smith's in the
vest of nation is the same.

141
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,730
Adam Smith's as in the theory of
moral sentiments because Adam Smith's,

142
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,870
those who argue for Vaughn Adam Smith's
rather than to Adam's misses, right?

143
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,170
Say that he has a theory of humans,

144
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,320
which is a sympathetic theory
of humans. What drives us, uh,

145
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,210
that we have sympathy for others.

146
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,020
Other people's sympathies that
in interacting with others,

147
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,770
the are seeking others,
people's sympathy, right?

148
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,380
We try to please people, right?
We want to impress people,

149
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,980
right?
The want to have a reputation.

150
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:27,780
We want to have good reputation.
The want to act honorably, right?

151
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,080
So we are seeking sympathy,
we have a sympathy,

152
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:34,320
they have that understanding of
other people's human conditions,

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,270
but we are also expecting others
to understand us and value us,

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,100
right? Um, and I think this is a
very important and intriguing idea.

155
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,610
This a Ivr show that to show you later
on may not be completely inconsistent by

156
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:57,081
the idea that seeking self interest
is leading to the common good,

157
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,343
right?

158
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Because indeed if self interest
implies that I all show wronged,

159
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,970
right? Uh, others to
respect and evaluate me,

160
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,510
that self interests also implied that
I want to good do good to others,

161
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:19,320
right? This is in yourself interests
that you can say, at the end of the day,

162
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,400
I am a good person. Right? Then in fact,

163
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:26,190
pursuing these self interest,
right,

164
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,200
may not be all that different,
right from the common God, right?

165
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,390
Because it is inside you. And that's I
think, uh, the way how he is being read.

166
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,900
And he introduces the notion for the first
time of the concept invisible hand in

167
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,690
the theory of moral sentiments.
But here,

168
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:51,920
the invisible hand is not what you know.

169
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,050
You are told Adam Smith's theory of
invisible and this it's not the laissez

170
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,980
faire free market.
It's the hand of God.

171
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,740
God guides us,

172
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:07,741
right to have a proper balance between
passion and sympathy and that is somehow

173
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,560
God's will. But we follow. That's in fact,

174
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,500
you know Ivy, we'll talk
about this later, dawn.

175
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:22,210
A big a deal is made out of Adam
Smith's theory of the invisible hand,

176
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,140
the term diversity,
invisible hand,

177
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,970
the term calm sub three times in his work,
right?

178
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,160
And in each time he's using
it in a different meaning.

179
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,030
The way how we understand invisible
hand comes from a section lungs in one

180
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:48,781
sentence in the vast of nation and in
fact it is specifically about foreign

181
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:53,920
trade, right? And International Trade.

182
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,370
Not a mug and more about the role of
the government in domestic affairs,

183
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,610
but it is about free trade,
free international trade in.

184
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:08,611
This is the context in which he's
using the invisible hand as it is being

185
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:12,580
interpreted mostly today by
Adam Smith's theories, right?

186
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,600
So it's intriguing,
isn't it? Watch yourself,

187
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:21,601
then you are coining a term because a
term occasionally can stick and then it

188
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:27,460
will be all that repeated to you even
if you use it once right in your life.

189
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,840
Okay. They're the vast
of nations. Where are,

190
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:36,841
these are the kind of table of content
you guys about the division of labor and

191
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:41,200
the termination of prices,
a accumulation of capital.

192
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,000
He talked lots about the evaluation
of societies hunting, grazing,

193
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:50,700
agriculture and commercial
societies. Um, uh,

194
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,690
he never used the term capitalism.

195
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:57,130
A modern economy was commercial
industrial society for him.

196
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,580
And then he offers a criticism
of mercantilism and that's
where he offers right?

197
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:07,450
An argument for free international
trade and that's where he introduces the

198
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:12,451
notion of the invisible hand and
then something is on taxation.

199
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:17,020
What I've y'all not talking about?
So the self interests and the common good,

200
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:17,460
right.

201
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,460
One of the biggest Jews and we have
to discuss when we are faced with Adam

202
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,550
Smith's and the arguments are if
you are interacting with each other,

203
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,890
do not expect Benner valance.
Right?

204
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,170
Do not to expect that somebody else,
there'll be charitable to you. Um,

205
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,350
there is also say if you are seeking self
interest specifically in the citation

206
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:44,560
sites for instant choosing your
employment, if you choose it rationally,

207
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,390
this will be in the common good.

208
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:51,391
And that will try to explain why you
seeking self interest in finding them job,

209
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:55,870
which is best for you is also the
best for society. And then, uh,

210
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,870
he says,
well,

211
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,900
the individual are the better judges of
their own interest than any statement of

212
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,700
law giver as little state as possible.
That's very,

213
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,530
it is coming from and we will
see how he argues the case.

214
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,320
So do not expect Ben Valance. Uh, okay.

215
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,200
This is a very frequently
cited sentence, uh, uh,

216
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,010
from Adam Smith's. It's not
in the text. Uh, um, uh,

217
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,610
I assigned for this course, it said, well,

218
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:28,310
it is not the Beneville
ranch of the butcher,

219
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,080
the brewer or the breaker that
we expect our dinner from.

220
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,060
But the very self interest of
the, of the, um, of the butcher,

221
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,250
I go to the restaurant, right.
I do not expect died, the cook,

222
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,860
right. Uh, to give them
a bpm me a good meal, uh,

223
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,630
because, uh, you know, I need a good
meal and you know, I, you know, I, um,

224
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,160
uh, I expect the cook to like me, right?

225
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:00,530
I want him to cook a good meal
because then I will give a tip,

226
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,140
right? It is in the self insurance, right,

227
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:07,100
of the waiter to serve me well
and certainly good food, right?

228
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,240
Otherwise I'd be not to go back again and
be, and not give her a tip, right? I've,

229
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,540
you're punish, right? It is appearing
to the self interest, right,

230
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,330
of the person for whom I expect
something, right? And not,

231
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,340
it's been a valance. Now he said, well,

232
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:30,341
the address ourselves and not to the
humanity of the people right now to their

233
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:35,000
self love, but we want people to uh, uh,

234
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,540
take advantage of this. This is
an interesting issue, by the way,

235
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,300
even in everyday life, right? That are,

236
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm sure in this room that are people
who think about this differently.

237
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,560
Just to give you a very
personalized example. Uh,

238
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,590
my wife occasionally tells me this person
is not a good friend of yours because

239
00:16:56,811 --> 00:17:01,811
this person only costs you when
that person needs you or this had,

240
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,580
this does happen. And my answer
overseas, and I think in this way,

241
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:12,170
deep in my heart, I'm a
Smithsonian. I don't want rents.

242
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:17,171
I don't want anybody who do not see
an advantage in interacting with me.

243
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,860
I want people, right? Who Ha,

244
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,630
who actually act out of self interest,
seeking my relationship.

245
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,780
It will be a bad relationship
if my friends or the things
that it costs them to

246
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,310
talk to me and they do not benefit
from the relationship with me, right?

247
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,040
I don't mind. Well, my children, right?

248
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,490
Just to act out of love and sort
of be a pain in the neck for them,

249
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,640
right? I want my children,
right. Uh, to uh,

250
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,150
see that having me as a father,
it's beneficial for them. Right?

251
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,850
That's a good relationship,
right?

252
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,410
Good relationships are all of us
based on self interest, right?

253
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,220
You don't want to have a lover,
right?

254
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,380
Who does not enjoy being your lover.
Right?

255
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,550
Therefore you want right people
acting out of self interest.

256
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,560
And I think that's what is getting
get here. He said, even the Bagger

257
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,020
here,

258
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,020
actually the citations as the beggars
are the ones who are dependent only upon

259
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,230
Benner ones,
but then he qualifies it.

260
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:32,370
He said that's the even for the
beggar is not quite true. Right?

261
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,700
The beggar view make some tricks in which
in in fact it's actually a veal appeal

262
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:43,140
to yourself, interests that you
are a charitable person. The robot.

263
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,050
Now self interest in
employment. He said, well,

264
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:48,720
it's a very good example then you are,
he said,

265
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,590
then you are choosing an occupation. Of
course you want to have a big job, right?

266
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,700
You want to be well paid, right? Um,

267
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,020
those of you who are in economics major,
you know, you may want to have, you know,

268
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:05,680
some nice job, you know, some a
brokerage firm in Wall Street, you know,

269
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:09,930
and every 10 years, you
know, um, bachelor's degree,

270
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:13,070
you would like to earn $100,000 a year,
right?

271
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,340
But why would you earn $100,000?

272
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,600
Because the employer gets
a lot out of these skills.

273
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,490
What you get out of year,
right?

274
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,080
And therefore it will be in the interest
of the society that you had the highest

275
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:32,490
possible salary because you made the
greatest contribution to the common good.

276
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,520
Otherwise you have done, we've paid
that high. Okay? So therefore you,

277
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,530
they'll try to find that occupation
in which you get the highest possible

278
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,050
reward,

279
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,990
but you will get only the highest possible
rate we about because you make the

280
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,450
most contribution.

281
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:53,451
You can bitch your talent with your hard
work and it's your skills to the common

282
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:59,340
good. Right? This is Adam
Smith's argument. It's a
persuasive argument actually.

283
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,900
Right? Um, uh, well,

284
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:07,080
I can go home. It's not
all that important. Now,

285
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:12,081
this is very important to individuals
have the better charge of their own

286
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,670
interests than anybody else,
right? And, uh, uh, uh,

287
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,010
Bell, this is, I think, uh, again,

288
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:24,540
extremely important and I'm sure
this classroom is divided 50,

289
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:29,190
50% along these views,
right? He said, well,

290
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,083
uh,
uh,

291
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,080
the individuals in their local
situations are simply better,

292
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,640
uh, judges, uh, to what is that
interest then? Any statement or,

293
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,320
or, or log either, right?

294
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,220
People should the judge for
themselves what they want.

295
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,330
And it should not be a government,

296
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,990
which is imposes it on them
right now. This is, you know,

297
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:56,650
a big debate right now for instance,
about the house, good insurance,

298
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,620
the Husky reform.

299
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,720
Should we let it up to people to decide
whether they want to have an insurance

300
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:02,760
or not?
Uh,

301
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,860
should we expect people to be individually
responsible for themselves to take

302
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:09,730
charge of their life?

303
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,440
Or should it be the government or
should it be a statesman? The log you,

304
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,120
the congress who takes care of people
and he, he clearly takes a position. No,

305
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,470
I think,
you know,

306
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,850
people are the best judges
of the theories. Now,

307
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:29,680
the Labor theory of value, and let me
run through of it. This is important,

308
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:34,480
right? His point of departure,
uh, comes from, uh, uh,

309
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,610
John Locke as we have seen.

310
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,410
And it is leading directly to
Karl Marx, Karl Marx, radicalizes,

311
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,540
um,
his position.

312
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,810
But the point of departure is clearly
Adam Smith's and the argument about the

313
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:53,260
little bird theory of tell you the
Labor is the measure of all values.

314
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,980
And then he said,
the whole produce belongs to the Labor.

315
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:00,640
And so far Mark's
completely I crazy right?

316
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,800
And event we will be
discussing marks. Um, uh,

317
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,320
but then he departs from it
because he has a question.

318
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,700
Where does the profit and revenue come
from? Mike's as discretion as well.

319
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,060
And he says,
exportation right?

320
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,030
Those who earn profit
explored the workers.

321
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,710
But Adam Smith has a
different view. He says, well,

322
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:28,711
those who were land capital and those
who offer land also deserve part of the

323
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:34,360
value. Now let's see how this
contradiction can be resolved,

324
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,310
how he's dealing with this.

325
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,400
How can that all value is created
by labor and belongs to the Labor?

326
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,080
And nevertheless,
the capitalist podcasts,

327
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:47,680
profit and the landowner
packets rent for the land.

328
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,380
Then here, this is really a
very much John Locke, right?

329
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,700
The value of any commodity
is uh, uh, uh, uh,

330
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,350
bell belongs to the person, uh,
you know of, possesses it. Uh, um,

331
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,940
and, uh, if you know, if,

332
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,650
if it is not for use or consumption,
but exchange,

333
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,750
then the value of this commodity is equal
to the amount of labor which has to be

334
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:18,010
put into this.

335
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Libor is therefore he said the real
measure of the exchangeable value of all

336
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:27,940
commodities, right? Commodities
can have a use value.

337
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,620
They can be very useful and they can
have very little labored in it like fresh

338
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:37,200
air. But go by now we know fresh air
needs some, quite a bit of laborers do.

339
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,740
Um, uh, but, uh, the
exchange, Javier Exchange it,

340
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:44,380
you'll be guided according to Smith,
by Labor.

341
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,920
A few people accept today the Labor
theory of value, smiths or marks,

342
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,920
no matter what I did,
it belongs to the whole labor.

343
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:56,600
This is a very interesting argument,
right? He said, and this is where, again,

344
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,040
now John Locke,
right?

345
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:02,510
The property of every man
is his own labor, right?

346
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,920
And therefore every value is created
by these labor and therefore it has to

347
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:11,150
belong to the person
who, uh, has, uh, these,

348
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,640
uh, w own the labor. But
he said, this is true,

349
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,700
or societies be for capital is being
accumulated and the four land is privately

350
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,550
owned,
right?

351
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,110
So this is really an argument
for ancient societies,

352
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,610
the south capital accumulation.
And we saw private ownership of the land,

353
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,340
uh,
in these conditions.

354
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:41,860
If there is no capital accumulation and
no private ownership of land is commonly

355
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:45,880
owned, then the whole producer
of labor belongs to the Labor.

356
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:50,930
And this is where he marks the beauty
part dramatically from Adam Smith's.

357
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,450
So where does the profit
and Ramcom now, uh, uh,

358
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,360
our capital is simply exploiting
the workers. He said no,

359
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,400
there is a distribution of value
between Labor, capital and Rant,

360
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,690
right? Um, and this is reasonable, uh,

361
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,680
because um, the capitalist, uh,

362
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,170
offers capital, uh, in order, in fact,

363
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,200
advances capitol to the Labor takes risks
with this advancement of the capital.

364
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Supervise is the labor process
and therefore it should claim,

365
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:31,190
right? Some profit from capital.
Otherwise we'll be a fool,

366
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,790
right mark to advance its capital.

367
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,270
And the same goes for, uh,
um, land that shortly, uh,

368
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,850
land owners also have,

369
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:45,810
you'll have to give the land site
in which production takes place. Um,

370
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,460
and therefore they really
should be able to, um, uh,

371
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,280
collect some rant on this land. Well, uh,

372
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,230
finally the invisible hand that
are three conceptions of this, uh,

373
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,900
uh,

374
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,760
I briefly pointed this out in
the theory of moral sentiments.

375
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,430
He said,
this is really God,

376
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:10,670
which gives us a sense of sympathy.

377
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And 38 is a balance between passion
and desire and hunger for more and self

378
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:23,930
restraint to respect others and
earn respect from others. Um,

379
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,010
and then of course in diverse of nation,
this appears to be the,

380
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,440
the Bri marketplace.

381
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,120
And then finally he had the manuscript,

382
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:38,240
his goatee off drawn on me,
and he said,

383
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,120
the invisible hand is the hand of
Jupiter, the hand of Jupiter. Um,

384
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,270
because people at as long
as the are ignorant, um,

385
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,620
uh, phenomena lightening for
instance, but they don't,

386
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,630
cannot explain attribute to
the wheel of Jupiter, right?

387
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,600
Superstition, the invisible
hand is superstition. Okay.

388
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,880
So what is fun,
right?

389
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,120
That three instances where the notion
of invisible hand is used in each case

390
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,570
with different meaning and in none of
the cases exactly the same meaning as we

391
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:17,970
normally understand it.
Okay.

392
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,780
I think I am now moving over to,
uh,

393
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,060
John Stewart male and the two,
uh,

394
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,860
uh,
utilitarianism.

395
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,080
Um, and uh, yeah,

396
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,120
he's a wonderful

397
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,003
man.

398
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,150
Um, and it makes a lot of, uh,

399
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,670
well I'm on the long,
long fire.

400
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,430
Okay.
So this is all about,

401
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,000
okay.

402
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,750
Utilitarianism and liberty and,
uh,

403
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,093
uh,

404
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,910
the long growth from Jeremy
Bantam to John Stuart Mill.

405
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,160
Uh,
um,

406
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,930
utilitarianism is a fundamentally
important proposition.

407
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,350
It informs a modern economic theory and
18 forms political and social theories

408
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,900
be charged in the kind of rational
choice mod or the theorizing.

409
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,210
And the point of
departure, um, is a Bantam,

410
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,790
um,
uh,

411
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,720
who in many ways is the founding father
of utilitarian is though he never used

412
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:47,110
the term.
Um,

413
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,660
and he influenced the life of
John Stuart mill in a major way.

414
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,420
A meal. Father was James Smeal, um, uh,

415
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,130
quite an intellectual.
He wrote the big three volumes,

416
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,300
history of um, uh, these, uh,

417
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,720
in India and a British
involvement in India.

418
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,060
He met Benton in 1808,

419
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,360
and he fall in love with the theory of
Italian and he asked him to supervise the

420
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:20,380
education of his son,
what he did and sort of where,

421
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,630
um,

422
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,100
John Stuart mill grew up
under the influence of a
very strong father and a very

423
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:30,840
strong teacher. Um, and uh, uh, uh,

424
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:34,170
he invented the term,
uh, John Stuart Mill,

425
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,880
the turn utilitarianism in
1822 at a very young age.

426
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,403
Um,

427
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,820
then he suffers a nervous breakdown
when you see what a utilitarian is.

428
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:50,620
Ms You will not wander. I mean, uh,
if you are a real yes, children,

429
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,420
sick, utilitarian, difficult to
survive this out and nervous breakdown.

430
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,510
Uh, alright, so what is
Bantam theory? Right? Um,

431
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,090
he published the book the principles of
morals and legislation in 1789 and there

432
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:15,240
are some very important
claims in this book. Uh,

433
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,400
Andy at first instance, they
sound very reasonable. Uh, but uh,

434
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,180
he may be pushing his luck
too far. He said, well, uh,

435
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:28,150
the are created to seek pleasure
and to avoid pain, right?

436
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,700
We, and therefore, if we can minimize
the pain and maximize the pleasure,

437
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,370
that's when the achieve
the greatest happiness.

438
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,530
And that's what we called
utility. Right? Um,

439
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,020
so action is right.
If it is leading to happiness,

440
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,850
we all want to be happy. Uh, okay.

441
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,620
Um, well, uh, and this can
be actually quantified.

442
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,320
The action is right morally right.

443
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,740
If the sum of blessures minus the sum
of paints mildly Levi by the number of

444
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:05,320
person affected by action is positive.

445
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,440
Sounds reasonable, right? Uh, if
more people are happy in society,

446
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:16,190
then unhappy, then the society
does as well as it can. Uh,

447
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,460
that's uh, you know,
the, the argument, uh,

448
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,250
well there are a couple of citations.
I don't want to fail on this too longer.

449
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,740
I will put in on the Bourbon.

450
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,910
It's not in the tech side
require from you to read. Um,

451
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,320
so he said, you know, the two big
masters, our pain and pleasure,

452
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,030
somewhat of the kind of
similar argument to hops.

453
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,210
And he said an action may be said to
be conformable with the principle of

454
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:50,980
utility. Man, the tendency is
to augment happiness, right?

455
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,260
Um, uh, and that is greater
than to diminish it.

456
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,720
And what is utility utility?

457
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:03,721
Is that principle Meijer approves or
disapproves of reaction to augment or

458
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:10,471
diminish the happiness of the party
whose interest is in question?

459
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,520
Right? This is a notion of utility,
which is not all that far away.

460
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:19,450
What economists start using eval at
this time. Then he comes something.

461
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:23,860
But I think nobody would accept now that
simply he said that it's easy therefore

462
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:28,090
to calculate it. Right? Uh,
and I already pointed this out,

463
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:32,860
you just count the number of people who
are happy and who has been a kind of a

464
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:37,570
number of people who are happy
with it and have pleasure.

465
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,500
And if more people have pleasure,

466
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,980
the sum total of pleasure
exceeds the sum total of paints.

467
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,090
Then you got the good society. That's
a utilitarianism, Allah Bentham.

468
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,920
Now, John Stuart Mill, um, here he is, uh,

469
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,823
uh,

470
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,260
he was born in London and he never
attended school. He was a lucky one.

471
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,520
Uh,

472
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,520
but not necessarily all that lucky because
his teacher was Benson and John Mill

473
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,940
who were tough people and yet had to
start learning to hack in and Greek man,

474
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:16,810
he was three years old.
Well,

475
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:21,590
if there are anybody who is
an Asian American in the room,

476
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,150
uh,
Chinese,

477
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,480
you may have to start actually how to
read and write in Chinese pretty early.

478
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:31,070
But he did the v the street,
Latin and Greek,

479
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,130
which to my mind is a
bit easier than to then,

480
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,300
or the characters in Chinese. Anyway, 22,

481
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:42,950
we established a utilitarian society
and invents the term utilitarianism.

482
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,760
And then he suffered him a
nervous breakdown. I mean,

483
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,610
too domineering people in his life.
And then he also becomes very, um,

484
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,660
sort of unhappy,
right?

485
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,660
With the expediency in
emphasis on Utilitarianism,

486
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:04,690
right? Instrumental Ism, the
coldness of the arguments, right? Uh,

487
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,350
he actually beginning to,
becomes interested in poetry.

488
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,040
And then he meets a Harriet Taylor,
uh,

489
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,840
at wonderful lady, um, and a friendship,

490
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:22,480
a very close friendship is formed. Uh, uh,

491
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,610
Harriet Taylor was a fantastic,
uh,

492
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,420
intellectual as far as
we can judge, uh, uh,

493
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:34,450
one of the very first radical feminists
and had an probably extra ordinary

494
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,710
impact, uh, on the verge
of Jon Stewart Male,

495
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,830
if you would have been at a zero feminist,

496
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,090
he probably should have
put on, is very, um, uh,

497
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,160
Harriet Taylor as a quarter.

498
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,820
She probably quartered this work.
I mean,

499
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:57,500
she was married and this
was an interesting triangle,

500
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,820
which did develop, I
mean, uh, in what way?

501
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,960
We don't quite know what they were
traveling together. The threefold,

502
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,530
uh, entity. Quite
interesting. I said, well,

503
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,040
uh, 51, Mr. Taylor
basses of, and then, uh,

504
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:20,840
John Stuart Mill, immediately Mary's
Harriet Taylor. But unfortunately,

505
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:24,980
she has a very short life and
dies after the short marriage.

506
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,670
So his, uh, undisturbed
happiness to put it this way,

507
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,310
did not last very long.
Um,

508
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,880
and he died in [inaudible] 73 in Avignon.
Now about the work,

509
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,340
uh, briefly, uh,

510
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,440
we'll be talking about three pieces of
work on liberty. Uh, utilitarianism,

511
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:46,520
uh, uh, uh,

512
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:50,610
ivy or not talk about his role as a
member of parliament without actually,

513
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:54,920
he was one of the first
advocate for a female suffrage,

514
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,690
um,
of which did not fly at that time.

515
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,900
And he even lost reelection probably
because he advocating voting rights for

516
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:03,954
women.

517
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,130
And then he wrote a 69
a subjection of the man,

518
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,780
which is in many ways is a feminist book.

519
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,910
Uh, quite a radical feminist
book. Um, a feminist book,

520
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,360
you know,

521
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,360
you can really read four for men
and especially the not in 1869.

522
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,300
Um, okay. So what are
his major contributions?

523
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,950
He redefines utilitarianism,
right? As I said,

524
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,180
he felt it too cold. He needed, you know,

525
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,120
more sentiments, right? Uh,

526
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,360
poor tree had you tailor,
you know,

527
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,430
if him of sense of the verb,
which is richer in 70 months.

528
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,940
So he has a says, well, there are,

529
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,400
that is higher mass,
right?

530
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,660
That is a lower level of happiness
and then a higher level of happiness,

531
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:06,300
uh, to have a good steak.
Uh, well it is pleasurable,

532
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,050
but to listen to,
uh,

533
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,330
the ninth symphony of Beethoven
manage greater happiness,

534
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,930
right? It's a higher
level of happiness, right?

535
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,880
When you hear the concluding core
out of the ninth simply right,

536
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,610
you are through the roof of Blusher,
right?

537
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,340
You have a higher level of happiness,

538
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,580
then he'd be eating a nice rare steak.
Huh?

539
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,490
That's the higher level of
happiness. And he said, and he,

540
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:41,430
nobody argues it more forcefully than him.

541
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,210
Individual Liberty is the
ultimate value and expediency.

542
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,280
And you know what he means by experience?
You right?

543
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,670
That you get there by using the least
means and you maximize a dirty term.

544
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,380
Expediency cannot justify intervention
against individual liberty.

545
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,360
Very interesting issue and very accurate.

546
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,370
Very up to date issue. Right? Uh, uh, uh,

547
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:18,660
just, uh, think about, uh,
uh, mine, the lava, right?

548
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,630
This is exactly the problem after nine 11,
right?

549
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,660
How much of we can act against individual
liberty in the name of expedience,

550
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,310
right? How much we are willing
to accept the limitations,

551
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:37,060
individual liberty and a bell of Evo.
See he said,

552
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,620
expediency is not to be
ignored, but, uh, um,

553
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,800
Ben, the chips come down. He said,

554
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,790
it is individual liberty.
He's a libertarian, right?

555
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:54,010
He is for the sanctity of the
liberty of the individual.

556
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,930
And he's the ultimate of
British individualism, right.

557
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,160
And the sacredness of British
individual, isn't it? And finally,

558
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:05,740
the third major contribution,
he said,

559
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,250
the most legal situation
resembles those of slaves.

560
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,090
The are only verse off that slave side.

561
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,410
And he argues that in a very
articulate today, and you know,

562
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,190
women should heavy for rights
in jobs in public life. Uh,

563
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:26,740
the same kind of education, total
confrontation. We drove up close. So,

564
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,700
um, uh, but he believes that in marriage,

565
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:35,020
the Gan create a
friendship bond with males.

566
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,450
Well, Harriet treatment did not quite
agree with this door. She married twice.

567
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,110
Uh,

568
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:46,030
she boasts times did it probably
reluctantly she did not believe in the

569
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:50,440
institution of the marriage
though she did Mary Rice.

570
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,750
Okay.
Uh,

571
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,880
well let me see whether I can
still do this. Um, his, uh,

572
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,400
staff on utilitarianism and
leave the rest for, uh, uh,

573
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,220
Jersey. I think I have some
three more minutes to go.

574
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,090
The teams in the work,

575
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,100
utilitarianism is the concept of
higher happiness and human beings have

576
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:21,220
faculties for more elevated, right. Um,

577
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,120
uh,
advertise that animals have.

578
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,680
Then he talks about justice and legality.
It's a very complex issue,

579
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,010
but he's thinks that the law is a more
restrictive notes and then justice and he

580
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,710
stands for the idea of justice, uh, uh,

581
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,820
and show some contradiction
between law and justice as such.

582
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,540
And then he talks about
justice and expediency,

583
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:54,440
why justice cannot be simply
explained by expediency. Uh,

584
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,160
well, uh, again, something,

585
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:00,880
it's speaks from very much through
the issues which is on our mind.

586
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,420
Just expediency makes it just that you
Kocher and l bladder or a business owner

587
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,700
or a suspected their quad a prisoner to
get information out because this way you

588
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:19,150
save lives. I, some people will say yes,

589
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,940
this makes it just others who say,
no,

590
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:25,000
it is unjust and therefore expedience.

591
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,740
You should not use expediency that you,
that you get better information out,

592
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,040
uh, from, from Doris. Sure. Well,

593
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,640
I think I probably leave it here and
then you continue with them. Uh, uh, uh,

594
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:38,760
uh,

595
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,580
Tuesday and I hope it got you up in speed.

596
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:45,600
Right. Um, um, uh,

597
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,980
usually Italian is my John
Stuart Mill and Adam Smith's.

598
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,070
And you see how actually, um, uh, uh,

599
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,220
John Stuart meal and utilitarianism
radicalizes one stream of thought of each.

600
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,690
He is in Adam Smith's,

601
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:07,691
but Adam Smith is not quite ready
to go as far as Benton then.

602
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,170
And even not as far as
just your meal, Matt. Okay.
