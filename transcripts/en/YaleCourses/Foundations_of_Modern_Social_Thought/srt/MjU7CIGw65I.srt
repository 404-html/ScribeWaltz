1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,670
Good morning.
Uh,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,580
today's stop the keys
Weber's a theory of legal,

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:13,530
rational authority and his
theory of bureaucracy. Uh,

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,480
uh,
this is one of those questions,

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,450
those topics. Faber is probably
the best known for. Uh,

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,490
it's also that they're a complicated
issue when we are saying legal rational

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,600
authority be briefly referred to the rule,
the rule of law.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,170
And we tend to associate in our mind
that the rule of law a bit liberal market

9
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,930
economies and the liberal democracies,

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,880
well they bear has a very
complex argument about this.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,410
Um,
uh,

12
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:54,411
in the League or National Authority is
the kind of system of authority which is

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,630
predictable.
Uh,

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,100
because there is an observable
law. Everybody's, uh,

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,570
a subordinated to which
in fact has the, uh, most,

16
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:08,580
uh, uh, um, uh,

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,190
the clearest elective affinity
with a market economy. Um,

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,660
nevertheless, uh, um, uh, as video see,

19
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,661
he will argue that which is very counter
intuitive that a bureau stype of Frigo

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,350
National Authority is bureaucracy.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,880
And this is usually what we don't have
in our mind when we are thinking about,

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,520
uh, uh, uh, a market economy
that it is bureaucratic.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,390
So, um, uh,

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
we have to deal with Weber's interesting
claim that the purest type of legal

25
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:46,770
rational authority,

26
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,150
which goes together with and Monica
capitalistic economy is actually

27
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,310
bureaucracy.
Um,

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,400
it's also interesting that vapor does
not make an assumption that I'm a

29
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:04,221
bureaucracy legal rationale authority
or capitalism necesarrily goes together

30
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,880
with democracy.

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,420
How democracy fits into the picture
is a rather problematic for him.

32
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,230
Of course, we have to appreciate that
in Weber's when vapor was writing,

33
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,700
um,
uh,

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,820
about these issues somewhere
between a 1914 or 1920,

35
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,650
uh, um, I mean,

36
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:30,480
virtually none of the countries in
the world where liberal democracies on

37
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:33,010
universal suffrage and, um, uh,

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,370
the political systems of the world
changed so much in the last hundred years.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But he problematizes does relationship
and it's actually quite useful.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,410
So this is, uh, uh, the, um, uh, uh,

41
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,030
guideline for today's lecture.
Again, I strived with, uh, uh,

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,280
the definition of the ideal type,

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,280
the purest type of legal
rational authority.

44
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,900
And then I tried to dig into these,

45
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,901
a unusual but very influential Avebury
and argument that bureaucracy in fact is

46
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,080
the purest Stipe, a fleet,
rational national authority.

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,730
And then Ivo look at various kind of,
uh,

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,350
limitations of the exercise
of bureaucratical authority.

49
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,600
One is called the reality. The other
is functional division of Labor that I,

50
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,900
the separation of various
branches of government,

51
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,010
which is a limitation on
bureaucracy and representation.

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,930
Democracy as a limitation on government.
So you can see that he sees,

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,150
um, attention, right between democracy,
bureaucracy, legal, rational authority,

54
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,984
and capitalists.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They do not go as easily together as
usually we Americans tend to think about

56
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:54,540
this. And then a couple
of ideas about, uh,

57
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,720
uh, his, uh, his view about, uh, uh, uh,

58
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,000
democracies.
Okay.

59
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,110
So let me start with
what is the pure type,

60
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,580
um, uh, for, uh, illegal
rational authority. And, uh,

61
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,710
there are really two issues. We
have to very briefly talk about, um,

62
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,790
that are different ways how laws
and norms can be established.

63
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,360
You already beginning to feel
our way into the problem.

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,920
Whether the rule of law and democracy
are identical order, you know,

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,450
it can be democratic or does not
have to be that democracy democratic.

66
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,140
Um, and, uh, uh, then the question is, uh,

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,440
who obeys a wallet and home
on the legal authority.

68
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,610
Um, so, um, uh, and a, a bit about, uh,

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,990
I leave that Asher authorities. So
the, uh, the argument years rather,

70
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,860
there are various ways, um, how, uh, uh,

71
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,570
laws or norms can be established. Uh, um,

72
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,410
uh, and, uh, well he said, you know, uh,

73
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,200
legal or quality or rest on the
acceptance of the following guy ideas,

74
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,060
right? Well, the norms,

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
he said they can be
established by agreement.

76
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
That's what we usually think when we
think about rule of law or by imposition.

77
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,170
It can be imposed on people,
right?

78
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,190
And it can happen on the
ground of expediency.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,180
And it can happen because
these are the most useful laws.

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,200
And therefore the either agreed
that this is what we want to obey,

81
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,170
or there is an authority
which we impose on us.

82
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,080
Or it can be based on value.

83
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:48,760
Rationality may not be that
expedient may not be necessary,

84
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,500
immediately useful,

85
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,860
but on the basis of shared values or the
values of those who impose those laws,

86
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,900
and we tend to believe it.
Uh, uh, uh, reveal, uh,

87
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,700
this is the way how it will be
established. And then, you know,

88
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,320
of course,
the legal system,

89
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,660
it has to be a somewhat
consistent, uh, uh, right? Uh,

90
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,310
this is important for the predictability
of the system and it has to be

91
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,060
intentionally established,
right? Is Not coming, uh,

92
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,890
uh, or from, uh, uh, um, accident,

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,630
but intentionally established. But the
major point, what I wanted to make right,

94
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,170
that a legal, rational authority,
uh, in Weber's view, um,

95
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,930
can be actually an
authoritarian system. Uh, uh,

96
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,520
let's say, uh, uh,

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,200
chiller under Pinochet the later
times after he established,

98
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:54,100
so consolidated his power earlier
on it was a tire and Nicole, ooo,

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,440
but later on, you know,
Pinochet establish the, uh,

100
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,150
Ellie got rational order though it
was not democratic at all, right?

101
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,680
It was operating a weak legal system.
We tried,

102
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:10,500
he imposed on people. And you
know, in history we have a,

103
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,750
uh, a number of instances.
Then we can say, you know,

104
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:19,751
this country is a country
of law and law and order.

105
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,790
Uh, we know what the laws are. Uh,

106
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,480
we actually think the
laws are not unreasonable.

107
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,460
But it was imposed by some power upon us.
Now the next question is,

108
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,120
uh, who obeys a home and, well,

109
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,960
I don't want to develop on this along.
This is quite clear.

110
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,790
You already are familiar with this.
What is important?

111
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,690
Add the person who is in
authority, we issues orders, uh,

112
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,340
um, um, um,

113
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,000
is himself subject to an impersonal order.

114
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,000
So we are all subject to the same order.

115
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:00,680
This is the essence of Frigo
rational authority. Um, uh,

116
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,810
um, uh, uh, at least in the IDR type,

117
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,400
right? Uh, we, we know the
exceptions to this. Uh, uh, you know,

118
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:15,170
that will scorn if for instance,
in Italy, Italy really are illegal.

119
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,180
National Authority for a long time managed
a right to pass a legislation which

120
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,150
enabled him to escape prosecution.

121
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,050
Though he's probably involved a
number of criminal activities,

122
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,850
but somehow he managed to
escape criminal prosecution. Uh,

123
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,350
but that's the exception.

124
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,700
The rule is right that even
the person who is, uh, uh,

125
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:45,701
highest in charge is subject to the same
mortality and it has to obey the law.

126
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,230
Uh, and this is again, very obvious.

127
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:56,090
We already covered this. A the opposite,
the mirror image of it, right. Uh,

128
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,990
the members of the society,
uh, over or obedience, uh,

129
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,430
uh, uh, not to the superior,
not as an individual,

130
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,300
but to an impersonal order to,
to the law as such.

131
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,250
That should be quite obvious now. Um, uh,

132
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,310
so what are the major characteristic
of a system which is based on legal,

133
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:24,290
rational order?
That is a continuous rule bound conduct?

134
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,580
Uh, it's again, you know,

135
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,180
I think it does not a
call for too much, uh, uh,

136
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,360
clarification. Uh, it is continuous.
The same rules, the rules,

137
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,380
uh,

138
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,380
change slowly and with great deal of
difficulties as we see how congress is

139
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:48,120
struggling to pass a law about
how secure that for him, you know,

140
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:53,121
it takes months or years before an
important let new piece of legislation,

141
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,320
yes, into a place and usually
new pieces of legislations,

142
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,520
uh, in legal action or authority.
Our grandfather, right.

143
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,150
If you pass a new law,
you change the rules of the game.

144
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,010
You're usually grandfather them.

145
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:13,011
Those who entered the game before the
new law are still under the rule of the

146
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:18,360
old law. But you do that
at the universities all the
time, right? If for instance,

147
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:23,361
a degree requirements do change
in our university almost overs,

148
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,430
this degree requirements are these,
uh,

149
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,450
these new legislation is
grandfather are, you know, the, the,

150
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,280
the terminology,
right?

151
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,000
It will not apply to people
who are already in the program.

152
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,600
It feels only applied to people
who are entering the program or at,

153
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,660
or, you know, one way of grandfathering,
get that v if people are choice,

154
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:46,230
you know,

155
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,500
if you want to operate under the new
order or you can opt for the new oral, uh,

156
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,260
or if you want to stay under the old rule,
you can stay on the old rule,

157
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,910
only do four dome.

158
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,290
Those are the new rule binding
who are entering the system now.

159
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,410
So that's very important, right? That
is continuous and uh, and uh, um,

160
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,880
and roll band. And he's also said
in Ligo rational authority, uh,

161
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,920
there must be a very clear
separation of stress of competence,

162
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,580
right? Uh, who is, uh, uh,
competent to carry out what, uh,

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,600
and then you can have as a,
uh,

164
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,590
figured out how you will navigate in
that ego rational order. Uvl Be told,

165
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:32,370
well, this is not my table
or you go somewhere else.

166
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,500
So you go and you ask
something, um, from, uh,

167
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,400
the director of undergraduate studies
and the director of undergraduate studies

168
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:46,290
might say, go and see the dean of
your residential college. Right?

169
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,430
Because that is this fair of
competence of the residential college.

170
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,330
That's the way how legal
rational or ESC pose to operate.

171
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,930
And the same, you know, occasionally
the dean of college will say they are,

172
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,760
you have to see, um, uh,

173
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,320
your sociology professor or
your economics professor, right?

174
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,430
You want to get transfer credit,
for instance, for a summer course.

175
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,250
And then the dean of college,
they all said, you know,

176
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:17,251
it is the department be political
science or economics or anthropology.

177
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,370
They will be able to tell whether this is,

178
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,580
can be accepted as a, uh, uh,

179
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,360
an economic scores at year. Right. Um, um,

180
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,130
and this also implies that that is over
as a hierarchy and the right to have

181
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,140
appeal. This is, again, you are very
familiar with, you know, exactly. Uh,

182
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,880
if, uh, uh, you get a grade from
your discussion section leader,

183
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,990
you can appeal to the, to
the professor to say, well,

184
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:51,470
I don't think it's a fairly not grade.
I deserve a better grade, you know, uh,

185
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,160
and my section leader
and made an an error.

186
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,450
And if you are unhappy with
the response of the professor,

187
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,500
you go to the chair of the
department and at the old,

188
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,810
the cello and they had is a
whole hierarchy of Aptio. Right?

189
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,980
But you can try to correct
what you think is, uh, uh,

190
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,210
are not right. So I think it's
extremely important that you know, you,

191
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,290
you know exactly what is the chain
of appeal and how far you can go up,

192
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,380
but was surely there is also
some specialized straining, uh,

193
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,020
which is, uh, uh,
expected for people to do,

194
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:33,640
occupies certain positions.
Uh, so, uh, uh, uh,

195
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,930
uh, uh, discussion of section
leaders viewed all of us be, um,

196
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,880
at least graduate
students. Uh, um, uh, uh,

197
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,910
usually hell people can teach their
own course once they were past,

198
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,160
uh, um, uh, uh, they
had, uh, a phd students,

199
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:59,161
but all of over they have
is a dissertation to finish
or they must have that phd

200
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,590
and I, so that is a specialized
training and that's history, uh,

201
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,530
to perform certain functions
as such. Um, and that's,

202
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,930
uh,
an interesting and very complex idea here.

203
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,960
Either the staff has to be separated
from the ownership of means of production

204
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,970
and administration. And this
is even more important for, uh,

205
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,760
for, for Weber's argument being
separated, you know, it's, uh,

206
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,810
not, not that easy to penetrate what
he exactly wants to saving this.

207
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,920
What does it mean that you do not
own the means of administration?

208
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,280
It basically means that the source
of rules and laws are outside off the

209
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:46,600
administrators. As such, if you want
to have any change in the rules,

210
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:51,601
then must be some procedure
which is beyond the person
who is administering that

211
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,870
rules. How the rules can be changed,
right. And this, in order to, you have,

212
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:00,860
could prevent, uh, um, uh,
unpredictability in the system.

213
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,130
And that's why, you know, rules
change all the time. Uh, but, uh, the,

214
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:10,850
the, the fundamental principle is that
these rules should not be allowed to be

215
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,100
changed, uh, um,

216
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,320
by the person who administers
the writer though those rules.

217
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,610
Um, uh, so, uh, you know,

218
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:25,890
just to give a very
trivial example, once, uh,

219
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,790
you got your syllabus and the
course requirement, then, uh,

220
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,800
you know what kind of from
assignments you have to, uh,

221
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,180
uh,

222
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,180
they'll liver during the course in
order to get credit in this course,

223
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,480
then a welder Verking
out these rules, uh, uh,

224
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,110
professor plays a role. Uh, but you know,

225
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,730
we have to be get approved by the
courses and curriculum committee and then

226
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,290
innovative. We are bound by
those rules. So on Dovey,

227
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,670
I could not announce you today.
Well,

228
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:02,340
I changed my mind and that
will be an unseen, you know,

229
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,270
final examination.
Maryville have,

230
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,830
you will have to get a final examination,
right?

231
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,780
And Uv or not know what
questions I will ask him.

232
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:16,700
I can ask any question for the whole
course, right. If I would change, right.

233
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:20,360
These, uh, these rules right now,
uh, you have or would have app,

234
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,650
I'm sure appeal, you know, against
me, my, against my decision, right?

235
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,810
I'm bound Baru, so that, that means that
I don't own the means of administration,

236
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:34,610
right? I am, I am administering,
right? Uh, what is, uh, in, in,

237
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:38,810
in the syllabus that is a little
Levy, right? Occasionally,

238
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:43,220
I can give you an extension,
for instance, uh, uh, uh,

239
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:46,250
if you come to me, I mean,
therefore, it's, uh, uh, you know,

240
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:50,660
that is a little flexibility in the
system, but fundamentally, you know,

241
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,340
the course should be taught as,
as it is, uh, uh, in the syllabus.

242
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,680
And the requirement should be like
it is in the syllabus. That's what,

243
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,490
what it means, right? That you do not
own a ride. The means of administration,

244
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,760
unlike in traditional authority where
a feudal lord does have a dog's own,

245
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,700
appropriated some means of
administration from, uh, the,

246
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:21,290
the monarch and, uh, you know,
uh, British or the French,

247
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,120
uh, of high aristocracy,
uh, could, uh, make rules,

248
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,610
um, and not implemented those,
but would make rules as well.

249
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,730
The unique feature of modern, uh, uh,

250
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,620
legal rational authority is that
this becomes an impersonal process,

251
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,400
uh, by which is, uh, uh, uh, uh, not done.

252
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,750
There is a separation between those
who implement the rules and there's a

253
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:51,810
separate procedure.
How the rules are being established.

254
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,760
Is that reasonably clear about
ownership of means of administration?

255
00:17:56,761 --> 00:18:01,560
Means has not appointed out is a
very, very, very an idea, right?

256
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,940
For four Mark Strad, the whole
issue is the means of, uh, uh,

257
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,000
ownership of means software
production for vapor.

258
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:13,950
This is everything about the
administrations, uh, um, the,

259
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,670
uh, the means of administration. Okay.

260
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:22,290
Now we come to this very interesting way,
very and theory of the bureaucracy,

261
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:26,760
very interesting guy, very controversial
in many ways. Very counter intuitive.

262
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,990
Uh, you may say it is false.
Uh, uh, well, uh, see,

263
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,900
uh, and uh, that is a nice stop
before discussion sections. Um,

264
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,370
and, uh, Ivr, this is what I veal
will through a number of issues.

265
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,540
What is a bureaucracy, a
vapor and makes these, uh, uh,

266
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,560
quite incredible claim.
But first,

267
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:53,561
a UVL completely reject that the most
efficient organization is the bureaucracy.

268
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:57,390
Right? That's exactly the opposite
of what you think. You know,

269
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,950
when something is very
inefficient, then you say, well,

270
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,780
this is so bureaucratic,
right?

271
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,640
They were never that US claims that
the most efficient organization is

272
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,920
bureaucracy. Then, you know,

273
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,550
the question is how is
bureaucracy related to capitalism?

274
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:18,960
And socialism is really capitalism,
a bureaucratic organization,

275
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,000
but is the relationship between capitalist
market, economy and bureaucracy,

276
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,270
but are the consequences of bureaucracy
and also then some contradiction of

277
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,890
bureaucratic position.

278
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Now let's just quickly rush through
a for what are the characteristics,

279
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,810
um, Afa and bureaucracy. Now he said, ah,

280
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:47,790
the purest stype of legal authority.
This is, as I said, counter intuitive,

281
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,180
is that one dish employs a bureau
Katich administers if staff,

282
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,070
and, uh, well, uh,

283
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,130
what are the characteristics of the
staff in order to qualify to be due to

284
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,790
bureaucracy? They all, they
have to be personally three.

285
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,800
So it cannot be clients,
writer of a mentor, right? Uh,

286
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,870
there are legally free individuals that
makes it so different from a traditional

287
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:18,270
organization.

288
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,050
That's why a family is not a bureaucratic
organization because you are not, uh,

289
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,680
uh, uh, there are by
choice. Right? Um, uh,

290
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,451
and then,

291
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:33,030
and bureaucracy is organized into a
hierarchy of offices is something which

292
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,820
basically we already covered.
Um,

293
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,970
under the offices are a
field by a free contract.

294
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,320
Um, and, uh, in this contractor,
what your qualification is,

295
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,220
that's what we call that meritocracy.

296
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:53,221
People do have as it grows to a certain
degree and that degree qualifies them to

297
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,800
be incumbents have a certain office
and the receiver a fixed salary that's,

298
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:04,440
uh, uh, uh, it's not quite a
bureaucratic organization. Um,

299
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,510
if you're working for a
commission, right? Uh,

300
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:12,511
you are really in a
bureaucratic organization when
you sign a contract and you

301
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:18,991
know exactly what you are fringe benefits
will be and what your annual salary

302
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:22,860
will be, will be. Uh, uh,

303
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,710
typically the office is,
uh,

304
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,720
is the sole occupation of the
incumbents and it constitutes a career.

305
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,530
This is also very important,
again,

306
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:37,531
very different from a traditional
organization where people could,

307
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,440
uh,

308
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,440
actually we incumbents have a number
of positions and could draw in fact,

309
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,950
even incomes from a number of position.

310
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:50,440
In a pure bureaucratic organization,
uh,

311
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:53,630
you really can't have only, um, uh,

312
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,970
a single occupation. Um, uh,
uh, you know, if, uh, uh,

313
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,850
for instance, uh, uh,
somebody is appointed, uh, uh,

314
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,760
with tenure to Yale and,
uh,

315
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,820
is coming from another institution will
have to resign from his or her tenure at

316
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,610
the other institution.
If you are employed by year,

317
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:18,220
you can be only a year employee.

318
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:23,110
You cannot hold the multiple
jobs at the same time. Uh,

319
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,790
and uh, and it constitutes a courier and
the courier and means that is a letter.

320
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,770
You have some sense,
you know,

321
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:34,700
how you will progress in these
bureaucratic hierarchy. Uh,

322
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,410
again, the universities are classic
raw bureaucracies. You know,

323
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:41,380
that you entered as an
assistant professor,

324
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,470
then you are seven to nine years
depending on the institution of is south

325
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,030
tenure.
Then you are being promoted to tenure.

326
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,020
Then you expect that one point of time
to become a full professor, blah, blah,

327
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,240
blah. Right? I, this is what it meant.

328
00:22:55,241 --> 00:23:00,010
It is a career and in many bureaucratic
organization, even in the business world,

329
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:04,660
right? You'll have a sense, you know,
how you progress, uh, in a law firm,

330
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:08,500
right? Uh, if you entered a
law firm, right? Uh, you have,

331
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,820
you have a pretty clear idea that
it's actually very similar to the

332
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,720
universities.

333
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,930
Usually for seven years you are working
for the law firm and that's when you can

334
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,280
be gone right. At partner in the law firm.
Right. And, um, the, the crowd, you know,

335
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:29,090
so you, you, you, you have a sense
how your carrier veal unfold.

336
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,360
Um, uh, well,

337
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:39,170
uh, this is something we order
the kind of, uh, um, uh, uh, uh,

338
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,560
cover dry that you are separated
from the means of administration,

339
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,590
uh,

340
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,590
because you are subjected to this
zipline and control now comes the very

341
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,370
controversial idea.
And what do we have to talk about this,

342
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,600
uh, Weber's claim, you know,

343
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,910
which is against very much
against common sense, uh,

344
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,210
that, uh, uh,

345
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,220
the purely bureaucratic type
of administration he was
capable of attaining the

346
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:14,090
highest degree of efficiency. Uh, uh,

347
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,751
well,
uh,

348
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:19,751
led me on the other hand from the citation
on the line and important point here,

349
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,600
and this is a, you know,
uh, uh, of course we were,

350
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,930
was talking about a very specific
type of organization, you know,

351
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,040
bureaucracies which are relatively
speaking historically quite efficient,

352
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:40,520
slide the plush and type of bureaucracy.
But here,

353
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,260
here he emphasizes,
and this is,

354
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,850
these are two very important words
from the technical point of view,

355
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,950
right? The bureaucracy from the technical
point of view is the most efficient

356
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:52,880
organization.

357
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,270
It does not necessarily means that it
does achieve the highest valve fail for

358
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:03,821
people who are seeking to not navigate
in a bureaucratic organization,

359
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,900
but technically speaking, it
is the most efficient. Why?

360
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,460
Because it has a very high
degree of predictability. I mean,

361
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:18,200
this predictability might suggest that
it will take you a long time to get

362
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:22,490
through of that bloody Red Day, right?
What the bureaucracy was, is on you,

363
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,780
but you know exactly the red tape
and you know, if you are stuck,

364
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:31,310
you know how to try to appeal and
to get the process moving. So,

365
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,680
and therefore the crucial issue.

366
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:38,681
He said by the bureaucracy is so efficient
because it is technically competent

367
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,780
now. And it is, it is predictable.
And, uh, this is what makes it,

368
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,320
uh, actually, uh, so

369
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:54,310
to fit so well with the, uh, uh, uh, uh,

370
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,370
a Marquette, uh, uh, well he said,

371
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,850
what else? If, if it is not bureaucracy,

372
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,070
how can you advise,

373
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:09,071
organize an organization if it is
not done bureaucratically than it is

374
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,040
dilettantism. Right? Uh, um, uh,

375
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,770
and you may want to think about this

376
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,130
now. Uh, uh,

377
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,340
here comes the question about how
does a bureaucracy and capitalism are,

378
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,080
uh, fits into, um, uh,

379
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,690
and now he makes a very intriguing,

380
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,730
very provocative claim.

381
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,930
I think it is very deep and
deserves your attention.

382
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,960
He said the primary source of
superiority in a administration,

383
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,010
uh, life's in technical
knowledge. Uh, right. Uh,

384
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,820
bureaucracy is domination
through knowledge.

385
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,970
Now, a very provocative,
very important claim, right?

386
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,800
Bureaucracy is right.

387
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,360
The par exsalonce medical
cratic organization, right?

388
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,840
That people who are issuing command
artist showing command did the assumptions

389
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:16,170
that they are the most competent
people to carry this out. Well,

390
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:18,600
whether this is the case
or not, I, I, you know,

391
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,630
you remember Vba is all of us operating
with idea of taps or pure types.

392
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,660
The concrete cases may be
a different from it. Uh,

393
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:31,160
you may have people who are not competent,
uh,

394
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,130
to exercise the authority,
what they do exercise.

395
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,210
But I think it is important that you
have the idea of tie because then you can

396
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:43,950
be upset and you say, these bloody
bastard, right? It is incompetent,

397
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:47,100
cannot do their job and then
you can appeal and to say,

398
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:51,330
why don't you remove this person because
this person does not know about his or

399
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:54,870
her job is,
and actually such an appeal.

400
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,600
Very often it's consequential people.

401
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Occasionally I removed that position
if that in competence is being

402
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,120
demonstrated.
Um,

403
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,200
when all this is very difficult with
the university because universities,

404
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,190
we have the system of
tenure, you know, um,

405
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,160
after I use a software for seven
years as an assistant professor,

406
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:22,170
you are promoted to tenure and then it
is very difficult to get you out of the

407
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:22,800
job.

408
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,800
But even at the university is possible
if you find out that I'm completely

409
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:32,340
incompetent, right? You'll document
that I am incompetent, right?

410
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,840
That I'm just misinterpreting
all the orders you had here. Um,

411
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,860
and then you can appeal right to the
university and you can say that I really

412
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,720
should be removed. I, you know, my, uh,

413
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,990
tenure should be involved and
if I found to be incompetent,

414
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,750
I will lose my job about the
only way to do it. Yeah. Look,

415
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,770
prove my competence.

416
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,420
Actually University is very rarely do
it because a very painful exercise,

417
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,570
but because they are bureaucracies,
their is right.

418
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:07,950
The rule that it can happen and
it should happen in these cases.

419
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,550
And then he said, well, from
this point of view material,

420
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,440
it does not matter whether
an economy's organized as a,

421
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,030
um,

422
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:23,030
a capitalistic economy based on private
ownership or whether it is organized as

423
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:28,350
a socialist economy based on public
ownership. Right. And in fact,

424
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:31,680
now he goes even further and
it's very interesting what he's,

425
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,250
he got to say here in the, um, uh,

426
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,050
he's writing the some that in 1919,

427
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:41,010
1920 a the Soviet Union already exists,

428
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,250
Russia or the exists that
is already as society,

429
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,020
which costs itself Socialist,

430
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,920
which eliminated private ownership and
he said the hell socialism of would

431
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:56,921
require a still higher degree of former
bureau categorization then capitalism.

432
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,570
That's a very interesting idea though.
Antio now he's suggested, right that uh,

433
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,860
the bureaucratic organization is
the best bit free market economy.

434
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,740
Now he said, actually socialism,
you be even more bureaucratic.

435
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:17,050
And then I think what comes very,
it's a very intriguing idea.

436
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,861
And he said,

437
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:22,861
but the big problem with socialism is
that there will be a big conflict here

438
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,870
between,
uh,

439
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,870
the former rationality and
substantive rationality,

440
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,280
but the bureaucracy carries out
and you'll know by now, right?

441
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,230
Or do you have at least a hunch,

442
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,970
but he's getting get between
formal and substantive rationality,

443
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:40,661
right?

444
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:45,661
Former nationality is that you are simply
implementing the rules of the game.

445
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,260
Um,
uh,

446
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,510
substantive rationality is you are
actually concerned with develop fair,

447
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,740
the substantive goals of the action.
And he said,

448
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:01,390
well if you have a publicly owned
economies, centrally planned economy,

449
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,220
then the central planners make
substantive decisions about the economy.

450
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,560
They decide for instance,

451
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,970
their government or taxpayer money
should go off. We'll go to you know,

452
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,090
which branches of the
economy should be investment.

453
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,880
We're going to write in
a capitalist economy.

454
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:23,560
Governments you typically cannot do that,
right? They said the rules of the game,

455
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,850
well the best,
you know,

456
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:29,590
they manage interest rates and you know
they may be able to manage the currency

457
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:34,591
exchange rate but they cannot allocate
resources across the economy or if they

458
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:40,300
do, uh, then people there save, we
are on the road to socialism, right?

459
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,310
To the extent substantive
rationality is involved, but he said,

460
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,270
well if it is socialism, that
will be this big tension, right?

461
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,280
You cannot be at the same time for money,

462
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,510
rational and substantively rational.

463
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,820
You either consider that content of your
decisions or you are concerned simply

464
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,480
the the procedures of the decision.

465
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,070
If you are concerned with the
procedure that is former rationality,

466
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,480
if you are concerned with the content
that is substantive rationality.

467
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,430
Let me just give you one example
about the legal system. Uh,

468
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,580
indeed in Communist societies, uh, uh,

469
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,470
and probably to some extent
even China today, uh, uh,

470
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,490
too much less so than it was
at say 30 or 40 years ago.

471
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,540
Uh, well, uh, when justice
is being served by the court,

472
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,130
the court is not blind to who of people
who are being accused of committing some

473
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:45,930
crime is um, uh, uh, the communist,

474
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:50,931
the legal system called itself
a class law that in fact,

475
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:56,981
the purpose of the legal system
is not to be blind right now.

476
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,760
Who committed the crime.

477
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
The purpose of the legal system is that
was the kind of legitimacy see claim and

478
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,560
their communism to defend the interest
of the working class. Um, right.

479
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:12,000
And therefore that was,
uh,

480
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:17,050
specifically illegal system based on
substantive rationality right now,

481
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,540
uh, um, uh, capitol,

482
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,550
this legal system then to be procedurally
right rationale is the former,

483
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:33,080
the rationality in principle.
It doesn't matter who the person is.

484
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,970
Then you are serving a justice.
This is again the ideal,

485
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,680
right? In concrete cases actually, um, uh,

486
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,623
uh,

487
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,790
judges might consider
some sort of substantive
characteristics of the person who

488
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:55,010
is on trial and not simply
to implement the law, uh,

489
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,240
may consider as mitigating circumstances,
right?

490
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,000
For instance,
when they are passing the law.

491
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,190
And of course there are other reasons
how actually substantive considerations

492
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:09,500
entered the game. You know,
um, if you are white and rich,

493
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,730
you can hire a better defense lawyer
and your chances to get off the horse.

494
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,270
Basically,
we've seen the same rules are veterans.

495
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:21,890
So substantive considerations centered
the theme, but that's the exception.

496
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:26,230
That's not supposed to happen. The are
angry when it, this is happens, right?

497
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,930
We want to have a faceless legal system,
right?

498
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,390
A justice is blind,
right?

499
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:36,560
These blindness of justice
means radices simply,

500
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:40,520
procedurally just right and
not substantively so. Right?

501
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,050
This is why justice is shown.
We had blind eyes.

502
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,250
Now what are the consequences
of bureaucratic position? Uh,

503
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,770
here are some of them.

504
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,650
He said that it is a tendency of leveling
of interests since everybody's in

505
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,600
principle equal before the law.

506
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,450
And therefore interest will be level.

507
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,070
You are not supposed to take the
intellect down people's position in it.

508
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,410
Um,

509
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,410
well there is a tendency Medico
cratic tendency that people,

510
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,090
uh,

511
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,090
higher up feel have higher levels of
training or more training guest such,

512
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:25,010
uh, and uh, uh, the,
this is again, you know,

513
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,230
justice is blind. Uh,
uh, what is important is,

514
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,550
uh,
that uh,

515
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,680
the essence of a bureaucracy has to be
a formalistic impersonality a Sienna era

516
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,920
at studio, uh, this out hatred,
then passion, right? Uh,

517
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,860
this is why occasionally you are kind of
upset when you are confronted with the

518
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:53,070
bureaucracy. You have a
special problem, you know,

519
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,810
and then to bureaucracy tends to be
insensitive to your special problem,

520
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,700
right? Uh, uh, van it
is audio bureaucracy,

521
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,710
right? Uh, you can't say, you know,

522
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:09,540
I just had a fight with my,

523
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,710
uh, uh, [inaudible] and this
is my, I cannot take the test.

524
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,320
Well, see, you're not either a studio.
I mean, ah, in our yard, bureaucratic,

525
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,430
a discussion leader or professor
of you say, too bad, uh, you know,

526
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,740
this is your person or business.
The test is right now, uh,

527
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,120
you take it or leave it. Well, I mean, uh,

528
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,560
APP usually not that stupid bureaucrats,

529
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,270
but that's the spirit of bureaucracy,
right? This, our teacher, that passion,

530
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,050
that also means that you are
not motivated by, um, uh, uh,

531
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,003
various or no,

532
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,790
uh, uh, uh,

533
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,620
feelings. You know, you
don't differentiate.

534
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:54,180
This is a person I like and then I give
preferences Rodesh light and therefore

535
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,370
diva, uh, adverse grade. Oh, right.

536
00:36:58,371 --> 00:37:02,930
That are and number of contradictions
of bureaucracy. Uh, uh,

537
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,813
if is,
uh,

538
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,530
ah, ah, AH,

539
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,770
Betty formalistic. Yeah. Uh, um,

540
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,980
and he said that is also
another interesting tendency
do it is formalistic and

541
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:20,090
it's supposed to go
by, uh, at the, um, uh,

542
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:25,390
simply by the rule arose occasionally
not only under socialism,

543
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,570
in all systems, the bureaucracy
then to have, uh, uh,

544
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,650
some sensitivity to substantive
rationality to the welfare
of the people who are

545
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,650
under, uh, the bureaucracy.

546
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,760
And then it can turn into a
client that is stick system.

547
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,340
The bureaucracy can,
can have these, uh, uh,

548
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:51,850
these standards can think about that
fared bureaucracies, right? Miss,

549
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,520
you do have a great deal
of client that is Steve.

550
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,540
Dan Dance is built into them well,

551
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:02,760
and that are these various limitations
of bureaucratical authority.

552
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:07,550
Vaughn is collegiality,
a division of powers and representation.

553
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,253
Well,
um,

554
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,520
I don't want to dwell too long
on the notion of collegiality.

555
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:18,170
Collegiality says, really
grows out of, um, uh,

556
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,020
uh,
Watch v you as a,

557
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,340
uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, um,

558
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,853
as a,

559
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,020
okay.

560
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:44,020
The fashion all or groups or
professional or organizations.

561
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,960
So, um, that are different
ways how collegiality, uh,

562
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,690
can, can operate, uh, uh, one, uh, they,

563
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,573
uh,
uh,

564
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,720
that that means that you are interacting
with other people in the same, uh,

565
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,800
organization on the basis of collegiality.
Uh,

566
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:07,760
you can get a good sense
of these collegiality,

567
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,670
collegiality, for instance. Uh, uh,

568
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,810
it's very important in the
medical profession. Um,

569
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,330
if you go to a doctor
for a second opinion, uh,

570
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:23,090
this doctor is really not supposed
to say that his or her colleague,

571
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,500
the other doctor, uh, uh, video,

572
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:29,150
the school data and he gave
you the wrong diagnosis or,

573
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,540
or the or the wrong territory, right? Uh,

574
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,790
collegiality means that you stick
together rather the profession, uh,

575
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,700
sticks together. Um, uh,

576
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,340
that is a very strong
sense of collegiality among
lawyers or at least supposed

577
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:48,170
to be. The attic of legal profession
is very much collegiality.

578
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,570
And it is also, um, uh,
uh, incidentally in, in,

579
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:54,430
in the universities.
I mean,

580
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,160
okay.

581
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,480
Faculty is not supposed to bad mouth
each other, right? They, uh, uh,

582
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,400
certainly towards students they have
to show that they have a collegial

583
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:10,180
relationship with each other. Mutual
respect, balance them together. Uh,

584
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,680
occasionally that is a,
what he calls me talk all the reality.

585
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:16,770
The collegiality does,
Does Give Vico right?

586
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,190
To certain people to do
run this organization.

587
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,970
A single person can
veto a decision. Uh, uh,

588
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,430
such a, again, very typical
in universities, uh, um, uh,

589
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,960
vanee comes for instance,

590
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:35,640
to decision whether somebody's view will
be granted a permanent position in a

591
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,330
university. So called
tenure. That is actually,

592
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,840
I'm the president of the university
usually has a veto right?

593
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,200
And can veto no matter
that all, uh, bodies, uh,

594
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,400
approved that the president
usually have a vitro, right.

595
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,390
Can veto that to decision.
It uses it very rarely,

596
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,910
but occasionally it does use a,
it's a veto or, right. Uh, so, uh,

597
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,110
in, in even in a collegiality,
organized, uh, uh, uh,

598
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,530
a bureaucracy that is these,

599
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,380
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

600
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,340
individually [inaudible] score,

601
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,440
the GLT usually operates through
different committees and advisory boards.

602
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,630
Yeah.

603
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,780
Uh, uh, uh, uh,

604
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,660
I mean,
collegiality,

605
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:29,661
you surely is emerging in a situation
where you have a common trade or a common

606
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:32,004
profession.

607
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,250
That's when a group is being
organized as a collegial bureaucracy.

608
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,590
And as such, um, and, uh, uh, uh,

609
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,830
many or few Vlm Dapa and
professions in the bitch,

610
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,920
uh, UVL have, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh,

611
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,790
such a collegial, um, uh, uh, uh,

612
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:01,010
an environment as such a, um, uh,

613
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,310
okay. Uh, the other issuers,

614
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:08,270
which is also a limitation of the
functioning of the bureaucracy, right?

615
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,710
A collegiality man tried that though.
Uh,

616
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,020
the bureaucracy is supposed to be
blinded to individual differences.

617
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,180
It's not all of us because we have lawyer
off the stove was each other based on

618
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:24,870
our profession.
Lawyers,

619
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:29,871
solid legal to lawyers and doctors and
loyal to fellow doctors and professors.

620
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:36,030
So I have a degree of loyalty.
Um, now the other one is a, um,

621
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,910
uh, uh, uh, division
of, uh, off Bowers. Um,

622
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,910
uh, now there's division
off Bowers, uh, uh,

623
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:50,580
law, uh, and Montesquieu. And there
was silver was talking about the,

624
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,290
well, it's a function or system. Uh,

625
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:59,040
he cites Montesquieu about the
separation of power, um, uh,

626
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:04,010
uh, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, uh,

627
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,903
that,
uh,

628
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:10,020
creates some degree of unpredictability,

629
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,900
uh, in, in, in the system, but
necessarily, but creates some degree,

630
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,730
um, uh, for entree.
Addictability. Nevertheless, uh,

631
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,630
this is a very hard to prevent diarrhea
and he's so therefore it is good for the

632
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:27,290
economy by what he means
for the market economy.

633
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,750
And then comes the question of
representations and different forms of

634
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,140
representation. So, um,

635
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,690
well that are very, again, you know,

636
00:43:39,691 --> 00:43:42,270
what representation can be democratic and,

637
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:46,670
but is not necessarily all
that bloody democratic. Uh,

638
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,710
uh, uh, in fact,

639
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:53,711
that is a possibility of that presentation
when the representation is happening

640
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,820
through some, had a
deterring means, uh, uh, uh,

641
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:01,370
u s you know,
in

642
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,610
the additional authority,
uh,

643
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,460
people who were born in Sudan position
like Montesquieu, he himself, uhW,

644
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,310
was supposed to represent
certain interest, um,

645
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,530
and have each is beyond the,
uh,

646
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:23,531
the personal interest of the person that
was supposed to represent the interest

647
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:29,930
of the whole estate.
The what it did for standing for um,

648
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:35,160
well it's also, or in modern times,
we do have our representation,

649
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,360
well,
representations can be selected by,

650
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,810
by rotation or, or lot, um, uh,

651
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,990
in ancient Greece this happened. Um, uh,

652
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,140
and that can be a limited,
uh, mandate. Um, uh,

653
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,220
they are not representing, uh, uh, uh,

654
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,970
necessarily the interest of their
constituency and they can be,

655
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,620
uh, can be recalled. Uh,

656
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,410
this was typical of a
communist bureaucracies, uh,

657
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,340
or that it can be what he calls free
representation is what people would

658
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:16,341
associate to democracy where the
representative is elected rather than,

659
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,900
uh, selected or appointed.
Um, and, uh, it bought,

660
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,630
it is also not bound by instructions,

661
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:29,770
is only obliged to express
his own conviction.

662
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,190
Uh, so, uh, this is what we have seen
in the congress happening, right?

663
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:39,530
The Demo Democrats, um, uh,
[inaudible], uh, uh, uh,

664
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,570
Republicans because those Democrats argue
that I'm not under party discipline,

665
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:49,790
right? I am acting out
of my conscience. Um,

666
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,220
now, uh, um, uh,

667
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,440
a couple of ideas about
three representation and how
it goes with a capitalistic

668
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:03,720
economy. Well, what is
cool short item, they were,

669
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:08,450
keeps coming back and back to this,
but is vital for a capitalistic economy,

670
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:13,230
has to be a cocktail ability
and reliability. Um, uh,

671
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,720
uh, um, and uh, uh, well in, uh,

672
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,190
early stages.
In fact,

673
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,220
there was property qualification who
could actually water and that was

674
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,620
implemented in order to make the system
more predictable for the property

675
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,590
classes.

676
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:36,450
There was a great deal of concern by the
bourgeoisie to give universal suffrage

677
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,830
because they felt then this view
would be unpredictable who via, um,

678
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,130
via the elections. Um, in fact, uh,

679
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,760
very often these were monarchs and
absolute monarchs who were pushing for

680
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,190
extension, right, of suffrage.

681
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:58,470
Because they wanted to use this
against their property, uh, was Razi.

682
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,380
That's against something
very counterintuitive,

683
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:06,120
but I think historically a
very accurate, uh, uh, uh, uh,

684
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:10,770
understanding Grad.
So one has to be very careful.

685
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:11,460
Uh,

686
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:16,460
what exactly the relationship with the
capitalist economic order and democracy

687
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,590
is. Uh, uh, uh, so,

688
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:21,780
uh,

689
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,780
Weber's fundamental argument is what
many people who do the history of

690
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:31,570
democratic movement feel, Agri others
view, disagree with him. Again,

691
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:34,270
a good subject for discussion.
Um,

692
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,830
a parliamentary fee representation
was the product, uh, between, uh,

693
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:42,850
struggles actually struggles between
monarchs and the bourgeoisie.

694
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,060
Um, uh, well,

695
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:51,061
I think I'll just leave this here or
probably gave us enough food for the

696
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:52,390
discussion.
Thank you.
