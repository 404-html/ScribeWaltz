1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,530
Good morning. Um, I

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,150
have to get started because that is of
course a lot to be said about sigma on

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,140
Friday.
Uh,

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,660
I actually, it's a shame I have
only 50 minutes for it and not, uh,

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,310
Dorsey, uh, lectures. Uh,

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,550
just before I get into a fried,

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:34,551
I just want to tell you that I did send
the questions already emailed it to use.

8
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,290
So if you check your email,

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,890
you have the questions for next year's
Day and I strongly encourage you to

10
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,850
attend the lectures and the
discussion sections. Uh,

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,260
those questions are not
necessarily very easy, so you,

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,280
you may want to get more
exposure beyond the readings,

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,380
uh,
to have a good handle on it.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,190
And let me just a very,

15
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,970
very briefly come back to a nature,
uh,

16
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,590
before we go on to fried.

17
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:11,640
Why have you not phone fried
more than enough for today? Uh,

18
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,530
but I would like to ask,

19
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,510
still kind of rapid off and
to save on the bottom line is,

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,870
and uh,

21
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,510
the big question is to start with
what is genealogical mattered?

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,430
What is the new and in
the niches approach?

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,940
Um, and it should be clear from
the writings and from the lecture.

24
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,370
And I think from the discussion sections,
I,

25
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:47,150
that's what he's suggesting that
in the genealogical mattered, uh,

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,010
you viewed take, um, um, an
ideal and I'm more our principal,

27
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,730
uh,
what you think is the right idea.

28
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,690
And then he will show that one can
think about this idea different than

29
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:05,100
historically they did things differently.

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,130
And these major example is good.

31
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,570
Are you think an idea of what good is?

32
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,740
It's uncontestable easy to agree.
Well,

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,770
I will show you that in history had
an ocean of good and the opposite.

34
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:26,650
What is not good has been
constructed differently. Uh,

35
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,170
so the point of departure,

36
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:33,171
first of all the hell that is the Judaeo
Christian morality of Glaad and area.

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,290
I've your show, I've, you'll go back to
time. I go back to the antiquity and I've,

38
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:44,550
you'll show them the notion of God
was completely different, right?

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,620
Uh,

40
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,620
that is the general logical and
mattered a lot to do with consistently.

41
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,280
He really should be cleaning.

42
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,870
They're going back to the antiquity.

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,430
I'm suggesting that the good
in antiquity was the real good,

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,473
right?

45
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,660
It's just a comparative study which
relativizes the idea of God in your mind

46
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,360
today, uh, to make, uh,

47
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,450
you over there that God has been thought
about differently and different times.

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,390
And in particular,
of course,

49
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:27,391
his main focus is on the notion
of mortality in modern society.

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,210
And he said, well, that is something
unique about these modern society,

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,840
namely that morality somehow
is internalized into us
and we kind of accept our

52
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,930
own subjugation and oppression because
these values are so deeply invested in to

53
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:57,190
us. So that is in a way that
the general logic or metric, uh,

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,420
not to have, as I said in the
lecture, a critical vantage point,

55
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,050
try to get a vein that I will give you
the real universal definition of good and

56
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:14,011
ivy or criticize any question of mortality
from a universal concept of morality.

57
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,760
That's not what he does,
right? His major lame is, uh,

58
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,500
to show, uh, that, um, uh,

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,450
all morality's all conceptions
of moralities, all go,

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,440
all conceptions. Uh, what is, uh, um, uh,

61
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,590
uh, justice, uh, uh, what is fair,

62
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:40,591
what is humane and has been manufactured
right in the Virg sharp of ideals.

63
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,840
And this workshop I offer ideas is a dark
place that actually core shern torture

64
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,370
is being used to manufacture
these seemingly great ideas.

65
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,550
It's all about control, uh, over humans.

66
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,600
That's in a nutshell, right?
What niches trying to do?

67
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,850
So let me just make a step back.
Uh,

68
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,480
two marks and foreshadow
our staff for Vod to fried.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,240
So these nature has reality
little disagreement of it.

70
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:27,180
Marx theory of Eliana nation.
He said they'll as long as mark,

71
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:31,720
she's saying that in the modern world
we are alienated because we are not

72
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:35,960
masters of our own fate.
I agree with him. Uh,

73
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,540
Raj Vr Elian in this world,
and we do not have power over our,

74
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,750
our life external conditions,

75
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,130
ECT like fet for nature,

76
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:49,360
a standard storm and determines our life.

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,950
He agrees with these diagnosis,
right of modernity.

78
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,030
His problem with marks is that
march comes to a solution, right?

79
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,860
Mark Says Bell,

80
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,890
I know what human emancipation
VOB I know about good society.

81
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,310
Vob and I know who will get us there,
right?

82
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,260
The proletariat. And he said,
this is, uh, you know, uh,

83
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,010
this is churlish that's,
that's no good. Right? Um,

84
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,680
uh, I've, I won't do that. I
won't fall into this trap. Right.

85
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,070
I feel not manufactured and other ideal
because my workshop then ideas would be

86
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:36,050
manufacturer would be also a
workshop which smells, right.

87
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,030
And which is full with coercion.

88
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,440
And I would subject others to uh,
um,

89
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,390
uh, torture, mental or physical torture.

90
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,640
In the good old days, it was
physical torture. Today it's worse.

91
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,080
It is mental torture, right?
That's in a nutshell, right?

92
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,770
But he's trying to, to achieve. Um,

93
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,770
and of course that is no fried.

94
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,480
There is no labor and there
is no Michelle for core. Uh,

95
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,570
there is really no modern
and postmodern social theory.

96
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,400
This out niches inside.

97
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:17,960
This is a radicalization
of critical theory, right?

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,280
Political theory,

99
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:23,810
we've talked about this right from
Hagle two marks was a critique of

100
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,770
consciousness.

101
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,410
That's what is in our mind is a
distortion of the reality, right?

102
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,690
And therefore they were trying to
subject human consciousness to critical

103
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,410
scrutiny. Nicha does it the
most radical way. He said,

104
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,840
I am capable to show,
right,

105
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,750
the shortcomings of our consciousness.

106
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,520
We such showing you what is
the right consciousness, right?

107
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,260
That's the project.

108
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,390
Now seeing one fried and has a
lot of similarities with this,

109
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,920
right? He's also a critical
theorist. And he says, the hell,

110
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:05,921
what is in our mind comes very deep down
from the repressed and Ivy will show

111
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,320
you, right? Um, how,

112
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,770
if this causes you neurotic responses,

113
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,310
I can actually cure you by the age of Sti.

114
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:21,230
Let you understand what has been
repressed in your life experience,

115
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,340
and then how you can do
something about yourself.

116
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,990
So that's in a nutshell,
Zigmund fries, uh, contribution.

117
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,050
So it basically follows
closely, uh, Q, um,

118
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,540
uh, niches, ideas, and in the piece,

119
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,510
particularly what I ask you to read today,

120
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,050
one of the pcs ride a
civilization and these,

121
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:49,850
these con then he's struggling very much
with the problem niches is struggling

122
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,860
yet, uh, he shows modern
civilization as repression,

123
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,910
right? At the same time, he does
not want to reject civilization,

124
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,170
right? And he's tormented, right? Uh,

125
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:08,430
how to evaluate civilization, right? Um,

126
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,570
and val, he probably is
not going as far as, uh,

127
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,270
uh, as nature. Nature does. Maybe
a seat. That's when it comes. Okay.

128
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,320
This is as ignorant fried.
Um,

129
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,010
and it's a good advertising.
Don't smoke.

130
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,470
Uh, you have his cigar. Uh, uh,

131
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,310
he has actually oral cancer.

132
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:37,311
He was suffering from it during the
last 20 years of his life and eventually

133
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,240
committed suicide.

134
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:44,241
And the cancer obviously has something
to do with his cigars who don't smoke.

135
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,570
Um, well, uh, Freud was one
of the giants, uh, um, uh,

136
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:55,920
for 19 and early 20th century thought.
Um,

137
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,010
many people who would name the,

138
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,350
the intellectual giants of these time
a 19th century would name three names,

139
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,640
Charles Darwin,
Karl Marx and Sigmund Fried,

140
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,030
right?

141
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,030
These are the three thinkers
which made a rethink ourselves,

142
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:22,750
who we are and where we come from.
And uh,

143
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,950
what is the nature of the society
we live in the most radical ways.

144
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,970
Okay. Uh, let me talk very
briefly about, uh, uh,

145
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,880
fried slide.
Uh,

146
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,130
Eve was born in 1856 in what
is now the Czech Republic,

147
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,010
more rvr southern part
of the Czech Republic.

148
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,080
In a small city called she boy. Um, uh,

149
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,030
his father was a Jewish world merchant.
Um,

150
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,580
he was, uh, uh, or that he
married to his third wife,

151
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,760
uh, was about 20 years. His Junior.

152
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,950
He was a pretty dominating
figure. Uh, the mother was, uh,

153
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,740
on the other hand, a very
sensitive human being. Um,

154
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,730
uh, in some ways, uh, uh,

155
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,750
Fried's troubled relationship be
the aging authoritarian father.

156
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
And we had the soft spoken,
kind,

157
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:31,801
forced coming and warm mother does
explain a locked about his thinking about,

158
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,370
uh, um, uh, human life. Uh,

159
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,490
very soon after he was born,
he, they moved away for,

160
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,550
she bore a first be free divert in
Leipzig and then they moved to Vienna.

161
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,510
And this is where, uh, uh, uh,

162
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,630
Zignal fried received his education.
Um,

163
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,130
in 73,
he enrolled at the University of Vienna.

164
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:01,390
He was studying law for the VI.
He got very bored with it.

165
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:06,391
So he shifted into medical school and
received his medical degree in 81 and

166
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,580
[inaudible] two in the major
university hospital in Vienna,

167
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,770
which is scarred genital hospital. Um, um,

168
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,140
uh, in 85, uh, very briefly,

169
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,640
he went to study, uh, to Paris. Uh,

170
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:30,580
and this was very cool show
for his change, uh, because,

171
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:30,790
uh,

172
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,790
he became interested here in neurology
and especially became interested and in a

173
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,600
therapy about a French,

174
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:45,601
a psychiatrist was used and that foss
hypnosis to cheat hysteria and sort of,

175
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:55,051
he came back to Vienna and he decided
that he will now become a neurologist,

176
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,450
interested particularly in hysteria,

177
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,100
and we'll use hypnosis as a clarity.

178
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,140
Um, he also married in
86 as a life long. And,

179
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,290
uh, you know, uh, very, uh, uh,

180
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,800
peaceful marriage. Uh,
um, Martha Bernard's,

181
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:20,801
who was a granddaughter of
the Chief Rabbi of Hamburg,

182
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,000
so it's coming from a
deeply Jewish family,

183
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,300
but he himself had very
little faith in his life.

184
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,050
He began to practice
psychotherapy and he saw,

185
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,180
set up an office in a barrack Schrafft's,

186
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,190
a mind seeing a 19 barrack
stress saying central Vienna.

187
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,440
Here it is, the house today. Well, uh,

188
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,740
Zigman Fried,
uh,

189
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,730
start that to practice and
practice that until 1938.

190
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,950
And this is where psychoanalysis was born.
So,

191
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,020
uh, an important house. Um, so, um,

192
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,550
after 86,
right,

193
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,430
begin to collaborate with another app,

194
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,300
psychologist Joseph Broyer and Broyer,

195
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,750
I was not using the hype naughty care,
hypnotic,

196
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,320
a hypnotic metrics. Uh, what he did, uh,

197
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,110
he did something,
what he called the talking cure.

198
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,310
This is something what you occasionally
do or your friends do witchu right?

199
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,510
If something is on your chest,
then you call your friend and you say,

200
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,530
I need somebody to talk to right
now has some, some real big,

201
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,460
big trouble in you.
You want somebody to listen right now,

202
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:57,080
this is exactly what Brian did.
He did ask his patients,

203
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,060
uh, to talk to him, right?
And turned out that these,

204
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,170
a talking cure was very effective.
Uh,

205
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,310
as you probably all experience,

206
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:12,920
right when something is on your chest
and you have a good friend who is willing

207
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:16,700
to listen and does not rush
to give you advice and I,

208
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:20,810
this is whom you want, right?
Just to listen and nod,

209
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,170
to be sympathetic and tried to understand
you and let you talk and ask the good

210
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:31,520
questions, but not to give her advice,
right? There's four broiler discovered,

211
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,970
well in 1895,

212
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,430
they coauthored a book
studies in hysteria. Um,

213
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,710
and now they actually in the book
suggests that there must be a new therapy.

214
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,230
Don't put people asleep,

215
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,570
but make them Clark and led them
freely associate and through this free

216
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:58,571
association you throw verse in and then
they beginning to freely associated to

217
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,150
this world you actually can uncover.

218
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,740
They beginning to use
the term unconscious.

219
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:10,100
That is an unconscious
level in every individual.

220
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,310
And with this free association
you can dip into the unconscious.

221
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,380
Um, and in fact it was
fried who in doing this,

222
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:26,240
practicing this with
patients, uh, uh, also,

223
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,660
uh,

224
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,660
began to understand that a lot
of stuff in the subconscious is,

225
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:37,160
has something to do with
sexuality. And it is, you know,

226
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,760
unsatisfied on,
achieved sexual desires,

227
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,990
which are kind of repressed
into the subconscious.

228
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,050
And then through this free associations,

229
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,090
it was digging into the unconscious.
He began to discover,

230
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,740
um, a lot of sexual stuff. Um,

231
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,220
and then one year later it is
right. A very important, uh, uh,

232
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:06,221
they in the history of modern
social thought in 1896,

233
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,250
he finally has a name for what he
does and he calls it psycho analysis.

234
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,010
Um, uh, and, uh, here it is a,

235
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:22,310
if you have not seen this picture yet,
you should.

236
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,050
This was the famous couch.
That's where the patient had to lay down.

237
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,120
And Freud of us sitting
in an armchair and, uh,

238
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,100
listening to what they got
to say. Um, and, uh, uh,

239
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,770
uh,
asking just a couple of probing questions,

240
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,200
but the essence of
psychoanalysis is that I,

241
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:47,000
that you do not solve the
problem for the patient.

242
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:52,030
The patient has to find its own
solution that psychoanalysis a veal,

243
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,750
know what the problem is.

244
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:59,751
Eventually be a lead you that bring it
from the subconscious into the conscious

245
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,540
and then it is because
it becomes conscious.

246
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,860
You suddenly realize you
can't deal with it. Um,

247
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,480
now what about the later, very just
very briefly, it's a voluminous, uh,

248
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,090
uh, uh, in, uh, 1899,

249
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:22,980
he published a book which is
called interpretation of dreams.

250
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,451
And a,

251
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:28,860
it's to a large extent is
analysis of his own dreams,

252
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,450
but also the dreams of
some of his patients. Uh,

253
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:37,530
his father just passed away and we,
the dad of the father,

254
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,570
he had a great deal of guilt,

255
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,860
why he had these heat feeling
of his father. It was a hate,

256
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,630
love relationship, but, um, uh,

257
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,580
strongly motivated by hate. Um, and, uh,

258
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:51,960
uh,

259
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,960
he began to analyze himself and trying
to figure out what his problem with his

260
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:02,700
father was and what his relationship
with the moderate and father was.

261
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,260
And interpretation of dreams is a
very important step in this direction.

262
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,590
And the fundamental idea in these
past be breaking book that in fact,

263
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,470
dreams are not actually a dental.
Uh,

264
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,490
dreams are the time of this little window
of opportunity when some of the stuff

265
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:25,770
from the unconscious tries to come
up into the conscious. So therefore,

266
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:26,460
what he did,

267
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,460
he made people to remember their dreams
and then he tried to help them from the

268
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:37,880
material, which was surfacing
from dreams to understand, uh,

269
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,630
the subconscious.
Uh,

270
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,110
in 1905,

271
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:48,111
there is another major breakthrough is
publishing and the pathology of everyday

272
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,130
life, um, in which you,
you all know this term,

273
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,750
the Friday and slippage and
somebody just by accident,

274
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,640
some of got something wrong,

275
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:03,810
slips his strong and says something
differently than it should. The,

276
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,100
a fry does a show that very often
it's actually also the subconscious,

277
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,200
a good thing his head up and he is an
indication what is in your subconscious.

278
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,490
But is it a blessing?

279
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,260
Knew it was just not an error what
you did right beyond these errors,

280
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,450
he can see, uh, the
subconscious coming up.

281
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,080
And then of course the same year and
other major breakthrough probably next to

282
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,650
the discovery of [inaudible] is
the most important breakthrough,

283
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,610
the three essays on the
theory of sexuality.

284
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:44,270
And now he is moving towards what
some will say call a pan sexual,

285
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,560
just understanding of the mind,
uh,

286
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,660
well is probably pushing it too far.
Uh,

287
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:57,670
most what do not believe in fried,
so that are still many,

288
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,560
many people who do believe in
Freud, right? That are people who,

289
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,320
and I have this psycho
analysis and you know, just 10,

290
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,260
20 years ago, I mean, everybody
has his, his analysts, right.

291
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,870
Interesting. Now think somehow this
is a little going out of fashion,

292
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,970
but I think that are still people.
You must know people, right,

293
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,980
to have the analysts strat and they go
every other week to the analyst lay down

294
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:28,390
on the couch and you know, they speak
their mind and then they kind of relieved,

295
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,100
well, I would say, you know,
if have problems of depression,

296
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,340
why don't you try actually I think
does certainly does do less damage than

297
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:42,010
taking, uh, uh, this bloody pills.

298
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,770
What can not, not, not, not
that I, when I just cannot,

299
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,370
of course he would trouble because
these cycles of course all know,

300
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:55,930
because uh, for, for
our theory of sexuality,

301
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,580
uh, that all these problems
in us is that press,

302
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:04,581
sexual desires and everything has to
do something with our early childhood

303
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:11,221
experiences for boys with the
love of your mother and um,

304
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,650
and jealousy of your
father. And um, uh, uh, uh,

305
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,730
uh, right. Uh, uh, and it
goes the other way around.

306
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,050
Well also,
if you go to an analyst in no time,

307
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:28,390
he will start figuring golf value.

308
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,300
You really hate your father
or you hate your mother. Uh,

309
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,010
and well,
I'm not so sure that's the best thing,

310
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,450
but it can happen to you. But anyway,
that's what what he was doing.

311
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,220
And he in fact, you know,
he uh, um, discovers a,

312
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,860
I think an intriguing idea and
I think psychologists do these,

313
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:51,670
they are struggling with it.

314
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,920
How much trues that destroyed
the SOCOM. Saul, God,

315
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,220
early purse complex.

316
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:02,221
And you know what early posts complex ne
is the early post by accident marriage,

317
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:07,841
his own wife or mother of
any turns out that mother,

318
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,000
and that's of course a big tragedy, right?
You are not supposed to. This is incest,

319
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,600
uh,
which is the,

320
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:20,230
you're surely all civilizations
prohibited, incest,

321
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,370
um,

322
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,370
bow and this is early posts
complex that we are all those uh,

323
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,630
um, in lover. Uh, we, uh, uh, uh,

324
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,900
our balance of the opposite
sex and jealous of, uh,

325
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,500
of, of the other, uh, other parent,

326
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,100
right and do early push complex also
means that we have a desire to kill our

327
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,780
father in order to have the love.
In fact,

328
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:52,781
sexual love it off our imagine if you
had boys and Mash rivers are for girls.

329
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,940
Now I think everybody would agree this
probably pushed the idea a bit too far,

330
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:01,370
but that is clearly an interesting,

331
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,440
very important insight in the argument.
Then in the liter,

332
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:10,220
very, he is moving more to
have arts met up psychology.

333
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:15,221
Now he tries to explain the functioning
of society rather than just individual

334
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,120
UB psyche.
Uh,

335
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:22,121
the first major step in this direction
is 1913 when he published the book totem

336
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:24,920
and Taboo.

337
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,960
And this is about the origins
are fairly primitive society.

338
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:34,280
The transformation from a
kinship networks stretch tribal,

339
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,320
larger tribal society.

340
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,860
And he explains in this book
the origins of uh, uh, you know,

341
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,990
first complex society as the brothers
come together and they killed their father

342
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,270
and the father exercise that
in the kinship relationship,

343
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,970
absolute power. And in fact, uh,

344
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:59,540
he also believed that in these
early kinship based societies,

345
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,060
there was even no incest taboo.

346
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,040
So the fact that actually could
have sex, uh, we had, uh, um,

347
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,850
if his daughter says, well, now
the brothers come together, uh,

348
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,740
they kill the father and they
create the first civilization.

349
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,570
They beginning to wrap dress
desires, um, and uh, share,

350
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,110
uh, uh, uh, power among themselves. Uh,

351
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,960
that's a total Manta will.

352
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,470
Then he writes to important to you that
a conceptual basis beyond the pleasure

353
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:36,470
principle 1920,
and they go and eat.

354
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,180
And I asked you to read some of it,
1923 which are kind of,

355
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,940
uh,
important conceptual elements.

356
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,570
And I think this all culminated in his
a civilization and its discontents 19

357
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:51,614
Kirti,

358
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,030
which arguably if you are not
interested in individual psychology,

359
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:57,830
but the theory of society,

360
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,040
this is his most important book was
very big success and has not been out of

361
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,190
print endeavors since dirt the eighth.

362
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,990
He has to leave Vienna. He had, um,

363
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,760
a similar here at love
relationship to the city of Vienna,

364
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:18,200
stove out his father as many people did a,

365
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,640
but by 38,

366
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,670
the Nazis took it over a
guest star who actually, um,

367
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,870
interviewed, uh, uh,

368
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,900
his daughter a lot better love
to daughter Ana and sort of he,

369
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,980
he show the writing on the raw.
It's time to leave if you are Jewish,

370
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,720
you don't want to live in the term dry.
And he moves to London.

371
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,380
And just a year later he actually
called my commits suicide.

372
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,260
It's as an assisted suicide,
um, uh, his doctor, how Tim,

373
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,310
uh, to get rid of the pain he was
struggling with for a very long time.

374
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,490
Bell, a bit about UB psychoanalytic
movement. Fried's ideas. We are of course,

375
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,330
outrageous, outrageous
ideas. A very controversial,

376
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,630
never the last very early on or daddy
or 19 or two that are really a group of

377
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:13,940
very young and the evil people,

378
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,950
which included people like
Shandra Ferenczi and Carl
younger and they hadn't the

379
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,850
Strawns who wrote their Vondra fool,

380
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,140
a biography of the definite
biography of fried, if you want.

381
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,790
Of course, a very profiled the end,
uh, perspective, uh, to read it.

382
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,180
It's a great book. Um, eh indeed.

383
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,650
And they start to gather
in Beck set nine seen, um,

384
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,710
in Vietnam every events day this was
called events deep psychological circle.

385
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,190
Then in 1908, this becomes a, uh,

386
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,010
the VN up psychological society.

387
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:58,011
A bit of a misnomer because in no time
he's beginning to spread around the world

388
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,350
and that are psychoanalytic societies
all over delivered on deal this very day.

389
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,140
And if you want to become an analyst,

390
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,930
it's not enough to have a medical degree.

391
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,780
You have to go through years of
very rigorous training, um, uh,

392
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:18,900
um, uh, to these siteground artists
or scientists, we are monitored.

393
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,390
Uh, fried was also a very
difficult person to get along.

394
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,780
He basically had fallouts
with everybody first,

395
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,510
probably the most important of his
earliest associate Adler already in 1911.

396
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,520
They break up then with younger,
uh, you know, Adler Young,

397
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:46,521
good next to Adler are the dominant
figures of psychology in the first two or

398
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:52,050
three decades of the 20th century.
Then even later on,

399
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:55,110
he breaks with fancy,
who was a pretty loyal guy,

400
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:58,950
was not easy to get a fallout with him,
but you know,

401
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,700
Froud managed this, you know, he
couldn't make enemies everywhere.

402
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,510
Okay. Um, uh, then the really the
person who was running the show, uh,

403
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,690
uh, became, uh, um, uh,

404
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,840
his daughter or not fried,
uh,

405
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:19,980
who live the long life, uh, and, uh, uh,

406
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,500
hold up the torch and carried
the causal psychoanalysis.

407
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,080
So let me have a look at the work on,

408
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,880
uh, the Eggo. Not Arrogant. I'm sorry.

409
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,540
That's the EGL and [inaudible], right? Uh,

410
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,530
this is a Friday and slippage. It's, uh,

411
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,270
I have two glass.
They swap now that I,

412
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,610
he said that here he is beginning to move.

413
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,860
The initial idea is that is subconscious
or unconscious and conscious element,

414
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:58,510
what constitutes the human sexuality.

415
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:03,511
And now he wants to have a clearer
conceptual at banner to tools to deal with

416
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,890
this.
And he has bell,

417
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:10,690
our perception system has three
components. One is the ego,

418
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:15,790
uh, the other one is either,
and the third one is super ego.

419
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,220
And we will deal with all of this, right?
And therefore, what is interesting,

420
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:26,221
what is an introduction between ego
ID and Super Ego and this content and

421
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:29,050
civilization. They are
sweet, disagree deal.

422
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,340
These also talking about the
two classes of instincts.

423
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,470
What guy's life and that's
also important for um, uh,

424
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:42,550
see realization. And this one
valley, he said, you know,

425
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,680
initially we made a distinction between
the conscious and the unconscious.

426
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,250
Um,
and uh,

427
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,910
the idea of unconscious game from
the theory of repression that we have

428
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,930
unconscious because some of the
experiences we do not recall,

429
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,480
for instance,

430
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:05,950
our sexual desire to or
murder which was prohibited.

431
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,340
It's pushed into our subconscious and
other unpleasant experiences in our life.

432
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:15,230
We want to forget and be
put into subconscious.

433
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,310
That's [inaudible] you're repress.

434
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,610
We are oppressed and
on desired experience,

435
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,470
uh, here, unconscious, right coins sided,

436
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,050
uh, with what is latent and
what wants to become conscious,

437
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:36,820
wants to enter the conscious. These only
supressed than it is psycho analysis,

438
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,900
which helps you to bring
this into the consciousness.

439
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,330
But he said, well, it's
all that is repressed,

440
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,080
is unconscious. That's, that's
quite shoe. You know, um,

441
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,480
if you had bad memories,
you,

442
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:56,050
you tend to forget it and
put it into the unconscious.

443
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,530
But the big discovery was what not.

444
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,170
All that is unconscious is necessity.

445
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,920
Rewrap breasts that are
stuff in the unconscious,

446
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,420
which was there before
it was in consciousness.

447
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,540
Uh, uh, you said the lecture,

448
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:18,530
which is unconscious only descriptively,
not dynamically,

449
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,990
dynamically, man, it was depressed,
but that is an element of subconscious,

450
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,140
which is their only descriptively,
right?

451
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,180
This is what he called pre consciousness.
Before it,

452
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,640
it was never in the conscious,
right?

453
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,060
This just deep down in you.

454
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,220
Um, and uh, well, uh, he shed
viewed esteemed the term,

455
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:47,240
I'm conscious to the
dynamically unconsciousness,

456
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,580
breasts and now the two,

457
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:54,850
these repressed unconscious and the
preconscious together via constitute,

458
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:00,790
I suppose it now he
can now currently play,

459
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:05,000
but who have different
concepts now, fried, set,

460
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,260
conscious,
pre conscious and unconscious.

461
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,500
And the question is what
is the relationship between
those? So what is Eagle?

462
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,140
He said that each
individual and that is a,

463
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,400
a coherent organization
of the mentor process.

464
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,120
And this is what we call ego, right? Um,

465
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,513
uh,

466
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,620
well it is to this eagle that
consciousness is attached.

467
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,450
What is consciousness is as
is what is Eden. He said,

468
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,190
it is also a mental agency,
right? Which supervises,

469
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,960
um, uh, and constitutes the
process of thinking, ah,

470
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,170
he sat,
which goes to sleep,

471
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,560
but at the same time he's exercises
control even over your dreams.

472
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,550
That's your equal.
Um,

473
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,010
and the eagle is the agents of repression,

474
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,260
the ego VL repressed stuff,

475
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:11,261
which is in the way of the Eagle to act
that will push it into the unconscious.

476
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,620
Uh,
well he said,

477
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,690
therefore our therapy was to try to
bring into the ego what was unconscious,

478
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,530
right, and what else repressed.
Um, but that is something else,

479
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:30,380
uh,
which is not a repressed,

480
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,190
which also has a very important drive.

481
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,890
And this is it,
right?

482
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,170
Is What is deeply down in
your, your, those desires,

483
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,310
the drives which come out
of you and they are not,

484
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,020
some of it is not,
has never been repressed.

485
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,160
Does just by nature in you, for
instance, Shat sexual drives,

486
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,180
right? So I propose,
uh, the car, the entity,

487
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:04,181
which starts out from the
system of preconscious and
begins by the conscious and

488
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:11,060
the room and called the other part
of the mining to which these antique,

489
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:16,061
the extents and which behaves
through it as if it were unconscious.

490
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,173
The it,

491
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,870
it's unconscious but not repressed or
combination of repressed and preconscious.

492
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,460
Well,
uh,

493
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,590
he said the ego is very sharply
separately. The, the, uh,

494
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:37,680
from the IED, uh, it's
really the air, the,

495
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,770
uh, is uh, uh, below the ego
and that's the value, the,

496
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,940
this probably the best of graphs,

497
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,060
but he said the eagles or relationship
to the Ed is like a man on a horse back

498
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,100
right after the ride that is obliged to
guide the horse that the horse wants to

499
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:01,380
go. Right. This is the ID, right?

500
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,580
So the Eagle Vob in on the Horse,

501
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,190
the horse is the Ed. But occasionally
if you don't want to follow the horse,

502
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:13,590
you'd have the whole school by
the horse long to go. All right.

503
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,600
You try to control the horse, but that
is so much you can do about the horse.

504
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,470
It's a very important
idea and mature for us.

505
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:26,130
And then there comes the
Super Ego, right? He said,

506
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:29,930
the ego is not merely a part of the Ed.
All right?

507
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,200
There also exists that agreed in the ego,

508
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,290
which may be called the
ego ideal or the Super Ego,

509
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,970
right?
And a part of this ego is for the,

510
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,810
uh, you know, Hermie connected
to the consciousness.

511
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,340
Um, uh, um, and Vail, uh,

512
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,710
the Super Ego, right as
the, uh, he said, uh,

513
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,080
is part of a residue of earlier
object choices of the Ed.

514
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,360
Um,
uh,

515
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:11,450
but it represents an energetic reaction
formation against those choices.

516
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,460
It, it is what tells you what
you should be, not what you are.

517
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,610
The Ego tells you who you are,
right?

518
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,210
The Ego test a version
of reality and tests,

519
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,040
but you cannot achieve under the
conditions of reality, right?

520
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,460
The Super Ego is that part
of your consciousness, uh,

521
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,400
which actually will tell you
that what you should be right?

522
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,600
Adam Smith's,

523
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:44,601
you remember Adam Smith's the theory of
moral sentiment that is somebody inside

524
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:48,000
you with watching you and
makes a judgment on you.

525
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:52,800
Whether this is right or wrong.
The idea of super ego is very similar,

526
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,670
right to these Adam Smithian idea.

527
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,820
Uh, well sacco analysis you said was, uh,

528
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
criticize us for ignoring the higher
values in human life and ongoingly only

529
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:12,540
about sex and so on and so forth,
is that this is all wrong.

530
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,630
We are very aware of the existence of
the SIP Super Ego and that is a complex

531
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:21,930
introduction between ego ID and Super Ego.

532
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,750
Uh, well, ego is essentially
replicate safe. Uh, uh,

533
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,180
it's, it's, it's essentially
represents the external reality.

534
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:35,800
The external Verdis such a,

535
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:40,720
the Super Ego on the other hand represents
the internal of you on a view of what

536
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,070
you would want to be,

537
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,110
though you cannot be partially
because your drive sab dirty, right?

538
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,910
And you need to go does not
let you to achieve that. Right?

539
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,440
Uh,
so I actually bought,

540
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,040
belonged to the last part of the
mental life, right? The suppress stuff.

541
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,690
Uh, um, uh,

542
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,720
it's turned into what is the
highest in the human mind, right?

543
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,280
The Super Ego. Now that are
also two classes of instincts.

544
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:15,930
One instinct, what he discovered
early in the work is, uh, um,

545
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,830
uh, uh, what he, uh,
uh, calls libido, right?

546
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:25,950
The sexual desire and the desire to
live and survive and self preservation.

547
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,200
But there is another instinct in us.

548
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,210
It discovers she's somewhat later in
life and this is the desk in state that

549
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,910
Donatos so that are arrows.

550
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,150
And Donato Swan is what makes us live.

551
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,420
The other is destructive once to bring
us to this and the human life and the

552
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:52,261
human history can be understood as a
struggle between the arrows and Donatos.

553
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,990
Such a sad deism is a good
example of a tomato's.

554
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,870
Um, he said, uh, okay, uh,

555
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,910
let me move to civilization and discontent
and that are the major highlights

556
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,890
about ego development, uh,
religion and purposes of life.

557
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,390
Uh, a civilization as
restriction, uh, of, um,

558
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,220
sexual life. Um, uh, uh,

559
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,540
I got about ego development that is not
that much I have to add or interpret

560
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:33,850
here. Uh, well, uh, he said, uh,

561
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,210
um, uh, the ego eventually
have all seen us.

562
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:40,130
It's not just given in us,
right?

563
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,120
It sharply differentiated.

564
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,850
I can see this person
who has a strong ego.

565
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:49,520
You present your ego very
strongly and your ear,

566
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:53,890
the is being hidden from,
um, you know, if I've,

567
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,510
if I can, um, uh, uh,

568
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,240
put it fit Erving Goffman ride
the EOD is in the backstage.

569
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,500
You don't show it right that it,
but once you want to present is,

570
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,210
is your eagle. Um, uh, uh,

571
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,800
but this,
uh,

572
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,120
dwarves gradually right in the
process of human development.

573
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:20,730
You can see as eagle gradually
develops in a child, um,

574
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:26,030
and takes the form as it is and one
important process in this as you move away

575
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:32,500
from the pleasure principle to
the reality principle, right?

576
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:37,520
Is that a purpose of human life? He
asks, well, only religion can answer.

577
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,600
Talk to you about the purpose of life.
Uh,

578
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,680
I was a psychologist or a social
analyst or social scientists.

579
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:50,960
I cannot tell you about the purpose of
life is what is the purpose of life.

580
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:54,620
Now he comes very close to
the utilitarian idea, right?

581
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:59,220
The almost here. Um, uh,
John Stuart Mill, uh,

582
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,390
speaking to him, happiness. We
are all striving to be happy. Now.

583
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,620
I bought on the,
unfortunately,

584
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,300
the problem is that it's much easier
to be unhappy than to be happy.

585
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,060
Uh, uh, uh,

586
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:19,280
and because we are confronted
with the problems, uh, uh,

587
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,920
that, uh, uh, in fact, uh, uh,

588
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,280
on the happiness is much likely to be our
faith then achieve what we want to be.

589
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:30,170
Happiness. Uh, these, uh,

590
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,150
pleasure principle is transformed
into a reality principle.

591
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,350
We save out. That is the reality
of what we have to accept.

592
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,830
Um, uh, and you have to escape this.

593
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:47,990
We need to have this reality principle
to bring our unhappiness under control,

594
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,980
uh,
to be able to survive a sufferings.

595
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,350
We have to have a sense of reality.

596
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:57,320
And this is the painting of the ego.

597
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:02,350
This now become very close
to nature as close as a,

598
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,140
uh, um, uh, fried ever VOB right?

599
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:08,690
And the sub Lee nation of instinct,

600
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,280
that's all about civilization
is all about right?

601
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,860
The feeling of happiness is derived from
the satisfaction of vide intellectual

602
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,990
impulses untamed by the Eagle,
the blonde beast,

603
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:27,290
right?
That's where a pleasure comes from,

604
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,720
but it has to be tamed. All
right, here comes right.

605
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,410
The very measured on each and idea,
and this is happening through the process,

606
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,880
you know, um, if, uh,
on a long two s keep it,

607
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,200
then you,
you'll do it.

608
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,580
You'll become maniac or intoxicated.
You know,

609
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:50,480
if you cannot, uh, uh,
a feast dirty Allity,

610
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,850
then you drink, right? Uh, all
right. Uh, it was too much.

611
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,770
So I go to the pub and I ordered a double
scotch, right? And then I relax, right?

612
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,510
Uh, intoxication is the
way how to avoid reality.

613
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,690
I get drunk. Um, many people get drunk,

614
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,910
a very bad idea because actually it feel,
make it worse.

615
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,710
You're on unhappiness.
As soon as the first,

616
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:21,050
a few minutes of happiness is fast,
we be just verse.

617
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,760
Now. Uh, and uh, uh,

618
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,090
another way to do it is
sublimation, right? Of the instinct.

619
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:33,480
You suppress an end all in some days.
These instincts,

620
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:36,560
that's that actually, uh, the, uh, you'll,

621
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,550
you'll move into sphere of fantasies.
You fantasize rather than live out,

622
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,740
uh, you were depressed desires. And
this is the mechanism of fantasy,

623
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:49,110
which creates art and science.

624
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:54,111
And the most noble human activities are
actually sublimated unsatisfied desires,

625
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:59,730
right? Which came from the
ego. The came from the ear,

626
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:04,731
the ego confronted with reality and then
suppressed it and then was sublimated

627
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:09,660
into this higher, um, uh, um,

628
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,880
elements where,
uh,

629
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,630
he has a very nice
quotation from Gerta on, uh,

630
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,210
an unpublished poem and not,
uh,

631
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,370
surprisingly unpublished,
uh, this, uh, as, uh, um,

632
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,610
the people, uh, who have, uh, uh,

633
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,490
science and art also to have religion.

634
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,273
Um,

635
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,920
those who do not have either science
or art have to have religion.

636
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,540
Now it's a very interesting
guy. They said, in fact,

637
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,610
I don't think it is totally

638
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,530
obvious how you have to interpret
the special, the first part,

639
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I think it's a v one can interpret the
first sentence of [inaudible] business,

640
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:03,480
how to [inaudible]. Uh,
it, it basically means,

641
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,260
well, you know, science and
art is a sort of analogy.

642
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,640
And if you are actually a
scientist or an artist, you have,

643
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:14,010
you diligent and you even
don't have to be religious.

644
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,490
But if you have no
signs or, or, or no art,

645
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,900
in order to make sense of the life,
you need religion. Right? And that's,

646
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,180
I think it's, uh, not, not,

647
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,680
not surprising that he never
published the point. Now, um,

648
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,350
fry pushes far.
He is also antireligious and he said,

649
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:34,741
well,

650
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:39,741
indeed religion is just mass delusion
because it does create the impression,

651
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,083
right,

652
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,200
that you can actually more the
reality that there is purpose of life,

653
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,050
probably not in these areas,

654
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:52,470
but beyond that and you will
be able to achieve that.

655
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,270
That's why he calls it mass delusion.
You don't confront reality, right?

656
00:46:57,271 --> 00:47:01,500
You do not develop your
reality principle sufficiently.

657
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,290
Uh,
uh,

658
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,380
and of course he also caused this infant
dial infant died because you create the

659
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,710
figure of the God, the
Father God. And he said,

660
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:17,640
this is exactly the young
in the fence reaction,

661
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:22,670
how to respond to danger and the reality
to hope that you will get protections

662
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,110
from your father.
And he said,

663
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,440
this is exactly what religions are
calling upon my life, you know,

664
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:34,020
event venue address God as s my father.
Uh,

665
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,820
okay. That are different sources
of unhappy and NASA. Um, uh,

666
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,980
uh,
first of all,

667
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:46,981
the nature is source of our unhappiness
is superior and one part of nature is

668
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:51,460
particularly source of unhappiness,
our own body. And you know,

669
00:47:51,461 --> 00:47:54,040
if you are getting sick
and old like Freud dead,

670
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,810
it will appreciate more and more how
much unhappiness comes from your body,

671
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:01,450
what you don't necessarily feel right now,

672
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,520
but wait 50 more years
and you via, uh, okay. Uh,

673
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,690
and that is the biggest unhappiness
actually comes from human relations.

674
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,760
So again, something which
resembles a, uh, very much, uh, uh,

675
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:20,530
the young Marx alienation,
um, as a Rdna from,

676
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,800
from your fellow human being and
of course a very much a to meet Ya,

677
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:31,120
right? Uh, that the problem
is in, in human relations. Um,

678
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,840
now, uh, uh,

679
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:39,820
now the question is how onerous he can
solve this problem of human relations.

680
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,710
Uh, and because we have this big
problem, right in human relations,

681
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:48,940
people start blaming civilization,
like, you know, niche idea.

682
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,320
Um, and well, um, Eh, Eh,

683
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:58,490
I bet he said it is in fact conceivable
that man in earlier age is rather than

684
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:03,290
in modernity actually were
happier than they are today. Uh,

685
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,290
noble savages, right? Their happiness
in the state of nature. Rousseau,

686
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,710
he said, well, that's not
on reasonable argument,

687
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,510
but how does civilization developed?
Uh,

688
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,520
well he said suggest he's proceeding two
of are more and more control over the

689
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:25,480
external word,
but also true of us.

690
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:29,230
Extension of the number of
people included in the community.

691
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:33,280
Therefore more and more control
over other people, right?

692
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,460
This is sort of civilization
is a technology,

693
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:41,260
how to be able to control more people,
control nature and more people.

694
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,840
Yes, we already talked
about the totem and taboo.

695
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:51,170
You will see this on the Internet.
Um,

696
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,900
anyway,
or culture.

697
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:57,880
All civilizations are coming from the
oppression and this is a very important

698
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:01,420
insight. Very similar
to niches, a critique,

699
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:05,940
right of morality and Andy in particular,
civilization,

700
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,820
restaurants, uh, sexual life. Well,

701
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:14,850
the important IEM of civilization to
bring many people together into a society.

702
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,920
And, uh, uh, the, uh,

703
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:22,960
limit of uninhabited
sexual love, right? Uh,

704
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,390
it restricts sexual life.

705
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:30,780
He said his high mark was reached investor
in European civilization. It's, again,

706
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,860
almost, you read almost
Nicha right here. Um, uh,

707
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:40,090
a choice of an object is restricted to
the opposite sex and the morst extra

708
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:46,340
genital satisfaction are
forbidden asper version.

709
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,810
Uh, but, uh,

710
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,870
even heterosexual Janet Lav is rest
shifted all his sexual relationship on the

711
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,380
basis of solitary in those,

712
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,530
in the salute will bond between Vong
man and van of one woman is what is

713
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:06,740
accepted in Western civilization,
not in order stabilization.

714
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:12,050
And that is the more stress,
oppressive system of sexuality. Right?

715
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,350
Uh, uh, uh, uh,

716
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:22,400
right. And there is actually more to it
rather than the repression of sexuality.

717
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:27,230
You know, it has to, uh,
whereas all other kind of,

718
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,410
uh, drives, which is coming from the Ed,

719
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,760
it teaches you are right, uh, to, uh, uh,

720
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,690
love your neighbor and even
your enemy, which is, uh, uh,

721
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:43,040
in his view ride, uh, impossible, uh,

722
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,130
Barta of l uh, um, uh,

723
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,400
we have to control some house aggressivity
who will [inaudible] is the wolf of

724
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:59,240
man. I, this is kind of hops, Ian,

725
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,620
theory of human nature are
deeply down the are actually,

726
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,730
that is also a critique of mark smart
things. That is an easy solution.

727
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:12,500
You eliminate private ownership and homo
whom in Amarillo most will be solved.

728
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:15,590
He said this is naive.
Uh, this does not happen.

729
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,070
That I don't have time
to work on this. Um, uh,

730
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,980
though it's a very interesting idea.
Narcissism.

731
00:52:21,981 --> 00:52:26,780
And why you dislike particular
widget schools to you? Uh,

732
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,850
well, um, uh, uh,

733
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:33,190
I think I probably just have to leave
this here and just finish with the north,

734
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:37,910
uh, suggesting that uh, he
is actually very troubled.

735
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:41,330
He shows they're passive
nature of civilization,

736
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:46,660
but he does not want to buy
into the Nazi NTC realization.

737
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,640
Right. And he said, well, um,

738
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:55,090
I am not suggesting the super ego is
not necessarily super ego is necessary,

739
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:00,620
but I'm concerned about the super
ego to be tire at Ryan Nicole, right.

740
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,520
And less chart, you'll
find a middle way, right.

741
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,950
In which that's not be
naive. The Eod, uh, gifts,

742
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:14,420
uh, bad impulses, and they have
to be controlled by the Super Ego.

743
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,470
The Super Ego can go cool.
Far and too much.

744
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,680
So kind of ties to walk a narrow
way between marks and Nicha.

745
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,020
Alright.
Alrighty.
