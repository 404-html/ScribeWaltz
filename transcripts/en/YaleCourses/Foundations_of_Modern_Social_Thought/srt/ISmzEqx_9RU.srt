1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,850
Nope,
Dan,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,850
let's go on to Tomas hops and I
don't something about trouble.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,590
We're not everybody does.
Uh,

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,510
I've kind of history of ideas scores.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,090
I give you an overview of the individual,
uh,

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,620
whom you were reading from. Um, and uh,

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,720
uh, uh, [inaudible], uh,

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,950
some sense of the historic
times they lived in. Well,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,980
occasionally I get negative comments
in my course evaluations for this.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,330
People want just to talk about the
past, but they have to know, um,

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,210
uh, that are some people
who like it to see, wow,

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,530
this is how Tomas hops.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,260
So that four, I still
be doing this. I think.

14
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,440
What have you tried to do?
Yes.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,810
Go very fast through the slides.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,460
It should have my cake and eat right

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,700
and showed us sleep in that historical
context and the street and is all swollen

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,290
up on the board.
You can't go back to that.

19
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,050
And then there'll be
stopped that this week. Uh,

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,330
almost hops and, uh, uh, bad.

21
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,350
Their foundations of modern
social for good stock pops or not.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
That's a Mash Tun. Uh,
even some other courses I

23
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,590
bake them about that even eat

24
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,060
be Sundays. Audio almost pops. Yes.

25
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:51,490
The first I believe the foundation.
So mother silence,

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,240
um,
uh [inaudible] and the formula.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Then you stream the controversial speaker
and that's all very important issues.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,980
Yeah. All steel. That'd be

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,850
good.
Or are you by nature?

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,140
I think that will be handled crowd

31
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,503
one day

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,640
started that in the discussion sections.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,530
Got Our Napo in buddy border issues.
Almost false screen.

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,400
I do try to be low impact later.

35
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:40,401
Social Sam Smith or Nesha on Brian on the

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,410
next eight or and audios.
Okay.

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,470
So this is sort of sparse and a that'd
be just that if he could talking about

38
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,810
his life. I mentioned production.
You like the most boring.

39
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,660
Do you invest sport? I also mentioned
that the Spanish was a baker.

40
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,130
He had actual young,
he's fine. He's learned.

41
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,700
She man places in a cemetery.
Absolutely.

42
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,420
We'll know by that time.
So we have to skip and this,

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,210
that and the food must us behind me,

44
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,050
the kid off and uncle
when what's actually then

45
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,770
go off. So you saw a peptide.

46
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,363
Ooh,

47
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,460
I'd be back to Oxford.

48
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,460
They might go and call them in other ways.
Uh,

49
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,970
graduated became a future of feeding
cabin vishuddha sector as we begin.

50
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,123
And

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,110
then France and Italy.
It's very important because he,

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
that Med gone the literal,
it's absolutely going by getting battle.

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,700
And the quizzes,
Stein,

54
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,330
I already mentioned by the
halts kettles be classified and,

55
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,430
but basically it's even fellow would be
classified as a social science is you

56
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:20,160
boast as the much a map mission.
I get the big advancement,

57
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,670
I love all sorts of,
made me be quote unquote the sciences.

58
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,900
Now. Uh, uh,

59
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,770
he had close association, uh, person,

60
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,850
you'll be a fence faith and it
was Francis Bacon in the groups,

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,180
uh, fences fake come, uh,
plus a few awesome bird.

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,560
I haven't rejected of youngest
book value on logic system.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,060
Um, uh, which basically was a,
you have this system a stop out,

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,120
some major assumptions.
So we thought shows that alone.

65
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,560
It's the most open ecosystem.
As I said,

66
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:10,120
well I build these scores by stopping.
That's his bacon.

67
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,300
It does become in some ways
is the founding father of
modern science is because

68
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,620
he said every scientific investigation,

69
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,830
she'll start the induction from central
observation and what you observe,

70
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,010
you shoot off a suit.
It does exist.

71
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,250
What I've done for II advocate at the
methodology is was exactly the opposite of

72
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,400
Yeti slow Pallium methodology,

73
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,120
which trust document the FOP adoption.

74
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,720
But now that he most spending cools
the affiliated good Cavendish and had a

75
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:53,830
great deal of impact on hops
initially we'll eventually,

76
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,980
hops of change actually is mine

77
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,790
and the other they suspend
you left the stem time.

78
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,280
That is uh, uh, and, and uh, uh,

79
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,000
investigate natural science

80
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,110
in particular because the most important
sport for hops from Dadi level.

81
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,500
If you learn, and I'll turn
up who bacon's inductive Maca,

82
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,730
uh,

83
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,730
got a little awkward and methodologies
by it and watch social scientists to bed

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,590
who be in normal social science,
subscribed Neiman's.

85
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,070
That's was the methodology bunk to
the level a resolute called positive.

86
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,140
She got the math that from
struck the deduction, right?

87
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,690
You have some initial hypotheses,

88
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,540
then you'll move observation,

89
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,070
central observation and froze
the central observation you made,

90
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,270
inductions that you made back
and you test your hypotheses.

91
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,130
That's how I'd be in bed.

92
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,950
And this is what my bacon
learn from garden level and uh,

93
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,960
adapted this methodology.
And now this is a really,

94
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,490
they card, uh, you know,

95
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:28,491
one of the greatest philosophers
of the times and of all times the,

96
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,610
they now as compared to something
like call. Well, isn't it right?

97
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,523
Isn't it

98
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,700
he only man that he separated the
soul and body from each other and hops

99
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,040
rejecting this idea?

100
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,693
Uh,

101
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,300
because he suggested that in fact they
were engaged in a big debate on optics.

102
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,210
What,
what we do see,

103
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,450
and he hops was advocating that there
must be a real object whose movement we

104
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,450
see,
what we actually can see.

105
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:14,200
So he rejected the
dualism and then he wrote,

106
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:18,250
I mentioned very briefly,
he's try logix that quarter.

107
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,630
This is about the human body,
the homeowner, about men.

108
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,420
And finally the Seaver about society.

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,600
I see this is formidable and something
which APIs are great deal to social

110
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:34,720
scientists today, right? To try
to develop a theory of social

111
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,390
society,
which begins actually the biology,

112
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,340
the biological processes,

113
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,320
and build it up gradually from biology
to understanding of the social,

114
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,980
the individual, and from the
individual to understand society.

115
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,150
That's highly controversial. There are
many social scientists who rejected,

116
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,870
but today that are many social scientists
were greatly attracted to this and be

117
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,910
see an emergence today are for
sciences and social scientists.

118
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,910
Well,
a hops entered politics as a royalist.

119
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,010
Um, uh, uh, then, uh, uh,
really I'm Kevin Bisch, uh,

120
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,710
entered politics and in
fact harps, uh, translated.

121
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:24,711
I also mentioned to kitty
this and basically because
to kitty does express some

122
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:30,381
skepticism about the democracy in Athens
and he was greatly skeptical about the,

123
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,860
uh, the democracy. Um, and
the, uh, uh, believe the, uh,

124
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:42,060
the need for a strong central authority.

125
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,170
Where are these world very troubled times,

126
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,950
a troubled times and religious conflict.

127
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:53,670
So I skipped this one because I know
you are all very familiar with British

128
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:56,010
history,
but it all started with Henry,

129
00:09:56,011 --> 00:10:00,360
the aides who had a very trouble
the matador relationship. Right?

130
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,280
Year three, vives, uh, divorced
Vonn executed the second one, uh,

131
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:09,690
in search for Assan from
funnel, one of his, um,

132
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,190
his wife's. Um, but in
the process of divorcing,

133
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,600
he split from the Roman Catholic Church.
And that's from Church of England.

134
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,270
Uh, immersion. That's how, um, uh, uh,

135
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,080
England became a rather
standoffish a sword. Uh,

136
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,980
um, well, uh, again, as I said, I,
I skipped this one and one, they,

137
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,020
this is a, uh, the eldest daughter,
um, are from Henry ator. Mary,

138
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:41,660
the first call, the bloody Mary.
Uh, she inherited the throne. Uh,

139
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,130
she was crying, uh, to, uh, uh,

140
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,180
um, uh, establish a, um, uh, uh,

141
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,000
Roman Catholicism or Bart had to resign.

142
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:57,330
There was too much resistance against it.

143
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,500
So he had to resign. And the,
uh, give the Troon, uh, to, uh,

144
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,050
his younger sister, um,
our lizard that, um, uh,

145
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,010
and this is screen Elisabet.
Um, and Trina Elisabetta,

146
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,150
uh, uh, was at the time of, uh,

147
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,510
puritanism under a great deal of pressure
of puritans who wanted to get rid of

148
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,640
Catholics all together,
uh,

149
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,910
from government in England became this
became a very important issue. Uh,

150
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,830
later on. And New haven has his
spirit and connections. Uh, uh,

151
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,860
anybody is from Davenport College.

152
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,160
Nobody's from that are important.
Oh my goodness.

153
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,290
So naughty are purely turns around
here. There are, that's a shame.

154
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,810
Anyway, this was a reverend
John Davenport. Um,

155
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,870
he was a puritan who
settled, um, in, uh, uh,

156
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,490
new haven with his followers
in 16 dirt the eighth. And, uh,

157
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,920
uh,
already of course in I think 1703,

158
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,720
the puritans created this institution
and they were basically running this

159
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:11,530
institution until the late 19th century.
Not Anymore.

160
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,070
Okay. Um, now, uh,

161
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,330
there will be a great deal of
conflicts between, uh, you know, yeah.

162
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,630
Mary was called the
virgin clean. Well, uh,

163
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,000
whether she was a virgin or
not, it's unclear, but she's
clearly had a lot of, uh,

164
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,580
a very close friendship, uh, via
to value as a man in her life.

165
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:39,240
But she never married and
never gave birth to a charge.

166
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,270
He was actually a very good cleaner, a
smart, good, good, good, good, clean,

167
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,080
uh, by, uh, you know, the
challenges of the time. Um,

168
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,610
uh, uh, but, uh,

169
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,310
she was the last one and
died be the Assan. Uh, uh,

170
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,770
and, uh, then, uh, uh, the, uh,

171
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,920
the crown went over to the,

172
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,120
to the stewards and they
were total disaster.

173
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,130
James first was ordered the disaster and
Charles the first was real disaster and

174
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,230
they vote in collision of course,
with parliament.

175
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:18,520
And there was a constant war in England,
civil war,

176
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,090
culminating in 42.
And finally charts.

177
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:27,010
The first was executed in 49. Um, uh, and,

178
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:30,610
uh, Oliver [inaudible]
came to power. Now, um,

179
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,280
are here I give you a picture of
the execution of Charles First.

180
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,610
If you don't believe
it, you can see it. Uh,

181
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,210
well hops that got into some
trouble at that time. Um,

182
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,950
uh, uh, uh,

183
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,240
because he was too close to the
royalists and he had to flee England,

184
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,320
uh, in CC and 40, uh, a
head of time and he van,

185
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,190
uh, uh, to, uh, live in, in Paris.

186
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,610
And he was very close that
to the is exercise. And in,

187
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,850
uh, 51, he completed his
major book, Leviathan.

188
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,990
What review we'll be talking
about in a minute. Uh, um, well,

189
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,560
Leviathan became an
extremely controversial book.

190
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,680
It was very controversial in his
times. Uh, became, uh, actually, uh,

191
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,700
a big hot topic in the 19th century and
it's a very hot topic in the last 30 or

192
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:33,691
40 years because a lot of economists and
political scientists who are interested

193
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:40,051
in rational choice theorists discovered
in Tomas hops the first rational choice

194
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,340
choice, the earliest it's extruding.
He's a bonder fully lucid mind.

195
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,760
And if you read the text and
you know enough mathematics,

196
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,360
you could do a lot of his propositions
in mathematical equations,

197
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,680
what all else and economists want to do,
right?

198
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,980
It must be true if you can put
it into an equation right now,

199
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,990
that's what certainly Thomas Hobbs is
available to do because of the extremely

200
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,710
lucidity, uh, of, of,
of, of his mind. Now,

201
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,740
it was definitely a controversial book
also for the royal royalist because in 51

202
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,350
hops, and if you're talking
about this in great detail,

203
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,580
was considering that probably
people should be allowed
to transfer their loyalty

204
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,310
to an owner knew or authority
which offers safety. Right?

205
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,200
And that's what the royal is,

206
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:38,090
did not want to hear that crumb val
actually can become a legitimate ruler.

207
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,890
And that's what in a day,
um, uh, the book, um, um,

208
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,480
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

209
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,390
Leviathan, uh, uh,

210
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,430
foreshadows so he better had to skip
out of Paris and go back to London.

211
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,970
This is the first edition
of Leviathan, uh, 51,

212
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,300
and this is about the idea that people
are by nature evo and we need an all

213
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:13,630
powerful sovereign to avoid
the seat of war of uh, uh,

214
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,410
everyone against everyone else.
Powerful proposition. Again,

215
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,440
I would think probably half of the people
in this classroom then really think

216
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,720
hard about it.
Do believe hops argument.

217
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,950
Half of them would be violently
opposed to the argument, right?

218
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,380
So it's a very nice topic to
have heated discussions in.

219
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,090
Uh, the uh, um, uh, uh,

220
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,450
discussion sections there via turn,
uh,

221
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,920
is a sea monster, the state
or the silver room. Uh,

222
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,610
we need to keep order as such.
Okay.

223
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,410
There were a great deal of
controversies around him. Um, uh,

224
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,170
he actually was publishing rather new
trust stuff, only attacking universities,

225
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:07,030
which is over as a good
thing to do. Right. Um, uh,

226
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,890
but then in a 1660,

227
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:14,070
the monarchy was restored and charge the
second, the son of Charles De Fund, uh,

228
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,240
first became king hops was invited back
to the court and it looked like if you'd

229
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,270
be just fine right now as a royalist
not so because in [inaudible] 66,

230
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:28,670
there was a fire in London.
And because of this fire,

231
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,890
some people believe that this fire was a,

232
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,380
the revenge of God because
of the sin full New York,

233
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,390
Not New York, London. Right. And, uh,

234
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,620
they were therefore trying
to find the guilty long.

235
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,640
And who was there?

236
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,450
Of course Tomas hops with his is maride.
Uh,

237
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,100
no. So, so how is that
a journal life possible?

238
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,970
This must be an Ati is
his book should be burned,

239
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,500
if not himself.
So they did not burn his book and himself,

240
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,401
but you know,

241
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:10,401
he certainly was out of
grace and died in 79.

242
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:14,040
He was greatly admired
in continental Europe,

243
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,690
but was very controversial in England.
And Val,

244
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:22,860
if you don't believe there was a fire
in London, here is the proof, right?

245
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,850
That is the great fire of London 66,

246
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,090
which by you know, look like
Los Angeles to me, right? Uh,

247
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,430
okay.
About 3000 people right there.

248
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,670
The fire brigade was not as effective
as today is in southern California.

249
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,480
Okay. Now that's about, uh, uh,

250
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,390
the person and the times,
I think extremely for my,

251
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,460
as far as I'm concerned,
extremely important to
understand this, uh, the Virg,

252
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,540
um, if, uh, if you know the
times when he, he lived in,

253
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,580
okay.

254
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,810
All right, so now let
me go on and, uh, uh,

255
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,310
dark too,

256
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,450
uh,
uh,

257
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,080
Leviathan

258
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,173
[inaudible].

259
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,630
This is the first edition of Leviathan
which came out in [inaudible] 60 and 50.

260
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:34,520
Vaughn, uh, in cure big volumes.

261
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:38,330
Each one was 500 pages long.

262
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,760
Now this is the structure of the book.
The first spot is on the man.

263
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,300
Uh, uh, uh, and, uh,

264
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,400
the first few chapters are
about the mechanisms because
of Galileo or hops of us

265
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:57,910
are obsessed with the idea of motion.
Um,

266
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,210
so he described the biological
motion, spot moves, man,

267
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,120
senses, imagination, speech reason
and so on and so forth. Uh, the,

268
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,260
and the chap just sits is out bond
chapter. It is about empathize,

269
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,071
desires,

270
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:17,900
every versions and fierce and the theory
of voluntary action have you talk about

271
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:21,350
this. This is really very
insightful, very important,

272
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,450
a very great deal of impact on
contemporary times. And I hope that, uh,

273
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,970
you can also relate to it individually.

274
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:34,160
And then a chapter seven to 11 is,
uh,

275
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,010
uh, the relationship between
people as Sawcha. Uh,

276
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,880
and then the final, the, the state
of nature and the two laws of nature.

277
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:48,550
We've, you'll have to talk about
this in greater detail. So,

278
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,720
uh, the bar two is about common Val's, uh,

279
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,750
it's about really the first
theory of politics. Um, uh,

280
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,390
uh,

281
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,390
the rights and duties of the
governments and the subjects.

282
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,880
Uh,

283
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,340
there are some very interesting arguments
here that actually the [inaudible]

284
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,000
also have duties,
not only simply rights.

285
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,260
And then part three and four,
a offer,

286
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,070
some theological justification.
What he does, uh,

287
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,650
bizarre chapter, part three and four. Uh,

288
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,380
I think very the red, or at least
I see very few citations to it.

289
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,930
So what are the major themes of the book?
Uh,

290
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,120
first about the theory of human nature?
Uh,

291
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,000
the second one is the
relationship between, uh, uh,

292
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,350
nature and sort of the
theory of social contract,

293
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,810
uh, hops is really the first
of the contact areas, right?

294
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,970
Who are advocates that what brings
society together is a social contract.

295
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,740
If you want to understand.

296
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,400
So Saturday you have to understand
that we have contracts with each other.

297
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,380
And then finally the theory of the
Silverado, right? Uh, the major desire,

298
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,830
the essence of hops work years to try
to find an identifiable Silverman,

299
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,760
right?

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,530
He lived in turbulent times when you
did not know who the silver on is.

301
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,910
Is this the king is the landlord,
are these disease,

302
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:26,830
the burgers? Is this the parliament?
Who on earth is the stubborn,

303
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,400
he wanted to find one identifiable
silver and we can all agree this is the

304
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:38,250
proper source of law, right?
That's what he was obsessed with.

305
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,030
Okay. Uh, so let me then move
on and about human nature.

306
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:47,240
What are the themes here now? Uh,

307
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,040
one important argument is
that men will deliberate,

308
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,200
deliberate between appetites and
aversions and as a result it will act

309
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,100
voluntarily. Well, it's
a fascinating issue.

310
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,260
An issue. The cannot get
red out of our hair. Uh, um,

311
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,530
well when I was in your age,

312
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,950
the all of us were there
mentally debating the question,

313
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,230
do we have the two, three, three
bill? Or if you don't have reveal,

314
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,600
right,
our action is over a debtor mind.

315
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,140
This is exactly the question of what the
hops is talking about and develops the

316
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:31,030
idea of voluntary action,

317
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,210
which is kind of half day between absolute
Freeville and complete determination,

318
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,300
right? The idea is that
we are driven by appetite,

319
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,800
by desires.

320
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,730
Vivio talking discourse later
on about Zigmund. Right? Right.

321
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,460
We were stuffing you about derives right,

322
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,850
that our drives and have each
makes us move these out about hops,

323
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,050
God appetite few century
before they won't fry.

324
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,280
But then he said they also have aversions.
We have fears,

325
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,320
the are these what we want,

326
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,910
but we have fares that we won't
be able to achieve what they want.

327
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,510
And therefore we have to somehow
negotiate out between our desires,

328
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,230
appetites,
and our fears or aversions.

329
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,630
And what comes out is voluntary action.
It's weak.

330
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,910
Have a choice, right?
We have to measure up,

331
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,090
but the price of our action VOB and then
we decide where that it is worse stupid

332
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:41,220
this brass or it is not
averse to pay this price. Uh,

333
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,110
so I see somebody whom
I designed a great deal.

334
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,330
I thought it would be
a great partner for me,

335
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,910
but in order to approach that person
and to say, can I have a date?

336
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,220
It has risks because it
may say go to hell. Right?

337
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,680
And I don't want to be rejected. Right.
I have fears that Ivy will be rejected.

338
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,730
So I've even been measuring
God. Right. And some of you,

339
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,220
if you aren't in such a situation,

340
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,340
if you since that the answer will be no,

341
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,510
you don't place the phone call. Right?
And you'll, you'll never get that person.

342
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:21,350
Right. The fare over rules, right.

343
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,330
The appetite or others
will say, heck, you know,

344
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,450
it's a no then ivy or try a second time.

345
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,320
I've you're trying to curve time and if
it is no, the third time that I give up.

346
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:38,210
Right? Okay. So this is
voluntary action, right?

347
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,160
This is freedom,
right?

348
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,300
You are free to decide whether
you want to try it again, right?

349
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,440
Whether you want to
achieve your appetites.

350
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,030
And then the second point
is maybe of sea power.

351
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,290
The essence of human nature is
that we are striving for power.

352
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,690
Again, an issue, very good issue to
discuss at the discussion section.

353
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,501
Again,

354
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:08,501
I think the half of the class we
probably agree with hopes that people are

355
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,060
actually trying to dominate others.

356
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,740
Others will see we are much
more beneficial than three
are actually nice people.

357
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,190
You don't want to dominate.
Well, voc his argument for it,

358
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,490
he said actually. And the
last point is, you know,

359
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,920
if we want to survive vivio
need an all powerful silver.

360
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,940
So, um, voluntary action. Uh,

361
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,920
he actually said that
are two kind of motions.

362
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,600
One motion is what he
calls vital emotions.

363
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,710
And these are stuff like,
you know,

364
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,520
a food that we want to have food or
something and that is what he costs.

365
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,880
Well it sounds stage today,
animal motions,

366
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,820
but this is what I think is a better
called voluntary motion. So, um,

367
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,950
it'd be which actually has something
to do with the appetizer or desires or

368
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,410
aversions and how to deal with this.

369
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,790
So let me just speak about
appetites and the versions. Again,

370
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:13,250
I don't want to read the texts
savvy or put it on, um, uh, um, uh,

371
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,330
on, on the Internet for you. Uh, it
just describes what I have said, right?

372
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,750
That we all have appetites, we
have designers, we have needs,

373
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,990
and in order to satisfy our needs,

374
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,400
it always has costs and therefore
they have to figure it out.

375
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:34,140
Whether it was the cost for us
to satisfy that need, right?

376
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,110
And therefore we have a
certain degree of freedom.

377
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,890
We don't be conned to do
whatever we want to do, right?

378
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,520
Because we may not have the resources
to afford it or they have one,

379
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,540
we'd want to have many things.
And then we will have to have,

380
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:53,541
prioritize what we want to
have more and spend more on it.

381
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,990
As you can hear, right.
Hops is very close through,

382
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:01,230
but later on becomes the Utilitarians,
right?

383
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,930
Very close to what Adam Smith,

384
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,940
we'll argue in his economic theory or
what Joe Stewart, Neil have you represent.

385
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,870
It's uh, um, in, in, in his, uh,

386
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,760
utilitarian is or for the at that safe,

387
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:18,090
but what most economists today believe,
right?

388
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,220
Who called themselves neoclassical
economists or who identified themselves as

389
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:26,320
rat choice, right? Or
rational choice economies.

390
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,200
All political scientists or sociologists
for the sake that are some sociologists

391
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:35,040
who also subscribed to
restaurant of choice or I,

392
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:39,780
this is also very lovely liberation
and the bill. And he said,

393
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:42,930
well, when we have designers
and we have a version,

394
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,390
that's when we actually
beginning to figure it out.

395
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,850
We liberate what on earth is verse for us.

396
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,150
And the end of this deliberation,

397
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,050
we have a bill redesign.
I go for it.

398
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,060
I want that to date.
Right?

399
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:05,130
Or we decide I don't want it because
the costs are too high. Okay.

400
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,520
And this is what we call the Ville.

401
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,400
Your will will be that you
decide I go for it or you decide,

402
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,700
no, that's not verse for
me. It would be silly.

403
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,630
I make out a cloud out of me.
I just don't do it right.

404
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,290
That's the veal well, uh, about power.

405
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,740
The power is on ending,
right.

406
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,900
He said that is right.

407
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,770
A general inclination for
us to seek power, power,

408
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,620
influence on other people.
And he said,

409
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,960
this is not nothing evil about it.

410
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:44,961
It is necessary because if you want to
survive the veal have to try to exercise

411
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,250
influence on address.

412
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,580
We have to seek power as such extremely
important idea which foreshadows

413
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,820
especially uh,
uh,

414
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,840
Nicha and Max Faber who comes
up later in this course.

415
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,460
Well then he comes a very
interesting argument about equality.

416
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,010
Very exciting argument.
He,

417
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:14,170
he is one of the very first philosophers
who claims that the are all born equal.

418
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,391
Now for you,

419
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:21,391
this is of course of years but was
not obvious in 1651 that people,

420
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:26,540
mobiles and serves
slaves and slave holders.

421
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,020
We are all born equal.
Uh,

422
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,080
and he said in factor also
extremely important that
they are ever equal actually

423
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:40,600
in strengths.
Because even the weaker person,

424
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,130
we Casperson has the capacity
to kill the strongest one.

425
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,170
I even David can kill goal go out.
Yeah,

426
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,213
right.

427
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,280
But he said the same goes intellectually
and in fact intellectually we are even

428
00:30:57,011 --> 00:31:00,040
more equal than by physical plower.

429
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,910
So that's Sal's Mandra fool and
you probably all agree with it,

430
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,940
but then he makes a very controversial
point and probably that are some people

431
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,030
in this room who agree with him,
but others probably or disagree with it,

432
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,530
namely he said,

433
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,800
but comes from this equality
is this unending fight that
because we designed the

434
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:27,481
same thing and he operates with the
scarcity assumption that what is desirable

435
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:31,780
is actually scares if you're
five to each other. Right?

436
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,180
And we can fight each other because we
had equal because we cal can kill each

437
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:40,700
other. You can outsmart each other. Uh,

438
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:43,450
this is a very unusual argument,
right?

439
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,220
He is a very ironic guy right now.

440
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:51,520
He always says things,
but you may not want to hear right.

441
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,320
And this is something what, who believes
in equality do not want to hear that.

442
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:56,891
In fact,

443
00:31:56,891 --> 00:32:01,891
equality can be interpreted as the reason
for social conflict rather than the

444
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:08,080
solution for social conflicts. That
that is his argument. Very interesting.

445
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,480
Very unusual. Right, and again,

446
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:15,040
probably the closest to Nicha
as we will see they are.

447
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,240
Then we have, this is I, this
is, I won't read it, save it.

448
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:23,920
This is the page you want to trend
because for the rest of your life,

449
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,610
if you ever Vonn thrive to site the harps,

450
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,810
this is the citation,
right? And namely that the,

451
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,100
if we will be therefore be in a war of
everyone against everyone else for the

452
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:43,400
above reasons.
Now about the question of social contract,

453
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,450
a veil, he operates with this idea
of state of nature. Then they,

454
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,460
we'll talk a lot about this because in
among the most of the social theorist

455
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,780
found founding fathers
of social theorists,

456
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,990
there is a debate what is the original
nature of humans and it's controversial

457
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:05,930
that that this is a useful concept
at all the state of nature.

458
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:10,010
But he did believe in this.
Well, there are really

459
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,320
two basic laws of nature.

460
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,060
One Law of nature is that you are full,
forbidden.

461
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:23,790
What is harmful to you,
right? You have to post.

462
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,270
So self interest.
He had again,

463
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,720
you see the rational choice
theory speaking, right?

464
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,410
People are self interested and this is
the law of nature that we should be self

465
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:40,550
interested, right? We have to do
everything in order to preserve our life.

466
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,710
But that is a second law of nature.

467
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:47,711
You are used and this requires that
we what you would not do a yeah.

468
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,790
Not to do others.

469
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,930
What you would not want them to do to you.
Right?

470
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,950
This is again,
you may want to save these citation.

471
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,770
Very important citation for shadows,

472
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:08,060
major theorists of ethics,
which gum many,

473
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:11,870
many years or decades
or centuries after him,

474
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,320
particularly Emmanuel Kant, right? Uh, uh,

475
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,450
and his categorical in better diverse.
Okay?

476
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,730
Uh,
well does in the state of nature,

477
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,450
if there are no restraints,
that is no civilization.

478
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,240
That's a very interesting idea,
right?

479
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:36,740
That pressure limiting the
state of nature is necessary.

480
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,610
This is again, for shadows. Absolutely.

481
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,100
Zigman fried and his
theory of civilization,

482
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,740
the civilization comes out
of the repression of drive.

483
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:50,510
So rather than satisfaction of,
of drives,

484
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,310
if whatever you all need
is immediately satisfied,

485
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,440
there is no civilization.

486
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,010
Civilization comes from software inks,
right?

487
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,960
For from suppressed desires.

488
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:08,110
That's when you go back and you create
great pieces of art or you become a great

489
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:13,670
scientist because you suppress
your sexual and other desires,

490
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:17,450
right? That's, you know, it's
all of us from suffering.

491
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,800
They're great products of
humankind are coming from right.

492
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,120
That's what he's saying. And that's
of course what Zigmund fried view say.

493
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,780
Okay. Uh, there are the two
laws of nature and again,

494
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,720
I don't want to elaborate on it.
This is quite obvious.

495
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:37,530
He said that is the elementary
a law of nature. The right,

496
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,240
that's we have to do whatever is
necessary for sackcloth action.

497
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,520
And the elder one is that we
actually should consider others,

498
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,550
but others will do bell
and then the contract now,

499
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,430
but follows from the second
law of nature, uh, is that uh,

500
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,830
we pulled our rights as
side and transferred it to,

501
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,620
uh,
orders that uh,

502
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,270
these chance food of rights,
uh,

503
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,820
is something that is
some reciprocity there.

504
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
We give up some rights and
he gets something in exchange
protection or safety or

505
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:24,240
something as such.
Um,

506
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,700
and when the transferred
these rights to somebody else,

507
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:32,750
this is what is called the
covenant or social contract.

508
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,640
This is as far as I can tell,

509
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:39,230
this is the first formulation of
the theory of social contract.

510
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,210
Uh, it's not quite the
theory of social contract,

511
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,480
but we will read from a law or from
Rousseau because he said to again,

512
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:56,030
controversial comments,

513
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,300
one that in fact that contract we
entered by fear is also obligatorily.

514
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,140
Uh,

515
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,140
just because we were forced into
a contract out of fear does not,

516
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,610
does not mean that we can walk out
of this contract whenever we want to.

517
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,650
Right. So it's very much state to
school. He's a conservative guy.

518
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:22,550
I think it has to be understand,
right? He's deeply conservative.

519
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,070
And then he also said that in fact,

520
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:29,540
a former corner contract
makes void a later contract.

521
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,260
So that is no divorce. The
put in this way, right?

522
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,940
Once you'll swear. Do you
know that? Well, uh, uh,

523
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,580
I save it you until via live.
That's about it, right? Uh,

524
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,440
that is no new contract,
which avoids it.

525
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,800
They'll, uh, uh, now, uh,

526
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,890
very briefly about the power of the
silver and it's power is to produce safety

527
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:58,690
to the people, right? He
lives in unsafe times,

528
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:01,260
so he wants safer safety.

529
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:06,810
But obedience is only due to the extent
the silver and can deliver the safety.

530
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:12,240
And if it cannot lie, charge
the first couldn't, well,

531
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,680
you could redraw your,

532
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,550
um, uh, um, uh,

533
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:22,840
obedience to you. Loyalty
from it. Okay. Now, uh,

534
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,640
uh, what is, uh, important, uh,

535
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,690
in his time to find out who the sewer and
ears and the silver Sudan actually can

536
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:36,410
be? Uh, and, uh, uh, I just, uh,

537
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,600
point out two words from the
citation can be transferred on war,

538
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:42,670
man,
right?

539
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,750
The king or a pawn one assembly of man.

540
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,900
That's I think extremely important
though he was very strongly in favor of

541
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,920
absolutism.

542
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,250
He did consider right that the silver
and can be a properly assembled body of

543
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:03,790
man. What, how they view
be properly assembled.

544
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,680
He doesn't have the faintest study or
doesn't have the guts to say it right.

545
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,170
It will become much more clear in
lock and particularly in Rousseau,

546
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,890
uh, where the sewer and ears
and it becomes of course,

547
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:21,880
crystal clear in the
American constitution,

548
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,150
we start re the people,
right?

549
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,810
That's the silver one is uh,
in hops Stein,

550
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,820
it was not quite we the people,

551
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:35,680
but he did consider that it may
not be the royal, the royalty,

552
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,350
the king right now, the,

553
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,890
the sewer industry have
duties. Uh, uh, uh,

554
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,890
the, uh, office of the Silverman, uh,

555
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,560
has to procure safety of the people.

556
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,950
And he said he adds to this extremely
important that it is not bear

557
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:01,700
preservation. It has to give
more than just survival, uh, uh,

558
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,930
as such, and therefore you can expect to
the server and to deliver this and the,

559
00:40:06,931 --> 00:40:11,170
the silver than does not deliver.
You can, we drove right? You royalty.

560
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,880
So even though he is, uh,
uh, a theorist of absolutism,

561
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,150
he does see you ride the
need and possibility that
you withdraw your loyalty and

562
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:23,440
new transfer it to,

563
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:28,210
I got king right to a good
silver and as such, um,

564
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,430
uh,

565
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,430
well the question is also what are the
good laws are the people say good laws

566
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,030
are the laws which are good for
the, and uh, and he said it,

567
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:43,180
this is extremely important,
but I, I highlighted it.

568
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,600
It is not so not through that good laws
serve only the silver and the good laws

569
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:55,180
should serve the people. Uh, well, uh,

570
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,980
and this is the end of it.

571
00:40:56,981 --> 00:41:01,510
What are his contributions and
what are his shortcomings? Well,

572
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,530
his emphasis is on peace and order,
right?

573
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,280
But what he does not consider that
the silver and might abuse his power.

574
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,450
And this will be the big criticism
of hops by later theorists,

575
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,350
particularly by law Vivia seat
or that events day, right?

576
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:25,770
Rory is primarily considered by the
possibility that the silver and may abuses

577
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,700
power
they'll,

578
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,950
and then he actually does
not develop as a result,

579
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,460
you theory how power
can be held in checks.

580
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,100
That is no theory of checks and balances.

581
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,460
That is one in hops and even one
more developed in Montesquieu.

582
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,950
And the American constitution does not
come from hops or the cops for comes from

583
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:54,230
Loc.
And particularly from Montesquieu.

584
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,910
Montesquieu is the one which
defined that checks and balances,

585
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:03,170
which entered the American constitution.
They're all,

586
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:05,030
he was an apple or genetical.

587
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:10,050
Theories of an enlightened absolute
is not any absolute isn't right.

588
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,970
Uh, he was, uh, against
the real monsters, uh,

589
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,440
as I ordered it demonstrated as a result,

590
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:23,441
he was not acceptable to the monarchs
because he put too much limitations on

591
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,310
their powers,

592
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,700
but he was not acceptable to the
emergent bourgeois class because it that

593
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,570
rebooted too much power to the
