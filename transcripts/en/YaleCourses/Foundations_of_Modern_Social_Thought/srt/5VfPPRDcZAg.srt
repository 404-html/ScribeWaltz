1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,070
Okay,
I have a lot to talk about today.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,540
Uh,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,540
and we move a one century and
then move into another culture.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,740
Both are very important. It
may move from, um, uh, um,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
uh,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,240
17th century England
to 18th century France.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,850
We moved from a situation which was
dominated by civil war chaos and the

8
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:37,070
yearning for, um, uh, clear run, uh,

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,340
and the movie in a, uh, century, um,

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,710
you can call it of enlightenment.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,220
And that's where the term
enlightenment comes from,

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,710
the French context and
a century of decadence.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,600
Eventually it leads to our evolution.
But before the revolution,

14
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:01,830
that is a lot of fairly juicy decadents.

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,870
So two different epochs
and two different cultures.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,460
Uh, British individualism, uh,

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,320
Hobbes and Locke,
we're methodological individualists.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,510
They thought,
uh,

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,510
the analysis should start all
of us with the individual. Uh,

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,420
you remember hops,
right?

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,670
Individual rives and fairs and then he
builds up what society is starting all of

22
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,920
us from the individual,
not the French.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,880
The French are
methodological collectivist.

24
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,840
They believe that is
such a think as society,

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,640
which is more than the sum
total of the individuals.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,040
And somehow they know how to grasp it.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,390
So these are the changes,
what UV is. See, uh,

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,310
uh, today, there's today
and next Tuesday, then Vba,

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,320
we'll be discussing Montesquieu and Ron
Jacques Rousseau before we return to

30
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:12,690
British individualism or Adam
Smith's and John Stuart Mill.

31
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,360
Don't ask me why this difference
between the two cultures,

32
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:23,361
but there is an a lasting difference of
today's topic is Montesquieu and I have

33
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,260
a lot of fun stories to tell,

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,560
but our try to limit my anecdote
so I can focus enough on,

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,440
on the texter and do not
run out of time. Um, uh,

36
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,570
by the end. Okay. So that was Montesquieu.

37
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,050
Uh, uh, he was born and as
Sharis Louis de Second. Dot.

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,160
Barone our bread,
um,

39
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,180
was born in 1689 near Bordeaux.

40
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,750
Um,
his father was a former normal family,

41
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,000
but because he was a younger son, he
had to become a mercenary. And the,

42
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,540
in fact he was fighting chirks in Hungary.

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,430
He received a law degree in nevertheless
from the University of Bordeaux.

44
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,780
Um, and uh, in 1715,

45
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:24,190
he did what many atoms? Stock crash
did. He married a val, said woman,

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,180
I was wrong. Uh, large tig, uh,

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,920
which was helpful for him because
he was not all that very ballsy. Uh,

48
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,350
though he was a noble man.
Uh,

49
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:40,351
his uncle Voss a bottle do Montesquieu
and when he passed away a shower,

50
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,500
Louis, uh, received the his style at all.

51
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:49,450
He became Montesquieu
and inherited his office.

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,690
The presidency of the parliament
of Bordeaux. Don't think about it,

53
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,710
was not a very big deal and certainly
did not offer income for the luxurious

54
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,243
life,

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,280
was not particularly effluence stuff and
was not a particularly powerful stuff.

56
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,140
Now I bet about the times.
Um, well here it is.

57
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,640
Louis cut off the highs of
French absolute is ma'am.

58
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,090
Uh, well he caught him. They,

59
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,220
he was called the Sun King and
here is his emblem. The son, he,

60
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,170
you know, the sun is shining
like the sun. Uh, they are, um,

61
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,330
uh,
he actually claimed the,

62
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,430
that's a famous sentence and important
to understand Montesquieu later,

63
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:43,180
some work. Uh, I am the state. Well,

64
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:47,620
it was a kind of an overstatement.
Not Quite. He pretend to,

65
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,560
to be more powerful than he actually was.

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,300
The French absolutism shows.

67
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,380
She did show order the cracks and the
bourgeoisie was becoming already quite

68
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,550
powerful under the times
of Louis Carr tours.

69
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,160
But he had the notion of
French glow, ah, the glory,

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,230
right. Um, uh,

71
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:16,231
and he built these wonderful palace of
Versailles showing what Gla or glory is,

72
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,850
uh,
uh,

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,170
resident to go ride.
Also emphasize,

74
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,260
emphasize the French, go. Ah,
the French are very fun of it.

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,170
Okay. The 18th century was
the century of enlightenment.

76
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,650
They call the [inaudible] of Lumiere.

77
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,610
Lumiere means the light.
Um,

78
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,390
well it was the car,
uh,

79
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,260
who transformed philosophy
two words, uh, uh, uh,

80
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,340
the code view cold look of reason.

81
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,180
And that was Yvonne,
which was spreading in 18th century,

82
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,333
um,
uh,

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,440
in grant Cardone and thing
in the 1789 revolution.

84
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,020
And we see two major
steps in this direction.

85
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,180
Montesquieu Andrew saw, uh, uh,

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,560
well one of the major accomplishment of
the enlightment for the publications of

87
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,170
Aussie Clopay d, uh, the
sort of blood assessor,

88
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,790
a British and cycle encyclopedia
Britannica of digital and Darla and bear.

89
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:36,801
And they did.

90
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:41,780
And which put together rationalistic
scholarship of the time.

91
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,840
Well here you have the first edition,
uh,

92
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,370
for [inaudible]. Um, well, uh,

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,750
as, uh, Louis Carr course passed
away, his five year old, uh,

94
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,230
great grandson, uh, um, uh,

95
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,510
Louie fifteens and became the king
and root for a very long time.

96
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,630
Now, uh, the,

97
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,640
the K of absolute wisdom men royal
authority continued and the are really

98
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:19,520
entering now, uh, with, uh, uh, 1715,

99
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,410
um, one, probably the
longest in modern history,

100
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,620
the longest epoch of decadence
and sexual permissiveness.

101
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,970
It's interesting. Kind of seem
to recur in human history. Right?

102
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,390
Then you had a similar kind
of permissiveness and sort
of decadence 1890s until

103
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:47,120
1914,
probably 1930 and then the 1960s,

104
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:50,360
of course, right. Then
everything goes, uh,

105
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,100
well this was a time of the scanned.
Well,

106
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,140
um, he was not at particularly
interested in governing, but,

107
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:04,970
um, he was very interested
in beautiful women. Uh,

108
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,300
well he was quite a good looking
guy when he was young as well.

109
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:12,740
So I'm sure women very fat
interested in him too. And you know,

110
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:16,730
the name Madame Pompadour,
uh, was, uh, uh,

111
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:20,150
the most famous and most influential,
uh,

112
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,630
of his mistresses.
As I said,

113
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:27,600
it was becoming right at time of
her sexual permissiveness. Uh,

114
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,330
promiscuity,

115
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,920
a ditty vice spread also
affected Montesquieu.

116
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,180
It is a Madame Pompidou,
uh,

117
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,470
indeed a very beautiful person

118
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,250
but not only a beautiful,

119
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,060
she was extremely smart
as as far as we can tell.

120
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,310
He was an intellectual of
very distinguished stays
days he knew or people of the

121
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,860
Enlightenment Voltaire,
uh,

122
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,860
one of the big trouble makers of his
time and he supported the dro and the

123
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:04,190
project of Aussie Clopay d uh,
which is a,

124
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,210
it was unusual because you know, royal
authority did not really like, uh,

125
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,160
this one.
Well,

126
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,240
and that me just give you a little
ethnography if you are interested.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,320
[inaudible]
a br.

128
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,900
Sure.
They're low lack law.

129
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,280
I wrote a novel about the sexual and
most of this time, which is scar,

130
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,310
the dangerous relationships they liaison
dodger is now there was two movies out

131
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,720
of made of fit and anybody
watched any of these movie?

132
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,750
Nobody watch it. Wonderful movie
where there are two versions.

133
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,160
One by Roger, Vadim, uh,

134
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,220
and that puts the whole story
in French society of its Stein.

135
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,060
And the other one is an
American Ron Stefan Fares.

136
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,430
And it is Glenn close. Uh, uh,

137
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,400
who features in it now? This
is the Pr Luden movie. Okay.

138
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,500
Borrow it. Do, you will have
fun and you'll be, you'll
have an understanding, right?

139
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,040
But meet an 18th century in France was,

140
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,080
and there Montesquieu and Russo
are coming from. And of course,

141
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,970
this is the American version with
Glenn close. She's already, ah,

142
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,900
you know, the person, what
she likes to play, right? Um,

143
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,570
uh, the vicious woman. Okay. Um, now,

144
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,410
uh, Montesquieu, uh, well,

145
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:41,000
he lives in the century of
enlightenment and promiscuous.

146
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,610
He sells his office though.
I mean,

147
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,870
he made it lifts from the verse of
his wife, a salsa band business,

148
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:53,250
but then he leaves the van business to
the wife and beginnings to travel in

149
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:57,510
Europe and in England.
Uh, then when he returns,

150
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:01,170
he settles in Paris, leaves to
the vive and back, you know,

151
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,120
to run the van business.
And he will be getting to write.

152
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,730
Uh,
he writes a publishes in 1721 already,

153
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,000
the parish and letters.

154
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I talked about this before and then he
was elected on the basis of these two.

155
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:23,420
Academic, Fran says, uh, the French
academia of sciences and art,

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,330
the very big accomplishment
that these very early age.

157
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,830
And finally, 1748, he
publishes doing major book.

158
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,610
Um, it, this is really
a very important book.

159
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,650
I hope you did what I asked you
glance that it not an easy read,

160
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,060
a bit drier than some of the
texts we read, but very important,

161
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:49,490
fundamentally important
stuff. Did you ask him to, uh,

162
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:53,280
write something for the Onsie
Gloppy d about democracy?

163
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,860
About he's bored with the
question of democracy.

164
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,180
He wrote enough about this.
So he writes an article on taste.

165
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,150
Okay.
And he died in 1755 and patty,

166
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:10,730
so these are the times, and
this is your order. Uh, um,

167
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:11,780
okay.

168
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,630
Montesquieu

169
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,903
MMM.

170
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,510
Oh, let me move on to, uh, the Varick.

171
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,980
Oh
yeah.

172
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,840
So here we go.
This bit is off the laws.

173
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,850
Anti yet is the first edition.

174
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,860
So what is this book?
Uh,

175
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,480
the first part as a lawyer and genital
and different malts of governance,

176
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,220
uh, entered us think,
not pass breaking. Uh,

177
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,310
this is not what he did
be remembered for though.

178
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:17,360
I mean that he is opening some
very important subject matters.

179
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,600
The second one is law and politics
and separation of powers VVC,

180
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,710
right. He bills, uh,

181
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,070
on lock and takes lock
him a big way for Vod.

182
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,100
Great improvement in many of,
you know,

183
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,390
to the extent that is improvement of
course lock has some insight which is

184
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:40,391
missing from the Montesquieu and
formulation of separation of powers.

185
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Uh, then he has this extra ordinary
section on low and climate.

186
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,190
This is one of his big contributions.
Uh, um, Ivs. Sure. You,

187
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:56,270
I mean, the way how he
formulated is extremely naive.

188
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,570
Um, almost borders on
the ridiculous, but uh,

189
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,250
given, uh, the 21st century,

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
there are very few people with
the exception of [inaudible]
who I named already,

191
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,250
right in the introductory lecture who
was so sensitive that society lifts in

192
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:19,220
these globe.
Right.

193
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,490
And how society is formed and structured
and how its laws are being shaped is

194
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:31,151
actually greatly influenced by the
nature of environmental and climatic

195
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:38,600
conditions.
So he is the first of ecologist.

196
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Here's the first environment artists
thrive who understand the interaction

197
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,230
between social organization,
Morse ethics,

198
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,920
ideas and society. Right. Um,

199
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,650
and then the, that that is a
bit on law and commerce. Ivo,

200
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:02,370
very briefly talk about this law and
religion and Ivo skip this section or

201
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:07,130
together. And Lo and history, I also
skipped. So what are the main teams?

202
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,870
First, you know, we'll be about
classification of governments then ivy,

203
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,760
we'll talk about separation of
powers and then an environment,

204
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,160
law and social structure.

205
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,660
These are the issues they
will be rushing through.

206
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,290
There's a lot of staff,
uh, to, uh, uh, uh,

207
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,390
look at it well before Montesquieu,
uh,

208
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,480
the question when they classified
government was who rules,

209
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,690
who is the silver and
Montesquieu changes somewhat.

210
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,710
The discourse is interested
in the manner of governments,

211
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,430
how people who are in authority rule,

212
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,000
uh, uh, the real music distinction,

213
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,800
better government is moderate
or whether it is despotic.

214
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,220
Now, what are the questions? You
know it when you try to judge, uh,

215
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,960
the nature of a government, one important
question you, he said you should ask,

216
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,130
ah, the various power
separated or not. Um,

217
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,130
irrespective who rules, whether it can be
a king, it can be an elected president,

218
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,750
it can be a prime minister.

219
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,490
The question is I have
the power are separated.

220
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,000
And the next question is,
this is very important.

221
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,900
Why do people obey the question,

222
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:40,901
why people obey orders is Dutch
strip on by hops and lock,

223
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,740
but it's not really elaborated.
This is the issue.

224
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,760
But the will call the
question of legitimacy, right?

225
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,060
What are the principle of why the obey
orders and Vivio see a much later in the

226
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:02,081
scores at it will be Max Weber's will
elaborate on this issue at great lengths.

227
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,640
Um, and then the next question is, okay,

228
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:12,590
is the ruler and individual or
is this an institution? Is it,

229
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:17,000
this is all very interesting
enrichment of the idea.

230
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,190
But the nature of governments are,

231
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,850
he himself supports a constitutional
monarchy at his reports.

232
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,850
Um,
uh,

233
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,940
a monarchy right in which there is
a king or clean but king and clean,

234
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:36,110
which operates on the rule of law.

235
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,960
That's what constitutional monarchy is.

236
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,230
The second major theme
is separation of powers.

237
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm still elaborating what we
are. Come well, you have read,

238
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,510
uh,

239
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,510
lock distinguish between and executive
and federative branches of government.

240
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,300
More skew,
uh,

241
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,630
distinguishes between legislative
executive and you're ready.

242
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:04,230
Call now. This is the
Vaughn, uh, which is,

243
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,290
has been so influential on the
American constitution about the,

244
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,520
or believe now in this country that these
are the three branches which should be

245
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:19,440
separated. Though of course,
the federative remains to
be an interesting issue.

246
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,450
Who should exercise federative
powers the powers of war?

247
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,370
Should it a the legislature or
should it be at the executive branch?

248
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,630
Uh, as such now, um,

249
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,850
or Montez cures that the three
powers will have to be separated.

250
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,970
The legislative power,
uh,

251
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,200
and this is a departure
from Hobbes and Locke, uh,

252
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:49,260
should be by elected representatives.

253
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,480
And then he makes an important,
a new contribution.

254
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:59,460
And he said the right of
minorities should be respected. Uh,

255
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,110
though he kind of foreshadows
something like universals, um,

256
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,940
um, uh, uh, wall thing though is
not quite explicit about this,

257
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:13,260
but you can read into it. But then
he said, the minorities, right?

258
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:17,970
Should it be, um, uh,
reserved? And he said, well,

259
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:22,971
the legislative power cannot and should
not be held by the monarchs and what it

260
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:29,100
has to be limited. There must be a
limitation on legislative powers.

261
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,633
Um,
uh,

262
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,720
and the executive bill exercise
checks over the legislature.

263
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,670
Um, and Vivio again, doc
about this in more detail.

264
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,990
Uh,
and,

265
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,990
but there must be some checks and balances
over the executive branch has val,

266
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,450
um, when it comes, you
know, who controls what,

267
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:56,451
he puts more emphasis on the executive
limiting the legislative stand the other

268
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,520
way around, but, uh,

269
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,410
reveal see what the arguments are and
about the ration of for this is and how

270
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,250
this affects, for instance,
the functioning called
the US government today.

271
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,690
I think it is not all that far of a,

272
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,210
for the blueprint Montesquieu um,
established,

273
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,040
laid back, um, in, uh, uh,

274
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,400
the mid 18th century.

275
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,360
And then the last issue
of VOB environment, uh,

276
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,140
how social conditions are shaped, uh, uh,

277
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,320
by environmental on conditions,
but he said,

278
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,420
but that is also a general spirit,

279
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,330
a spirit which is above the individuals.

280
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,750
And this is the very French team,
right?

281
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,360
You cannot explain it from the individual.

282
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,540
There is some general idea Durkheim vieux
Carre collective conscience Russo via

283
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:52,780
called it the general veil, right?
The very franchise idea, right?

284
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,850
That there is some consciousness at
both the individual consciousnesses.

285
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,690
This has formulated so
powerful the first time,

286
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,590
um, by uh, uh, um,

287
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Montesquieu and he actually
said a civilization is
progressing the influence of

288
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,100
the natural conditions,

289
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:17,101
the clients and the importance right of
general spirit increases or to put with

290
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:21,100
Durkheim, the collective conscience
becomes more and more important.

291
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:23,560
I'm just foreshadow that
you have a sense right,

292
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,870
that the score three or
the hangs together, right?

293
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:28,750
They are not talking
about separate orders.

294
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:33,370
We are talking about a set of orders
who are talking to each other.

295
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,290
They're beating each other,
right?

296
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,390
That's I think what is so fascinating
about the foundations of modern social

297
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:42,530
food. Um, uh,

298
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,550
that's cannot be said about 20 or 21st
century social theorizing where we are at

299
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:52,060
each other throats and we
ignore each other, right?

300
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,890
It's a more typical, okay. Um,

301
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,730
as I said, you know, he's a methodology
called call activist, right?

302
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,070
And that just explained this to you. A
little riot methodological individualists.

303
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,730
We'll begins in order to develop
our conception of society,

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
you have to start with at the individual
the only reality what you can observe

305
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:18,970
in individual action and
individual consciousness.

306
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,260
Everything else, right? But you
suggest is speculative, right?

307
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,610
This is British individualism
and empiricism, right?

308
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,320
The French emphasizes
there are stuff like law.

309
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,360
This is why the legal system,

310
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:37,770
the law is so important for Montesquieu.

311
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,780
That's why the major book is called like
the spirit of law because the law is

312
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:47,410
not simply as some toto right
of individual consciousness,

313
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,540
it sends over us, right? And we
get into a society and the law,

314
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,980
the legal system already does exist.
If will see Naruc handles the same thing.

315
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,940
This is why the legal system
is so important for him. Okay.

316
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,270
Now let's move into the first team
and talk about the different forms of

317
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:09,664
government.

318
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Now he makes a distinction
between Republican government,

319
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,110
a monarchy, um, and desperate state.

320
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,780
Republican government in his definition
means that either the people,

321
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,630
uh, uh, uh, uh,

322
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,210
rule democracy or a subset of people,
right?

323
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,220
Aristocracy has the silver and
power are the source of law.

324
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,470
Um, as VBL see, he's not all that certain.

325
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:47,660
Whether the people rule is all
that good, right? He refers,

326
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,010
sort of selected aristocracy.
It will be even true for who.

327
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:57,011
So he's much more radical
than he is Manara here and
which one alone governance.

328
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,840
Uh, but by fundamental laws,
the monarchy itself is bind by,

329
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:07,400
by laws. Um, Eh, a desperate state.

330
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,420
Now, there are no fundamental
roles, rather desperate exercise.

331
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:15,000
It is power at its vale,
um,

332
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,400
of Hitler's Germany or Stalin's
Russia or Soviet Union.

333
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,430
Our desk, Patek stays right where
there is no proper rule of law.

334
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,660
Now about a 30 public hell,
as we said,

335
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:34,661
there are two forms of it
is the democratic and then
the Edisto cratic farm in

336
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,590
the democratic. You have a selection
of people to office by lot.

337
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,350
Well, he's not, don't get about elections,

338
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:45,410
but by lot and indeed in Greek democracy,

339
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,270
people were occasionally
selected two major offices,

340
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:55,220
right? In ancient Greek by
law, by lottery in aristocracy.

341
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,260
People are selected by choice,
right?

342
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,500
The best people get into the office that
they have the best skills to perform.

343
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,830
Now he said, well, everyone can vote,

344
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,920
but not everybody's prepared
to serve in the office.

345
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,660
That speaks right for uh, uh, uh, at his,

346
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,370
at his stock class by choice.
But, uh, whatever the republic is,

347
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:23,060
that is a principle.
Legitimacy is based on virtue.

348
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,080
The person who served should be virtuals.
Right?

349
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,460
And if the virtuals ness
of the person is question,

350
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,960
then you know, the legitimacy of
the person is in some trouble,

351
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,210
a verb body. The virtuousness,
remember Bill Clinton,

352
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,970
he ran into some trouble,
you know,

353
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:48,140
because people started to
bastion virtuals ness, right?

354
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,130
In the very narrow sense
of the term. Okay. Anyway,

355
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:54,950
that's the guiding principle.
Then manner.

356
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Now here the prince has a silver and
power is the source of law or to Mazda law

357
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,980
is established. The prince has to
follow that law. That's monarchy.

358
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,190
And the principle here is honor.

359
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,560
The prince has to be honorable,
right? In order to be obeyed.

360
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,521
Again,

361
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:21,521
the busiest of legitimacy is honor and
despotism as we have seen a Duvon of who

362
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,610
governance can do whatever it
wants to do is above the law.

363
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,320
Right?
Uh,

364
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,600
and what is the principle
of despotic rule fair,

365
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,340
right? You obey those in
power because you fear that.

366
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,680
Well,

367
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,430
the next is separation of
powers and the see the,

368
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,320
the three powers
that are,

369
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,590
but I the legislative
power executive power,

370
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,800
and they'd be able to see
the power to judge later on.

371
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,120
Executive power over Danks,

372
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,150
depending on the right of nations
executive power over things,

373
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,980
depending on civil rights.
Um,

374
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,610
he said the first power executive power,

375
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,570
uh, uh, uh,

376
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,780
executive legis legislative
power, uh, in fact, uh,

377
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,980
can be exercised by a
king or a magistrate, uh,

378
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,880
can be exercise by even elected body.
But the second one,

379
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,590
executive power, uh, Vale,
it has to be executed.

380
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,710
He believed the, uh, by, um, uh,

381
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,050
usually by a monarch. Uh,
and that is the last power,

382
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,000
the power of judging a Veatch has
to be separated from boss, uh,

383
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,250
the, um, uh,

384
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,930
legislative and executive
power. Let, let's see the
argument, what he puts forward.

385
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,061
He said,

386
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:06,061
vendor legislative power is United with
the executive power in a single person

387
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,480
that is no liberty. Uh,
because one can fear,

388
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:14,900
right that the same monarch
who mates died, Dido,

389
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,970
Nicole Ross, Bill, execute them
in a tire and Nicole manner.

390
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,540
So therefore you have to separate
legislative and executive powers.

391
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,240
Well, the separation
is not complete, right?

392
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,160
Because it takes time for the
legislative body to pass laws.

393
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,181
And therefore,

394
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:39,181
very often executives even in the United
States operate with executive orders,

395
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,600
right?

396
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,010
These executive orders
kind of substitute right?

397
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,000
For laws or legal regulations,
right?

398
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,640
So the separation,

399
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,840
even in modern society like
the United States is relative.

400
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,520
And in fact,
uh,

401
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,260
many constitutional lawyers
in the United States,

402
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,530
we're concerned you in the
last two administrations
that the executive branch to

403
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,660
often operated by executive orders,
right?

404
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,410
Rather than to ask, uh,
uh, the legislature, right?

405
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,760
To legislate about, uh, uh, doors today.

406
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,790
Um, okay. Uh,

407
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,780
now,
um,

408
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,710
he, then he goes on and
he said, look, uh, uh,

409
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,310
this is not really a question of
that at public versus manner. He,

410
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,220
uh,
he said,

411
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,970
look in in his stamps
in most kings of Europe,

412
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,920
but the government is
quite moderate. Um, uh,

413
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,970
he sat val depends who exercises. Uh, uh,

414
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,470
the first two powers a
bell, uh, leaves, uh, uh,

415
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,670
uh,

416
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,670
a great deal of autonomy for its
subjects and the thallium republics.

417
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,450
They are republics in office time,
18th century.

418
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,930
The powers are United and that is
less liberty actually in this Italian

419
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:25,790
republics. Well, it's
an interesting, uh, um,

420
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,523
buoyant,

421
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,893
uh,

422
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,570
no about the legislative
power. He said, val,

423
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,990
it better to be an elected body,

424
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,370
which exercises the legislative power,
passes the laws,

425
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,410
uh,

426
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,410
and become close to the idea of
universal suffrage in choosing the

427
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,500
representative.

428
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,560
All citizens should have the right to
vote and then comes the qualification

429
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,350
except who city so humble that they are
deemed to have no deal of that all in

430
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:09,490
order to have a veal, you better
the be a property owner. Right.

431
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:13,120
That is a suggestion here
of property qualification.

432
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,400
Mitch was quite dominant in the United
States until the 20th century. Right?

433
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,630
Um, uh, uh, in, uh,

434
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,270
Yep.

435
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,800
But on the other hand,
he elaborates on it.

436
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,320
People should not enter government
except to choose their representatives.

437
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,180
I, because in order to be in the
executive, you'll need skills.

438
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,350
Um,

439
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,350
now you may know who would be the
right person to run the office,

440
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,740
but you may not be able to run the office.
That's the fundamental idea.

441
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,733
Uh,

442
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,010
well it's also important,
right, that these representative
body, the legislature,

443
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,513
uh,

444
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:10,280
should be separated from a actual
action. Now comes the idea, right?

445
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:11,490
The right of minority.

446
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:16,510
This is a novel idea cast
in a very conservative way,

447
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,950
but the way it is cast in a
conservative kind of fuel door,

448
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,490
Edisto cratic manner and
that [inaudible] speaking,

449
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,930
he's formulating a very
important principle,

450
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,210
what we are still struggling with,
right?

451
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,540
How to defend the rights of minorities
against a despotism of the majority just

452
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:40,800
be costs.

453
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:45,801
51% voted one day does not
mean that 49% is wrong,

454
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,060
right?

455
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:52,060
And that the rights of that 49% or
even just 1% in some days has to be

456
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,300
guaranteed. And that's what he's
struggling with. Now here in this context,

457
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:02,850
and we'll put the
citation, uh, on the web,

458
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:05,810
so I don't want to read
this very long citation.

459
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,560
The argument is for the
nobility, it said, well,

460
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:14,870
the nobility has more rights and
therefore they have more rights,

461
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:19,130
more stakes in it. They have
more than one voice. Therefore,

462
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,730
the solution is a two chamber solution,
right?

463
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,020
A chamber for the aristocracy,

464
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,570
upper house and the chamber
popularly elected by everyone,

465
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,920
a lower house. Now, not
in the aristocratic sense,

466
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:37,310
but in some ways representing the defense,
right?

467
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:41,150
Of Small States and agrarian states.

468
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,640
This is by the United States Senate.

469
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,580
Every stage since two senators rather,

470
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,450
irrespective of the size of
the population, right? Uh,

471
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,590
and therefore a though
not in a, um, uh, uh,

472
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,520
sort of few dollars stick way as
Montesquieu demented, but it is,

473
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,130
the whole proposition is very much alive,
right.

474
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,270
In our current political practices.

475
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,170
Uh, okay, that's me.

476
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:15,500
The move on and talk
about the executive power,

477
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,090
the executive power should be stable.

478
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,980
That's why he believes it better
be in the hands of a manner, right?

479
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:28,400
Because the government
needs immediate action.

480
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,820
It cannot leave right to Massey
Congress to debate things all the time.

481
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,090
Uh,

482
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:40,090
the government has to act instantly
and therefore it has to be in one hand.

483
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,740
Um,
well there are all of,

484
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,900
he elaborates a number of
limits of legislative powers.

485
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:53,630
Some of it applies to the United States,
others dawn,

486
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:56,510
but may apply to Western democracies.

487
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,780
It should convene at regular intervals.

488
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,170
And that's quite true for
all democratic states, right?

489
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,730
The legislature is called
very often, um, uh,

490
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,630
and uh, with some regularity. Well,

491
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:16,400
it should not be in session without
interruption. Uh, the US, uh,

492
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,323
uh,
um,

493
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,690
congress is virtually right in
session almost without interruption,

494
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:28,270
but other parliament in continental
Europe or not necesarrily so the reason is

495
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:32,360
that it, they don't want
to make, uh, uh, uh,

496
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,670
membership in the legislature.

497
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,570
The sole source of occupation and income
and that are being switch speaks for

498
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:44,490
this idea. Right now the legislature
is not impermanent that a session.

499
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,790
And then he said, that should not have
the right to convene itself. Well, uh,

500
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,100
the u s congress convenes itself.

501
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:57,330
It does need the car of the executive.
But in England, for instance, right,

502
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:02,331
it is the queen who dissolves
the parliament and cause
the session of the bottle

503
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:07,310
on them doesn't give her much power.
But nevertheless, uh, it, uh, uh, the,

504
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,190
the idea,

505
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,280
the more Montesquieu and idea is present
in a number of Western democracies,

506
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,110
um, now, uh, regular intervals,
that's obvious, right?

507
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:22,110
When it should not be
left to the executive,

508
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:27,111
especially if the executive has the right
to call into session the legislature,

509
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,733
right?

510
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,770
That may mean the executive veal not
call the new laws are needed and they'll

511
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:39,510
become a desk buddy. That's
why it has to be, uh, uh,

512
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,420
uh, called by, um, uh, regular intervals.

513
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,700
Uh, uh, and, uh, it, uh, you know, it

514
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,850
should not be in session without
interruption because he said it would

515
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,870
overburden, uh, the
executive power as well. Uh,

516
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,740
and it cannot convene itself.
He said,

517
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,120
and the arguments are known
because if it would, um, uh,

518
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,180
have the right to decide
whether it dissolves itself,

519
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:13,890
it will never dissolve itself. That's
the fundamental argument here. As I said,

520
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:18,540
in many countries, this is exercise.
She's very now the executive, he said,

521
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,100
I should be able to check
over the legislature. Uh,

522
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,740
um, and uh, in what way? Uh,

523
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,140
because it doesn't run the
legislature, uh, to, um, uh,

524
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,820
paralyzed the action of the
government. Um, and, uh,

525
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,560
the mean they, uh, how, uh, the, uh,

526
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,810
executive exercises checks over the
legislature is the veto right of the

527
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:50,571
executive exactly like it is
done in the u s constitution,

528
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,170
right?
Uh,

529
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,520
the president can veto laws
which are passed by Congress,

530
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,530
has to send back to Congress
and the Congress has to
overrule rather the veto of

531
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:05,810
the president. But there is a
clear light check of the, uh,

532
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,450
executive over the legislature, right? Um,

533
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,870
the executive has the possibility,
uh,

534
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,010
to remind the, uh, uh, the legislature,

535
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:19,770
this may be a bad idea to pass this law.

536
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,400
You better rethink it
before it becomes a law.

537
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,780
There are checks and balances
over the executive branch.

538
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,510
He is quite a conservative here.

539
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,880
And he said the executive power belongs
to the legislative oldest to its

540
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,010
faculty, uh, Alpha,

541
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,670
uh,

542
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,600
vetoing, uh, the executive power. Uh,

543
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,910
uh,
yeah,

544
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,370
it's very important, right? And
Axa, the rising of public funds,

545
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,620
um, uh, uh, uh, uh,

546
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,190
only with the consent of legislature.
This is again,

547
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:04,630
a very important principle,
the ruling all democracies.

548
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,760
And either the budgets have to be
improved, uh, by the legislature. Um,

549
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,400
just see the mass.
Uh,

550
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:15,880
what we have seen in California recently,
right by the,

551
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:20,470
that the legislature was not giving
the budget I have to the governor.

552
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,660
Um, uh, but this is certainly a very
important principle of democracy.

553
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,090
Um, and now, uh,

554
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,120
let me come to the question of environment
and society and the whole idea that,

555
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:37,540
uh,
the physical condition shape,

556
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,050
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

557
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:46,330
social conditions. And let
me give you a couple of, uh,

558
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,780
as I said, quite silly notes. He said,

559
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,200
the spirit and passion are extremely
different than in various climates.

560
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:01,110
Laws should be relative to the
differences in these passions.

561
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,080
And now comes the real silly
var call in cold climate,

562
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,730
the blog is pushed harder
or about the heart.

563
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,240
This produces confidence in
oneself and carriage and better,

564
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,700
much so.
You are more courageous,

565
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,730
more active and smarter if
you live in cold climates.

566
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,120
Um, uh, like in France or in England,

567
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,220
people in hot countries
that they made like old man,

568
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,420
I'm not all that teammate. Okay. Um,

569
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,920
and then interestingly,
you know,

570
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:49,921
to sort of this himself from racism and
that term which did not exist in his,

571
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:55,191
that is that even the children of
Europeans born inside the end is lose the

572
00:40:56,291 --> 00:41:01,190
courage of the European
climate. At least it is, uh,

573
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,120
uh, uh, uh, uh, not, uh,

574
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,640
based on a racial argument,

575
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,940
but indeed made ms on a extremely
naive ecological argument.

576
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:17,260
But let me emphasize that is
fantastic insight here. Right? Um,

577
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,660
for another 200 years,

578
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,080
nobody took the environment
seriously. I mean, the,

579
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,940
the exception of Emil Durkheim,

580
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,160
they will talk about this when we talk
about their time coming from Montesquieu

581
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:34,400
for Durkheim want a secure and Russo
over the goths, right? That's that,

582
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,550
uh,
modern theory of society came from.

583
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,210
It was Montesquieu and
it'll solve a boss of them.

584
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,970
So, uh, and now about the general spirit,

585
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,450
he said many things,
government climate,

586
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,090
that ledger laws,
the maxims of government,

587
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:57,560
more sun manners.

588
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:03,690
That is this all s to gather a general
spirit which is formed as a result,

589
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,510
right? I hope you get the idea
of the general spirit, right?

590
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,660
That that is a set of ideas, which is, uh,

591
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:16,670
both our individual consciousness
in child. Who would we learn,

592
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,640
right?
We internalize those ideas.

593
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,890
It is not coming from the individual.

594
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,390
It is entered into the individual
in the process of education, right?

595
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,740
And therefore,

596
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:32,741
the argument was Montesquieu makes
repeated by Rousseau and do your crime.

597
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,200
That's the 10 have and should have an
idea off society or collective conscious

598
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:43,700
neck standing over and
above the individual.

599
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,480
This is a big debate, right?
Which informs most of the,

600
00:42:48,481 --> 00:42:53,120
that Bates in social
sciences today in economics,

601
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:57,980
in political science and
sociology and anthropology,

602
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:03,050
you have some scholars who the
God themselves in economics,

603
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:08,051
few methodological collectivists and
doors will call themselves methodological

604
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:13,290
individualist, rational
choice people. Right.

605
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,530
Are the methodological individualists,

606
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,820
the cultural analysts are
methodological Glock activist, right?

607
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:24,740
We have that distinction virtually
everywhere, as I said, least in economics.

608
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,180
But even in economics,
you have the institutionalists,

609
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,060
right, who are on the edge, right?

610
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:37,061
Or between being methodological or
collectivist or being methodological

611
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,040
individualists. Uh, and then, uh, uh,

612
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:47,060
well, he says as
civilization on force, uh,

613
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,300
the importance of the general spirit is
increasing and impact of climate is a,

614
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,800
uh, a declining, not that
climate doesn't matter,

615
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,640
but overtime it's important declines.
And the,

616
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,480
the importance of general
spirit increases. Well,

617
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,790
that's about it for today.
Thank you.
