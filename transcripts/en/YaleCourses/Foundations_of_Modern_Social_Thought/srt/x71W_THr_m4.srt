1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,880
Uh,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,500
I would like very briefly to come
back to Weber's theory of domination.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,730
I deleted it from the questions,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,270
but I promise IVL get this back in
one way or another for the next test.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,740
So probably the last thing you
want to think about now is a test.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,840
Uh, but let me still talking
about the theory of domination.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,630
I think there's is a
very important to Uri,

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,890
extremely influential
and extremely insightful.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,660
So,
uh,

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,720
led me just very briefly sum up where we
left it last time and then I move into

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,020
Weber's theory of traditional authority.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,560
And the last time we were talking about
the Crucial Distinction Vapor makes

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,700
beats being mocked and
hair shaft a martyrdom is
translated in English as power.

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,000
That is no question about this,
uh,

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,230
the translation of hair shaft
to various, uh, if there's, uh,

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,390
translated either as authority or
if this translated as domination.

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,300
Um, and I think most
translation, uh, are good.

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,480
Um, I think, uh, people, um,

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,570
or whom I feel closer in my own vapor
reading a translated more like domination

20
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:33,990
rather than or authority. Um, uh,

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,500
and in fact, uh, I think,
uh, just to emphasize you,

22
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:42,350
the importance of the, uh,
translation or difference,

23
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,130
um, in the notion of hair
chuffed, the first four letters,

24
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,420
Hara means the Lord.

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,940
So I think the notion
of hair shaft, uh, uh,

26
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,941
has a very strong implications of
asymmetrical power relationships.

27
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:00,650
Uh,
uh,

28
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,190
but I think domination
captures better than authority.

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Those who translated Weber's
notion of how shaft as authority,

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,820
like a dark world,

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,460
Parsons wanted to emphasize that vapor,
um,

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,450
uh, uh, uh, looks at hair shaft, uh,

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,780
as something which is authoritarian
ride for somebody x out of authority,

34
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,840
right? Um, uh, this is, uh, uh,

35
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,460
not a false translation but
misses an important point.

36
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,910
And namely Weber's Interdis Indivi
how power is being exercised,

37
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,220
uh,

38
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,220
invested in a VA misses a Max
Weber's rules in the Frederick Nicha,

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,120
uh, or blah, blah, blah.
Eva and I made there.

40
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,180
So in the hops, uh, right,

41
00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:02,181
human history is all about the
history of struggle for power.

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,380
That's in mighty think,
Weber's fundamental idea,

43
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,520
bow RV,
that important modification.

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,020
And I gave you the
citation a last lecture,

45
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,030
but let me come back to this.

46
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,750
Power means the likelihood
that people will obey order,

47
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,660
uh,

48
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,660
even against resistance and domination
means the likelihood that people,

49
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,080
veal actually follow orders,

50
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,820
these are being coerced to do so.
Uh,

51
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,080
so the notion of domination or hair shaft
does imply a degree of voluntary ness

52
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,790
and minimum level of belief that in fact,

53
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:56,791
those who issue order do have the
right to do so or at is at least it is

54
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:04,291
reasonable that they issue orders and I
follow the orders or to come up with an

55
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,911
even more minimal definition of how shaft
that I cannot see any real alternative

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,650
under the present circumstances,

57
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,840
but to obey the orders to the
volume who issues these orders.

58
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,420
Right. Uh, so, uh,

59
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,010
and this has everything to do
with the idea of legitimacy.

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,280
And I put a, uh, at last lecture
at his little equation, right?

61
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,520
Um, uh, on one of the slides, uh,

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,600
that power plus legitimation
adds up to domination,

63
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,830
uh, or, or authority.
So what is legitimation?

64
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,390
Viber said power is
really an extreme case.

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,760
That very little, very, it
happens very rarely, uh,

66
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:05,761
that the von who exercises or authority
exercise is simply by exerting power

67
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,260
coursing people to obey those
who are in position of authority,

68
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,410
uh, or try to legitimize rate, uh,

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,460
that autonomy or authority and tried to
come up with reasons by people subjected

70
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:29,890
to these authority should
obey that authority.

71
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,420
It's again, very niche
Yan, the idea, right,

72
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,720
that those who are exercising
power tries to internalize your,

73
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:46,181
a subjugation to power in one way
or another and try to create in you,

74
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,530
in you and mortality,
right?

75
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,840
A set of principles by
which you would say, well,

76
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,740
uh,
this may be the right thing for me to do.

77
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,680
Or as I said,
the minimum that finish.

78
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:08,150
And even if you don't particularly
like obeying order, you say,

79
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,650
what else can I do?

80
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,000
The alternative if I don't
obey order would be verse, uh,

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,140
or about the person
who issues or totality.

82
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,970
You may not lie the person who issues
authority, but you've, you'll say,

83
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,030
but the alternative is verse,
right?

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,870
So you can pick a course.

85
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,900
You may not lie the lecturer or that
March or the way how it creates,

86
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,410
well I've done other of course is you
did shop for and they've hurt even worse.

87
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,870
So you will be the least verse course,
right?

88
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,230
You pick the lecturer who seems to be
the least boring and too seems to be the

89
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:55,220
most reasonable grading you or assignment,
right?

90
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,220
That does mean that you are all that
thrilled to be at lectures and to do

91
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,970
assignments,

92
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,270
but you have to do it and under the
circumstances you go for the last email,

93
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,523
right?

94
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,750
That's I think the kind of most extreme
interpretation of Weber's idea of

95
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:20,330
legitimacy. But we were also,
I pointed this word out to you.

96
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,640
They were sad that all legitimacy
contains an element of a myth.

97
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,630
It doesn't mean that the person who
tries to justify its accorded the is

98
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,000
studying the troops,
whether it is through.

99
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,390
So naturals is almost besides the point,

100
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,900
the most important issue is that it
creates a methodology about the reason why

101
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,490
you have to obey authority.

102
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,450
So what I would cry to underline
already in last lecture,

103
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,780
that Weber's notion of legitimacy
is so much more sophisticated,

104
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,760
so less liberal and so much more me chair.

105
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,980
Then the idea of the normally hear,

106
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,200
then you hear the word legitimize
Shan by legit dimension.

107
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,040
We see something very good,
right?

108
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,300
A power is legitimated because it was
somebody who was elected in fair and three

109
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,460
elections, uh, to an office.

110
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,420
And we believe that this
person will do a great job.

111
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,010
Having been elected,

112
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,670
well have a verb would be more likely
to think something like our shy,

113
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,510
uh, uh, under the circumstances barberry,

114
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,800
there is no alternative to Afghanistan.

115
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,970
But to have this guy as the
president though it's very doubt for,

116
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,350
you know,
what all those claims and bowed,

117
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:56,220
the legitimacy of the
system are being made,

118
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,420
the APP 50 march and the
ecology created around it. Uh,

119
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,420
but, uh, the advice,

120
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,660
the alternative is cow horse and even
these guys probably better than chaos,

121
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,450
which would happen. Other vies
and I, this is, uh, you know,

122
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,540
my dark leading our next neighbor.

123
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,120
Now,
as you can see,

124
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,270
of course the difference
from Marx is fundamental. Uh,

125
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,500
marks did see human history as
unfolding of more soft production.

126
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,740
It was all struggle around
ownership and means of production,

127
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,190
clash of economic interest for vapor.

128
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:43,250
It is not economic interest,

129
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,310
which drives human history
but struggle for power.

130
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,520
And he can describe different
systems of authority over time,

131
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,590
but it is all described,
uh,

132
00:09:55,591 --> 00:10:00,030
on the quality and the
nature of those mythologies,

133
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,890
those in position of power
come up to legitimate,

134
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,790
but they are trying to
do to you. Right? Uh,

135
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,910
so that is one fundamental difference
between a marks and the vapor.

136
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:19,500
That is an other fundamental
difference. And uh, you'll be,

137
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:20,980
you'll have to, uh, uh,

138
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,540
bear this very much in mind as these
lecture on traditional authority on the

139
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:27,750
floors.

140
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,230
Though Weber's develops these
different types of a domination,

141
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,950
uh, primarily to describe
historic gotta change,

142
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,240
grander societies,
traditional authority,

143
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,600
charismatic, all loss authority, legal,

144
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:50,601
rational authority kind of describes
the evolution of humankind and has a

145
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:56,781
similar kind of flavor
than marks a subsect van,

146
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:02,100
small soft production,
but vapor does more than that.

147
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,430
These three types of authority do describe
or kind of organizations or social

148
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:11,580
units,
uh,

149
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,630
and today the Ken Clark about legal,

150
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,980
rational authority,

151
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,220
traditional authority or Charismatic
Authority in Contemporary Society,

152
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,220
though he will call liberal market
capitalism as the purest Stipe.

153
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,150
And what pure type is,
I've,

154
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:36,151
you're talking about this in a minute
of legal rational authority give you say

155
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:39,030
that even in Contemporary Society,

156
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,220
the have organizations which are
based on traditional authority.

157
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,300
The most obvious example
of traditional authority,

158
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,640
and bear it in mind when we will
be talking about this, uh, uh,

159
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,730
today is the family you'll live in had
the family is primarily bound together by

160
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,510
tradition, but the very
institution where you are in now,

161
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:09,511
universities do have a flavor
of traditional authority,

162
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,500
right?
Uh,

163
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,830
it has a kind of ethos with at least three
teachers believe that you have to pay

164
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,100
some respect to the teachers.

165
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,930
And we have core kind of
traditional rituals, right?

166
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,090
Which makes, uh, uh, the making
the functioning of our university.

167
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,440
Uh, in a way a traditional
organization, right?

168
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,830
There is the graduation ceremony when you,

169
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:43,690
there will be varying all these
funny, you know, um, uh, uh,

170
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,740
um,
uh,

171
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,900
academy dress and then you
are awarded at the Gri,

172
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:54,530
which is happening almost like a,
of wording.

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,540
Um, uh, Lord chip by the cream, right?

174
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,930
The president of you'll say by
the power invested in me. Uh,

175
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,850
and then by this power,

176
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,870
the o Cornforth do you ride the degree
of Bachelor of arts or a Bachelor of

177
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,320
Sciences? Right? Uh,

178
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:19,321
this is very much like confirming the
title of Lord ship a on somebody by the

179
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:26,350
queen of England,
by the powers vested in her.

180
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,210
Uh, okay. So therefore vapor
is more flexible. It marks,

181
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,480
it doesn't simply describe society,

182
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,690
but in every society it does describe
a certain organizations and in

183
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:45,700
contemporary society,
the often talk about charisma.

184
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,450
And we have been talking a lot about
Carrie's mine the last 18 months.

185
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,930
And we were talking about, uh, um, um, um,

186
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,000
barrack Obama and,

187
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:02,290
but Aqua Obama being gift
charismatic leader, right?

188
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,680
So the charisma is also something
what we very often in a walk today,

189
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,230
um, describing the
nature of authority, uh,

190
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,750
somebody, um, is, uh, exercising.

191
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,100
Okay. So that's again, you know,

192
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:26,101
just the backdrop to the notion
of authority and I hope it feel,

193
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:31,080
help you to locate it,
uh, more, uh, in, uh, uh,

194
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,330
the, uh, uh, literature.

195
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Now as I mentioned also in last lecture
that are c major types of authority,

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,030
traditional authority
in which basically the,

197
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,190
you have a personal master in charge
and dispersing our master somehow pos to

198
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,370
old age or,
uh,

199
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,800
sank a sacred rules,
uh,

200
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,760
to ask you to obey his or her commands.

201
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,110
Mostly yes.

202
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,410
But occasionally her commands after all
that is a green in England that were

203
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:17,480
queens in England for a long time.
Okay.

204
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,390
So that's the additional authority.
Uh,

205
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,400
the other one is charismatic
authority where the person in charge,

206
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,590
um, uh, cause for obedience
on the grounds, uh, uh,

207
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,131
that,
uh,

208
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:35,660
that person is believed
to have some supernatural,

209
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,720
extra ordinary powers. Uh, um, um, uh,

210
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,040
uh,
and fine,

211
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:47,041
not illegal rational authority or
authority in which the person who is a,

212
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,100
um,
uh,

213
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,100
issuing command is also under the same
law as people who are obeying orders and

214
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:02,150
in legal, rational authority, you
do not have a personal master.

215
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,280
You do not obey a person,
but you obeyed the rules and laws.

216
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,580
That's why waiver costs legal
rational authority as a shorthand.

217
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,280
I think it would be more obvious to
call it liberal or authority or liberal

218
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,520
system of authority.
I just want to make one more vote.

219
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,760
One very brief comment.
Um,

220
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,130
as we proceed to traditional authority,

221
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,460
namely that the three types of
authorities are not exactly have the same,

222
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,620
uh, ontological status, uh,

223
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,440
vapor basically have two
major types of authority,

224
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,640
traditional authority or
legal rational authority.

225
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,180
Charismatic Authority does not have
the longevity of our traditional or

226
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,680
authority or legal.

227
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:59,681
Rational Authority has charismatic
authority as we are talking about this.

228
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:03,350
A great deal is a revolutionary force.

229
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,710
Charismatic Authority usually occurs
for the relatively brief period of time.

230
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,010
Typically the charismatic leader is a
one person and it is very lucky if that

231
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:22,301
one person can maintain the charisma for
all the time this person is in charge.

232
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,820
I mean,
uh,

233
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,260
just after nine months of the
election of President Obama,

234
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,960
we see a level,
right,

235
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,310
a withering of his sort of
strong charismatic Aptia.

236
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,050
So in order to maintain your charisma
for while you are in office and a

237
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:47,051
specialty for the lifetime
is very difficult and even
more difficult to transfer

238
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,970
his mom to another leader.

239
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,490
So charismatic authority is
really a change basically,

240
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
as I will argue later on from one form
of traditional authority to another form

241
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:04,560
of traditional authority
in the Maxim Baber.

242
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,590
So therefore are the two big types,

243
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,340
traditional authority and
legal rational authority.

244
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,230
And what Mark's God,

245
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,970
the transition from fewer dollars
into capitalism or what the understand

246
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:22,971
modernization is really nothing else but
the movement from traditional authority

247
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,580
to legal rational authority.
Okay. Uh, now let me go,

248
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:29,290
go,
uh,

249
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,290
into today's topic and dark
about additional authority.

250
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,480
And uh,
at first about pure type by Vr.

251
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:44,080
Describe his definition of the pure type,
but it needs a,

252
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,880
a fool to north about
pure type is all about

253
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,100
uh, uh, as I already pointed out,

254
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Max Weber's was a Kantian.
Uh,

255
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:01,401
that meant that Max Faber did not
believe that a human knowledge,

256
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:06,780
which completely describes
the reality is possible,

257
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,703
right?

258
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,450
The reality is so infinity
the rich that the concepts,

259
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,460
what we develop is only mental
images of these objects.

260
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,780
What we are developing concept about,
right?

261
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:26,250
It can be never be fully
describing the subject.

262
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,500
So these mental objects,

263
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,501
what we have in our mind about the
object from which we tried to develop

264
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:39,471
knowledge is what he calls a ideal types
or they are abstractions from the bird,

265
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,400
not a precise description
of diverse world.

266
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,270
So therefore what he said the best,

267
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:53,271
what we can aim at to develop
ideotype pure types and or realities.

268
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,820
We all of us,

269
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,900
some are different from the idea of
type what is in our mind and as human

270
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:05,610
knowledge is progressing and
that's what makes actually be,

271
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:09,870
but at difficult reading is that the,
in the process of knowledge,

272
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,070
we develop an ideal type at conceptions.
About the world.

273
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,370
And then we go back to reality and we
see that he does not exhaust the reality

274
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:24,210
as it is the reality has
other important features.

275
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,370
The miss in the first instance.

276
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,780
So we go back and via Redo
our ideal type and rich,

277
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,840
the idea of type to fit to
create a better fit with reality,

278
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,240
right?
That's the fundamental idea.

279
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,390
And that's what makes Weber's so difficult
to read because he often comes up

280
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,000
bitten idea of type a
pure and he said yes,

281
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,800
but when I'm reading get historical
reality, it does not quite fit.

282
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,650
So therefore I redo a little my
idea of type and and rich it.

283
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,860
So you can easily get lost
when you are reading vapor.

284
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,790
And this is not accidental,
right? This is the methodology,

285
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,290
how he proceeds.

286
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,350
You does not believe that we can
attain absolute knowledge. Uh, what,

287
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,430
what,
what,

288
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,330
what he believes that we have to
strive to be able to describe.

289
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,570
But we want to describe as precisely
as we just skim tech as we can.

290
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:27,730
So this is the idea of pure types.

291
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,140
So what is the pure type of legal,

292
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:36,130
rational authority or for
traditional authority?

293
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,200
And first of all, if you have to talk
about the basis of legitimacy, uh,

294
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,710
just very briefly,
something also about the veterans,

295
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,120
how Assaf is being recruited as such.

296
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,580
And we come with a very clear
and simple that definition, uh,

297
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,730
in traditional toricity legitimacy is
claimed for and believed in by virtue of

298
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:07,600
the sanctity of age old rules.

299
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,110
So the person who rules makes a claim
that this has been all of us this way,

300
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,560
and that is some sacred mess in,
in effect,

301
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,600
obeying the person who by age or
tradition was assigned to a position of

302
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:31,390
authority. And again, let me
just go back to the family.

303
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,360
This is a classical example.
The parents, uh, do, uh,

304
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,760
uh,

305
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,760
have some sacred law rights to issue
some commands and the do obey barons

306
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,920
because it has all of us this way.
Children,

307
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,540
all of us had to obey barons to
what extent they have to obey.

308
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,920
And what parents can do to children
may vary a little over time,

309
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,900
but the parents are in charge
and they are them. Uh, uh, um,

310
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,980
uh, in fact do have Darius to
issue certain kinds of commands,

311
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,170
is widely accepted,

312
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,210
but avert believed in is
also very important, right?

313
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,450
So the parents do not have to force you
to obey you beginning to believe that if

314
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,970
it is indeed right thing
that the parents obey order.

315
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,840
It happens also if you,
particularly in this life,

316
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,810
but they try to order and
occasionally you may not like, uh,

317
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,030
uh, one of your parents
or both of your parents,

318
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,460
never the less you think,

319
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:44,461
some degree of obedience is necessary
unless you really break the law and you

320
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,530
ran away, right? Um, but
that is, uh, uh, certainly,

321
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,230
um,

322
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,230
and extreme case as it is an extreme
case that parents will force children.

323
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,050
You will squashing, uh, of
children to obey that rule.

324
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,940
Well, occasionally they use
some degree of coercion.

325
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,520
It's also very important
in, in Viber. You know,

326
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,760
that question is all of us present in
every type of a domination neuro thing.

327
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,850
That legal rational authority does not
have coercion in the United States.

328
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,100
Over 3 million people are in jail,
right?

329
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,210
They are being coerced in
the United States. People,

330
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:33,740
occasionally I killed by the
government, right? The are executed.

331
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,040
So there is coercion,
even in legal,

332
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:41,420
rational authority in the most
liberal democratic society.

333
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,630
If you break the laws,
you have your B course,

334
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,400
and if you are not breaking the law,
that is always the promise of coercion,

335
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,070
right? It said, well, under certain
circumstances you'll hear because,

336
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,643
um,

337
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:01,030
now the second important point is right
that the master who obeys the order is

338
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:06,110
designated by traditional rule,
right?

339
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,950
And the are obeyed because
of that I convert that, um,

340
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
well I to do day is translated
into English as traditional status.

341
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,040
Uh,
it's not a very good translation.

342
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,480
I can build the really means that
they are believed to have virtuous by

343
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:28,220
themselves, that they have a virtue
of what they themselves carry out.

344
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,490
So there is honor and I think the
term honor is extremely important,

345
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:38,870
right? Um, uh, uh, for
understanding traditional authority,

346
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,410
uh,

347
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,410
the traditional master is always
assumed to be an honorable person,

348
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,160
right?
And if that person becomes non honorable,

349
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,240
it is likely that it will
use each authority. Again,

350
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:55,740
think about balance, right? Um,

351
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,620
the parents are supposed to be honorable
and if they are not honorable any

352
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:04,360
longer, that is a crisis
in the family. Um,

353
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,720
have you seen Arthur Miller's play?
The Das have the sales man?

354
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,200
This is exactly what happens in the depths
of the salesman when he song catches

355
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:19,340
the father whom he admired
so much is sketching him, uh,

356
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:23,900
that, uh, uh, another woman,
then his mother, right.

357
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,260
Then suddenly the father loses his
honor is not honorable any longer.

358
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:35,240
Right? And that creates a
lifelong crisis for the child.

359
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,920
So, um, uh,

360
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,980
I think honor is very important to
understand traditional authority and uh,

361
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,600
it is based, a traditional rule
is based on personal loyalty.

362
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,760
You personally feel that you
have to be loyal to this person.

363
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,421
Again,

364
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:59,421
all of these issues do apply to a
substantial degree in institutions like a

365
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,980
university. Right? Uh, uh, it,

366
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,180
there's also the kind
of assumed, right? Uh,

367
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,200
that professors should act in an
honorable way and if they don't,

368
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:19,050
uh,
they are cold or being not honorable,

369
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,030
they are VOB losing their,
uh, uh, a legitimacy.

370
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,510
And that is a great deal
of personal loyalty. Uh,

371
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:32,040
in university situations there are,
particularly in graduate school,

372
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,180
the relationship,

373
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:38,181
the mentor and the phd student is a highly
personalized relationship off neutral

374
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:42,300
loyalties. Uh, right. Uh, um,

375
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,450
there is so much a mentor you'll be
able to take that a PhD student in the

376
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:53,061
dissertation will be true critical of
the professor who is supervising the

377
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:54,450
dissertation.

378
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,720
It accepts some degree of loyalty right
from the student and the student would

379
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:05,061
be very disappointed and if he turns out
that the mentor is writing bad letters

380
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:08,880
for him, right? There is
an expectation, right,

381
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,120
of mutual loyalty in every
type of traditional authority.

382
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,050
Uh,
and what is therefore important.

383
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:24,051
That is also a personal element whom you
obey is a kind of a person or master,

384
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,260
not simply a supervisor,
not a boss,

385
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,380
but something of a person
or most of a master,

386
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,840
an honorable person to whom
you are linked. The two, uh,

387
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,590
by uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, loyalty.

388
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,380
Well, how do you recruit
staff under this, uh, uh,

389
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,480
a system that are really
two ways to do it.

390
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,400
That is a so called battery
morning or recruitment, um, uh,

391
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,880
namely that people are
selected into position, uh,

392
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,670
because the are related to the
chief, uh, uh, by tradition,

393
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,810
uh, because they are known
to the chief. Um, uh,

394
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:11,550
this happens still green deal in
various organizations even today.

395
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,500
Um, especially university
organizations do exercise, uh,

396
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:20,160
substantial, uh, patrimonial
system of recruitment,

397
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,340
but there are extra petrie morning or
vase when persons are judged to be loyal

398
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,870
by the master.

399
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,170
And I pointed to the office because
all of their expected loyalty or such.

400
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,520
Again, I can give you the example
of the universities that are,

401
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:43,390
a lot of recruitment is happening through
battery morning. Our recruitment, uh,

402
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:46,300
you are well in the u s universities,

403
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:51,220
you are not supposed to recruit your
own students in Europe. They do, uh,

404
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,740
uh,
in the U s few universities.

405
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:58,050
Do you recruit the students of your body,
so your,

406
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,100
your friends or your colleagues,
right.

407
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,820
It's a lot of battery morning
autism going on in university, uh,

408
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:07,390
recruitment and in fee.
In fact,

409
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:11,590
loyalty is very important when it comes
particularly to the appointment of

410
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:15,360
administrators in the university system.
Uh,

411
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:22,110
now that odd I let me move on and
let's have the broader historical view.

412
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,970
There are various historical variations.

413
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:29,690
So after additional authority,
uh,

414
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,820
VBA is very messy in terms of terminology.

415
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,150
I was trying to make as
much sense as I could.

416
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,050
I think that our two major
forms of traditional authority,

417
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,320
one is Scott Patriarchaly Zuma and
the other one is Scott Beci morning.

418
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:47,530
I'll domination.

419
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,160
The big difference between patriarchal
systems that it does not staff,

420
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,730
um, uh, that uh,

421
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,790
what is being the authorities exercise
directly by the master and does not need

422
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:04,460
a staff in order to exercise,
eat authority.

423
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,900
Patrimonial domination on the
other hand does have a staff,

424
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:13,850
it is a larger scale society
on a larger scale organization,

425
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,960
better staff view or carry out
the commands of the master.

426
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,290
This is the distinction between masters
staff and the people who obey is

427
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,110
extremely important for Max Ray.
But,

428
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,120
and try to get deep down in your
brain these comment because you cannot

429
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:36,230
understand the vaporium visa. This,
as I pointed out, the neighbor said,

430
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:41,231
that is of us a degree of belief
or faith involved in legitimacy.

431
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,080
But what kind of fate
depends a great deal.

432
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Whether the fate is by the staff in the
master or by the people in the master

433
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,760
they burst. Fundamental idea is
that the system is legitimate.

434
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:01,040
As long as the staff has a
positive belief in the master.

435
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,440
I had the masses.

436
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,430
The people you shortly do not have
a positive belief. They don't.

437
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:10,100
You'll surely love the person who rules.

438
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:13,470
Then they just accept
it as the lesser evo,

439
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,690
but the staff has to have a
positive belief in the master.

440
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,150
Then do to come at revolution comes
then the staff is losing faith in the

441
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:27,200
master,
then the Shah of Iran a fail.

442
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,710
Then the second unity services in
Iran begin to lose faith in the shock.

443
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,570
The people of Iran, he was short. He
did not lie there shot all that much.

444
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,830
They just could not think of an
alternative should they accepted it,

445
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:48,310
but the regime fell when the
security services lost faith in them.

446
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,500
The same can go for the fall of communism,

447
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,890
communism fell of and the Communist
Party staff and the specialty.

448
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:01,670
The secret services begin
to lose faith in the system.

449
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,580
Not that most people who
lived under communism,

450
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,350
all that bloody communists,
right bath,

451
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,090
bow the staff Os than the staff turned
out to be again coming on his best when

452
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:17,080
communism fell,
they'll be three.

453
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,240
Patriarchal is my view and
make to this distinction here.

454
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:25,241
Primary Patriarchal is man get on top
crecy and then about pitch and morning of

455
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:30,591
domination about pure patrimonial Islam
that the staff is purely a personal

456
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,880
instrument in the master.
And finally,

457
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,490
SD type of domination.
It wasn't,

458
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,370
we normally call few [inaudible] event,

459
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,400
the administrative staff and appropriate
certain powers from the master.

460
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,880
Uh,
and now what I do or you to show,

461
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:54,881
I think what Weber's theory of
history is how these different types,

462
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,950
uh,
for systems evolve.

463
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,750
He said the history begins
with B three or charisma. So,

464
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,770
but relatively small societies,
for instance, kinship networks,

465
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,040
they're the elders or the fatter can
rule the society and does not need

466
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,920
policemen. Jailers, you know, judges,

467
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,440
administrators, stack school
actors in order to run the SAF,

468
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,280
it does indirectly,
uh,

469
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:29,270
then it moves to a primary Patri
morning. Al Islam, they're,

470
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,230
the society becomes
larger. Uh, there is staff,

471
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,260
but the staff is individually selected
by the master and the the completely

472
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,910
depend by their master.

473
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:46,340
Their most extreme example of this is
as I view a dark about this in a minute,

474
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,480
salt on Islam and that the salt and can
actually get credit and we'll typically

475
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:56,501
get shreds of the staffer at Veale and
very frequently then it is moving to

476
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,910
feudal type of nomination that the staff
appropriate certain powers from the

477
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:08,530
master appropriates those
powers because uh, um,

478
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,600
for instance it has lent holding what
is given to a noble family not only for

479
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:19,220
life but also for the laminate family,
for the life of the family. Right.

480
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,740
The feudal property has been inherited
and then the staff appropriate certain

481
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:30,290
powers, uh, from, uh, the
master will act as a master,

482
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,740
for instance, even serve
justice. And finally,

483
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,470
legal rational authority. Uh, there,

484
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,320
the of coercion is the
monopoly of the stage.

485
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,040
No individual has the right to exercise
scores if power except the state.

486
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,790
Well, this is not quite true.
Bet. Dance, for instance,

487
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:55,590
still I have summarized,
we ha we feel uncomfortable about this,

488
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,190
but parents do have summarize
to exercise coercion,

489
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,730
but generally you cannot
exercise any coercion,

490
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,560
only the state can.

491
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:10,070
So as you can see in a way the history
of humankind is an evolution of the means

492
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:14,550
of coercion by four marks.

493
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:19,551
The question was the evolution of the
means of production for the bird history

494
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,810
live in by the evolution of the
means of administration and coercion.

495
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:26,761
Again,

496
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:31,761
a very niche area and idea and that
dark read of the history that history

497
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,380
actually is getting worse because
those who will have more and more

498
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:42,381
sophisticated means to suppress
a larger number of people.

499
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,040
And what makes it even worse?
They internalize you,

500
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:50,740
internalize your own
submission internally.

501
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,230
You believe that this is the right
thing, that you are not free, right?

502
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,273
That's again,

503
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,430
I think the [inaudible] view of history
in my reading now about patriarchal

504
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:07,680
asthma is the most elementary
form. As I said. Um, uh,

505
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,690
um, when, uh,

506
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,180
we believe rider that is one
master without the staff, uh,

507
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,300
who has, uh, the right
to exercise or there's a,

508
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:22,620
because that it is no
staffer, uh, it is, uh, uh,

509
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,620
assume that the members of the group,
which is under patriarchy,

510
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:32,280
charisma, for instance, a kinship
networks, um, uh, has a, uh,

511
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,320
substantial, uh, feeling, uh,

512
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,400
that they actually should obey
these master of Aber caused them.

513
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:45,570
They are there no set. They are
comrades. There is a camaraderie, right?

514
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,220
This is a family, right? The family
has some degree of pharmacists.

515
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,950
They are not, uh, uh,

516
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,520
he said [inaudible] they are
not subject to authority,

517
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,170
but they are comrades, right? They
are members of our community. Um,

518
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,100
uh,
but I'm very patriotic.

519
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:09,060
Holism means when there
is a, uh, uh, typically,

520
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:14,040
uh, father, uh, kind of rule,

521
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,510
uh,
the father rules,

522
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:20,511
typically it's that there may have
been maternal authority as well.

523
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,420
Uh,

524
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,420
the historical record is a bit unclear
whether there were matriarchal societies,

525
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,100
uh,
we can assume the reverse.

526
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:32,370
So then they have their patriarch
or matriarch has societies.

527
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,300
It was a mater who ruled the
family or the WHO ruled the family.

528
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,360
And uh, uh, uh, the relationships,

529
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:45,361
we are not necessarily based on blood
relationship because actually it's what I,

530
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:50,561
very long time we did not know
that the sexual act may have,

531
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,790
uh, or that Mush duvet
procreation. It, uh, recent,

532
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,820
a reasonably recent discovery of human
scientific knowledge that this happened.

533
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,890
And therefore in very early societies
it was not known at that there is blood

534
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:10,400
relationship between the father
and the children. Um, uh,

535
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,560
even then it did hold, uh, uh,

536
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,340
well once up cases of course slavery,
I leave it out,

537
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:21,100
but let me talk about
getting get on ocracy.

538
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,870
There are some systems
in which the elders rule,

539
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,230
the older person has the authority.
Um,

540
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,080
uh,

541
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,920
Valerie get on docker oracy is against
something which is not on her door for a

542
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:40,120
modern societies as well.
Now let me move on to battery morning.

543
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,030
I'll domination.

544
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,240
Um, yeah. Um, and uh, uh,

545
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,360
uh, it does emerge. Typical, yeah,

546
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,840
merge fan and administrative
staff is being created.

547
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:53,460
This is a larger societies.

548
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,850
You need armies on policemen
than tech school actors.

549
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,730
In order to operate,

550
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,970
and the members who are subordinated to
your authority are treated as subjects.

551
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,970
Uh, I mean, I'm also her
majesty's subject. Uh,

552
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,660
you know, when I got to run, so
Australian citizenship and then, uh,

553
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,790
um, uh, you know, the Korean is
the other Korean of Australia,

554
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,350
so I'm her majesty's subject,
not simply an Australian citizen.

555
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,370
Right? Uh, then there is
a person with whom I'm,

556
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,420
the authority is relied on in some
days in England and in Australia.

557
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,310
It's the figure of the queen who
does that, right? Uh, uh, well,

558
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:42,990
uh, I don't want to deal with this
because I'm running out of time, right?

559
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,250
Uh, initially, uh, three
are called domination,

560
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,960
but patrimonial domination. It was
really just a large household and the,

561
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:53,880
in fact, uh, but the, the, you know,

562
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,970
ruler the king or unburned did he event
from one village to the next and be the

563
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:04,560
staff and was fat for life
in a household and moved on.

564
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,060
But then of course, uh, it became
more complex. Uh, and then,

565
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,590
uh,
had to create a state.

566
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I had to create a state in which a
moves beyond the oil costs and taxes are

567
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:20,310
being collected.

568
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,470
Um, um, um, and, uh, uh, uh, uh,

569
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,573
uh,
uh,

570
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,230
it, uh, it's surrounding
[inaudible] be like kind of, uh,

571
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,010
a bureaucracy, um, now, uh,

572
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,860
in a pure type of battery morning,
all domination, right? The, uh,

573
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,590
the, uh, staff are purely, uh,

574
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,250
instruments in the hands of the
master and life. I'm mentioned.

575
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:53,500
Salt on Islam is bad.
That is virtually on the restaurant.

576
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,060
The power for the ruler to replace,
uh,

577
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:03,350
uh, uh, duals under each
authority as it pleases,

578
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,840
but then, uh, uh, uh,

579
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,960
evolves in history and
more complex system, um,

580
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,360
SD type of domination or a few dollars,
ma.

581
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:18,740
And it is a system in
which, uh, um, uh, uh,

582
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,330
um, uh, cost it to SD type of domination,

583
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,690
uh, uh, in which, uh, uh, uh,

584
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,190
the staff has certain degree of stability.

585
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,350
Um, uh, uh, uh, now how
much stability, uh, it has,

586
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:39,590
uh, um, uh, if you're depend, uh, uh,

587
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:44,591
how the staff is being rewarded and a
vapor makes a crucial distinction between

588
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,910
benefits is and fiefs.
Uh, these other two ways,

589
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,040
how the staff, uh, uh, uh, can be, um,

590
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,060
at evolved deed, uh, in, uh,
an estate type of donation,

591
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,590
a fee for a uveal easily remembered that,
right?

592
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Avi Use the term in ordinary language
we say somebody has a fee for Dorma.

593
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,400
And by this we mean if
somebody has a fever dorm,

594
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,810
it means that somebody created the,
uh,

595
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,690
a subsystem Uber, which
it has gone through, uh,

596
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,780
virtually as long as that position is
alive was as that position is at least in

597
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:40,820
the same organization. Uh, so again,

598
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:43,190
if I can use the university examples,

599
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,150
you may not be as familiar
with this as I am,

600
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,610
but in universities,
for instance,

601
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:54,440
a office space for faculty
is a typical fees long. Uh,

602
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,800
once, uh, you know, in
faculty got an office,

603
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:02,630
it's virtually impossible to take
the office away from somebody.

604
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,900
It created a fief Dong a over
the territory of what that,

605
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,280
uh, what that person
has a, this is, uh, uh,

606
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,720
only for the time of the tenure.
Of course,

607
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,920
somebody retires that officers
will be immediately taken away.

608
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,770
The fiefdom is lost.
But you know,

609
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:26,771
the notion of fiefdom means that
you have lasting powered on it.

610
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,980
Benefits on the other hand
means that you get certain,

611
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,091
but all of the,

612
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:38,070
under the conditions that you
actually do the liver, uh,

613
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,760
uh, uh, uh, uh, to the ruler.

614
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,570
And there are really two types of feudal,
uh,

615
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,290
uh, systems. Uh, uh, one
is, uh, uh, a base. The,

616
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,450
um, on benefits is, um, and this is a,

617
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,680
a kind of a Rubendall for forum,
a few dollars. That means,

618
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,820
uh, the ability we serving
the SAR. For instance,

619
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:09,750
Russia was ruled, uh, typically, uh,

620
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:14,680
after Yvonne the terrible, my
namesake, uh, and until, uh,

621
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,060
uh,

622
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,060
the Russian revolution by a kind of
prep Bendel's system in which a desire,

623
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,470
uh, gave, uh, um, uh,

624
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,210
as data to the Lords as long
as they were loyal to it. Uh,

625
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,820
Eh, we see this now happening
in Russia again. Um,

626
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:38,970
President Putin actually to the
billions of dollars of Val's,

627
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,200
uh,

628
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,200
what people receive the from President
Yeltsin as private property because he

629
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:47,940
did not think they are loyal.

630
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,050
So these people ended up in jail
or they were sent into emigration.

631
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,240
Their property was taken away.

632
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:59,690
So even contemporary Russia in a VA
operates almost like a breath and,

633
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:03,280
or type of few dollars more, right? Uh,

634
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:08,390
President Putin as a kind of Evander
terrible right to sort of reinforces

635
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,240
loyalty. Uh, uh, and,
uh, I made the point,

636
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:19,340
right? That was exactly as
in Russia changed, uh, the,

637
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,320
a few of those system. Um,
and then, uh, [inaudible], uh,

638
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:24,900
uh,

639
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,900
were turned into Polish chics
boilers in Russia before Ivan,

640
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,690
there's charitable, had
inherited valves, um,

641
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:38,310
and Evander terrible and Peter the great
took that obey and turned them into

642
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,890
serving nobility in exchange for loyalty.
Uh,

643
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,760
if you have a listen to
Mussorgsky's fantastic opera,

644
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,510
Boris Godunov, you get the
story that he, exactly.

645
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,270
If you have not listened to it,
do right.

646
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:59,020
Don't get a year degree not
having known both. Uh, uh, uh,

647
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,260
and we saw us is fantastic. Upper
Boris Godunov. Um, all right.

648
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:09,540
Uh, well, uh, western a few dollars
more on the other hand is based, uh, uh,

649
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,110
on, uh, uh, uh, uh, long glass thing.

650
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:15,880
Get powers of the staff.
Uh,

651
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:21,170
a vest and feudal lords received a
property for lifetime and it actually was

652
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:26,790
inherited, uh, by the, uh, children. Uh,

653
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,900
and the fell.

654
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:32,590
They also exercise a great
deal of administrative power,

655
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,960
light,
uh,

656
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:39,770
feudal lords in France or England did
held court and made judgments right over

657
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:46,780
there. They're serves those who
belong to that authority. So the, uh,

658
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,580
and the kings were rather
limited in their power.

659
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,790
Uh, Valerie have seen this struggle
earlier in this scores, right? Uh,

660
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,970
between, uh, the king's
trying to gain more authority,

661
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:05,980
take it back from the feudal lords.
That's all that,

662
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,230
uh, um, uh,

663
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:12,290
absolute is versus constitutional
monarchy was all about right now,

664
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:16,990
of course for a constitutional
monarchy was not simply

665
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,020
the, uh, feudal lords who are assisted,

666
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,270
but also order the,

667
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,520
the bourgeoisie who wanted to have
a constitutional monarchy to limit,

668
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,300
uh, uh, uh, the rights of the monarch.

669
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,440
Now a traditional Tori
or Tony does a authority,

670
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:41,950
doesn't go very well with the economy,
right?

671
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:46,951
Because it is primarily oriented towards
satisfaction of needs and not the

672
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:52,110
generation of the profit.
Uh, right. And, uh,

673
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,060
therefore, uh, uh,

674
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:00,420
traditional domination
is likely to prevent the
development of business oriented

675
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,690
activities. And that's, I think, again,

676
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,440
true for the more
traditional type of system.

677
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,240
But we are familiar with like
the family or the universities.

678
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,770
Uh, they do not fight, operate,
lie business corporations,

679
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:22,960
um, uh, and, uh,
therefore the, uh, uh, uh,

680
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,080
may, uh, make, uh, uh,

681
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,850
calculate economic calculation
and profit seeking, uh,

682
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,630
difficult or impossible. Um, uh,

683
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,050
they can be a defense against
market Mac market mechanism,

684
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,170
but do not promote, promote a
mark Marquette mechanism. Uh,

685
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,210
uh, um, uh,

686
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:48,550
and of course in all
of these organizations,

687
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:53,110
that is a larger degree of arbitrariness.
Then in modern,

688
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,640
uh, organizations, uh, uh, uh,

689
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,370
and of course in traditional organization,
that is all of us a greater, uh,

690
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,060
um,
uh,

691
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:09,010
respect to the vowel fear of those
who are subjugated to authority.

692
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:14,250
So that's about traditional authority
and the extension of its modern

693
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,810
capitalism.
Thank you.
