1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:06,300
And see dental in my discussion sessions,
people got too excited about charisma.

2
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:09,390
So we did speak a lot about galleys.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,490
Ba I asked your patients recover
some of the same grounds,

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,030
but I hope I can give you a
new jokes about charisma. Uh,

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,040
this is one of the most exciting features
of the labor theory and probably run

6
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,980
off next to the Protestant ethic,
right,

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,320
the wrong and entered the common
language more than anything else, right?

8
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:39,321
That we all talk about get asthma and
the people's getting smart charismatic

9
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:40,950
leaders all the time,

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,060
just like the Protestant vert that date
be entered to the popular vocabulary and

11
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:51,660
everybody who has not tried
any vapor still uses the term.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,750
Uh,
uh,

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,710
it's also very important to come to
terms with the idea of charisma because,

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,720
uh, uh, a neighbor was a suspected, uh,

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,310
uh, in the 1930s, forties and 50s,

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,030
to be actually a protocol fascist and
with the idea of charisma advocating a,

17
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:19,230
for a strong leadership for Germany,

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
calling for a charismatic
leader for Germany and in Ebay,

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,970
almost demanding out of
Hitler. Now, of course,

20
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:34,770
he died in 1920. He could
not do that. Uh, about,

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,020
uh, especially, um, at a
philosopher George wrote clutch.

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,980
I accused him to be an
irrational, just, uh,

23
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,280
and, uh, uh, being a portal fascist,

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
laying the ideology for a
narcissism and add of Hitler.

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,073
Uh,

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I have to tell you that I
am not absolutely certain
what the Labor would have

27
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,120
done in 1930 or 33.
I hope for a,

28
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:11,121
like his brother who would not have
gone for the fascists or Nazis.

29
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,480
Um,
but it's complicated.

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,180
Ivo tried to make a case that in fact,

31
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:22,130
the concept of charisma is
not quite what I'd have.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,700
Hitler was. Um, so, um, uh,

33
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,120
the main major themes of the
presentation today. First of all,

34
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:35,250
we will dov the definition of charisma.
Um,

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,390
what is Gary's magical
authority? Uh, then we've,

36
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:44,391
you're talking about the sources of
charisma very carries mice coming from,

37
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,400
and this is particularly important,
uh,

38
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,660
to see why vapor is actually
not a plot on assay.

39
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,010
Um, uh, then the viewer will be talking
about, uh, uh, uh, the followers,

40
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,370
the charismatic leader. Um,
then we will talk about,

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,670
get his Ma as a revolutionary force,

42
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,530
get his Ma as, uh, the,
uh, vehicle of change.

43
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,820
Um,

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,820
and I think this is an interesting idea
in Bieber or one of the Vika points,

45
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:24,490
I think, or fever dearly. Um, I think, uh,

46
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,880
Karl Marx,
uh,

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,200
has a much more coherent and much more
best ways if tivity about historical

48
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,830
change as class Tragal,
you know,

49
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:40,720
and the contradictions between forces
and relations of production. Um,

50
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,100
this is, uh, uh, uh,
historically invalidated,

51
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,840
but a very coherent and very
best soil as it kind of argument.

52
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Vaporous idea of charisma
is that evolution on force
actually has an bitty car,

53
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,560
um, irrelevance, but, uh, it's, uh,

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,860
it had an aunt pass swears even
love your Clark about this. Um,

55
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,190
and then become to a big
club with the cat is a smart,

56
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:11,191
how charismatic leadership
can be routinized or
transmitted from a charismatic

57
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,840
leader to the next.
Uh,

58
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,070
and what I do maquettes of succession
for that charismatic leader.

59
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,870
Uh, so I mean, those of you who've
heard in my discussion section,

60
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:25,870
as you can see,

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,760
it feel not to be just a
regurgitation of the, uh, uh,

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,460
um, um, discussion sessions.

63
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:37,210
And I don't know what happened in
other discussions sections. Also,

64
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:42,140
the charisma may have come up.
This makes people move. Uh, um, uh,

65
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,530
uh, mine's mine. Smooth equity deal.

66
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,600
So I just a step back a minute and again,

67
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,610
revisit the idea of different types of
domination and what [inaudible] and a,

68
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,240
this is the simplest scheme. I can come
up fit, but I think this is a good one.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,610
Uh, I copyright it. I did it. Uh,

70
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,310
so the question is about,
is OBD as youtube.

71
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,550
It can be you two rules in person or
rules or it can be useful to a person or

72
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:20,050
master to an individual.
That's the big story, right?

73
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,120
And if it is youth too loose,

74
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,390
that's when we are talking
about legal national authority.

75
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,440
And this will be the topic,
uh, and bureaucratic rule,

76
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,730
a modern liberal democratic
system where a mother,

77
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,010
not that democratic system, but
systems which don't steal, do,

78
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,600
have, um, uh, rules. Um, uh, of, uh, uh,

79
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,120
uh, our floor, uh,

80
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,890
that aren't actually a authoritarian
systems and, you know, operate,

81
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,780
uh, uh, that, uh, uh, uh, uh,

82
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,890
rules of law that authoritarian leaders
actually themselves for all the law and

83
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:03,980
take law seriously and
implement laws, uh, seriously,

84
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,550
uh,
that lead got national authority,

85
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,740
does not mean liberal democracy.

86
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,010
It simply means that this
is a system in the village.

87
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,170
There is a, um, uh, at all or flaw,

88
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,890
even if the leader itself can
be not particularly democratic,

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,250
then we'll classier democracy
as we understand the try.

90
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,200
There's a very recent phenomenon,

91
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,950
a universal suffrage in the western
world became why spread since the 1920s.

92
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,210
And it really became the
dominant form right, of them, uh,

93
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,210
of, uh, uh, political
rule a much, much later.

94
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:53,500
And I would say more like
after the Second World War, um,

95
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,410
I'm in Switzerland for instance,
you have rights, uh, for women.

96
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,170
Two wars just very recently.
So, well, you know,

97
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,770
democracy is a liberal,

98
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:11,771
democracy is a very new intervention lit
and the Legal National Authority is not

99
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:17,110
such a new invention. Uh,
there was a rule of law, um,

100
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,210
in England moving back to,
uh,

101
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,290
the odd ocean evolution, right? This
is going back to the late, um, uh,

102
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,240
uh, uh, uh,

103
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,410
17th century, um, that it
was doable off law, uh,

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,700
in the United States. Uh, uh,

105
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,500
before the late 1800
[inaudible] 19th century,

106
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,860
though, there was no liberal democracy
as we understand that, right?

107
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,740
There was no universal suffrage at
all. I saw, I mean, you could have a,

108
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,910
uh, a rule of law. We saw democracy,

109
00:07:55,911 --> 00:08:00,070
but that's still very different from
a system very well be and master.

110
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,850
And that are two ways. How
you are the master, Eh,

111
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,540
you will obey because the tradition and
pointed that master and that's what they

112
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,950
were talking about,
uh,

113
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,190
Tuesday or because the master is believed
to have some charismatic features.

114
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:18,831
Uh,

115
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,800
I also mentioned it last time that the
difference is between the three types of

116
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,350
authority, legal, rational
authority, traditional authority.

117
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,580
It d and charismatic authority
do not have the same,

118
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,810
I use the term ontological
status. All right? Um,

119
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,460
the two big forms in history,
our traditional authority,

120
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:45,461
which through rationalization eventually
become Sligo national authority and

121
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:51,110
charismatic will quality usually
is a transitory pays stage.

122
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,250
Uh, charismatic leader quality
is the charismatic leaders.

123
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,620
Emerge is a,

124
00:08:56,621 --> 00:09:01,290
in times of great times of great need,

125
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,200
desperation and need for change.

126
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,910
And charismatic leaders if they deliver,
you know, as long as they deliver,

127
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:12,060
they remain leaders.
If they stopped delivering,

128
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,420
cat is my cat is my
steak and away from them.

129
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,990
And it's extremely difficult for
charismatic leader to establish an ongoing

130
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:25,920
system of charismatic
authority, right? Because, uh,

131
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,390
um,
uh,

132
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,420
it would be very difficult to transfer
that own personal or charisma to somebody

133
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:37,440
else, right. And to keep
running a charismatic system.

134
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,630
Okay. So that's about generally, you
know, what it is, get it as smart

135
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,330
as I said, this really, we keep
using the term all the time.

136
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,020
The last 18 months, we use it a lot, uh,

137
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:56,940
because of a candidate and
later President Obama, and,

138
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:57,750
uh,

139
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,550
there is probably nobody in this
room who at one point the Nafe say,

140
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,380
uh, something about Obama
scaries Ma or you know,

141
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:12,210
if you did not like him, the
lack of his charisma, right? Uh,

142
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,540
but uh, you know, this was
a gum on, they use sturm.

143
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,900
Now this is coming from vapor because
he did this germ out from at a rather

144
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:25,440
obscure. They are logical
language. I charism.

145
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,540
I actually refer to some super
human qualities of individual laws.

146
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,140
I would say almost semi guards
who have some very personnel,

147
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:41,040
an exclusive relationship to God.
And therefore,

148
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,320
like any other human beings,

149
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,530
they kind of can't talk to God and then
they can interpret God's revealed to the

150
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,170
people,
these very charismatic leaders.

151
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,320
So in the most classical
definition of charisma,

152
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Murray first ride that to the great
founders of great world religions,

153
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,890
that's what charisma
in initial meaning men.

154
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,800
Uh, so Muhammad Morzas, uh,

155
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,120
or Jesus,
uh,

156
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:17,540
the headgear is smart because
they had a special access to God,

157
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,060
right? Um, Moses, God,
the two tables from God,

158
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,090
he could not see the face of God,
but nevertheless,

159
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,990
the God that through Deimos won't God,
nobody else could walk up,

160
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,980
ride that on the mountain and
get these tables, you know,

161
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:38,550
and are people, this is the law, right?

162
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,430
Because only Moses who good,
right?

163
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,770
And Jesus had a very specific
relationship to God, right?

164
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:51,120
Christian believe was even the son of God,
embodiment of God.

165
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,770
And undoubtedly,
you know,

166
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:57,760
it is believed by Christians
that Jesus could actually, um,

167
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,630
uh,
convey to us what God wants us to do.

168
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,050
Right at this very special,
unique, charismatic,

169
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,390
the Epi and Mohamed, uh, had
the special appeal, uh, to,

170
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,313
to God,

171
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,620
or if you are more and more than Mr.
Smiths had these very unique right

172
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:20,560
relationship to God, right? At one point,

173
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,610
an angel came,
you know that a new sacred book,

174
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:28,630
a continuation of the Bible,
left it with Mr. Smith.

175
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,010
He translated it. And when the
transition was, God, you know,

176
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:37,340
the angel came and took it
away that this was a charisma.

177
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,910
Write a very specific superhuman.

178
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:44,500
It did not happen to any other
human being. Only two Smith, right?

179
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,390
That's uh, um, uh, that is the
initial notion of the meaning.

180
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,990
But now they were very city,
a little,

181
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,020
kind of a broader conception.

182
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,070
And he said all that charisma will
be applied to a certain quality of an

183
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,140
individual. Personalities, important,

184
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:09,820
still an individual with
considered extra or the metric,

185
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,770
um,
uh,

186
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,030
and treated as endowed with super natural,

187
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,860
super human.
The sounds like the original definition,

188
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,750
but then he was on and he said,

189
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,210
or at least exceptional
powers and qualities, right?

190
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,970
And these are the guarded
as of divine origin.

191
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:38,150
That's the founders of the
Greek religion or exemplary.

192
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,860
He modifies, tried. It
can be just exemplary.

193
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,890
You don't have to believe that this
is Sammy God or the embodiment of God.

194
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,070
You only have to believe that this
is an excellent blurry being, uh, uh,

195
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,590
who has some exceptional he abilities,

196
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:59,170
exceptional qualities,
um,

197
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,230
and that will qualify
that uveal call somebody.

198
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,240
Uh,

199
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,240
attached is matic Burson
or the charismatic leader.

200
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,490
Uh, uh, let me also underline
one more term from these, uh,

201
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,440
um, uh, quotation, which
is extremely important. Um,

202
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,670
but,
uh,

203
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,700
he said the person is considered to be
extra ordinary and three teeth as endowed

204
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,440
with super human or an example
of the features. So in,

205
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,590
I think what is extremely important to
see that we bear does not tell us that

206
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:46,111
this individual is actually extra
ordinary that is actually super human in a

207
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:51,400
way.
It is in the eye of the beholder.

208
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,860
It is among the followers who at
[inaudible] tried to these qualities to

209
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:00,560
somebody.

210
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,280
So in ave a charismatic leaders
are being made by the followers,

211
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,700
uh, well what is, uh,

212
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,800
what is the source of charisma?

213
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:20,330
This is now making it even
more clear and more precise.

214
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:24,860
It dressed in recognition.
You have to recognize it.

215
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,551
Charisma.

216
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:30,551
So the relationship of charisma is in the
interpersonal relationship between the

217
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,700
leaders and the followers.

218
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,920
And in this interaction is
charisma being created, right?

219
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,400
It is not given by the grace of Lord,
right?

220
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,270
To an individual person.
It is created by, uh, uh,

221
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,990
doors who are subjected to authority,
right?

222
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,050
And it's also important that the cat is,
uh,

223
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,240
those who follow the charismatic leaders
are usually scenes as followers or

224
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,890
disciples.
Right.

225
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,930
They have some extra ordinary
commitment to this ledger,

226
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,490
right? Um, uh,

227
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:15,491
these leader creates excitement
in them and these excitement,

228
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,080
but creates a,
uh,

229
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,160
the community of the followers or
the community of the disciples,

230
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,460
right? Um, uh, well, uh,

231
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,570
this is was one of the
reasons why, um, uh,

232
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,430
many people in the last 18
months, uh, regarding the, uh,

233
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,503
uh,

234
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,990
Barack Obama as a charismatic leader
because he was keepable to appearing in a

235
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,540
crowd and moved a crowd,
right?

236
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,080
Create excitement in the crowd,
right?

237
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,070
He created followers, right? You know,

238
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,240
almost one would say
disciples, uh, um, uh,

239
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,260
such a, now what the
charisma can be, we drove,

240
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,200
this is again, a very important
idea and vapor. He said,

241
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:14,201
if the proof of success allude
the leader for too long,

242
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,120
it is likely that the charismatic
authority will disappear, right?

243
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,080
So the charismatic leader gives you
right promises that it will produce

244
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,430
miracles.

245
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,430
And when the charismatic leader
does not producing these miracles,

246
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,740
right, he must work
mirror. Cause I said, um,

247
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,490
uh, vapor. Then the people we drew,

248
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,520
the recognition of charisma from the
leader and the masters simply becomes a

249
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,370
private person at an
ordinary person loses its,

250
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:03,300
uh, in the vigil at Pr. Well,

251
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,010
uh, what is, uh, uh, very
important, right? Uh,

252
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,510
so that, uh, uh,

253
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,490
the cat is matic leader has to
promise you miracles, right?

254
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Has to promise you that it will deliver
something but you desperately need,

255
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
right?
Get is my,

256
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:26,961
is deeply rooted in the conditions in
the situation in which charismatic leader

257
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:30,870
is being constructed by the followers.

258
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,020
When you are in a desperate need,

259
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,680
then you are looking for
a charismatic leader,

260
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,590
which can solve this problem,

261
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:45,591
but you think is almost unresolvable
then the charismatic leader of your calm

262
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,560
and your promise, you
that this problem, uh,

263
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,650
that the charismatic leader will be able
to solve because it's extra ordinary

264
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,030
characteristics. Um, and again,

265
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:04,500
if I can come back to the last
elections that was, you know,

266
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:08,470
clearly, uh, the case, uh, um, uh, uh,

267
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,520
the v how a candidate Obama was,

268
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,470
keep her two of them,
the elections.

269
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:20,960
You remember one of the
key words, right? Uh,

270
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,890
cataract, Chad eyes. The campaign, um, uh,

271
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,960
haul change. Yes, we can.

272
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,150
I mean, these are very typical elements
that I had to have a charismatic appeal,

273
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,200
right? You are in need. You want hope.

274
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,980
You want to have businesses,
not usual.

275
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,130
You want to live a new type of business.
Now, this is what I promise you, right?

276
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,920
A change and hope and I empower you.

277
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,530
I'm the person who can empower you,
right?

278
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,690
It can be done right.
We can do it right? Yes.

279
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,730
It can be done. Who
Change? Yes. Can Be done.

280
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,530
These are very typical elements,
right? What a charismatic leader,

281
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,460
dusk produce. Um, in recent history,

282
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,140
other charismatic leaders,
which are probably not as attractive,

283
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,350
uh,
in historical perspective as Obama did,

284
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,070
became charismatic leader.

285
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:31,071
The same way Fidel Castro established
Kelly's is my Ford himself.

286
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,860
The Cuban society was in desperate need
for change in 1960 and Fidel Castro

287
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,270
appealed. And he said,
well, I'd be or blink,

288
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,280
pinch a change to you.

289
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,400
Ivy would get rid of this
corporate government, Ivo,

290
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,700
create equality, right
ivy, and help the poor.

291
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:55,690
The poor really get developed here.
I will create effluence, right?

292
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,980
I'd be or created Justin
Affluence Society, right?

293
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:03,940
And therefore he came up with promises,
what people are looking for.

294
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,260
And then charisma was
attribute it to Fidel Castro.

295
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,720
Uh, I'd off Hitler emerge as
a charismatic leader, right?

296
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,260
A Germany's suffered a humiliating
defeat in the first world war.

297
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,480
Then it was hit with a great depression,

298
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,050
which he Germany even verse then he,

299
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,470
the United States and
then out of Hitler appeal.

300
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,760
Um,

301
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,760
and or he was not quiet as an
attractive personality as Obama was,

302
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:39,880
you know, quite a ridiculous
guy. But he actually said, well,

303
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:44,500
I can solve the problems for
you. Right? A defined an anime.

304
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,890
It's, or Jewish conspiracy, CB,

305
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:51,640
get rid of the Jews and I veal
churning sat around and you know,

306
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,570
we, we have, uh, we,

307
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,230
we all have a new empire and
that it was he capable of it.

308
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,073
This problem.

309
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,080
There was a need in the situation that
people were looking for leadership and

310
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,510
they were looking for a strong leader.

311
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:10,750
The charismatic leader
and the attribute Id.

312
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:14,200
This charismatic leadership
feed people to them.

313
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,360
The problem comes when
they cannot deliver a,

314
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,110
certainly Hitler, when the Russian
troops were already fighting,

315
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:27,730
get out of Berlin, was no
charismatically done any long. Right?

316
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,150
You must hiding in the bunker considering
suicide and he's got his Mo was gone

317
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,990
all together cause he did not deliver.

318
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,480
You did not do the miracles.
Right.

319
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,550
And therefore his charisma was we drove,
um,

320
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,680
now about the followers, right? Uh,

321
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:54,570
he said the followers of
a charismatic leader, um,

322
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,890
are often often bound together by
emotional ties and they are create an

323
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:06,230
emotional community with each other.
Uh,

324
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,250
vapor uses these German for
term fatty gemeinschaft too.

325
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,800
They become kind of a community.

326
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,570
There is a real religious leader
with a charismatic appeal.

327
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,500
It creates overs.
Communities of people.

328
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:28,501
I don't know if any one of you ever
had experiences of some fundamentalist

329
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:34,210
religious experience. I did when
I was a teenager. There was,

330
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:37,450
you know, a preacher. Uh, interestingly,

331
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:41,650
he also did not look charismatic.
He was even not a great speaker.

332
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:45,760
I don't know how a nurse,
he had these curious charismatic Epi or,

333
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:49,040
but he did and he did
have an impact on me.

334
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:54,041
I attribute it to charisma to him and
he's kind of created a community around

335
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:56,600
himself,
right?

336
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,960
The all were brothers and sisters
together who's kind of believe in the

337
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,450
charismatic guest preacher.

338
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:10,451
This is very often in kind of sexy area
and fundamentalist religious groups be

339
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,060
Christian or being Muslim,
being evangelical.

340
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,720
There must be people in this
room, right? Who in the,

341
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,200
at least when they were a teenager,
the experience that right.

342
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,210
And you are a teenager and you want
to get out of your family and you are

343
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:31,220
looking for a new community.

344
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,730
I mean this kind of religious communities
very often offer an alternative one.

345
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:42,030
Some of you may still be in such
a a community and if you are,

346
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,040
I envy you. I think it is, uh, you know,

347
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,190
as I recall it was a wonderful
experience in some ways,

348
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,860
fairly demand shafto you had your family,
right?

349
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,720
You have your spiritual
family that you belong to.

350
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,210
Does it make any sense of that saying,

351
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:04,270
I think there must be people I had to
experience that are still experiencing it.

352
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,290
Right?
Um,

353
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,530
so that's what he calls fell gemeinschaft
doing gemeinschaft means community.

354
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Then the mass society
relationships becomes our
relationships like a community.

355
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,900
And indeed,
in even in charismatic political campaign,

356
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,500
you have the sense that
we belonged together.

357
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,530
The coma con calls right there was
fairly gemeinschaft and in civil right

358
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,040
movement right now there's
this charismatic leader,

359
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,500
Martin Luther King, Bobby
Kennedy, right? And, uh,

360
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:45,980
the whole idea of civil right, and
that'd be cool together, right?

361
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,610
And we go to the south and we demonstrate,
right?

362
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:53,870
And we demand city will rise
from this bloody raises, right?

363
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,460
That created a sense of
community among people, right?

364
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,760
Who had this belief, uh, on change.

365
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,810
Uh,
uh,

366
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,980
if you want to actually
in such a community,

367
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:19,981
you have a kind of personal
devotion to the leader,

368
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,490
uh,

369
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,490
and that is a certain degree of an
twosie asthma of what emerges in you,

370
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,310
right? Um, uh,

371
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,820
are bitches of occasionally
coming out of their spare,

372
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,421
uh,

373
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:39,421
that you are desperate and then
you hope to have some salvation,

374
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,241
uh,

375
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:45,241
some solution to an end result football
problem by the charismatic leader.

376
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,380
That's how in communism and charismatic
leaders like learning or Mao or Castro

377
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,540
emerged,
right,

378
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:59,550
is over all societies in deep trouble
after humiliations after wars in Vegan aid

379
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:07,541
for soc made some major structural
change and then they were looking for a

380
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,390
savior, right? Review,

381
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,470
solve these unresolvable problems
and we lead out to better dies.

382
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,610
Now,
it's also interesting that you know,

383
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,730
in a charismatic communities that is
usually relatively little hierarchy,

384
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,740
not all that much of a
bureaucracy. Um, uh, um, uh,

385
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:36,741
doors who are actually serving the
charismatic leader usually do not,

386
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,850
uh, yet, uh, uh, salaries or
benefits. It's again, chew, you know,

387
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:46,851
even for a charismatic political
leaders that they get a whole army of

388
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:53,361
volunteers because they are so strongly
believe right in the course that they

389
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:56,880
volunteer that time and money.

390
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:03,180
Now here comes a, an
entrusting and, uh, uh, uh,

391
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,810
uh,
disturbing proposition that he said about,

392
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,550
but because [inaudible] is
such an extra ordinary form,

393
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,490
it's as it as a system of
charismatic or Traditi,

394
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,950
it is all paused to a rational
and bureaucratic or quality,

395
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,070
right?
Uh,

396
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,090
therefore it is kind of irrational
in the sense of being foreign to all

397
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:36,321
establish rules because what is a
charismatically that about to change?

398
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,460
And the change means that there will be
new rules of the game and you don't know

399
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,680
exactly what these rules of the Games are.

400
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,370
And this what makes if the charismatic
or quality is a horse system is up or the

401
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:58,241
eating a high level of
uncertainty to the system.

402
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:04,370
And now forget about American
politics because in the United States,

403
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,690
um, we clearly have a legal
rational system, right?

404
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,750
That's what characterizes the United
States of America and occasionally the sea

405
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,740
and merging, um, uh,

406
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,320
politicians who actually do implement
some level of change or promise change

407
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:30,831
whether they can deliver or not will
greatly affect how long v attached

408
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,780
[inaudible] this before.

409
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,950
But from Roosevelt to JFK to
mark and military king, uh,

410
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:42,520
to, uh, uh, uh, or Obama,

411
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,170
there were politicians
which this charismatic happy
about the system itself was

412
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:49,660
not charismatic, right? Um,

413
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,320
cat is my health leaders to get elected.

414
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,800
And charisma actually may help a
leader to be able to make some strong.

415
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:04,270
And the important
changes early on in life.

416
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Those who are critical of president or
Mark Obama usual are critical of him that

417
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,240
he has not moving fast
and forcefully enough,

418
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,190
was not cashing in,

419
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,960
in his charisma early
right in his presidency.

420
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,180
Um, and that is, you know, some
science that in fact, you know,

421
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:28,700
his charisma charismatic at beer,
uh,

422
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,430
is weakening, right? There
are some people who say, well,

423
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,050
I feel betrayed.
You know,

424
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:40,051
I was promised change and I
see a lot of politics as usual,

425
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,990
right?
Uh,

426
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
so this is of course an inevitable problem
if a leader who has these charismatic

427
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:55,921
at bill finds itself in the
legal rational authority,

428
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,100
right? That actually it's very
difficult to implement the change.

429
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,510
You want to change the rules,
the law,

430
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:06,520
alls you have to walk through
Congress to do that, right?

431
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,700
You just cannot declare that from now
on of ours. That is a new game, uh,

432
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,830
rules of the game and that is sounds
very much like politics as usual.

433
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,390
That's a very different,
uh,

434
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,500
from about Lenin or mouse tone there.
Right?

435
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,160
Lenny in and Moussa took,
were not guided by the rules.

436
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,220
They established the rules.
I mean,

437
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,180
mouse or Duke is a particularly
interesting character, right?

438
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,480
He established first I bureaucratic
rule in China and then he launches the

439
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,790
culture revolution,
right?

440
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,180
He launches an anti bureaucratic movement
and the top leader of the bureaucracy

441
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:53,020
is becoming the major popular leader
of an anti bureaucratic movement.

442
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,430
I mean, this guy was really quite
something quite extraordinary.

443
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,130
And then I may, he did that, you know,

444
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:04,870
because his charisma was
weakened by the 1960s first.

445
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:07,140
He promised greatly four of our,
you know,

446
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,380
in no time they will catch up and
we'd be look like the United States.

447
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,490
And what happened with the
Greek lead for Var disaster,

448
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,950
people were starving to death.

449
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:23,230
So he was not delivering the miracle.
So what does he does next?

450
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,360
He shows us here is a real change,

451
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,320
the rules of the game.

452
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,920
He launches the culture
revolution and he's,

453
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,020
he suddenly becomes the leader
of people who actually should be,

454
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,210
or pausing Kim, uh, you know,

455
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,750
he is generating this kind of
miracles, you know, the last miracle,

456
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:49,751
but he's driving to January at all age
that he goes rimming in the young chair

457
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:54,800
river. You see, you think
I'm old and I'm dying. No,

458
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,760
I'm super human. I still
can serve him. Alright.

459
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,350
This is the kind of, you
know, trying to rescue, right?

460
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,480
You are charismatic Aptio and it
is about to be taken away from you.

461
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,320
But on the whole,

462
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:17,321
as we see as they established these
charismatic leaders established as

463
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,320
charismatic system, they can
change the rules. And you know,

464
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,290
if you look at Chinese
history every five years,

465
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,670
everything is completely
different, right? Um, uh,

466
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,390
first a hundred flowers,
four ish.

467
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,000
We all that every body will then,
you know, greatly for them. You know,

468
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:38,600
cultural revolution.
He is changing the rules all the time.

469
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,120
This is an unpredictable environment.

470
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,220
Candle economies work in this unpacking
unpredictable environment. No,

471
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,580
it cannot.
The same goes for the Nazis.

472
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,240
And the same goes for the Stalinists.
Right? It was unpredictable.

473
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,360
Environment was not good for business.

474
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,230
Business needs a predictable environment,
right?

475
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,230
It needs to rule of law.

476
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:07,850
That's why capital is
business at least, uh, lives,

477
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,560
legal,
rational or authority.

478
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,810
They don't necessarily lie
democratic system, right?

479
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,290
Capitalism can leave nicely
with authoritarian figures
and capitalist to love

480
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:27,080
the peanut chair, right?
Uh, God, you know,

481
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:31,070
peanut share was, you know, reasonable,
illegal Ashman authority. I mean,

482
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,920
at the beginning, you know, he
was killing people like crazy,

483
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,190
but then he established a
reasonably predictable system
and capitalist loved it.

484
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,240
And for the vile,
you know,

485
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,830
the Chilean economy partially had
wise by Milton Friedman, you know,

486
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,440
both Steve.
So I mean,

487
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:53,390
about capitalism really wants is a
predictable environment. And in many ways,

488
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,224
you know,

489
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:58,520
democracy is not all that good for the
predictable environment because every

490
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:03,050
fourth year we go to the pools and then
we elect other people and then they come

491
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:07,680
up with other ideas. And this is
a bit of a mess. So in reality,

492
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,970
I would almost say that a good free
market economy lavs rule of law,

493
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Evita kind of authoritarian and a
longstanding policy because the ability,

494
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:25,460
they don't like this big changes
right in the political system.

495
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,550
Uh, well, um, no, and charisma
is that evolutionary force.

496
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,020
This is very important.

497
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,590
I think we were first before for
making some very specific argument.

498
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,240
He said it is all of us in
traditional historic barriers, right?

499
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,010
Traditional Authority,

500
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,320
when charisma is the great
should rally for us. So in fact,

501
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:53,970
in a modern legal, rational
authority, it is not so much charisma,

502
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,640
which cat is the change through.

503
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,770
It is technical innovation and it is
a kind of routine and boring elections

504
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:03,840
every four years,

505
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,080
which brings changes by gradually and
incrementally the big changes occurring

506
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:15,330
from one type of traditional authority
to another type of authority.

507
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,630
And in order to change the value system
of one type of tradition to another type

508
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:24,630
of tradition that's venue
neath charismatic leaders.

509
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,950
So he said,

510
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,980
I bureaucratic rationalization ears
to major it evolutionarily for us.

511
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,490
But you know, in a bureaucratic
system like what we have,

512
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,900
it is a reality.
A revolution from the south.

513
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,750
It is coming from technological change.

514
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,510
We have an evolution or yes,

515
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,280
I'm in the first time when I heard
that his staff like Internet is,

516
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:52,320
was uh, uh, an email.

517
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,540
It was 1976 and now I'm
an inter, you know, uh,

518
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,380
uh, email, uh, at that addict
does many of, you know,

519
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,700
you sent me an email and occasional in
five minutes you get an answer from me

520
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:09,210
because I always checking my email
like crazy. This was all I knew.

521
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:13,950
All this was coming from the outside.
Now a charisma.

522
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:17,400
On the other hand, this is very
insightful, very important.

523
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,980
It is revolution from within,

524
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,650
but charisma is doing is changing
the value systems in you, right?

525
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,070
That's what charismatic leaders do achieve
to persuade you that you have to have

526
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,510
a different kind of value system.
And that's why I think charismatic leader,

527
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:41,490
she does play a role not only
in traditional societies,

528
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,220
but you know,
charismatic leaders in a legal,

529
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,240
rational authority do play a role
to change people's value systems,

530
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,830
uh, in substantial ways. Again,

531
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:59,610
we discussed that in discussion section
as those who are not in my discussion

532
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,990
section. Just uh, let me involve
the civil right movement, right?

533
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,650
The civil right movement in 10 years in
the United States produced the change in

534
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:11,400
value systems,

535
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,440
our attitudes to race relationships
and gender relationships,

536
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,250
which otherwise would have
taken a hundred years, right?

537
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,580
It happened in 10 short years that we
completely resold a race and gender

538
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:30,420
relationships in this country, right? Uh,

539
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,990
and it's to a large extent the mended,
right?

540
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,440
Charismatic leaders,
it demanded, right? Uh,

541
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,000
Martin Luther King, right?
Uh, who had a dream right,

542
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:48,030
about the society where there can be a
different type of value system and in no

543
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:54,450
time, I mean, you were too young to
experience that, but your balance and but,

544
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,690
and six billions and talk to
them, they will tell you, right?

545
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,020
How fundamentally their word outlook and
looking at a person of another race or

546
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:10,081
how they begin to cheat a villain in
their family or girls in the family.

547
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,820
How radically change almost instantly,
right?

548
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,270
Because it was a change from the thing,
right?

549
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,900
That's what charismatic
revolution is all about.

550
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,350
Um, and well, this is uh, uh,

551
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,580
of course, uh, uh, has
everything to do against routine.

552
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,840
Charismatic is not doing
things as they used to be.

553
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,370
That's why it is the opposite,
right? Of One type of traditionalism.

554
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,640
And the problem is what happens in the
charismatic leader disappears and die.

555
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:50,260
So that's when we have the problem.

556
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,440
How can the charismatic leader
be replaced as a very big issue?

557
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,220
And there are different
matters of succession.

558
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,980
And let me just walk
you through all of this.

559
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:07,610
It's not fight on interesting.
Again, be sure search,

560
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,000
it can be biased about it.
He Shun.

561
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,380
It can be designation
by the origin or leader.

562
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,890
It can be designation by a staff,

563
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:23,220
which is particularly qualified to decide
who is the next charismatic leader.

564
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:28,370
There'll be loud. The issue is how
can you maintain a charismatic,

565
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:33,610
the system Goin gon it can be had at that
Terry that's some had that they on is

566
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:39,190
established and it can be office charisma.
The office itself.

567
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:41,320
Get Kelly charisma.
Now,

568
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:44,650
let me just briefly talk to
each one of these church.

569
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,903
Um,

570
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,830
the best example is how
you found the Dalai Lama,

571
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,800
right?
It happens to US church.

572
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,830
The lie alarm or dies,

573
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,420
you know that the da Lai
Lama is reincarnated.

574
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,960
So you send out to people and looking
for the child who is the become nation of

575
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,590
the Da Lai Lama.

576
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:16,591
There must be just one child who is
the incarnation of the Da Lai Lama.

577
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,710
Then you have experts who can tell,

578
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,750
go around and then they find this child.
This is the new Dalai Lama.

579
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,040
And then if you'll be brought up
and will become the Dalai Lama,

580
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,840
and of course we'll have a greed deal.
Uh,

581
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,290
af charisma. You can't
see it. The barracks,

582
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,290
uh,

583
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:44,290
the Da Lai Lama does heck a
lot of galleries right now
other than you believe in

584
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:50,770
reincarnation or not? That's
another story. Uh, uh,

585
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,800
probably most people in this
room do not believe in it,

586
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,810
but if you do not believe it,

587
00:41:56,811 --> 00:42:01,811
it even more miraculous why the Dalai
Lama has this white extra ordinary care is

588
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:05,034
not,

589
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,090
there are people who just get wired if
they can get near to the Dalai Lama.

590
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I had a student in Taiwan who actually
turned into a boat his and became a great

591
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,460
follower of the Dalai Lama.

592
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:23,060
He got a phd from Ucla.

593
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,260
What he's following, whatever
the da Lai Lama, who was his,

594
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:32,210
all of us there because he has
these charisms, his charisma,

595
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,640
his attribute it to him,
right?

596
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,330
He was found in the right way and he was
established as a charismatic leader can

597
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:44,570
happen through revelation.

598
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,060
Revelation actually means that,
uh,

599
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,160
there are some people who believed to
have some kind of access to some divine

600
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:56,384
authority.

601
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,570
Who can that clear that this is a person
who is the next scan asthmatic leader?

602
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,551
Well,

603
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:09,551
I don't think in contemporary reverse
revelation is all that much though were,

604
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:12,310
I mean, newspapers do it for you, right?

605
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,090
The newspapers do create
charismatic leaders for you.

606
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:20,030
They attach charismatic,
they build up.

607
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,360
The charismatic powers are for half a
person in the media does it for you and

608
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:31,580
certainly their charisma
attribute it to um,

609
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,090
a rock stars, rock stars
to have charisma, right,

610
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:42,050
is created through the media. The
media has the oral call, right?

611
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,490
He knows who the grade
guys are and whom you,

612
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,500
you'll have to get absolutely the ABS
excited when you get to the accounts

613
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:55,310
shirt. Now that can be a
designation by the origin or leader.

614
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,060
Uh,
if the charismatic leader is dying,

615
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:04,061
then the charismatic leader has a
problem to find a successor that very

616
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:09,740
difficult to do because charismatic
leaders are bloody scared that if they

617
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:11,120
designate a leader,

618
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,160
then they will be poisoned or merge.

619
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,970
Uh, the new leader wants
to take it over to often.

620
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:25,210
Very often we see charismatic leaders
designating leaders and then murdered in

621
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:28,660
them.
That's a long history in human guide.

622
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,480
But you know,

623
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,480
an interesting example was that styling
tried to build up his charisma by

624
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:41,631
thinking a testimonial off
[inaudible] learning ambitious.

625
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,250
You normally 11 said that stallion,
there'll be the successor.

626
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:51,930
This was all lie landing in.
Actually the slight, uh, uh,

627
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,670
uh, starting a great deal and was
very reluctant to name a successor,

628
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,880
but he forged his letter and try to save
l I inherited the charisma and he had a

629
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:07,230
lot of problems actually to
establish his charisma. Eventually.

630
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,660
In fact,
during the Second World War,

631
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,810
he managed where merged as a charismatic
leader and not in only in the Soviet

632
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,050
Union,
but even in the vest.

633
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,460
There's a lot of people in
the United States as a, the,

634
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:26,461
the Soviet Army defeated the Germans
first in Moscow and then of course in

635
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:32,490
styling Grad that they begin to see
starting as a great leader, right?

636
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:34,350
As a charismatic Greek leader,

637
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,780
we probably had nothing to do with
the success of the Red Army now,

638
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:44,230
or it can be designated
by a qualified staff. Uh,

639
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,540
this is the way half, for
instance, the poop is being,

640
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,993
uh,

641
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,420
selected and the boob thus have
lie the charismatic authority.

642
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,760
If you are all man catalytic,

643
00:45:56,761 --> 00:46:00,300
you know that the pope
has some access to God,

644
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:04,430
what you ordinarily Roman
Catholics do not have and how is,

645
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,260
but it's going one from
bomb pop to the next.

646
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:12,630
The character of the book will
matter, right? There are some more,

647
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,380
you know,
charming more passwords if books when we,

648
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:21,381
you'll see more charismatic leaders
that are other groups who are more like

649
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:24,030
middle Kratz but never the less,

650
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:29,031
even the bureaucratic kind of Forbes art
assume to be charismatic and they are

651
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:31,350
Sellek then,
uh,

652
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,090
by a designated staff that is a
certain set of archbishop's men.

653
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,870
One Paul dies, they gather together in
Rome and they cannot leave, you know,

654
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,390
the room until they agree
the achieve their consensus.

655
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:50,391
Who is the other person who will have
dispatch shoddy relationship to God?

656
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,240
All right. Uh, that is
also had other attitude,

657
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:58,241
that charisma that you try to pass
a charisma on to your children.

658
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,960
Very hard to do a North Skoda
is trying to do that, right?

659
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,560
Himi was shown passed, uh, uh, his, uh,

660
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,980
charisma onto Kim Jung Il,

661
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,810
which is an absolutely ridiculous guy.
But nevertheless,

662
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,910
you know, somehow, yeah,

663
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:22,911
it looks like you know that in Korea he
does have some kind of get is matic at

664
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:26,940
bill.
So I mean this is not totally impossible.

665
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:28,890
I mean that's a bad idea.
You know,

666
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:33,010
if you are charismatic leader to
brass charisma on the spree buying,

667
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,470
not the office got his Ma,

668
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,480
this is very important in combines
of an office is supposed to have some

669
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,950
charismatic depending on the office,

670
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:46,540
but the office of the book of course
it's supposed to have charisma,

671
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,380
but we actually do use this very often.

672
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:55,381
We do barely into your aunt to for
you we call this leadership right?

673
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,240
That we expect people in put us in
position of certain authorities to offer

674
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:04,030
leadership to have vision.
Right?

675
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,400
And this is an a kind of a charisma
which goals, uh, via with the office.

676
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,730
And you know, I have been
department chair, uh,

677
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,710
quite a few times and uh,

678
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:19,120
it's so interesting moving into the
position of department chair and more

679
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:20,140
meaning out of it.

680
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,370
But your relationship to your
college change agreed there.

681
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,850
You know when you are the pen,

682
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,020
the and chair that is southern is Sammy
charisma is attribute it to you right

683
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,970
now. You are a support to offer some
kind of leadership annual, I believe,

684
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,950
to be able to bring in songs
change. I just remember, you know,

685
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,600
one of the institutions and I was an
incoming outside share our people say,

686
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,670
ah, you came in life fresh
air early in two years time.

687
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:55,720
It was all gone. I was not Rochelle.
I was a little tee in, you know,

688
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:58,000
I was operating, you know, bureaucracy,

689
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:03,010
massaging the mirror accuracy to get
the exam. My charisma was all God.

690
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,840
But there is, right. I think it's
a very American thing, right?

691
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:12,841
That you attach an expectations
to an incumbents of the office,

692
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,470
that it can actually carry out
change, bringing fresh air, right.

693
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:22,810
To have a vision and to do these
better than it was done before. Okay.

694
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,580
That's about charisma.
Thank you.
