1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,210
Uh, okay. So now the move into, um, uh,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,460
the 19th century,

3
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,850
it's unclear how long
these 19th century lasted,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,360
whether it lasted from 70
and 89 until 1914 or 1815.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,890
[inaudible] 14.
Right.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,480
But it was a relatively
long century. Uh, and yeah,

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,950
John Stuart Mill was already
20th century, but it, Karl Marx,

8
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:36,750
we get into the middle of it,
right? He was born and, um, 18,

9
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:41,740
18 and died in 83. Uh, um,

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,250
and I tried to find a picture of Mars,
what you may have, may not have seen,

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,590
uh, when he was still a quite a
good looking guy. All right. So,

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,730
um,
a few verses about his family background.

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,180
His father, Carl Heinrich, I don't know,

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,270
Marx himself was born in
1918 in three or Germany.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,500
And his father was Heinrich marks,
uh, who was actually a lawyer,

16
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:12,150
quite a successful lawyer. Uh, but he
was very much a man of enlightenment.

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,720
He liked Voltaire, um, and, uh, uh,

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,250
brought marks up in the spirit
of liberalism and enlightenment,

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,750
Voltaire and Russo and, uh,
uh, John Stuart Mill. Uh,

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,750
these were the guiding lights of the time.

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,090
The paternal grandfather was Mark's Levy.

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,570
It was a red by off three air,

23
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,790
but he died early and before
cavas born. And in fact, a,

24
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,390
his father converted to Lutheranism.
It did not matter much.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,800
He was not really religious. He was a, uh,

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,880
quite secular and Marx. Karl
Marx brought up and, uh,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
uh, uh, a secular family.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,780
So I found you a picture
of cheer in the 19,

29
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,420
early 19th century.
If you look hard,

30
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:04,740
you'll probably see some where
young Karl of walking around,

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
right shopping in the
marketplace of chair,

32
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,060
um, or it is education.
Uh, he attended of course,

33
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,790
high school in Chair,
then 35.

34
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,690
He was admitted to the University of Bonn,
but he a,

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,550
he studied the Greek and
Roman mythology and history.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,740
Um,
uh,

37
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,700
already became involved
in student politics about,

38
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,820
he really was born in born and was
attracted to go to Berlin of each at that

39
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,390
time. His big bet was becoming
a fascinating place. Um,

40
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,280
and uh, he was attending the
lectures. Uh, Bruno Bauer.

41
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,260
Uh, Bruno Bauer was a disciple
of Gower. Cagle, um, uh,

42
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,320
bower belonged to a group of philosophers
who called themselves the young k

43
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,500
galleons.

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
They were the cross of their time and
marsh already wanted to be a radical.

45
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:13,231
He just did not know what kind
of radical he VOB or should be.

46
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,940
Um, in fact, he received his degree
from the University of Vienna.

47
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,630
I think I cracked or that it is joke in
the introductory lecture, they fails,

48
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:24,490
assume bluntly.

49
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,690
It was easier to get a degree
from Vienna then their lien.

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,110
And Mark's was more interested already
in philosophy and radicalism or than

51
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:38,890
legal studies. Uh, but
he got his degree. Hell,

52
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,120
so he his here as Gauher Cagle uh,
uh,

53
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,850
one of the most important philosophers
of the 18th and 19th century.

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,230
Um, um, uh, he was a German philosopher.

55
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,580
Um, and ivy, we'll talk more when
we get into Mark's owner work.

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,500
Uh,

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,500
he basically saw human history as
the unfolding of human consciousness.

58
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,930
Um, and uh, um,

59
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,830
he also characterize the human
condition as in the state of alienation,

60
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,010
um,
in which a subject and object,

61
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,700
we are separated from each other.
These are big words,

62
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,960
you will get comfortable with it as I'm
lecturing and marks because this is very

63
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,410
important for he galleon philosophy.

64
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,830
Also a for Marxism rather distinction
that there is the subject you itself,

65
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:44,701
right who are observing and the object
the others or the material Virg upon

66
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,140
which you are there.

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Flecting that is also another big
word you will learn in the next door.

68
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,030
Three lectures,
the verb of totality.

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,920
Totality means that subject and
object are together in one unity.

70
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,420
There's what is meant to
be a totality. Now, um, uh,

71
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,890
he goes idea of Oz.

72
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:10,891
That subject and object became separated
and the separation of subject from

73
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,363
object,

74
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,410
then there is seen as weird
outside after the subject as a,

75
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,730
a separate object. Uh, um,

76
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,310
that is the state of alienation.
Alien,

77
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:29,311
right to be a stranger danger in the world
because what is around you looks like

78
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,890
strange as different from you,
right?

79
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:37,120
That's what he meant by alienation.
Uh,

80
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,710
but you know,
uh,

81
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,630
human consciousness is increasing
and as consciousness is increasing,

82
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,720
uh, a, you've overcome the separation
of subject and objects. There are,

83
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,430
I'm sure that if is not
clear for the time being,

84
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:55,750
but Vivian laboring ground this in
more detail, uh, with mark sent,

85
00:05:55,751 --> 00:06:00,660
hopefully if you become little more clear,
Bruno Bauer,

86
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,620
he is this charismatic lecturer,

87
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,840
the young Kid Galliano who's lectures
march at 10 did and that is no Marx and

88
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,850
Marxism beside Bruno Bauer do most of
his work is vitriolic criticism of Bruno

89
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,840
Bauer. Uh, well, Marxists
was quite a vitriolic guy.

90
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:25,640
He liked to use over 80 the
language. Okay. Finally.

91
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:30,590
It's very beautiful. The language he's
using. Uh, occasionally, uh, this is, uh,

92
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,550
pretty, uh, our trajene outraging okay.

93
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:39,170
But about Bauer and the left
he galleons. Um, um, uh,

94
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,730
um, as I said, you know, he
kind of, uh, [inaudible], uh,

95
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:48,720
he's a, uh, a Hagar
disciple about, um, uh, um,

96
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,390
he cashed to move beyond
Haig island, offer, um, uh,

97
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,410
critical theory of Hagar and
the he galleon system itself.

98
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,230
Um, uh, these guys, the
young kid galleons, uh,

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:04,930
uh,

100
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,930
bower and his brother and address like
fire buff called themselves the critical

101
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,440
critics.

102
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,630
This is a term which comes
Sapian Mark's work sometimes,

103
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,780
ironically, usually. Why was it so?

104
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,260
Because he got a is seen
in modern philosophy as the
founding father of critical

105
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,533
theory.

106
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,050
You may have heard the word
if you studied philosophy,

107
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:39,890
I'm sure you have heard the word.
What is critical theory?

108
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,511
I could,

109
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:46,511
the essence of critical theory is
that in beliefs that the major task or

110
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:51,951
philosophy to subject human
consciousness to critical scrutiny.

111
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,810
Now there is some discrepancy between
a human consciousness and the human

112
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:01,970
condition,
right?

113
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,030
Our consciousness does not
reflect properly the human
condition and therefore we

114
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:13,271
have to criticize consciousness
and get the right consciousness.

115
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,570
A Val who is actually the
first of critical theories.

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,490
There is some controversy about this
that are some people who actually named

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,410
Emmanuel Kant,

118
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,770
the German philosopher as the first of
critical theorist con to me then very

119
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:35,610
interesting distinction
between uh, uh, uh,

120
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,920
being get andZ and Dinga forsee things
in themselves and things for themselves

121
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,950
and Vernoff important contact
idea of us that all the ideas,

122
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:53,951
what we have in our mind are things for
themselves and they do not to the word

123
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,810
that around us,

124
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,110
the Verdun around us is so rich that
the concepts what we develop cannot

125
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,250
completely fit therefore, in
the act of cognition, right?

126
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,860
When we try to understand something,

127
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,330
these select from the world stuff,
which is important for us.

128
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,360
This is where it thinks for
themselves, right? We select, uh,

129
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,260
in the process of cognition,

130
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,290
of learning from the world
elements but is useful for us.

131
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,780
So I mean in some ways already count
as suggested that there is something

132
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:36,930
problematic with the human consciousness,
right?

133
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,230
We have to subject this human
consciousness to critical
scrutiny and to be over

134
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,940
there that the inner exhausted,

135
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,970
the richness of the world and reality
cannot be ever captured by the human mind.

136
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,700
Now, uh, others do.

137
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,780
Seriously girl Cagle as the real critical
theorist because now the central point

138
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,580
is alienation, right? He in the central
point is that this is a big problem.

139
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,560
And unlike, uh, Kahn who was an agnostic,

140
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,150
he did not think we ever can develop
concepts which capture the world,

141
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,430
right? He got to believe that if
you guys, you learn my philosophy,

142
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:25,280
you there'd be alright, right? Then
you'll all over camelia nation. You've,

143
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,920
you'll get the appropriate consciousness.
Read my worry. That was in, uh, you know,

144
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:34,610
I'm too simplified to a
grade year. So anyway, uh,

145
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,790
he was seen as a kind of,
um, critical theorist.

146
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,950
Now the young kid galleons where the
critiques of the critique, right?

147
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,800
They wanted to apply.
He goes,

148
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:50,430
critical method on Hagers theory.
They said,

149
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,330
why on Earth Georg,
uh,

150
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,550
uncle Darryl or griped believes
that his theory is the right one.

151
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,330
Why don't we subject this system
itself to the same critical scrutiny.

152
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,250
But he goes suggest everything should
be subjected to critical scrutiny.

153
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,940
That is really the
fundamental line of argument,

154
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,630
but greatly influenced Marx.
Marx is in many respects,

155
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,810
a critical critique.
Now,

156
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:26,811
this is another young kid galleon
Ludwig Feuerbach who had another very

157
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:31,400
important impact on the marks.
Uh,

158
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,170
Feuerbach caught his approach.
Naturalism,

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
this is a term but marks the young
Marx also used for a vile to describe

160
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,410
himself.

161
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I think most of you in this room of
would think that Mark's was a materialist

162
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,310
and their venture,

163
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,320
any marks use the term materialism and
more specifically historical materialism

164
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:00,460
to describe what he was doing.
But in his early work,

165
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,050
he was shying away from materialism.
Uh,

166
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,110
and he used the term naturalism and
natural is Maria the meant that you do not

167
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,500
underestimate the important
of consciousness in spirit.

168
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,860
Just in the introduction
with consciousness and
spirit and the nature itself,

169
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,010
you pay more attention to nature.
Now,

170
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:28,900
firebox most important book,
I don't think it is in English.

171
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:33,780
That's the reason the Kristen plume
the essence of Christianity. Um,

172
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,120
he also suggested that
rather than God creating man,

173
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,220
men created the idea of God
and they created the idea
of God is actually not all

174
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:52,900
that far from Grunow bower, just a
more radical position. Right. Um,

175
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,123
um,

176
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,430
because it found that to project
the desperation of alienation,

177
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,720
uh, into the idea of
God. Uh, so I mean, uh,

178
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:06,940
via, uh, um, uh,

179
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:11,830
so to say Bauer was not ready to drew the,
if I may use this term,

180
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:16,831
the ontological conclusions of his
criticism of Hagar Feuerbach vent into

181
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:22,360
ontology, right? Ontology
means the origins of things.

182
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,160
And he believed right, that
in fact, the spiritual,

183
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,190
the is a reflection right,
of humans as such.

184
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:35,080
That's why he called this naturalism
as this thing from idealism.

185
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:35,570
And Vivian,

186
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,570
talk about the distinction
between idealism and
materialism or ideal isn't as an

187
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:42,640
a church naturalism,

188
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,850
which is very important for Marxism and
has been an important distinction in

189
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:52,020
philosophy in the 19th and
earliest strengths. Uh,

190
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,990
20th century. I don't think
in the last, you know,

191
00:13:55,991 --> 00:14:00,160
50 or a hundred years, uh,
that, you know, in philosophy,

192
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:02,710
discuss too much ice though.
I mean,

193
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,740
I don't think it describes a useless
distinction who are idealists and who are

194
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,600
materialists and well Vva.

195
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,860
We'll talk very briefly
about this. Uh, um,

196
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,460
let me just foreshadow,
right? I you know what,

197
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,580
you are an idealist when you think that
the material of word is coming from an

198
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,360
an idea, right? If you
believe that there was a, um,

199
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,470
a transcendental being like God and this
transcendental being by its act of veal

200
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,880
created the word and created humans,
then you add an idealist.

201
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,070
If you believe rather the ideas
are explaining human behavior,

202
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,870
then you add an idealist.

203
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,140
Materialists are the ones who start from
the material conditions and tried to

204
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:57,040
explain the ideas from the
material conditions. Uh,

205
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,620
right.

206
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Fire back mid is a provocative statement
that we invented God rather than God

207
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:08,210
creating us mark schools
further and he will say, well,

208
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:12,920
you have ideas on your head.
I can tell you why you have these ideas.

209
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Then I look at your material
conditions and he will later on say,

210
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,550
when I understand your position in the
class structure and I understand you

211
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:26,360
would economic interest,
then I view,

212
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,870
be able to tell you why you
think the way you think, right?

213
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,910
This is the material is separate or
should I then you explain ideas from the

214
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,620
material conditions that versus
the other way around. Um,

215
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,640
and this comes from, uh, uh, um, uh,

216
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,930
Feuerbach Feuerbach inspiration,
right?

217
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:51,931
So you bring together are the critical
theory of Hagar and a young kid galleons

218
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:57,170
radical critique, critical theory
and natural isn't, uh, for,

219
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,990
uh, Feuerbach eventually pushing it
further and say, let's not fool that out.

220
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:06,530
And it, it is, material is more,
right. Okay. Now what about,

221
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,810
let's continue with the lifer. Um, 42, uh,

222
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:16,811
he moves to colonia the city of
Catalonia and becomes a journalist for

223
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,200
[inaudible] side to him.

224
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,220
Eventually even becomes
the editor of this journal.

225
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,530
And what he's writing is
just liberal journalism.

226
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,240
He's not a radical yet, is
a bourgeois liberal. Uh,

227
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,550
he is writing articles about,
you know,

228
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:38,720
the freedom of the press
and civil liberties.

229
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,070
He's writing staffer about to John
Stuart Mill would not object to at all.

230
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,150
Right. And then 43, he marries a,

231
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,160
I again, correct this joke
before, after a long engagements,

232
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,150
uh, Yanni phone invest Farlane
who comes from, uh, uh,

233
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,050
uh, uh, you know, a normal family,

234
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:07,940
a very high class family,
not, not Jewish family,

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,110
a high class family here. Here
is the picture of, of them.

236
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:15,170
Too many. It was going fast, right?

237
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,470
Um, uh, he was running into some,

238
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,860
uh, uh, political troubles very soon. Uh,

239
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,880
now the veal very quickly see some
extra ordinary years in March,

240
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,440
intellectual development, 1843, 44,

241
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,120
45,
just three years is quite extra ordinary.

242
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,120
What is happening in Mark's mind
and how far he goes or that in 43,

243
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,040
he is beginning to some very
important pieces of work.

244
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,340
I've, you're talking about them in a
minute. [inaudible] get to Mark's work,

245
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,510
Bonnie Scott,

246
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,690
our contribution to the critique of
Hegel's philosophy of the state or fit a

247
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,240
fit,

248
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,980
he goes philosophy of law or
writes it translated differently.

249
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,850
Um,

250
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,850
and then he's writing a very provocative
essay on the Jewish question in which

251
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:20,400
he beginning to distinguish himself
from the young key galleons, uh,

252
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,240
was of the speed of bcs,
especially on the Jewish question,

253
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,540
are an unacceptable to the German
police and political establishment.

254
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,380
So he had to leave Germany and he escapes
and he moves Sperry's and here it is

255
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,090
totaled. He Arriva No,
that's where he lived.

256
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,390
And that's where Marc Serota and his
extra ordinary unpublished manuscript for

257
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:54,270
this God,
the Paris manuscript of 1844 what form,

258
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,160
which you have read something.

259
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,490
And some of them are the jewel
pieces of social science literature.

260
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,800
Some of them is impenetrable,

261
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,980
but some of them is quite penetrable
and still blows people's mind.

262
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,930
Okay. 1844 in Paris. He, um, uh,

263
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
abandoned this book,
the critique of Hagar,

264
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,980
but he wrote an introduction, and
I will talk about this later. Uh,

265
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,280
this in many ways is quite an
extraordinary piece of work.

266
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,330
It's a wonderful piece of poor poetry.
Um,

267
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,820
and he sort of beginning
to lay out his philosophy.

268
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,280
And then in the summer of 44,
he completes a high heel,

269
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:45,000
not doesn't complete. He abandons
the Paris manuscripts. Um,

270
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,540
and for good reasons, and we
will talk about this, why, uh,

271
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,950
he never published it and never
finished it though. I mean,

272
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,090
it is quite,

273
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:58,080
quite a brilliant piece
and he needs a young man,

274
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,550
Reddick angles. Um, uh,

275
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,570
just 24 years of age and became lifelong
friends and they beginning to work

276
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:11,190
together. They are writing
this book, the Holy Family.

277
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,190
I strongly recommend you do not read it.

278
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,150
I have read it a number of
times and suffered a lot,

279
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,910
so I want to save you from suffering.

280
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,550
But there are some very important things
in the holiday family. Just uh, uh,

281
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:29,850
the price you have to pay to
find the jaw is very high.

282
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,440
Okay. Uh, and then they write
many other things together. Uh,

283
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,170
the communist manifesto, the, they ride
together, the German ideology, they,

284
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,750
they ride together and many other things.

285
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,140
Mangoes wasn't brilliant
mind. Uh, in fact,

286
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:50,470
he was a much more clearer
analytic mind then. Karl Marx,

287
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,740
and he had had a much better sense
of empirical reality than March.

288
00:20:55,931 --> 00:21:00,700
March was a bit of an abstract guy,
but Marx was really the genius,

289
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:05,250
right? Um, uh, Fredrick Kango swells
just a kind of year professor, you know,

290
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:09,230
that Karl Marx was a sort
of fact genius. Really, uh,

291
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,950
45. Well, uh, even in Paris, the on,

292
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,700
on bare above what they are doing.

293
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:20,080
So they kicked out from Paris
and then they go to Brussels.

294
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,970
And here his angles when they met, uh, uh,

295
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,440
uh, there is, uh, you continue
to work a big change in,

296
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,120
in 1945,

297
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:36,121
there is some people say
the epistemological break
until 45 until the Paris

298
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:41,050
manuscript, uh, uh, marks is
still in some ways I hear galleon.

299
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,333
Um,
uh,

300
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,370
now he's changing and he's becoming a
list and he coins the term historical

301
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:53,260
materialism to describe his, uh, position.

302
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,480
One important piece is that exists on
a foyer bar. I make you to read that.

303
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:03,400
I think it is a fantastic piece of
work, yet again, did not publish it.

304
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:06,910
And I will explain to you
why though it is brilliant,

305
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:09,700
why he shied away and did not publish it.

306
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,520
It's intention with the main message
about he tries to get through. Um,

307
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,670
and then 45,

308
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,820
five 46 together with angles they right
again and other unfinished manuscript

309
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,100
which was published only in 1904,
uh,

310
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,720
and even in 1904, only partially, um,

311
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,060
the German ideology. Um, and again, uh,

312
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:39,061
there are some extra ordinary pieces in
this incomplete manuscripts then comes

313
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:42,850
to year of revolutions.
February 22,

314
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:44,740
24 and 48,

315
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,950
a violent revolution in France.

316
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,670
They sit down with angles and Viseon Ivy,

317
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,580
they write the manifesto
of the Communist Party.

318
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,730
They just tell about the revolution
should be doing. Uh, well this is enough.

319
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,573
Bam flat,

320
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,770
a pamphlet with a lot of
disturbing statements,

321
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,610
but the pamphlet with
some very insightful,

322
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,030
very important social analysis as well.
Uh,

323
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,680
a piece of work which cannot
be ignored if can be hated.

324
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,600
Uh, it was loved by many,
but usually now it is hated.

325
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
But even if he hate you,
hate it or love it,

326
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,310
you better read it and you pay
attention to some of the very important

327
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:34,120
statements. And what is extra ordinary?
This is a pretty long manuscript.

328
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,230
They've were writing like crazy.
I mean I think I'm a fast writer,

329
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:41,980
but I could not do it in a week. Um, uh,

330
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,070
reasonably polic punish a polished,

331
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,200
especially in comparison
with these other very,

332
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,710
now he's expat from grasses,

333
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:56,450
but he moves to the evolutionary Paris
right on march the fifth or ready bud.

334
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,070
That evolution continues.

335
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,150
Mazda thirteens Vianna
is in fire, right? Uh,

336
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,970
but you have to wait on it to two days
and Budapest in Hungary is in fire.

337
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,860
The revolution is spreading all
over in Europe. March eight,

338
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,220
18, it's already in Berlin bows, Vienna,

339
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,050
Budapest, Berlin, whole Europe is in via,

340
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,170
this is exactly what Max was saying.
He'd will be happening.

341
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,960
Why there it is happening indeed.

342
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,380
So Maurice and Angus returned to Germany.

343
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,030
Now they will carry out the
torch of that evolution.

344
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,470
Now he doesn't class for,

345
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,770
that's a picture of backbeat shirt of
some of the revolution in bat is what's

346
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:47,540
quite a bloody event. Uh, and
here is a communist manifesto,

347
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,650
the first edition and a February,

348
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,540
1848 when it was printed heart
and distributed widely. Now,

349
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,310
you know, when evolution doesn't
last too long, in October 48, uh,

350
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:04,590
Austria carries out a contract evolution.
Uh,

351
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:08,960
they are pressed that evolution in
Hungary. Um, November the eight,

352
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,920
there is a controlled evolutionary cool,
uh,

353
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,430
in Prussia that evolution
is a, uh, depressed.

354
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,260
And then December, 1848, they are,

355
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,580
this is not a violent country revolution,

356
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,590
but the French go and vote on elections.

357
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,980
And the elected guy whose name is Louis
Napoleon Bonaparte after as president of

358
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:38,510
France,
it was a very stupid way to vote.

359
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Uh, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,
whatever was the nephew of not,

360
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,620
not pull down. Uh, uh,

361
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:49,880
his father was Napoleon's brother,
younger brother,

362
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,260
and he was the king.

363
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,360
He was meet King of the Netherlands
until of course, Napoleon fail.

364
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,800
And he was out sitting, uh,
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, um,

365
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,980
uh,
grew up in Switzerland in exile a,

366
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,580
it was not particularly
smart person, um, uh,

367
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,720
and cause a lot of trouble in France.

368
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,850
Now here he is when he was president,
later on he became right.

369
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,650
Um, uh, uh, emperor of France,

370
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,640
not Polandra hundred cured.

371
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,900
He renamed himself and kept
causing trouble. Yeah. Um,

372
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,680
now, uh, remarks, uh,

373
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,690
returned to Paris briefly and
was hoping, you know, the French,

374
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,660
eventually you will come to
their senses and oversee over,

375
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
through this jerk.
Now,

376
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,320
the French did not come to
them that Sam says, right? Uh,

377
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:54,030
it looks like the French occasionally
do, do, do silly political things.

378
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:59,020
Slide the Jacobins electing
Gooey, uh, uh, not,

379
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,610
uh, not, uh, Napoleon Bonaparte.
It was not a smart thing,

380
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,590
but you know that for they have to move
to London and that's where he published,

381
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,230
spends the rest of his life.
This is about,

382
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:13,920
he has another go at the
big book he wants to write.

383
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,790
It is called the ground
Resa. And Ivy, I'll ask you,

384
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,250
which will be a little
sweating to lead it. Uh,

385
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,860
but I Braum is,

386
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:27,210
I ask you to read the most readable
part of their going to sir.

387
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,930
So if you will have troubles
reading what I asked you to read,

388
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,560
remember the rest would be
much, much worse, right?

389
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,770
So you have to enjoy right reading it.

390
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,960
I think I asked you to do the to read
is extremely important to understand who

391
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,790
the real mark says,
right?

392
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:50,030
There are many faces of Karl Marx and
one of one article most clearly in

393
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:52,830
different on this.
Then he has finally the book,

394
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,980
but he overs wanted to do
the scrappy tab in 1867 a.

395
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:02,070
Then there is another revolution
in France said the commune,

396
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:04,680
and this is a real proletarian revolution.

397
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,050
They're very much following what Marx
and Engels wrote in the communist

398
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:15,051
manifesto that are a few instances
in history when two people can claim,

399
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:19,800
we wrote it down and hear the masters
put it into action. They did it in,

400
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,890
in France and then order the NCC for
marks created a political organization,

401
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:31,200
what he called international
international diverse organization.

402
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:36,330
Eventually we refer to this as the first
international with a Russian anarchist

403
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,540
whose name is Bakunin a 70 Vonda is this
proletarian revolution inspired by the

404
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:47,850
communist manifesto. They proclaim
our communal, uh, in Paris.

405
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:52,851
It's not all that different from
Soviet Russia or malware is China.

406
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,340
The same ideas does not last too long,
right?

407
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,950
In two weeks it is suppressed
and overthrown. Um,

408
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,550
and uh, Mark's dissolves
the international, uh,

409
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,390
that is a big fight between
Bakunin and Marx. Uh,

410
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:13,530
I think in this big fight mark Bakunin
who is actually not very smart,

411
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,640
but in the,

412
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,640
I think in the debate Baconian is quite
right about Mark's statism or too much

413
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:26,121
believe in Marx about the government
should do and Baconian is bottom up,

414
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,630
right? Uh, Baconian is an anarchist.

415
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,340
He believes in the ordinary people and
he wants to get read of the State rather

416
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:39,200
than doing stop by the
state. Uh, anyway, they,

417
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,500
they solved the first international.
Now Betty,

418
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,230
the defeat of Paris commune
was a very ugly affair. Uh,

419
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,980
people who were mass murdered, we,
south tria not very nice stuff.

420
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,650
Do, I mean the Paris
commune, of course, you know,

421
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,160
if you're as the anarchy staff saying
now if you want to have scrambled eggs,

422
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,340
you have to break a
couple of eggs, right? Uh,

423
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,250
so if you have a revolution,
occasionally you shoot. All right, well,

424
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,980
it was shooting on the canoe.

425
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,800
There was a lot of shooting
after the you right. Uh,

426
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,000
well after the commune, uh, uh, we
have a conservative epoch in Europe.

427
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,020
Um, Bismarck in Germany, right?

428
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,300
The iron chancellor,
Queen Victoria, right?

429
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,570
Uh,
uh,

430
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,760
ethical conservative is a Kaiser
France Joseph for the Blue Down Hole,

431
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,570
right? So operetta uh,

432
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,710
but very conservative guy.

433
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,060
I have so many nice anecdotes about him.

434
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:54,061
Too bad the course doesn't last two
semesters because I could entertain UBIT,

435
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,840
create stories about Kaiser Franz Joseph,

436
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,930
uh, big trouble. The Guy,

437
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:06,931
he primarily because the first world
war out of completely stupid action and

438
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,380
caused the deaths of millions of people,
uh,

439
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,420
in a bloody terribles cupid's war.

440
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,440
Well about that is no room in this
conservative time to revolution, right?

441
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,860
The Revolutionary Marxism,
Marx dies in desperation.

442
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,200
Actually,
if you read the later very,

443
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:30,240
his mind is gradually
disintegrating. Yeah. Um,

444
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,450
and he's buried together. We, Jenny, uh,

445
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,570
in London Highgate cemetery,
uh,

446
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,420
you probable it. It was just, um,

447
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,490
be some New York review of
books on Highgate cemetery.

448
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:48,370
Also names the Tom of Karl Marx.

449
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:52,480
We stands that and Marxist
goal now at postscript to the,

450
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,050
then all the create a second
international, uh, after his desk, uh,

451
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,430
and NGOs created it,

452
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,110
it eventually became what we call
a social democratic international.

453
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,730
It's still exist.

454
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Social Democratic parties occasionally
meet on an international meeting for that

455
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:15,280
via vendor.

456
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:20,281
Democratic Corp Bharthi was
a kind of Gfk Liberal Party.

457
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:25,890
Even the American Democratic Party sent
observers to the second international

458
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,960
meetings,
right.

459
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,090
Bobby Kennedy was a kind of very
sympathetic to second international.

460
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,100
We're kind of considering,
should not the Democratic Party join,

461
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,940
right? The social democratic
international movement, 1917,

462
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:47,570
that is a communist
revolution in Russia and 1919,

463
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:51,680
they say second international.
This really sucks.

464
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,790
This is not about revolution.
This is about reform.

465
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
We need a real revolutionary organization.

466
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,780
They create the third international
communist international,

467
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,150
which lasts until the Second World War.

468
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Then Russia and the Soviet Russia needs
the help of the United States to defeat

469
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,530
militarily, Germany. And the US said, all
right, but you dissolve the international.

470
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,710
So they did this, solve
the international, uh,

471
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:21,020
that is actually a force international.

472
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,290
I don't have time usually to talk about
this created by their own Trotsky or,

473
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,710
right. So that's about the life of a, um,

474
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,380
one of our major author Karl Marx.

475
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,830
And let me go on and talk
about his theory of alienation.

476
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:43,550
And I have my goodness,
12 minutes to do that though.

477
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:46,490
I could spend,
uh,

478
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,920
in fact the semester on
this, uh, uh, hell no.

479
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:56,921
But let me try to economize with my
time and I just very briefly run through

480
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:57,884
what is,

481
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:02,630
what is leading to the Paris manuscript
and the theory of alienation.

482
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,410
And I really have to talk
about alienation. So I,

483
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:09,260
you'll skip a lot of stuff
leading to the alienation.

484
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,060
So I said he got is the point of
departure for Marcy, theory of alienation,

485
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,710
but there is a kind of intellectual
project for the young Marx.

486
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,610
Um, as I said, he writes,
tries to write this book.

487
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:28,390
He goes a critique of Hegel's
philosophy of write this book.

488
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:32,480
He got suggested that there is a,
a,

489
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:36,530
the CVS store servants
constitute a universal class.

490
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:41,531
It is a critique of the French revolution
and the bourgeois society in which

491
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:46,811
Hagle felt the workers and the
capitalists are in athletics.

492
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,060
That's representing
particularistic interest and
order can be brought into this

493
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:54,710
only by civil servants,

494
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:58,610
by the government who represents
the universe of point of view.

495
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,540
And Mark's criticized is this a book?
Uh,

496
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:06,490
then he writes on the Jewish
question that he said, well,

497
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,400
the state bureaucrats are not universal,

498
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,550
but we need a universal standpoint. We
need universal [inaudible] emancipation.

499
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,450
Uh, as such, that's the point of view.
Then he writes this wonderful piece,

500
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,230
introduction to the critical figures
philosophy of ride. And he said,

501
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,580
but Julio Curry how this, uh, uh, in,
uh, you know, universal point of view.

502
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:33,260
And it is the introduction for
the first time in 44 January.

503
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,250
And he said the proletariat, but
people say, lie the proletariat.

504
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,350
Goodness Gracious.
That's when the manuscript comes here.

505
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,150
You said to put all that Talia because
the proletariat is the ultimate of

506
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:48,330
alienation and because they are alienated,

507
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:52,500
they have the interest to
overcome Eliana nation. Well,

508
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:57,501
I think I just have true Rushall
IBM put this stuff on the

509
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Internet, but I really don't
have time to get into any detail.

510
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:06,510
I want to get,
uh,

511
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,370
in the last few minutes into the Paris
manuscripts and this is the structure of

512
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:16,260
the Paris manuscripted of 1844. You
can see the line of argument, right?

513
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:20,730
How he's developing, right.
Um, uh, his, his argument,

514
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,080
um,

515
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,880
what is really interesting from the
parish manuscript is the first manuscript,

516
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,900
which is 27 pages. It
is on wages, profits,

517
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:35,490
and rant and culminates
with the idea of alienation.

518
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,810
Uh,
again,

519
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:41,430
unfortunately I don't have more
time to work more on a, on a,

520
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,000
um, uh, um, uh, especially, uh,

521
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,430
section four is crucially important.
Now,

522
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:51,560
the second and the third
manuscripts, uh, uh,

523
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,130
are of lesser important.
Now the major teams,

524
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,270
they, each profit and renter
and private ownership,

525
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:05,271
they all culminate in alienation
is a reinterpretation of Hagle.

526
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,840
Uh,
alienation does not come from ideas.

527
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,870
It comes out of material conditions
of the nature of capitalist economy.

528
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,170
And as I said,
he does not have the notion of capitalism.

529
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,380
It comes out of the nature of
commodity producing commercial society,

530
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,890
right? That's where alienation
is coming from rather than ideas.

531
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:33,720
And the problem can only be solved
if you fix the problems of commodity

532
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,280
producing societies.

533
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,080
And then he identifies four
characteristics of alienation.

534
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,630
And I've even talked to this,
uh,

535
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,500
wrong alienation is from
the object of production.

536
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,100
The second is the alienation from the
act of production than any other nation.

537
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:57,210
From species being,
again, a very big word,

538
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:02,400
God trumps reason in German.
Uh, what, what makes us human?

539
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,580
What makes us distinct from animals?

540
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,730
That's what the notion
species being refers to.

541
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,750
And finally alienation from fellow man.
Well,

542
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:17,550
I have seven minutes to Labor on
this. Let me do that. Um, okay.

543
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,990
Um, cause I said he
reinterprets he goes alienation.

544
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,880
Uh, he got, wanted to overcome
alienation in thought. Um,

545
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,110
uh, alienation was a problem
of the state of consciousness.

546
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,250
Mark's wants to ground the theory
in material practices. Right?

547
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,640
Um, uh, and uh, then, uh,

548
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,920
and merge you said Ed alienation
when Labor is becoming a commodity,

549
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,700
right? Uh, uh, uh, uh, and
uh, uh, [inaudible], uh,

550
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,000
profit drive.

551
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:56,470
So he come on me that span to be
enter the stage of alienation.

552
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,760
Um, uh, and the, uh, private
property emerges. Well,

553
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:06,761
I just leave this section out and let me
speak to the four dimensions of Neisha

554
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,130
and the next six or seven minutes.

555
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,600
So the first point is that is um,
you know,

556
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:19,490
we are talking about commodity producing
commercial society is to put it with

557
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:22,080
Adam Smash. All right. Uh,

558
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,100
or Marksville call it later on.

559
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:27,710
If you take him one more
year to figure it out.

560
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,460
What is really the nature of
the society is talking about,

561
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:37,210
about already in the German ideology
as we voc it Tuesday or a Thursday,

562
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,340
he coins the term the
capitalist mode of production.

563
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,820
So in the capitalist mode of production
in a commodity producing society,

564
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,150
um, the, the object which leads,

565
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,780
produces labors product conference,

566
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,230
the Vickers as something alien,
uh,

567
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:05,000
from him as a bower Elian of the producer,
right?

568
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,010
Under these conditions,

569
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:12,011
this realization of labor appears as the
loss of realization of the very care in

570
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:17,930
sharp contrast with petty
commodity production.

571
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,930
The work of the Artism that diverse,

572
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:23,630
what you produced is
part of your own life.

573
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,260
You identify with the part
what you produce, right?

574
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,400
You are a shoemaker, you are
producing a beautiful shoe, right?

575
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,350
You are proud of the shoe.

576
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:38,590
You go to the church Sunday and you saw
a nice lady walking in this beautiful

577
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:42,920
shoes and you proudly say,
this is my shoe, right?

578
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,490
Then you are not alienated,
right?

579
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:51,380
When you are working on the production
line and you are mass producing, uh,

580
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,530
you know, uh, Toyota Camry, ah,

581
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:59,120
you don't know what you produce shite.
It's an alien object from you.

582
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,400
You put a little bit of worry,

583
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:06,320
cried into the product and the
product is not you any longer.

584
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,310
It is something which is alien from you.
Um,

585
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,070
well, uh, of course not all of our work is
national story. Aliana ate it. You know,

586
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:19,790
if you are an RF,
just if you are a scholar,

587
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,290
you identify the right can you
have copyright for the verdict,

588
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:29,160
what you produce. But ordinary workers
usually do not have copyrights,

589
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,910
you know,
they cannot license.

590
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,040
They're very well Dave told you
was it becomes alien from them.

591
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,450
That's the point or the product.

592
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,730
Well then you are also becoming area
and in the act of production is that

593
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:45,500
because Labor is external to the
work at our different points in this,

594
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,120
right? External of were
Kelly does not belong to him.

595
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,230
His intrinsic nature in his work,

596
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,480
he does not affirm himself
but denies himself,

597
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,420
does not really develop
itself. You know, you say,

598
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,100
well that's already uh,
four 45,

599
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:10,880
I have only 15 more minutes to
go and then I am free. Right?

600
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,450
Life begins when work ends.
Right. You can see it,

601
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:20,330
you go to the supermarket and the
cashier hardly needs, you know,

602
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:24,920
to get out of here. I was trying to buy,
uh, last night, you know, a little beer,

603
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:29,870
you know, and it was eight 45.
And the cashier said, sorry,
I cannot sell it to you.

604
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:32,990
I said, why not? I till nine
o'clock. He said he's ninth, nine.

605
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:36,200
Yet she wanted to get out of there.
Right?

606
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,040
So it's alienated from the
process of production, right?

607
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,870
And Labor is not all on 30,
but for us, right? Well for us,

608
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,990
not legally you can starve,
right?

609
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,290
But if you don't want to strong
and you want to have a place,

610
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,220
a roof over your head, you have to
work. So it is forced economically.

611
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,530
So it is not one. It is. Here
is the right. Um, uh, uh,

612
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,120
and uh, you were activity
belonged to somebody else.
It's somebody else, you know,

613
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,790
go mass you who is the boss who tells
you what to do and then you shut up.

614
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,370
Right? Uh, and this is why, you know,

615
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,800
in the act of production
you have Eliana nature.

616
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,110
The third one is that you are alienated
from new species being off your human

617
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:21,944
being.

618
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,100
And now Marx has a teary of man in nature.

619
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,660
What is man?
And they in natural conditions,

620
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:38,050
what makes us man as distinct from animal
that are very different answers you

621
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:42,560
can give. Uh, well, uh,

622
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,570
Sheeler the German poet said,

623
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,370
what makes us humans that the
mo how to play. All right,

624
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,000
pray makes us human.
Mark said,

625
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,130
what makes us human that via Varick labor,

626
00:43:56,131 --> 00:44:00,890
that the transform the material
work to meet our human needs,

627
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,060
a plan in our head,
that's what makes us humans.

628
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,980
There are animals which kind of
work like bs, but they don't work.

629
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,670
Vieta plan it.

630
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,860
There are only humans who have an
idea of what my house, meal Beal.

631
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,670
And then you build a house
as you had the idea about it.

632
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,150
That is the essence of human beings.
And he said,

633
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:27,710
the problem is that we in a
commodity producing society,

634
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:31,620
VR alienated from Labor
but makes us human.

635
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,400
So we are alienated from
our very human essence.

636
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,700
That's the most horrifying thing for
marks in a commodity producing society.

637
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,680
Right? Uh, and then finally the
odd alienated from our fellow man.

638
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,580
This is probably the deepest, um, uh,

639
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:54,240
idea in the whole theory, right? Uh,

640
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,100
namely that we are beginning
to treat each others as object,

641
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:03,990
right? As we are entering the
world of commodity production,

642
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,150
profit maximization,
self interested individuals,

643
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:11,970
right? Maximizing utility, right?

644
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,420
And thinking instrumentalist
around the world, right?

645
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,200
What are the most less expensive means,

646
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:24,201
which gets us the cheapest to this end
than the beginning to treat each others

647
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,160
as instrument right?

648
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:31,620
Now he said this is the versed
alienation, which is new, right? It has,

649
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,610
this is very important to see
in marsh theory of alienation.

650
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,410
It's not a general condition of
humankind as Hagar thought it.

651
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,690
Alienation is emerging in modernity.

652
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,760
He does not have the term capitalism yet,
or the capitalist mode of production.

653
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:52,761
This is the characteristics of modernity
and modern industrial and urban life

654
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,600
that we are not interacting
with each other as human beings,

655
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:03,240
right?
In an all sided personal relationships,

656
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,020
but we tend to treat each
others as objects, right?

657
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,510
Between the other person
as a sex object, right? Uh,

658
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,520
the erotic complex relationship
is reduced to a brutal act of sex,

659
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,223
right?

660
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,180
We treat each other as an
instrument to reach an end, right?

661
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,100
The call, the others only then they
need that person for something.

662
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:29,963
Right?

663
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,070
The act out of simply self interest
in interacting with the others,

664
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,110
the lack compassion that we lack
love. Right. The lack sympathy. Right.

665
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:45,240
We seem, you know, he probably
did not read his Adam Smith's
care of fully enough,

666
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,990
right? It has not been
reading Mark Smith until 44.

667
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:53,580
This is where he's beginning to reach
Smith's very carefully around this time in

668
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:58,500
44 [inaudible] you see the point that
he's making and I think what Mark's

669
00:46:58,501 --> 00:47:00,050
describes in alienation,

670
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:05,060
particularly alienation from fellow human
being is something that probably some

671
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:10,680
people in this room can respond
to and to say, well, yes,

672
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,120
I did experience that.

673
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,220
I have been treated right as an object
when I go to the admission office

674
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,580
occasionally. Right? Um,

675
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,210
an administrator like treats me like
a piece of work that a piece of paper,

676
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:27,240
right? That's when you
are alienated, right?

677
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,850
Then you becoming an abstract
that than a human being.

678
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,430
So that's in a nutshell,

679
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:37,030
the theory of alienation that has
to be will be up on the Internet,

680
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:41,230
and you may want to dig into the
whole intellectual development,

681
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,440
which brings you to the beak of
what he called the young Marx.

682
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,471
Marx.

683
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:52,471
The he galleon marks who is not a
material is less yet not a historic on

684
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,650
materials.
He does not have the idea of exploitation.

685
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,810
It does not have the idea of the
capitalist model reduction yet.

686
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,590
All right.
