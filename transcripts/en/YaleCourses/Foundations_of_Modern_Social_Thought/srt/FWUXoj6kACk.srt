1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,920
Now, uh, uh, also I would like
to spend a couple of minutes, uh,

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,810
kind of wrapping up some,
uh, issues, uh, about, uh,

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,770
the four orders of what we
covered in that test, right? Uh,

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,550
Mark Snitcher Fried and labor.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,223
Um,
uh,

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,230
just to help you to get that overall sense
right for the bottom line is and what

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,570
the similarities and differences are.
And then I go into Max Faber.

8
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:37,080
There is a lot dive on to cover today.
Would love to talk a lot about his life.

9
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,970
I won't have time.
Uh,

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,770
I could give you a lot of my
stem juicy stories, what I have,

11
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:48,060
but I, I unfortunately I,
I have to be told myself.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,460
Ah, okay. So the four alters, um,

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,440
that is one important common
feature in all four quarters.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,180
And some of these things from
the theorist we studied so far,

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,320
uh,

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,320
in one way or another or four of
them can be called critical theorist.

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,860
That means they are offer critical
analysis of what is in your mind.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,520
They say what is in your mind is not
necessarily what you think it is.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,620
Less subjects,
your consciousness to critical scrutiny.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,930
I think all four do share these argument,

21
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,580
right? Um, mark,

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,800
certainly even the idea that,
well,

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,220
the dominant ideas of each ebook
are the ideas of the dominant class.

24
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,760
Um, and therefore you think what
is in your mind is your idea.

25
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,800
They tell me what your class position is
and diabetes tell you value your ideas

26
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,170
are coming from right. Uh, now, uh,

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,800
uh, uh, this is an hs project
and he said, well, you sing,

28
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,800
this is mortality.
I will show the immorality of morality.

29
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,220
What you think is more, right. Uh,

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,880
this is certainly fried you thing.
This is your ideas.

31
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,380
Well,

32
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,730
they all my couch and I
talked to me and I will,

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,020
you have,

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,020
you'll recall all these early sexual
experiences in your life and then you will

35
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:39,240
realize, uh, what, who
you really are. Well,

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,360
you know, um, vapor is a little
more complicated, but uh,

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,440
he also has this idea of legitimacy
and domination with some later Marxists

38
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,270
speak on this.

39
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,810
And the fundamental idea of vapor is
coming also from nature in the fundamental

40
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,140
idea is that we actually do internalize
the very principles of our submission.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,170
That's what legitimacy,

42
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:13,171
at least in my interpretation
in Vba is that his domination,

43
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,040
right? And therefore vapor is
also helps you to understand,

44
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,070
right where these ideas are coming from
and to what extent you yourself are you

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,490
own jail keeper,
right?

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,880
As sort of mine a little
postmodernist reading of Max Faber.

47
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:34,930
Um,

48
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,640
so these are this in this way they are
or critical theory stride the architects,

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,340
the architects of consciousness,

50
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,160
but there are fundamental
differences between the four authors.

51
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,910
Um, and in some ways, uh,

52
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,050
there is a similarity between marks
and fried Marx and Freud all thick.

53
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,430
They're point of departure
in their project to be
critical of consciousness for

54
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:07,660
sensors, human experience, right?

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,820
Material or reality in one way or another.

56
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:17,240
They are both materialists, right? Um,

57
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,360
of course four marks.

58
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,870
It is reductionist because the sensors,

59
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:26,350
human experience is
reduced to the economy.

60
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,483
Uh,

61
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,930
you tell me about your position
in the economic system are then,

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,780
I understand when you have
economic interests, Trad,

63
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,700
you are behaving and you are thinking
according to your economic interest and

64
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:46,290
then ivy law, understand what is
on your mind. Now, by the way,

65
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,270
it's not all that different,
right?

66
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:51,450
From Adam Smith's and rationally actor,

67
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,430
rationally acting individuals.
Maurice has some similarities.

68
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,140
All the offers it critically by
Adam Smith's Fr the affirmatively.

69
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,940
But that is Mark's reductionism,
that what is sensors like?

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,690
Experience is reduced to the economy.

71
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,030
And then he also has an
agency that's the big, uh,

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,330
uh,
unique feature of Marx theory.

73
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,480
He knows what will society is,

74
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,820
does not describe in much detail,

75
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,880
but has an idea about good society.

76
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,590
And he knows who the historical agent is,
will be lead us there.

77
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,151
I mean,

78
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:37,890
many of you were probably turned
off by his vision of the future,

79
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,140
but the strengths of the theories that
he has a vision of good society and he

80
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,910
knows how to get there.

81
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,150
So those of you who are
looking for answers,

82
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,230
Karl Marx does have answers for you right

83
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,040
now. Uh, uh, uh,

84
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,960
what about, uh, uh, uh, uh, fried?

85
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,780
He does not quite have
answers to you, right? Man,

86
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,480
you want to on his couch, right? Uh,

87
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,210
he helps you to discover the rep fest,

88
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,730
these jars in yourself,

89
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,930
and then it will help you to
get rid of your depression,

90
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,030
anxieties, hysteria or whatever
you are suffering from.

91
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,080
Right. But it, there'll
be up to you right,

92
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,140
to somehow figuring out what is for the
oppressed and we only will help you to

93
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,730
find it.
Right.

94
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,300
And does he have a very
clearly defined good society?

95
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,260
He has sort of ambiguous
attitudes about this, right?

96
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,370
A CV [inaudible] modern civilization.

97
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,050
Well this is coming from repression.

98
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,020
CBLI physician has a lot to do,

99
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,940
how people are being controlled.
On the other hand,

100
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:09,110
he knows out of the Ed,
a lot of nasty,

101
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:12,710
aggressive stuff is coming from
and they have to be wrapped breast.

102
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,970
So he has a kind of ambiguous,
our attitude.

103
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,480
He does not want to go
against civilization,

104
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,710
but he sees the dark side of
civilization at the same time.

105
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,110
Now what these common uh, in, uh, um, uh,

106
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,320
nature and vapor that they
all depart from this idea,

107
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,870
right? Uh, that it is sensors,

108
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:43,010
experiences from which you
have to understand, right?

109
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,840
What's wrong with your consciousness?
There.

110
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,720
Central concern is power,
right?

111
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,390
Power and domination.

112
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,650
It is not the economy,

113
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,580
it is not sexuality.
It is power.

114
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,390
And interestingly,
in some ways,

115
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:10,160
therefore they've probably
reach back all the way to hops,

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,073
right?

117
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,780
That all history of human candy
struggle around Bowel Hour.

118
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,690
Now this is the most radical he done
by nature because what Nicha is doing

119
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:24,981
right?

120
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:29,600
He shows you how the most to noble ideas,

121
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,840
but you have in your mind
are actually manufacturer,

122
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,320
right in the workshop of ideals,
in very mass.

123
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,940
You Vase by course shern right?
Uh,

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
by torture and he shows you
this instrument of growers.

125
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,790
Um, uh, if the, he's
sturdy of, uh, uh, the,

126
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,800
the Museum of Historical Museum of
Marx is filled up with the means of

127
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:03,360
production.
You go into a museum,

128
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,730
you can see the life,
right? How people lived,

129
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,240
what that house was, but the instruments
where they produce their livelihood.

130
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,620
You'll see this, a lot of contemporary
museums, which are not Marxists,

131
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:21,621
but still inspired by these
Marxian idea niches museum there.

132
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,770
Well, you'll feel fine.
Guillotines right? Be,

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,090
you'll find all these
instrument of torture.

134
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,000
That's human history. The
history of torture. And that's,

135
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:40,001
that is an interesting similarity
between a Viber and nature,

136
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,650
namely, that the history
of humankind is evolution.

137
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:50,010
But this evolution has its downside.

138
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,330
Our bodies may not be tortured
any longer in modern civilization,

139
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,710
but our souls are kept hostage.

140
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,010
That's the bad news right now. Uh,

141
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,880
uh,
I think that's in a nutshell,

142
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,890
I think the kind of similarities and
differences of the four [inaudible] we

143
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,200
covered for these tests.

144
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,260
And I don't think I have
more time to deal with this.

145
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,570
So let's now go to Max Faber.
Um,

146
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,760
and I am actually very sensitive.
Somebody asked a question, a veteran, um,

147
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,610
uh, the, uh, uh, on, on, on the
desk, the question on domination,

148
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,470
should it be the Ivr be thinking
very hard about this. In fact,

149
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:44,030
if you still have a very
much disliked questions,

150
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:48,990
send me an email and by will try to
take this into consideration. Okay.

151
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:51,360
So this is Max Faber,
uh,

152
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:56,361
born in 1864 and died in a 19 or 20.

153
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,920
Um, uh, well nowadays with flu shots,

154
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,040
he would not have died.
He just died of pneumonia.

155
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,790
It probably would have lived longer.
Fortunately,

156
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,680
he did not because he
did not leave Nazi-ism.

157
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,960
And we do not have to ask
the unpleasant question.

158
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,370
Worth have Max Faber
third into BMFC I doubt,

159
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,070
but there are some who
believe he might have.

160
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,790
And vivio we'll talk
about this later at all.

161
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,190
So a word about the Max Faber family.
Uh,

162
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,060
this is a Protestant family who
live in the city of Sal's work,

163
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,420
be, it was, which was
in the Habsburg Empire.

164
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,090
It was actually an independent city,
uh,

165
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,560
ruled by an archbishop,
very Catholic city.

166
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,230
And by the late 18th century,

167
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,040
these arch bishop started to take, uh, uh,

168
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,010
counter that for Nisha to seriously.
So therefore,

169
00:11:57,011 --> 00:12:02,011
those who were not Roman Catholic
better left suited the vapor family.

170
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,680
And they moved to Germany in the Rhineland
and they settled in Bielefeld and

171
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,890
they set up a textile
manufacturing business,

172
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,190
which operated pretty good.
Uh,

173
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,740
Weber's fodder.

174
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,190
Max Senior was the younger of two songs
and the family business though it was

175
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:28,330
doing okay. It was not enough to
support two families. Therefore,

176
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:33,230
he was asked to, uh, uh,
learn some trade. So he, uh,

177
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,850
uh,

178
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,850
actually entered CVL service and
became a politician and Seville server.

179
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,960
Um, uh, Max Faber himself was
born in 64 in air force, uh,

180
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,760
um,

181
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,440
in the eastern part of Germany where
his father was stationed at that time.

182
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,390
And, uh, his mother of us, Helen
enough Steen, a very sensitive,

183
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:59,770
wonderful woman.
There were eight brothers and sisters,

184
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:04,680
a big family and quite a
family. Uh, here you have a,

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,690
the three brothers, um, uh,

186
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,610
Max on the left and the middle,
afraid vapor,

187
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,430
afraid vapor was quite a scholar.

188
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,820
He was a younger brother of Max and
he was a very prominent economist,

189
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,410
philosopher and sociologist,
Bri,

190
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,510
primarily economist who was val northern
for the theory of industrial location

191
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,010
in his times. He was a professor
that University of Heidelberg.

192
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,050
He did not turn into a Nazi.

193
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,430
He was actually laid off by the Nazis
and there is a statute in eight,

194
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,630
1945.
Those of you who study in economics,

195
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:51,631
industrial relation theory may have
comment close the name of Alfred Vapor.

196
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,360
He was actually the femurs vapor.

197
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,700
Max Faber was less famous
in his Stein then Alfred.

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,470
Uh, now Max Weber's mother
was Halena, as I said,

199
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,950
she was a wonderful lady and,
uh,

200
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,020
she was a devil with Calvinists.

201
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:16,021
So now you can understand the role of
Calvinism in the Protestant ethic in the

202
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:19,360
waiver, um, and, uh, uh,

203
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:22,510
was also greatly
interested in philanthropy.

204
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:27,400
And that's where Weber's social
sensitivity is coming from.

205
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,240
Uh,

206
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,240
there was a great deal of conflict
between the sensitive Helena and,

207
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,600
uh,
uh,

208
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,530
Max's senior who was a very auditory
Italian paternalistic figure.

209
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:42,200
It a very unpleasant guy,
political yours,

210
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:46,930
so extremely conservative. And
they had quite a bit of, uh,

211
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,650
uh, uh, conflict 50
charter early in his life.

212
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:55,651
Max sided with his father did devote
fried sad you will do when you would

213
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,660
overcome your early posts complex
to identify you with your father.

214
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,920
Okay,
this is what he did.

215
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,470
But then he actually shifted
and eventually started with,

216
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,860
with his murderer. Well,
this is the father. Well,

217
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,380
I would not have liked him as my father.

218
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,640
Um, uh, um, uh,

219
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,030
he was a conservative politician,
uh, a very patriarchal figure,

220
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,040
a very,
he watched,

221
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,940
started in the municipality
as a cvs servant in air foot.

222
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,890
Then became actually a deputy
of the National Liberal Party,

223
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:39,810
which had very little to do with
liberalism. It was a conservative party.

224
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,930
Um, uh, um,

225
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,360
uh, this was under the
chancellorship of auto phone,

226
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,490
the Bismarck at the Ireland Chancellor,

227
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,820
real conservative times in Germany.

228
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,553
MMM.

229
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,180
Now, uh, about Weber's lives. Uh,

230
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:03,590
he studied in Heidelberg
and then in Berlin, uh,

231
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,490
he studied in both law
and agrarian history. Uh,

232
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,561
uh,

233
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:14,561
actually he was some valid between
a legal theories that historian,

234
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,690
um, and an economist. He was
kind of sociologists, uh,

235
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,760
last, uh, uh, in 92, he
married Marianna Schnittger,

236
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,670
who was a kind of second cousin,

237
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,780
Ivo come back to this
relationship. Later on, uh,

238
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:36,830
in 95, he was appointed professor
of economics at Fribourg,

239
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,100
and then he moved to Heidelberg that he
basically spent the rest of his life.

240
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,090
Um,
uh,

241
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:48,380
he also became a professor
of political science.

242
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,900
Um, uh, he was involved early in
his life in very feverish acronym,

243
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,120
uh,
academic activities.

244
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,030
He published two Phd dissertation,

245
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,570
one in law and one in
history. Uh, the law,

246
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:06,920
the law phd was on commercial
law in medieval Italy.

247
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,600
And, uh, the, uh,

248
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,840
history was on agrarian
history in the room walls,

249
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,780
books were published. The, um, uh,
and the are actually not in English.

250
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,330
Yeah.

251
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,310
Um, uh, uh,

252
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,540
liter version of,
uh,

253
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,220
the agrarian history was
published in [inaudible] 97.

254
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:31,300
He suffered a very serious,
a nervous breakdown.

255
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,010
I would love to talk in detail
about this. Uh, by all likelihood,

256
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:39,470
it had a lot to do with his
conflict with his father. Uh,

257
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,110
just during the summer of 97, um, uh, uh,

258
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,580
the modern visited,

259
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,240
he visited the patterns in
and then the mother said,

260
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,640
well, I want to visit you in
Heidelberg. And then the father said,

261
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:01,130
no, you can't because I
need you here. Right. Uh,

262
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,670
who via cook my breakfast.
Uh, and then Max Faber,

263
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:10,060
who was over as a subservient that
there'll be the, unto the father, Rev,

264
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:14,880
Walter Reed. And he said,
father, you can't do that.
If modern wants to visit us,

265
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,910
she should be allowed to visit us.

266
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,780
And this happened the first time that
Max Weber's said no to the father where

267
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,460
the father pastor of seen two or three
months and just after the death of the

268
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:33,900
father of Labor had a very
serious nervous breakdown. Now,

269
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,710
Novar knows exactly what it had to
do with the desks of the father,

270
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,450
but there is certainly a correlation
between the two facts. Uh,

271
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,430
it was actually a very
serious, uh, um, uh, uh,

272
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,170
uh, disease. Uh,

273
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,200
he was lucky to be married to a
Vonda food and extremely smart woman,

274
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:59,180
Marianna. Uh, they married in, uh, uh, uh,

275
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,550
uh,
uh,

276
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,640
earlier and Mariana was a great help
for him to recover from this nervous

277
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:12,780
breakdown for five years.
Bieber could not teach,

278
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,870
could not write good,
not read.

279
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,670
He will just sitting in the corner
staring he had of himself. Uh,

280
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,720
Mariana took him to travelers,

281
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,000
they went to Italy and
eventually he discovered 92.

282
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,270
He's coming out of his nervous
breakdown and recurrence to Heidelberg,

283
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,490
though he never really took on very
regular teaching youths anymore.

284
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,870
Now 18 or four,

285
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:44,120
he had his only trip to the
USA event to the Saint Louis.

286
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,060
Worth Fair and Rotor Vonda
food paper at that time.

287
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,030
Um, and then, uh, in 1906, uh, um,

288
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,151
again,

289
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:59,130
I wish I would have more time to
talk about the [inaudible] sisters.

290
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,670
This is a great story and the way he
obviously falls in love with Elsa Fondrick

291
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,770
restore fan as up on [inaudible]
was actually the wife,

292
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,610
uh, uh, um, uh, a good friend
and colleague of Vapor, uh,

293
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,310
[inaudible], uh, uh,
major, uh, political, uh,

294
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,340
social theories.
Well,

295
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:28,020
this is a very important event in Babers
life is slashed some dealer his desk.

296
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,050
It is actually not Marianna who is
standing by his desk bad about as I found

297
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:38,290
Rico Fan. Uh, interestingly Al's and
Marianna, very, very good friends. So,

298
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,600
uh, again, I cannot resist
to give you a little gossip,

299
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,060
but the best as we know,
uh,

300
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:48,610
the marriage with Mariana
was never consumed.

301
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,500
So these are fair with as a phone.

302
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:55,501
Rico fan is really the first real full
field Aerotek experience in Weber's life

303
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,760
and has a lot to do,
I think in VBS,

304
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,060
changing thinking about life,
um,

305
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,020
and modernity,

306
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,050
the rediscovery of the power of eroticism.
Um,

307
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,780
uh, then he has been doing
work, uh, on religion. Uh,

308
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
and this is mainly a response to
criticism he got for his book.

309
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:26,251
We will be trotting in a minute about
the Protestant ethic and he trusts to the

310
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:30,040
fender, uh, his very on, uh, uh, uh,

311
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,840
the Protestant ethic by looking at
various world religions and shows that

312
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:39,841
rationalization did not take place in
these religions as much as it happened in

313
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,760
Christianity. And then he's
working in his opal smuggle norm,

314
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,770
uh, economy. And so sadly, what
he never finished a, um, uh, uh,

315
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:55,771
died in 19 trente where all this is
Elsa from restore fund misses the Alpha.

316
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,990
Um, uh, uh,

317
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,370
she came from a very
prominent German family.

318
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:08,371
There were three very prominent and
very beautiful Rico fan sisters.

319
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,530
Um, uh, as I said,

320
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:16,531
Elsa was the vie for Fed God [inaudible]
or her sister Frieda from recto fun,

321
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,080
uh,

322
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,080
how the long and very
passionate relationship eventual
marriage bit DH Lawrence

323
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:27,901
and probably many of you in high school
have red DH Lawrence and sons in lovers

324
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,040
sounds in lovers,
was inspired by Frida phone.

325
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,030
Recto fan was a very durable
and complicated relationship.

326
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,090
Uh, well this is a Vba in Heidelberg, uh,

327
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,430
last time in his life. Um, uh,

328
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,460
the early version labor was mainly
in antiquity in 1903 and four heroes,

329
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,950
the Protestant ethic, then the
big world religions, China,

330
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,420
India and Judaism.
And then finally economy and society.

331
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,820
And on the finished manuscript.

332
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,740
This is the first edition
of the Protestant ethic. Uh,

333
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,120
well I think I probably
skip this one because I've,

334
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:17,540
you're talking to the Protestant that
later now this is the vapors housing

335
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,020
Heidelberg.
As you can see,

336
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,610
University of Heidelberg Treaty
that professors quite nice.

337
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,920
Um, well, uh,

338
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,600
Marianna was running us alone
in this house, uh, with, uh, uh,

339
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,800
extra ordinary intellectual
circle around them.

340
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:40,510
This is Mariana Vapor. Um,
uh, she was, as I said,

341
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:43,870
a wonderful woman. Um, uh, uh,

342
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:48,871
he was actually kind of second
cousin that his grandfather was a,

343
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,670
the, uh, Max Weber's fodder. Uh, uh,

344
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,260
uh,
she was also a formidable intellectual.

345
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Her book vives and moderates in the
evolution of law was a great success.

346
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,940
Um, Emile Durkheim reviewed
the book and at that time,

347
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:15,941
Ariana was much more famous
than Max Faber was a Max Stern,

348
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,080
quite nationalistic,

349
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,950
as many other Germans
during the first world war.

350
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,110
But then he's experiences of the
horrors of the first world war.

351
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,640
And partially I think the
relationship as a from Niko Fan,

352
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,650
um, uh, tourance him from
a committed liberal, uh,

353
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:39,320
who just had nothing else to see,

354
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:43,370
but approving things about
modernity. Uh, somebody,

355
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:46,070
we Scott a liberal and in despair,

356
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,800
he remains liberal for his life,

357
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,480
if you will over say that capitalism is
the only viable system we can live in.

358
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:56,120
Modernity has new alternative,

359
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,940
but he beginning increasingly the,

360
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,690
to show the downside of these modernity.
He said,

361
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:04,490
I cannot come up with anything better,

362
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:08,720
but it should not prevent me
to see that this enchantment,

363
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,750
the lost of magic in the modern world
and the horrors of the modern world.

364
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,170
A review you're talking
about this, uh, uh, later on,

365
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,960
uh, he actually nationalism
or had impact on him. Uh,

366
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,060
he actually was a part of the delegation
at the Versailles peace gt and he was

367
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,130
responsible for inserting article
48 into the very Marcos situation,

368
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,090
which unfortunately was used for
Hitler to gain power in 1930 to see,

369
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,790
I mean, that's that waiver camp Shelby,
how they're responsible for Nazis.

370
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,150
And this is something I have
to share with you. Well, uh,

371
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,210
the last work economy and society is
mainly a theory of domination and Vivia of

372
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:03,650
talking about, uh, next
week while domination is,

373
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,770
he basically combines power,

374
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,510
which has legitimated is
the concept of domination.

375
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,840
And what he does,
he develops a theory,

376
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,120
a fair human history has
subsegment types of domination.

377
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:24,070
So that major departure for marks,
right?

378
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,080
The social history is not describes
as subset when more so production,

379
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,620
but different types of domination.
Okay.

380
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:38,470
So that was the life and Varick Max Faber.
And now let's smoke,

381
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,120
turn into,
uh,

382
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:46,210
the Protestant ethic and try
to do this in 20 minutes,

383
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,110
which we are not be easy.

384
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,650
Okay.

385
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,990
So this is a I city covers from the,
uh,

386
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,500
nervous breakdown.

387
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,050
His first major book is the Protestant
ethic and the spirit of capitalism.

388
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,150
And that's in many ways a major
departure before the nervous breakdown.

389
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,450
A Viber s is an enthusiast
stick pro capitalist,

390
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,320
Stan [inaudible]. Um, uh,

391
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,860
his major concern before 1980,

392
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,880
97 is what blocks to development in the
eastern part of Germany and how those

393
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:52,311
forces which block the development of
capitalism can be overcome is very much a

394
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:57,870
liberal in the sense of Adam
Smith and John Stewart, the male.

395
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,970
Then he asks his nervous breakdown and
the person who is a merging looks like a

396
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,720
person who has been
thinking about Nicha right.

397
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:09,870
Why staring ahead of himself agreed deal.

398
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:15,170
And that beginning to show already
in the Protestant Ethic Bell,

399
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:16,680
uh,

400
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,680
he was working at a time when Marx's
was the dominant intellectual force in

401
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:27,120
Germany. The Social Democratic
Party in Germany was gay,

402
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,160
gaining ground and beginning to do
extremely val after election says vow and

403
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:35,170
therefore, uh, uh,

404
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:40,310
in my reading Max v Birth project is to
challenge Marxism in a fundamental ways.

405
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,070
And the Protestant attic is a
first and major step in the,

406
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:51,540
the action to challenge mark sees me.
So what is the marks?

407
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,130
They bird that bay.

408
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:58,790
If you are injured us sit in a it
ivy or teach a seminar next semester,

409
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:02,640
which will only deal with this slide.

410
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:07,010
What I'm presenting here to tell you
I bought you will be asked Judy the

411
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,660
laughter of text from marks and labor.

412
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,800
Now a historic on maturity.
Allah Islam, right?

413
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:18,000
Suggest to um, uh, uh, that uh,

414
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,070
uh, uh, it's only economic
forces which explain, uh,

415
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,930
um, uh, history, uh, um, vapor said,

416
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,720
look,
ideas mattered to you.

417
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,780
You cannot deduce ideas and
culture or features from Ecuador.

418
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:40,190
Me Go on auditions. Um, also, ah,

419
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,800
the virus has no problem. What
motivates human beings, survival,

420
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,430
economic interests.
A vapor said no.

421
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,120
We are not only motivated
by economic interests,

422
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,330
we are also motivated by tradition.

423
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,810
We can be motivated by values.
Uh,

424
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:03,490
he has a more complex
notion of human not evasion.

425
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:04,840
Then as I mentioned,

426
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,260
a history cannot be described
as subsequent van of production.

427
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,660
But change is,
is the nature of power.

428
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,310
The different type of motivation
but changes from time to time.

429
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,640
Historically how people
in position of power,

430
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:26,641
what kind of claims do they make for
you to obey and how you internalize,

431
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:31,450
right? Uh, the principles
of your subordination.

432
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,040
And he develops these
different types of uh, uh, of,

433
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,690
of authorities,
right.

434
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,500
Made three major types
to additional authority,

435
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,360
charismatic or authority and
booted liberal authority, legal,

436
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:48,540
rational authority.
This is his son,

437
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:53,200
but awkward term to
describe the liberal system,

438
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,000
what we would call liberalism.
And finally class,

439
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,560
they uses the term of class,
but he said they are not based,

440
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:07,561
you should not identify class on property
relationship but on marketplaces and

441
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:13,300
marks make an error by believing that
class is all of us existed in history

442
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:18,301
classes or new phenomenon which
emerges only with modern marketing,

443
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,190
integrated cap economies,

444
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,990
mark market economies or right.

445
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,310
What are the major teams
in the Patterson ethic?

446
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,450
It starts with that rather uninteresting.
Bart.

447
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,760
He offers some empirical evidence that
is a correlation between being rich and

448
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,750
being Protestant. Um, uh,

449
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,400
well this is no proof of
causality is a kind of prime,

450
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,160
a fishy evidence of what he does.

451
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,540
I think that's probably the weakest part
of the book. Then he asked a question,

452
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:54,430
what is the spirit of capitalism?
What is the world view of capitalism?

453
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,730
Then he looks at Lucas conception of
Kalin calling and what it has to do with

454
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:01,540
the spirit of capitalism.

455
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,370
Then he looks at the religious
foundations of [inaudible],

456
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,400
these worldliest skepticism and how
reformation formation brings these by.

457
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,780
Um, and a in particular
the interpretation of in,

458
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,680
in Calvinism and the teaching
of predestination. Okay.

459
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:25,681
So these are the crucial issues so of
religious stratification and affiliation

460
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:31,630
to social stratification. As
I said, this is, uh, uh, uh,

461
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,650
the weaker part of the book.
You really are.

462
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:39,410
He should do it if you will read the
whole book as a prime, a fishy evidence,

463
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:41,150
that is something going on here.

464
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,870
Look at the data and it turns
out that Protestant countries,

465
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,510
we're probably ahead of cow cattle,

466
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,050
Catholic countries in capitalism,

467
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:54,340
and look at the very
[inaudible] people and you've,

468
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:58,790
you'll see more Protestant
and Catholics. Uh, well,

469
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,920
not a very forceful argument.

470
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:05,921
He himself is a bit unclear about this
because he does not quite know what

471
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:11,510
causes what, um, is this, uh, uh, uh, uh,

472
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,390
somehow, um, uh, uh,

473
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,760
people,
uh,

474
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:25,040
Protestant inherited more valves or
because the apparatus and they can create

475
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:28,670
more of else. But you know, if you
are looking at American history,

476
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,450
that is certainly a prime, a
fishy evidence for this, right?

477
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,610
I think about 19th century
United States. Uh, right. Uh, uh,

478
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,920
uh, it was wasp wife,
Anglo Saxon and Protestant,

479
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:43,754
right?

480
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,420
And then they were the poor people coming
in and who they Daver the Irish and

481
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:53,340
the Italian and what, what does what,
what was the religion? Roman Catholic.

482
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,350
Right. So I think if you are
thinking in 19th century,

483
00:33:57,351 --> 00:34:01,670
late 19th century us, the kind of
empirical evidence is, you know,

484
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:04,580
pretty persuasive.
But otherwise of course,

485
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:07,370
I don't think this will
stand up for scrutiny.

486
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,710
But I think this is just to start the
argument now comes to the more serious

487
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:16,280
one. What is the spirit of
capitalism? And this is a,

488
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,430
that are two important point he need.
He says,

489
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,820
what is unique about spatty the capitalism
that the greed is turned into an

490
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:26,420
ethical imperative.

491
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,750
And the other one is that captured the
essence of capitalism is rationalism and

492
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:36,420
calculation. Now, greed,

493
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,680
uh,
turned into an ethical imperative.

494
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,790
Very interesting point
because as we have seen, uh,

495
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,820
Mark's does not offer any explanation why
on earth suddenly the capitalist start

496
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,860
accumulating capital.

497
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,190
Marcus does not have a theory to
explain the motivation of origin.

498
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:01,720
All accumulation of capital.
He only said or I,

499
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,210
accumulation of capital
is a kind of death, right?

500
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,560
And once you had capital, you don't
have to assume death. But you know,

501
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,360
the original accumulation
comes close to death.

502
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,650
But he does not explain why on earth
people beginning to accumulate capital and

503
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,220
vapor said,
well,

504
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,460
this is interesting because in most
history people like us who are working day

505
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,110
and night and you know, you, you,

506
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,120
you put our little money in four
over on k's or whatever and you know,

507
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:35,870
tried to put a little money in the
stock market and you know, more.

508
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:40,620
In most people, in most human history,
they will say, these people are jerks.

509
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,180
You know, why don't they relax now? They
have enough to eat. They should have fun.

510
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,010
And most of you in digital via probably
never have much fun, right? You'll be,

511
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,090
you'll be working day and night to make
more money there. Does it come from,

512
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,310
he said,
this is unique for capitalism.

513
00:35:56,311 --> 00:36:01,311
This is unique for modernity because
greed to become rich became an EFT,

514
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,320
ethical imperative, right? That is the
essence. And He, it has a lot to do.

515
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,570
The rationalization of
modernity and voc is,

516
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,450
we'll have a lot to do with Calvin
asthma and, uh, uh, bad destination.

517
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:17,970
And Luther's notion of colleague,

518
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,320
uh,
uh,

519
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,030
well this is the point what I
shed, right? The pre capital,

520
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:31,240
this man actually could not understand us,
right?

521
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,740
They had two very dim light because
they needed it in order to survive.

522
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,210
But once they had enough food
to eat and they had shelter,

523
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,050
they were not running after
money on the longer. Right?

524
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,070
This is something which is
unique for modern man. Uh,

525
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,240
yeah.
Capital isn't it?

526
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,300
A system needs this devotion
to the calling to make money,

527
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,950
right? It is for, for us. Uh, um, uh,

528
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,870
an ethical imperative. You know, uh,
well to what extent the destination,

529
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:07,930
I don't know about if you are very rich,
uvs say bell,

530
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:12,280
I have to get richer because I'm doing
good by becoming rich because I'm

531
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:15,670
creating jobs for others. What
a good person I am. Right?

532
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,460
That's why you want to
become rich, to be uh, uh,

533
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,460
to create jobs for others.

534
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,093
Uh,

535
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,290
now calculation,
this is absolutely crucial for vapor.

536
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:32,090
He said Val capitol is begins with
rational economic calculation,

537
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,890
which did not exist before
capitalists times a bell.

538
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:41,891
He kind of the parts here from Adam
Smith for whom rational calculation,

539
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,200
but all of us that people
were just not rational,

540
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,480
they burst said now this is a
unique historical phenomenon
that the beginning to

541
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:54,980
calculate effort and return
against to each other.

542
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,770
And we invented double bookkeeping,
right?

543
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,900
This is what we spend in terms of money
and our energy and this is our return.

544
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,200
This is our, our profit, which appears.

545
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,863
MMM

546
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,250
sure.

547
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:14,080
Rational economic calculation
is the key of capital is spirit.

548
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:14,390
So I,

549
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:19,390
these are the two things that in order
to her car then to make money makes you a

550
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:21,940
good person, right? Uh,

551
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:26,200
it's an altruistic act that you
can become rich. And second,

552
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,210
you are a capitalist. If you make rational
bookkeeping, right? If you don't keep,

553
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:34,780
you know, your income and expenditures,
you are doing something wrong.

554
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,890
You are not the real capitalist,
right? So in order keeping in mind,

555
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,930
you know, you really have to keep your
checks is more balanced, right? You,

556
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:47,170
all of us have to know how much
you spend and how much you have.

557
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,570
And the rationale is,
Matt,

558
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:53,770
there's a big tendency for history
that we are becoming increasingly

559
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,620
rationalized. Uh, right?

560
00:38:56,621 --> 00:39:01,621
And he said all the naive
historical materialism assumes
that ideas or originate

561
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,610
and as reflection of economic situation,

562
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,910
he said the spirit of capitalism was
present before the capitalist store.

563
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
There you had to invent rationalism and
rational calculation before you could

564
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:20,530
have capital accumulation
and capitalism as such.

565
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,570
Now here you come.

566
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,580
Luther's conception of
a one very important,

567
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:30,130
this shoe is, this is
a, this worldly view.

568
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,290
So big change from Medieval
Catholic theology. Um,

569
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,380
a looter coined the term bear rule
in translating the Bible into German.

570
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,760
And the term Beru has multiple meanings.
Uh,

571
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,140
in English I think it is quite
val translated as calling
do not quite because in

572
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:59,281
German bedroom has the very pedestrian
simple meaning of occupation.

573
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,590
So if you are filling out a questionnaire,

574
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,600
German language questionnaire for
the line occupations stands roof,

575
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:12,450
but bear roof is also a core
roof is to call in German.

576
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,170
So Barrow Office that you got costs.
You right there,

577
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:22,120
you got a roof, you got a call,
right? God costs you right?

578
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:27,070
You are needed. You have to do something
for God. They'd say this is bare truth.

579
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,570
And what is God calling you to,
to perform val in Yurok,

580
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:36,571
you patient so vile in medieval SKT
sees the essence of life was after life,

581
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,190
right? You were a saint,
then UV draw from your life.

582
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,690
You hardly ate anything.

583
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,310
You become sane because you all what
you eat is an egg a day and you still

584
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,770
survive, right? Um, uh,

585
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,150
this is saint who'd in the
medieval Roman Catholic sense.

586
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,150
Now this is more good.
Any longer.

587
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,280
Realtor said you have to be active
in this life, in your occupation.

588
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,650
That's the annual St Martin.

589
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:09,610
Can you withdraw yourself from life
and wait for after life, right?

590
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:13,060
This is the big innovation
of Lutheran theology,

591
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,530
a sort of therefore right for God once
you is the four from your duties in this

592
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:23,950
world, right. Rather than to be a sane,

593
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,240
not to consume visual, uh,
and so on and so forth.

594
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,680
Uh, okay. Uh, um, uh, now let's move on.

595
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,730
But water is also a traditional
theorist and vapor knows that,

596
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:39,741
uh,

597
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:44,741
in fact his emphasis on barrels means
that you have to perform in the job,

598
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,800
but you have in the social
position what you have.

599
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,130
This is not a theory for change.

600
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,700
It is a theory for the reproduction
of the state to school.

601
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,830
And loader actually stood up against the
peasant revolutions in Germany of his

602
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,340
time and sided with
political conservatives.

603
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,490
And Therefore, uh, vapor
suggest that this statute,

604
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,540
it is a non dynamic view of history made
it impossible for Lutheranism to become

605
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:21,560
the real moving force.
Uh, um, uh, and therefore,

606
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,650
uh, it remained to
traditionalist. You can,

607
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:29,650
that's why you needed
Calvinism. And by, by Calvinism.

608
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,630
Now,
the big change in modernity,

609
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:37,690
that magic is being eliminated but
was magic that we have power over God.

610
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,410
They could force God to do
something for us, right? Uh,

611
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,460
there were prescriptions.
What we do, and this,

612
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:50,420
these were magical means by
which you have magic. You know,

613
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,990
the magician comes rain doesn't come.
Magician does it.

614
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,140
Streaks and Rainville
calm, right? That's magic.

615
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,340
Now in order to rationalize the bird,
you have to get rid of magic.

616
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,830
A divert becomes rationalize.

617
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:08,450
You understand where the rain is
coming from and you know, you,

618
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,770
there is hardly anything you can
do to make a [inaudible], right?

619
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,250
So, uh, this is, uh, elimination of magic.

620
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,550
And this is what you see in
the Calvinist church. You walk,

621
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:24,200
you walk into the Calvinist church,
they don't have any pictures of saints.

622
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:24,441
You know,

623
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:29,441
it's has a called nastoff rationalism
ride in a Presbyterian church.

624
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,313
Um,

625
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,790
and what is the most important
element of Calvinism is the theory of

626
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:43,070
predestination. And that's an very
interesting, uh, uh, teaching,

627
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,840
uh, Calvin, uh, assumed, uh, uh,

628
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:49,400
and this is basically to chat radical it,

629
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:54,180
to get rid of any notion of magic
that in fact, whether you'll be,

630
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,670
you'll be saved or you perish was
decided upon your verse by God.

631
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,560
There is nothing you can do
about this. Um, uh, so therefore,

632
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,940
uh, you know, uh, in medieval
Roman Catholic churches,

633
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,890
this is what Luther was revolting against,
unfortunately, diverse, some corrupt,

634
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,090
a Roman Catholic priest who said,
you know what?

635
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:21,610
Give me a little money and if you
give me money, then you, you'll go to,

636
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,990
to heaven rather dental health.
Right?

637
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,280
So w people could buy
their way into, in, in,

638
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:33,280
into salvation. Now, Calvin said,
no way. You can't do anything. Uh,

639
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,430
not only not giving money to the police,

640
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:38,160
which was obviously caught up them
the church and about approved.

641
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:42,630
It was just kind of caught
up practices of individuals.

642
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,250
But he said, there is nothing you can
do in the life because it has been.

643
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,070
But at this feather stand,

644
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:54,090
the big question is how on earth
these teaching actually can create the

645
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,510
Protestant work ethic,
viable. They work hard.

646
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,750
If it has been decided pre,
uh, decided before us, uh,

647
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,630
uh, that, uh, uh, uh, Viveo
parish or of will be saved.

648
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,410
Now this will come out actually, um, uh,

649
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,840
from uh, uh, the preachings of, uh,

650
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:19,680
uh, uh, uh, uh, Calvinist
ministers, actual practices,

651
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,710
a pastoral practices. They said
there are, you know, you are, well,

652
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,490
this is a town of puritanism
that was really a pit place,

653
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:33,950
right of predestination.
New Haven was created by um,

654
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:38,360
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, by them you,

655
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,540
you start teaching, then
you'll will save. Well, uh,

656
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:46,200
are you concerned whether you go to hell
or heaven? You are, aren't you right?

657
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,900
You don't talk to burn or your life. You
want to know whether you want to heaven,

658
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,080
uh, well that is one way to do
it. Work hard. And if you are,

659
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,670
you'll be rewarded. This will be
a sign that God loves you and you,

660
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:03,420
you'll go to heaven.
So therefore you are working card,

661
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,230
not in order to buy your way into heaven,

662
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:11,560
but in order to have the sign of God that
you are on the right trajectory or new

663
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:14,620
vehicle to him. Well,
he said, unfortunately,

664
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,690
this Protestant ethic groover car to save,
um,

665
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:23,880
Benjamin Franklin, he signed Benjamin
Franklin, right? Uh, you, uh,

666
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,650
uh, are gone, uh, uh, in
modern capitalism, uh,

667
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,660
because now, uh, uh, the
puritans wanted UCR very hard.

668
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,210
Now this is all gone.
Um,

669
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,120
and what was created actually
the art in an iron cage.

670
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:44,400
This is a femurs rotation.
Again, you have to take it down.

671
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,760
One of the most frequently cited sentences
from vapor modernity created an eye

672
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,870
on stage where we are actually
working because we are, uh, um,

673
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,990
uh, forced to very, very hard.

674
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,720
And the spirit of capitalism today,
I think he was reading a Veblen,

675
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,140
uh, and the theory of the leisure
class and looking at American,

676
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,083
uh,
uh,

677
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:15,110
well seen by the early 20th century
who started to have a good life,

678
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,410
not only to save who Dave
would not follow any longer.

679
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,990
Benjamin Franklin advice. Uh, uh,

680
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:29,991
get up early when the song rises and
go to bed when the sun SAS because you

681
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:35,611
don't want to burn the candle and waste
money on the candle when you burn.

682
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,850
Right? Pat was the Reorg, right? Um, uh,

683
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,350
purely turns spirit.

684
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,100
The spirit which created
this very institution,

685
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,930
Yale University,

686
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:51,490
Right born burn your candle
stride because you raised money,

687
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,060
save money.
That's what we are pleased God.

688
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,770
That's what will be the sign that
you are having saved. Now he said,

689
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:04,771
this is unfortunately not any longer
because people are actually um,

690
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,370
uh,
ah for consumption.

691
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,210
Good speakers consumption.
Uh,

692
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,550
well and then he ends up, this is a
very important, uh, uh, quotation.

693
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,950
Keep it, um, uh,

694
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,980
and will be helpful for you to understand
the important difference between March

695
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:29,590
and VBA. He said, look,
but don't misunderstand me.

696
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,950
I don't want to substitute advanced
sided materialist explanation of history,

697
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,000
but Mark's offers with advanced
sided idealist history.

698
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,570
I'm not suggesting that capitalism,

699
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:48,571
it came out of Calvinism all the time
suggesting that has been an independent

700
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:53,230
change in theological teaching,
uh,

701
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,280
from Medieval Catholicism
to that formation. Uh,

702
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,580
it was a rationalization.
If religious thinking,

703
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,440
the loss of magic, the rational is
the teaching of the destination.

704
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,040
And if this would not have happened,

705
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,000
capitalist institutions would
not have been able to develop.

706
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:17,320
Not that they caused that emergence
of capitalist institutions.

707
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,400
There was also an evolution
of the economic systems.

708
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:26,410
The material change happened in one line,

709
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,300
and the change in the sphere
of ideas happened in another
line. And what he said,

710
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,090
that is an elective
affinity between the two.

711
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,570
If you have the proper ideas and the
proper economic institution goal,

712
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:44,080
right, then the change happens,
then you have modern capitalism.

713
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,930
If you don't have the right
ideas like Calvinists,

714
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:52,360
we said like in China,
in the 12 century,

715
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,870
every buzz worthy,
everything was ready for capitalism.

716
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,330
It did not happen because
the con fortune and Tau is,

717
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:05,340
the ideas at that time did not
give the ideological framing,

718
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,820
which would have helped the
development of capitalism in China.

719
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,480
And that's why China was
hold back, right? Uh,

720
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,810
Calvin Immuno nationalization
of idea could happen,

721
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,650
but if there are no economic
conditions for capitalism,

722
00:50:19,651 --> 00:50:23,590
it will not happen either.
So this is the idea of elective at finity.

723
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,860
He rejects simple cause or relationship
between ideas and material conditions

724
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:35,000
and he soft stick CQ sit,
we would say today an interactive effect,

725
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:35,420
right?

726
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:40,010
That is an interaction between
ideas and material conditions.

727
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,630
He calls it elective affinity.
As such.

728
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,310
Thank you very much.

729
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:05,070
And the best specialist will be sport
will be posted just before 7:00 PM I have

730
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:10,810
a discussion section at seven so before
I go to discussion section Thursday,

731
00:51:10,811 --> 00:51:13,120
I've your post the questions.
