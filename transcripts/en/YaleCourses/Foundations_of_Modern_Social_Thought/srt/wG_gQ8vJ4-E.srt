1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,030
Uh, good morning. Um,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,640
now the move to our last alter
in discourse to Emile Durkheim,

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,930
uh, that rd Ali to Durkheim's. Uh,

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,490
we have seen certainly to Marxists and to,
uh,

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,890
uh, Weber's, uh, that I'd also
two faces of Emil Dirk time.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,840
Uh, to put it bluntly, uh,

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,990
the young Durkheim,
uh,

8
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:38,991
has been a functionalist and the
positivist and then late in his life,

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,670
he has his epistemological churn.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,200
He became a cultural analyst.
Well,

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,670
it's not quite true because you know,

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,240
each author is more complex and there are
already elements of his cultural is in

13
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,680
the early Varick,

14
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,960
but there was certainly a
dramatic change in the Va,

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,560
how Durkheim conceived the,
um,

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,860
but what the job of social sciences
later in his life in his book,

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,230
uh,
the alimentary forms of religious life,

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,130
I think it had a lot to do
also with his personal life.

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,000
And if you're talking about
this, um, he was, uh, uh,

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,950
brought up here and I'd have been a core
family and it was supposed to become a

21
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:33,900
rabbi and then he revolted
against the parental household.

22
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,460
Um, much like Nicha did, uh,

23
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,210
turned probably in 28 days,

24
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,190
but certainly not an
active believer in Judaism.

25
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:48,090
And later in his life.
Um, he became again,

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,140
interested in religion and
not only a philosophically,

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,250
but also existentially
interested in religion.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,570
Um, well in the course, uh, we have
only four lectures on Durkheim,

29
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,940
so I leave a Durkheim,

30
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:10,941
the culturalist out and Vivio
doing a very only on the,

31
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,470
a earlier very, um, uh,
the division of Labor.

32
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,983
Uh,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
the wonderful book suicide and as
somewhat difficult book the rules of

34
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,710
sociological mattered. Uh, um,

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,570
and I,
uh,

36
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,620
I just leave the elementary
form of religious life.

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,730
I don't have time to fit
this into a Durer came,

38
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,370
had a extra ordinary impact on the,
uh,

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,810
American social science.
Um,

40
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,530
initially it was particularly
the younger Durkheim.

41
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:57,531
The functional is Durkheim who
had such an extra ordinary impact.

42
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,690
Um, uh, unlike, uh, uh,

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,560
vapor or Marx whose impact was brewed.

44
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,290
And the fact that history and economics
and political science Durkheim impact

45
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,950
was much more focused on the sociology.

46
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,900
So in the scores,

47
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,520
the only author who properly
speaking is a sociologist,

48
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,960
is Emil Durkheim.
All the others you discussed?

49
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,280
Um,
uh,

50
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,310
we're not really identified themselves
as sociologists later in his life.

51
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,910
He did did, uh, but,
uh, not, uh, uh, uh, uh,

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,800
uh, on the whole Emile Durkheim, uh, uh,

53
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,640
identified himself and his
project as a sociology.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,990
Uh, it, of course has lots of food,

55
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,070
lots to do that these disciplinary
boundaries between economics,

56
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:03,541
political science and sociology became
much more sharp redrawn by the end of 19

57
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:08,140
and early 20th century.
Um,

58
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,470
and the sociology as an
academic discipline was
really established by the late

59
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,300
19th century.

60
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,420
So this is Emile Durkheim
born in 1858 and died in 1917.

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,630
Just very briefly about his life.

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,080
He was born in a small down Epi now in
France because I said he's a father,

63
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,690
was a rabbi and the,
uh,

64
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:39,390
he was expected to become
at home by himself. Uh,

65
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,900
in 79, he was admitted to
the Ecole Normale superieure,

66
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,240
which is one of these very
elite schools, MIT, uh,

67
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,200
uh, version in France. Um, and, uh,

68
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:58,150
uh,
by the time he went to a university,

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,010
you called northern mass
per year is a university.

70
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,990
Um, uh, he lost his religious beliefs.

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,690
Um, uh, he was, uh, uh,

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,540
for some time a professor at
the University of Bordeaux. Uh,

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
then he became politically
active in the 1940s,

74
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,140
um, especially in the so
called Dreyfus affair.

75
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,580
And Ivo just briefly mentioned
what that was, uh, uh,

76
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,120
than 1902.

77
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,490
He became professor at the
University of batteries,

78
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,520
which is not quite as distinguished
as a core Nora mastery per year.

79
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,940
Uh,
uh,

80
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,980
he's sign avast killed the end of war
and shortly after this he died in Paris.

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,590
So this is Alfred Dreyfus.

82
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,050
This is a very important event in French
and in many ways in European history.

83
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,230
What was the drive was to have
fear? You're probably, or no,

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,750
in 1894 Dreyfus who was a, uh, Jewish,

85
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,170
uh, it was, uh,

86
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,080
a falsely accused to be a
German spy and it was, uh,

87
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,130
uh, imprisoned, uh, that
was, uh, obviously, um,

88
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,400
an antisemitic trial.
And these mobilized,

89
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:26,270
the French intellectuals are not only
French intellectuals, uh, but uh, uh,

90
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,160
uh, French intellectuals
in particular, um,

91
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,050
Emile Zola,
uh,

92
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,090
whom some of you may have rather a the
leading French writer of this ebook rule,

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,170
an important article
which appeared in the, uh,

94
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,850
French leading French daily newspaper.

95
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,340
Yakuza I accuse the French should
this study of being anti Semitic.

96
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Now Derek came joy into other
prominent intellectuals to protest,

97
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:05,090
to trial. It took them a long time,
but eventually they were successful.

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Dreyfus was eventually exonerated of
all charges and amid the night of the

99
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:18,380
Legion of honor. So it was,
uh, a happy ending, uh,

100
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,440
French antisemitism,

101
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,150
a photo via then it came
back with van Jams, um,

102
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,140
during the occupation
Nazi occupation franchise,

103
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,180
not as innocent about antisemitism
as you may want to believe it.

104
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:38,000
Uh, uh, many of you are
collaborating with the Nazis.

105
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,170
Well about the Verruca in 93,

106
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:47,171
he wrote a dissertation and which it
probably is still his most influential

107
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:51,950
book, the Division of Labor in
society. And today's lecture,

108
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,230
if you will be focused on this,
uh,

109
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,850
95 feet first followed by the rules
of sociological and mattered, uh,

110
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:02,420
which is, uh, his most
positivistic statement.

111
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,130
The division of Labor is his
most functionalist work. Um,

112
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,540
and then, uh, in 97, he had all suicide.

113
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,880
A suicide is a very important
book because it's three early,

114
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,030
the first piece of rigorous
empirical social science,

115
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,870
which takes a very unusual,

116
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,810
very rare phenomenon like suicide and,

117
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,360
uh,

118
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,360
crunches numbers extremely carefully to
test where that he can identify social

119
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:40,110
determinants of such a real
phenomenon. Uh, fortunately, uh,

120
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,130
even in countries where
many people commit suicide,

121
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,910
like side is still area for
an [inaudible]. Uh, it's, uh,

122
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,170
but he managed to come up with
a very provocative theory,

123
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,830
but he, um, uh, uh,

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,960
demonstrated it very
careful empirical analysis.

125
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,230
Maybe we'll be looking at the two
parts of the division of Labor. Um,

126
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,600
today we will be looking at, uh, uh,

127
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:11,140
the major arguments of
division of labor. Um, um, um,

128
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,060
and then, uh, also Vivia
look at, uh, uh, uh,

129
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,500
uh, Thursday on his theory of Anime, uh,

130
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,680
which is a central piece of the
book, division of Labor. Um, uh,

131
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,670
but, uh, uh, uh, I kind
of a bite of a, um, uh,

132
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,610
analysis. Um, uh, uh, uh,

133
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,100
and as I said in 1915,
he wrote this book,

134
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:40,740
the elementary forms of religious life,

135
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:45,250
which is a major break
in his work. Uh, uh,

136
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,800
uh,
and the shorts,

137
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:51,030
his renewed interest in the
spiritual and the metaphysical.

138
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,790
Okay. Uh, just, uh, very briefly
what is in the box. As I said,

139
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,390
the division of Labor
was his phd dissertation,

140
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,450
but on like money, uh, um, uh,

141
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,510
scholars who's a only go the book is
that dissertation and Durkheim full audit

142
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,720
up for Viet a number of
good other books. Um, uh,

143
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,560
many festivals,
I'd actually one book people,

144
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:20,480
or at least they should have been because
there are only good book for us that

145
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:25,481
is sufficient and what they publish
later only published because publish or

146
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,990
perish, right? To get tenure.

147
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,870
That's why they probably published
too many books. Um, anyway, um,

148
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,350
he was inspired by Montesquieu.
Um, uh, they all do it.

149
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,690
Academies, Very French, uh,
and his roots are deeply in,

150
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,290
won't askew and to some
extent in Jerusalem. Uh,

151
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,270
he admired Russo as val, but
Montesquieu is really, uh,

152
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:56,060
the, uh, major, um, inspiration
behind him. And, uh,

153
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,120
well what he does, he uses law as
a measure of social development,

154
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,000
uh, uh, much life.
Montesquieu did sort of a, um,

155
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,050
uh, um, uh, and, uh,
uh, he explains, uh, uh,

156
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,020
by using the law or the legal
system, um, uh, uh, how, um,

157
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,790
the division of labor of war,
of the,

158
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:22,560
what were the stages of the development
of division of Labor? There are,

159
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,280
um, uh, just a very brief
for contrast, right?

160
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,680
Maurice was interested in
economic conflict, right?

161
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,720
In struggle at and, uh, um, uh,

162
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,090
scares economic resources.

163
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,100
The Zebra was interested in
struggle for power. I Sovos nature,

164
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,290
they're kind of was interested
in social solidarity. Um,

165
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,160
uh,
Mark's and vapor are conflict theorists.

166
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,550
They tried to explain about
breaks up society. Um,

167
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,710
Durkheim is a tiered is the of each
just to understand what holds society

168
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,400
together but brings us together.

169
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,000
Arisal Saturday is not falling apart.
Uh,

170
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,760
right now,
uh,

171
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:14,761
in the book he makes a crucial distinction
between two types of solidarity,

172
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,800
mechanical and organic
solidarity. Um, and,

173
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:24,880
uh, uh, I've, you'll speak
about this at great lengths.

174
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,180
This is an other attempt to develop a
type pathology of evolution of societies.

175
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,350
You are already familiar with
Mark's more soft production, right?

176
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,670
The evolution from slavery
to feudalism to capitalism.

177
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,220
You're all familiar with Max Faber,

178
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,600
traditional authority and
legal rational authority. Now,

179
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:51,601
direct camps alternative is
mechanical and organic solidarity,

180
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,660
right?

181
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,660
But a vapor called traditional authority
is kind of mechanical solidarity for

182
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:04,081
Durkheim or Marx called
pre capital is formations,

183
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,020
is mechanical solidarity,
organic solidarity.

184
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:13,021
Describe legal rational authority
or modernity or capitalism.

185
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,460
Uh,
uh,

186
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,220
he also identified the pedal and
Dzhokhar pedological forms of division of

187
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,940
labor.
And this is what he called anime.

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,600
And his idea of anime is a kind of
similar or analogous distinction.

189
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,920
What was,

190
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,920
what was alienation in marks and what
it was this enchantment in the vapor,

191
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,880
uh, a door that are very
important differences as well.

192
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:47,320
And I will be talking about this
tourists today now on suicide.

193
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,401
As I said,

194
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:53,401
this is the one of the first very
rigorous empirical studies of a social

195
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:57,700
phenomenon.
A phenomenon we think is not quite social.

196
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,770
They think it is really an individual
decision whether you take your life or not

197
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,450
about Durkheim actually was capable to
show that even in these very private

198
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,580
action when you take your life
that are social determinance,

199
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,790
who is committing suicide or not,

200
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,560
and he's making a distinction
between different types of suicide.

201
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,200
Annemieke,
altruistic,

202
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,510
egoistic and fatalistic Vance and
ivy would be talking about this,

203
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,770
uh,
uh,

204
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,110
after you returned from Thanksgiving
spray now about the methodology,

205
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,930
he was a methodological collectivists,

206
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:42,931
much like Montesquieu or Shaw and
very much online cops lock or mills.

207
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,720
You know, Mark's being kind of halfway
between methodological individualism and

208
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:54,080
collectivism as a teary stuff,
revolutionary consciousness.

209
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,730
He evolves at evolution as a
methodology called call activists.

210
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,090
Maybe you'll see a deer camps notion of
collective conscience is not all that

211
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,230
different from Weber's. Uh, Mark's
idea of class consciousness,

212
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,470
which is not the sum total right of the
individual consciousness are very curse.

213
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,060
Uh, uh, but, uh,

214
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:22,061
Mark's in his theory of exploitation as
you have read his stacks reach almost

215
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,840
like Adam Smith or John Stuart Mill,
right?

216
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,520
It's a self interest
international individuals from
which he explains the nature

217
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:37,640
of exploitation. Arielle, it's much
more difficult to figure it out,

218
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,870
but how VBA Fitzy cause
we scatter goodies.

219
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,140
I think he's also [inaudible] between
collectivism and individualism later in

220
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:51,080
his life is becoming more of a
methodological individualism.

221
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,880
But Dirk kind of consistency in Durkheim,
is that from Dave Ron,

222
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,860
he's a methodological collectivist and
remains I the logic God called activist.

223
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:07,130
But at the same time he believed
in the existence of social facts.

224
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,120
Um,

225
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,120
and the social facts on the other hand
can be observed which rigorous and

226
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:18,640
[inaudible] and methodology.
And this is what makes him a in,

227
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,460
in a v a positivist. So this is a, uh,

228
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:27,461
just a brief introduction to a who the
orchard is an now let me move over to the

229
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:34,860
division of Labor. Um, and uh,

230
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,550
yeah,

231
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,550
all my computer getting slower
as the semester is progressing.

232
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,660
So it's probably time for the semester
to end because my laptop though it is

233
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:13,420
new, it's still, uh,

234
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,980
there'll become unbearably slow
by the end of the semester. Okay.

235
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,010
So this is Emil Durkheim and the
division of Labor in society.

236
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,480
So how does a Durkheim proceed?
Um,

237
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,110
in the Varick and a,
uh,

238
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,700
today's presentation will focus,
uh,

239
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,090
on the question. Why do a kind
of begins the analysis, uh, uh,

240
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,100
by taking the law as a,
the point of departure.

241
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,680
Um, uh, and uh, uh, uh, uh,

242
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,770
Dan, uh, Viveo, uh,

243
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:57,771
proceed how he makes the
distinction between organic and,

244
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:03,480
uh, um, uh, um, uh, mechanical solidarity.

245
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,150
Um, uh, so, uh,

246
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,570
the question actually is what I
methodological called activist, uh, uh,

247
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,690
uh, uh, that you need to find the, um,

248
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,620
some of collective expression,
uh,

249
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,700
in order to study society
and not individuals.

250
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,490
And a march, like Montesquieu, um,

251
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,540
he be beliefs that the law is
such a collective phenomenon,

252
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,020
a law,
which again,

253
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,560
be studied and established the,

254
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,310
to studying individual views
or individual opinions. Right.

255
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,460
Uh, it's a, uh, Bart's off,
uh, about, uh, you know, uh,

256
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,880
during camps during the analogy
is the collective conscience,

257
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,430
um, nerve, which is, uh, uh, at
Bhava individual consciousnesses. Ah,

258
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:03,930
okay. So that's, um, uh, uh, uh, what,

259
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,850
what are the most important, uh, issues,

260
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,020
uh, um, in, in the very few,

261
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,580
as far as we discuss it today,
uh, val, he is interested in,

262
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,080
in solidarity. Um, as
I pointed out, uh, uh,

263
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,040
uh, um, uh, the, our, uh, his,

264
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,140
his real question is what
holds society together?

265
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,590
The are so different and
society short fall apart.

266
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,630
And it is a writing in the late 19th,
early 20th century.

267
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,150
This is the time of industrialization
of urbanization. People are,

268
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,610
this launched from that,
um,

269
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:52,200
the traditional communities from
the traditional villages, uh,

270
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,390
Gustave from Besant agriculture and
move into urban industrial employment.

271
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,750
Um, and the question is, um, a
veal society breakdown, social VR,

272
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,380
social order breakdown. Um, if, uh,

273
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:11,381
the traditional order does not keep us
together and this is what he tries to

274
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:14,640
figure it out,
what in a modern,

275
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,970
urban and industrial society cannot
keep us together and he tries to find a

276
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:26,610
Saudi daddy did and, uh, uh, well, uh,

277
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,500
uh, uh, uh, what creates
is a solidarity, uh,

278
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,450
is called lefty for
consciousness. Uh, um, uh,

279
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,400
the fundamental idea about indirect
came about collective consciousness.

280
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,830
Um,
as I said,

281
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,770
it is a analogous to the
notion of the genital veal,

282
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,420
um, uh, in the, uh, uh,
a little sore or, uh,

283
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:57,220
the notion of class consciousness,
sir, uh, in Mark's, uh, uh,

284
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,340
so therefore it is not the sum
total of individual consciousnesses,

285
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,750
uh, but, uh, something, uh,
uh, of, uh, shared norms,

286
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:12,751
beliefs and values which exist prior
and individual is being born prior,

287
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,760
uh,
society actually existed,

288
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:23,170
which is passed on from one
generation to the other. Right.

289
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,650
And, uh, uh, therefore he tries to show,

290
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:31,651
right these collective consciousnesses
of which persist over time.

291
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,800
Um, and, uh, of course, the most obvious,

292
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,620
most rigorous way to go about this,

293
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,060
to look at law because that's
exactly what the law is,

294
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,470
right?
The law is changing over time,

295
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,530
but usually, uh, the change is very,

296
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,760
very slow and reaches
over several generations.

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,940
Uh, so, uh, ever before,

298
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,630
somebody who is a French social
scientists, you know, and run the Unifi,

299
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,030
we already talked about this. Uh, uh, uh,

300
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,240
the French are very methodological
collectivists the Anglo Saxon send to be

301
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:17,200
methodological individualist.
Um, and the French online,

302
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:21,010
the German, um, are very scientific.

303
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,270
The are very much scientists. Um, uh,

304
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,870
delivered our CRT thick,
uh,

305
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,600
in German does not exist.
Uh, the German say, um, uh,

306
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,550
API, this and shaft La
vison shaft means, uh,

307
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,500
um, uh, uh, vison is
knowledge, uh, uh, um,

308
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,883
uh,

309
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,810
science in German is constituted
by all sorts of knowledge, right?

310
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,970
It's a much broader notion,
right?

311
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,480
In French or in English bit
sciencey really mean rigorous
science of the natural

312
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,670
science.
Stipes.

313
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,470
Now that's Derrick hand did not go as
far as saying it is natural science,

314
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,710
but certainly he was very scientific
in insistence of rigorous analysis.

315
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:17,290
Uh, our firm objective data,
right? That's what, uh, uh, uh,

316
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,600
why the Germans, you
know, Vincent Schaffler,

317
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,410
all those who study ideas, uh, uh,

318
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,200
Bisson shufflers it's a much,
much,

319
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,230
much broader notion of natural scientists
are also vison shufflers but people

320
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,390
who study humanities and history of ideas.

321
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,210
I'd also vison Shufflers,
uh,

322
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,240
people who are an expert on co ops and
spend their life writing on hops is a

323
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,890
vison shuffler right?

324
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,010
In German we can hardly see
somebody who does right.

325
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,980
History of ideas to be a scientist,
right? It's uh, uh, uh, the,

326
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,410
we call it, you know, humanities. Um,

327
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,860
it talks about social sciences, uh, uh,

328
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,890
with a lot of anxiety and real
scientist ask cross social science.

329
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:10,790
What do you mean? What is science
about what you are doing? Well,

330
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,590
those of you who take economics,

331
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,760
they make sure it looks like silence
because you have all the equations on the

332
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,260
blackboard. So therefore, you
know, a scientist can relax,

333
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,400
but you,

334
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,400
if you are listening to my lectures and
not a single equation on the blackboard,

335
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,630
you probably have doubt that this is
the reality. Social Science. Anyway,

336
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,660
he was a CRT faker in chance of being
very rigorous and his analysis sort of

337
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,010
artist collective consciousness.
I give, uh, here, uh, um,

338
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,910
uh, a, um, a citation for you,

339
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,660
right? Uh, um, uh, if there's, uh,

340
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
a totality of beliefs and sentiments of
each are common to the average member of

341
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,460
society,
right?

342
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,930
But which has a life of its own.
All right.

343
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,060
Um,
uh,

344
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,180
that's what he calls a
collective consciousness.

345
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,700
So this is, uh, uh,

346
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,960
different from the consciousness
is of the individuals and door.

347
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,950
You know, he, he's a, he's
a scientist, uh, right?

348
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,490
Is she on traffic?
And it is,

349
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,080
has to be realized in
individuals. So therefore, I mean,

350
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:37,670
Durkheim, I will not
necessarily be opposed, uh, uh,

351
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:42,671
to carry out even survey research and
ask individuals about the custom sort of

352
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:50,171
values and the sort of aggregate this
up and try to find those patterns,

353
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:53,450
especially overtriage
diamond across nation.

354
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,760
That's not really what he did,

355
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,590
but I think he would be open
for these kind of half research,

356
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:05,591
which of course made him so influential
in early American sociology in the

357
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:10,060
1930s, forties and 50s. Because, uh, um,

358
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,210
American sociology has been very
positive and very embedded car.

359
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,110
Now,
uh,

360
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,840
but the most obvious example of
collective conscience is, uh,

361
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:27,390
the law, probably also
the language. Well, uh,

362
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,900
there are differences,
uh,

363
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,660
in law and the three modern
and modern societies.

364
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,610
Now we are getting into,

365
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,990
he's building the argument opt to make
the distinction between organic and,

366
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:45,900
uh, um, uh, uh, mechanical,
mechanical and organic solidarity.

367
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,860
Um, and, uh, uh, left me just,
uh, uh, Gore through of this, uh,

368
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,320
uh,
ops,

369
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,003
uh,

370
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,810
too far. Okay. Um, so, uh,

371
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:02,610
in the argument is done in,
in pre modern societies,

372
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,530
uh, uh, the,

373
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,550
the law of each existed is Brian
Maternity or repressive or penal law.

374
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,510
Um, uh, val that, uh, you
know, that is, uh, uh,

375
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:20,511
the purpose of Bunich Mandt is to punish
evil behavior and we tend to agree what

376
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:27,150
is eve? Your behavior is, uh, um,
and punishments. So therefore,

377
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,100
also tends to be harsh, uh,
to, uh, prevent, uh, uh,

378
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,900
further, um, uh, aggressive
behavior. Um, uh, uh, by,

379
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,590
uh, individuals, uh, uh, uh, sued.

380
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:46,050
This is, uh, the legal system
of pre modern societies.

381
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:46,801
Well,

382
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:51,801
I will give you a couple of
citations and I won't read them.

383
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,560
Uh, I will put them on the
intranet and you can see the, uh,

384
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,100
to at your leisure. It
kind of elaborates, uh, on,

385
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,050
on the points I made.

386
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,320
Um, uh, uh, uh,

387
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,440
okay. Uh, but in modern society, uh,

388
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,430
the legal system is very different.
Uh,

389
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
the legal system is based on contract.

390
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,320
The essence of modern
legal system is contract.

391
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,670
There's not that we do not
have a pin or cold, right?

392
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,020
The penal code survives.
But what is of a novel is a,

393
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,990
uh, a contractual, uh, law, um,

394
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:40,130
which is rest of the [inaudible] river,
which is not about punishing EDL,

395
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,550
but simply restitute the damage.

396
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:48,500
Somebody by baking a contract costs
to the other contracting partner.

397
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,393
Right.

398
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,500
And he said that this is a new
type of law which emerges, uh, uh,

399
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,610
via modernity. Uh, Marshall
will say, uh, it is, uh, uh,

400
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,850
a new legal system,
uh, which emerges a of,

401
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,410
we had to be capitalism
or, uh, um, and, uh,

402
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,980
Vaibhav you'll say this is the
essence of Liga rational authority.

403
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,293
Uh,

404
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,850
uh,
um,

405
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,270
bell. Uh, Oh, why does he study law?

406
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,370
I don't want to elaborate on
this too longer. Uh, that's,

407
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,410
uh, obvious that, uh,

408
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,500
the legal system is the single
best measure of what he,

409
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:39,930
he tries to get at collective conscience,

410
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,800
which can be the most objectively,
right,

411
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,950
that our law books and
legal practices and, uh, uh,

412
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,770
minutes of, uh, uh, recordings,

413
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:55,771
how the courts operated and how
low was made and implemented,

414
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,180
which can be studied with great level of,
uh,

415
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,050
rigor. Um, uh, uh, for instance,

416
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:09,610
it's very easy to study whether
indeed contractual law, um,

417
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,640
is a new form of law are you can go
back to legal history and to establish

418
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:18,910
exactly then contractual law and merged.

419
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,780
This was actually also very
much undermined, uh, for, uh,

420
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,010
the younger Viber.
Uh,

421
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:31,020
then he was also looking at basically
the emergence of contractual law.

422
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,720
You can lead to medieval
Italy, um, in, uh, his, uh, uh,

423
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,920
phd for the law degree. Uh, uh, uh,

424
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,990
I think I already made this point.
What is interesting that uh,

425
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,670
Durkheim and labor sort of
ignored each other? Um, uh,

426
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,000
I don't think they ever cited each other.

427
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:56,010
I don't recall ever seen
a citation to one another.

428
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,760
They were working on the same area.
Of course it was,

429
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,400
the speed did speak most of the languages.

430
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,810
And they were of course aware
that the other giant exists.

431
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,070
They were probably in many ways to close,
um,

432
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,800
too much in competition with
each other to cite each other.

433
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,920
I mentioned already that Durkheim
did review Marianna Weber's book,

434
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,490
but never any of Weber's book,
though Mariana was writing,

435
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:29,491
write about marriage or a lot of marriage
law of which was a marginal interest

436
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,610
to Durkheim and they've ever
was rotting on religion.

437
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,890
This was so central for their clients
into us and never had their last,

438
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,930
they've kind of
ignored each other.

439
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,970
Now about the two types of solidarity,
uh,

440
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,930
well, uh, mechanical solidarity, uh, it's

441
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,090
real hard to remember the distinction.

442
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,890
One would think organic
solidarity must be old, right?

443
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:02,650
And mechanical must be
modern. The machines. Now,

444
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,900
the opposite is true.
I,

445
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,670
I kept making these mistakes for the first
two or three years when I was leading

446
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:13,480
Durkheim some 45 years ago.
Uh,

447
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,590
uh, uh, mechanical or sorry,
Daddy. The, the is, uh, uh, uh,

448
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,540
which describes a pre,
pre modern societies. Um,

449
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,430
and uh, this is a solidarity which
based on the similarities, uh,

450
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,100
uh, of, uh, uh, uh, of,
of, of, of the parts, uh,

451
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,860
um, well this is why
you can have a, um, uh,

452
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,870
a penal law because a penal law does not
make a distinction between contractual

453
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:45,600
partners.
Uh,

454
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,420
it assumes the sameness
of the group as such, uh,

455
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,100
uh, and uh, uh, mechanical solidarity,

456
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,030
right? Uh, is, uh, as I said,

457
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,920
it's primarily based that we are the,
the seat CRC have similar,

458
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,280
uh, in, in the globe organic solidarity.

459
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,630
A Savill Durkheim argue is one which
is based on differences in society.

460
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:20,891
A higher level of division of Labor in
society produces organic solidarity,

461
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,661
organic.

462
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:28,661
He man sits as a kind of
biological analogy and modern
societies like the human

463
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,200
body,
right?

464
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,310
There are functional differences
between the human organs.

465
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,040
That's why these organic solidarity,
right?

466
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,270
The heart performs a different
function than the longer,

467
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,650
but the long could not live
the south of the heart, right?

468
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,530
This is why this is organic.
Saudi, Saudi, Daddy,

469
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,770
the society operates more
like an organism or um,

470
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,970
in the earlier times society was more
operating like a machine where you

471
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:01,450
actually a party staking out mechanically.

472
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,720
It doesn't matter all that much.
Right? Is a simple machine. Uh,

473
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,210
I mean, so that's a, that's the
fundamental distinction by the way,

474
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:15,460
also for Durkheim. Um, uh, and
this is also in the Texter,

475
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,670
but you are eating, there's distinction
between mechanical and organic.

476
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,950
Solidarity is,
uh,

477
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,360
developed in order to
describe a societies as such,

478
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,500
but much like,
uh,

479
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,200
the bursts notion of traditional
authority and Legal National Authority,

480
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,280
uh, he is also using this
to understand the, um, uh,

481
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,810
uh, uh, so sad.

482
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,090
The social solidarity
is in contemporary life.

483
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,540
So mechanical solidarity
does exist in the,

484
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,630
uh,
in contemporary society as well.

485
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:58,640
And he makes, you know, these
reference to finding it. Um,

486
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,560
um,
a marital partner,

487
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,400
the one to day two, it,
uh, and who the, uh, uh,

488
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,590
considered to marry,
uh, um, occasionally Vr,

489
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,600
uh, uh, we tried to find somebody
who is more similar than we are.

490
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,890
Um, and people voc. Well,
uh, you look like a,

491
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,480
if you are heterosexual, I
brothers and sisters, uh,

492
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:31,430
or if you are a gay, then you look
like brothers or like sisters,

493
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,900
right? You look seen, you, you look,
look similar and that can be right.

494
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,240
A consideration for elastic partnership.

495
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:43,500
I'm trying to find somebody who
likes the same stuff. What I like,

496
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,680
who is like me, right? But it can
be the opposite as well, right?

497
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,290
You may be looking for that person.
You know,

498
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,690
you may follow the logic of
organic solidarity, right? Uh,

499
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,650
you may be looking for a person who
will compliment you. All right? Uh,

500
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,380
I'm bad in keeping the books. Uh, uh,

501
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,390
and therefore, uh, what I'm
trying to look for a rod,

502
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:12,660
if somebody who view balanced
the checkbook, right? Um, uh,

503
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,540
so occasionally looking for a partner,

504
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,040
we are looking for somebody
who will compliment us.

505
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:25,310
Now that describes a right modern society
with a higher level of division of

506
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:28,920
Labor, division of labor, he says,

507
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,060
can bring us together, um, uh, March,

508
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,390
like,
uh,

509
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,490
the body of the organism that we are
performing different functions in society.

510
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,200
We compliment each other.

511
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,380
They need each other on the basis
of our differences rather than our

512
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,340
similarities. Um, uh, and the, in fact,

513
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:56,300
the contractual law expresses the spirit,

514
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,110
the AF organic solidarity as such.
Well,

515
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,240
uh, Durkheim veal, uh,

516
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,560
show us that there is a, in fact, uh,

517
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,870
a lot of trouble in the transition
from Oregon from mechanical to organic

518
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:17,840
solidarity,
and this is what he will call anime,

519
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:22,620
uh, in the transition from
mechanical to organic Saudi Daddy,

520
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,160
the moving from a traditional
society through our modern society,

521
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,260
our value system breaks down.

522
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,750
We find ourself in the
situation of anime about,

523
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,750
this is a topic I've, you'll be
talking about, uh, uh, jurors there.

524
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,250
Thank you very much.
