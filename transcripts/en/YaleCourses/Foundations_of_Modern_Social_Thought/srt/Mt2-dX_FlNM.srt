1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,320
So today Vivia we'll be talking about
the German ideology and Mark's becoming a

2
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:12,450
historical materialist.
Um,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,680
I just wanted to make a couple of more
comments about the thesis on the fire of

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,330
our marks is on the edge moving away
from naturalism or to historical

5
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:30,270
materialism or, um, but uh,

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,360
the emphasis and the thesis on
fiber is not so much on materialism,

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,860
but it is much more on a praxis.

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,370
Uh,
action change.

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,090
The lack of determination marks as
I materialist is usually seen as a

10
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:56,910
determinist.

11
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,340
And if you took other courses where
march was, march was stashed upon,

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,790
you were probably told marks
is a determinist economic
determinist and there's a

13
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,830
lot of to it,

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,930
but half truths and he's
struggling in the dcis on fire.

15
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,890
But, um, as I said,

16
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,600
he's on his way from
naturalism to materialism.

17
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,410
And the central idea is, as I said, Baxis

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,500
human practices.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,280
And that's why I put down on the slides
that it is a kind of dialectical about

20
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:47,181
Mark's represents in the thesis on fire
back now might seem self very rarely

21
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:53,180
used the term dialectic. God. Uh,

22
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,190
he had a clear enough mind to be
suspicious about the word dialectics,

23
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,080
a valance at an old age.

24
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:08,340
He wrote a letter to angles and he said,

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,350
uh, you know, Frederick,

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,120
what that I don't know what something.

27
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,170
Then I say it is dialectical,
right?

28
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,740
So the I on insulin,

29
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:27,741
you couldn't really find out what the
relationship between two phenomena is.

30
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,410
Then you say, well this is the car. Well,

31
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,450
it's a bit too simplistic.

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,460
Don't derm dialectical as
I am sure you all know, go,

33
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,740
go back to Greek philosophy.

34
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,890
But even in Greek philosophy,

35
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:48,891
the idea of dialectics was
emphasizing change and the process,

36
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,850
a theme as Greek philosopher once said,

37
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:57,600
and that jazz to capture
the essence of dialectics,

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,320
you cannot in the same river twice because
if you step in the river five minutes

39
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:11,650
later, that is not quite the same
liver because the water is gone.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,810
This is a different water,
right?

41
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,410
So the dialectics means that the
word is in flux is in change.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,760
That's I think one important idea.
Dialectics.

43
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,000
And in the thesis on Feuerbach,

44
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,570
Marx emphasizes right that we are changing
the world now they're just taking it

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
right in this sense he is dialectical
and this is why he still has this

46
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,260
materialism.
And the tournament is there is another,

47
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,830
um, uh, um,

48
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,890
more contemporary adaptation
of the word dialectics,

49
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,980
which comes from Garel Kagel.

50
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,740
And Mark's again was shying
away to use it very often,

51
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,190
but his friend Frederick Engels use it.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,730
He even said that it's a
dialectical materialism and me,

53
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,070
the distinction between historical
and dialectical materialism.

54
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,160
Now,
what was dialectics in Hagar?

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,540
He got us trying to capturing
the process of change right?

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,670
Already in Greek philosophy,

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,880
the dialect auditions emphasized
that if you are looking at the verb,

58
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:34,150
this is not a picture,
it is a movie, right?

59
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,630
And every minute you
see something different,

60
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,410
now he go try to come to terms with what
is the essence of this change and this

61
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,510
essence of these change.
He was looking at contradictions,

62
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,830
contradictions,
drive the change.

63
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,330
So he got made a big
distinction between these,

64
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,640
these entities is and synthesis.

65
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,410
So the change,

66
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:09,820
what dialectics captures
normally in social life,

67
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,580
it starts with the thesis,
right?

68
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,640
An actual conditions and entities is
which is the negation of their situation

69
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,230
and then it leads to a synthesis,

70
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,350
which is the negation of the negation,
right?

71
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,770
In some ways the original condition is
reconstituted but in a different way as

72
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,550
Hagar put it,

73
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,320
reserving good by abolishing yet right.

74
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,600
That's the he'd Guardian
inside what actually was a,

75
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,620
this kind of logic was a
attractive to marks and a Marxist.

76
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:56,730
Anyways, so this is dialectical
and marks from dialectical,

77
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,740
from the philosophy of practices where
praxis is the crucial eventually move

78
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:08,141
stove arts and more clearly
the terministic positivistic
social science in which

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,390
you have a very clear idea
of what is the key because,

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,500
and the concept Vance's right.
Uh,

81
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:23,501
doing very much but positive is social
science is doing today identifying the

82
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,931
dependent variable and independent
variable to come up with a hypotheses,

83
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,620
how the dependent variable veal cause
variation in the independent variable of

84
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:44,741
your cost variation in the dependent
variable and then to describe it,

85
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,560
that is very much the mature marks.

86
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,640
And because march was
moving into, uh, today,

87
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,320
Viveo call it normal science,

88
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,990
he becomes a real scientist.

89
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,150
Evolves is becoming so much of a
scientist that that volume point,

90
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:10,151
he began to a doubt that is much sense
to make a distinction between social

91
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,390
sciences and sciences.

92
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,500
He himself began to see himself
as the Darvin of social sciences.

93
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,400
You've are so much attracted
with scientific reasoning,

94
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,210
delete marks the second mark.

95
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:34,880
So maybe we'll start talking about that.

96
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:39,881
He actually fought a vile consider to
dedicate the book capital to Charles

97
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,460
Darvey because he saw himself
as doing for human history.

98
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,810
But Mark's did to the
evolution of the species.

99
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,700
He wanted to do an evolution
of human societies.

100
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,720
Now, luckily for Marx, he
did not do that, right?

101
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,550
He did not become a social Darwinist.
Right.

102
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,420
He resisted that temptation,
but he was stemmed it.

103
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,900
Okay. I just want to go
back very briefly to, uh,

104
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,740
to thesis on fire bath because
they are very important,

105
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,540
right? And this is the idea, right?

106
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,810
He is now criticizing cried Feuerbach.

107
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,060
And the problem with fire back,

108
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:37,061
he said that foyer Feuerbach and other
people who've are materialists before

109
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,450
him,
right?

110
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,870
They thought that there are the
things outside their objective decks,

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,600
the are outside of the subject.

112
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,560
This creates and knowledge
about these object.

113
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,860
He crawled that Gig and stomped object
and the knowledge is nothing else but a

114
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:09,591
reflection in human mind of the object
outside that this is a very typical

115
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,140
theory of truth, right? Uh,

116
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,060
very vitally share today and
probably our theory of tools,

117
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,360
but many of you in this room share
right then is your knowledge accurate?

118
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,210
You think about your mind as a mirror.

119
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,080
If the image of the object or the
objective world outside is accurately

120
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,480
reflected in the mirror of your mind,
then you got it right.

121
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,020
So what we try to do is to have the most
perfect mirror in our mind and capture

122
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,820
the objective reality as precisely
as much in detail as possible.

123
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,630
Well,
mark says,

124
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,340
this is simply a ref,
uh,

125
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,650
uh,
you know,

126
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,980
reflection and this should go beyond that,
right?

127
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,323
He said,

128
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,960
what is good about what Feuerbach
dead or what is good about a phone,

129
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,540
for instance,
what Hmong desk cured did.

130
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,520
These were the two people we
discussed so far over clearly,

131
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,900
you know,
um,

132
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,160
material it slammed me and hops was
pretty much and materialist as well,

133
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,440
right? Believing that this is
sort of biological conditions,

134
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,110
did you dive us and makes us what we are?

135
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,910
So they all start the
throne sensuousness right?

136
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,200
That the,

137
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,200
the reality is something what we
can get that through our senses,

138
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,930
right?
We smelly it to be touchy to see it.

139
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,890
And unless we touched it,
we see it, we smell it,

140
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,050
we doubt read that it exists. Right?
There's the difference, right?

141
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:10,950
Between materialists and idealist ideas.

142
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:14,640
You don't get through
your senses, right? Uh,

143
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:19,470
you get it through your
mind, but he said, this is,

144
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,010
these materialism is censures only
in the sense of contemplation.

145
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,890
The object is outside of the subject
and you get a grasp of it through your

146
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:34,530
senses. And he said, well,

147
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,830
but what I am suggesting in
my new approach is sensors or,

148
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,260
right,
but a census,

149
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:47,310
human activity and activity as such.

150
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,990
I mentioned very briefly
that this last lecture,

151
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,510
let me just may come
back to this point again.

152
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,310
This is what you're going
to harbor mass. Um, the, uh,

153
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,700
arguably the greatest philosopher
of the 20th century. Well,

154
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,740
he's still alive, but you may, you know,

155
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,230
the 21st century has a long
way to go to the side. Oh,

156
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,660
the will be the greatest philosopher,
but many things that you're going to,

157
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,450
harbor mass was the greatest
philosopher of the 20th century.

158
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,600
He said, well, yes, uh, uh,

159
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,680
mice in the thesis on fire Bar
is right hip. At one point.

160
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,713
I mean,

161
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,170
hubber must had his culture turn
moved away from materialism,

162
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,240
but in most of his life,
he said,

163
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:45,241
I am a material list because I also
believe that the ultimate reality has to

164
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,090
come through sensors,

165
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,070
experiences through the
senses. Right? But he said,

166
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,250
Mark's literature on the mature marks
became reductionist because the sensors

167
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:06,190
activity, he identified
the, the economy, right?

168
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,820
We production the economic activities.

169
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,260
And he said in the thesis on fire,
but he got it right.

170
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,310
Oh,
sensors activity our material.

171
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,940
So therefore he says,

172
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,190
let us not simply limit
our analysis to production,

173
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,120
but let's look at human interaction
then the interact with each other.

174
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,700
And this is also as sensors activity,
right?

175
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,750
So he creates peace between
Zygmunt Fried and Karl Marx.

176
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,330
Many people try to do that right now.

177
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:51,331
This is not an opposition that it is
either production or your sexual drives.

178
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,870
You know,
you're a sexual drives.

179
00:13:55,871 --> 00:14:00,871
Your sexual interaction with
others is very much sensors.

180
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:02,050
Right?

181
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,940
It's actually more
sensors than doing a job.

182
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:08,680
Right. Then, you know,

183
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,681
being in a Mac Donald's
and serving hamburgers,

184
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,770
that sensors activity,
but or, right. You know,

185
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,820
sexually introduction
is very much sensors.

186
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,370
That's a harbor must point and
marks in the thesis on fire,

187
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:29,860
but opens this book possibility up.

188
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,750
It's a very open argument. Okay. Uh,

189
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,830
this is actually one of the
reasons why he does not publish it.

190
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,670
It's still vague.
He wanted to be more precise.

191
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,410
And then he wanted to go,

192
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,440
he was reading Adam Smith and Ricardo
and spent all of his time in the British

193
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:54,510
library, these economists and
she volunteers to be bang,

194
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,820
bring it back down to earth to echo
the economy and economic interest.

195
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,350
And now let me start to this because
I think that's very important.

196
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,730
The theory of truths.
And I want you to think about it.

197
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,390
I think this is very interesting.
So what is true

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,310
and to be very simplistic,
right?

199
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,750
You have two competing theories of truths.

200
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,520
One theory of choose,

201
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,540
but I think most of you have in your
mind is the kind of reflection theory of

202
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:37,931
truths that our mind is
a mirror more accurately.

203
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:43,060
It reflects the objective
reality out there. Uh,

204
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,050
more chew the knowledge.
What we have in our mind is,

205
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,170
um, marks in the thesis
on fire bar says not. So

206
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,850
the choose is a practical question.

207
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,930
The problem with the reflection theory
of choose is that it is positive list and

208
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,060
it is.

209
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,060
Eliana did I throw in another word coined
by a major Marxist philosopher of the

210
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:24,170
20th century gorilla glue couch.
He guarded.

211
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,200
This is re fied consciousness re fied.

212
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,840
You know,

213
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Lucas was writing in German and in German
he used the term fair Dingley Hoang

214
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,890
they ink means to thing. I think
ratification is a very good translation.

215
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,230
Only those of us who speak English about
Dumas speak Latin don't necessarily

216
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:53,300
require get it right.

217
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,890
[inaudible] in Latin means the think ray
fication is the process in which return

218
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:07,040
stuff, but she's what is not
a thing into an objective.

219
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:12,041
Think it's a kind of fright look Kashian
reinterpretation of Mark's notion of

220
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,500
alienation.
Mark Stern,

221
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:23,501
right in German for a vacation
was and three [inaudible] framed.

222
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:27,560
That means, uh, alien, right?

223
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:30,380
So alienation is a good translation,
right?

224
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,160
You are alienated if you feel alien,

225
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:38,600
if you'll feel homeless in this world.
Now I think,

226
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,410
but look, uh, look, arch has
an interesting idea, right?

227
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,680
That the essence of alienation is
when we're beginning to see the world.

228
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,410
But actually we created the work.
It worked, this out creation.

229
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,680
I this as this objective world via rules.

230
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,140
We do not see ourself as
the masters of the world,

231
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,990
but we see ourselves as
ruled by the verdict,

232
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,020
right?
And this is the ray five consciousness.

233
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,490
When we beginning to see
the objective reality,

234
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,550
we cannot do anything about it,
right?

235
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,060
And the essence is the
philosophy of practices of
the young Marx ending with the

236
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:28,980
thesis on fire.
But the point is to change it.

237
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,640
The point is to change the world. So, uh,

238
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,400
in contemporary, uh, this course,

239
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,210
we usually call this positivism,
right?

240
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,990
Positivists are those social scientists
who think that our objective facts out

241
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:53,811
of there and the purpose of social
investigation is to establish the most

242
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,740
objectively and most concretely what
those objective social facts are.

243
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,710
You are an economist. You describe
the objective facts, right?

244
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,100
You say,
Val,

245
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,110
you have to maximize profit because
if you do not maximize profit,

246
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,000
then you will be vived out of business,
right?

247
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,140
This is almost like the force of nature.

248
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,390
Again, if I can recall, uh, uh,

249
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,980
yarrow glow catch,
he coined these wonderful term,

250
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,340
second nature,
right?

251
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,670
That's the beginning to think about
social life as if it were natural,

252
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,960
as if it would have the power of nature.

253
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,480
The economic laws look like lightening,

254
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,550
you know, like, you know,

255
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:57,330
this forced really like earth scrapes you.

256
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,860
We can't do virtually
nothing about earthquake. I,

257
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:04,470
if we can predict what we can't predict,

258
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,040
we just can't get into our
car and get out of it, right?

259
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,630
But even we cannot really
predict earthquakes. That's
one of the problems, right?

260
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,340
Well, now we can predict when a
hurricane is coming, what can we do?

261
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,680
You get in the car and get out of there
where the hurricane and we are calm now,

262
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,990
you know, uh, the point
is that positive is,

263
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,901
does posts,

264
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:32,901
it's social phenomena as if
they had the force of nature.

265
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,790
And that's what [inaudible] called
the coronate, the social of word,

266
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,040
as if it were second nature.
As if had the force of nature.

267
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,420
They said, this is all wrong
because this is the road.

268
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,930
What we created this should
the rule it all right?

269
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,980
That's the idea to overcome Aliya nation
to become the master of your fate,

270
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,920
right? To be able, right,

271
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,570
to change the objective conditions.
And you know,

272
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:08,560
in the German ideology marks puts
it very, very powerful. It's,

273
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,050
I will say it is almost the last word,

274
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:14,480
but in this debate he sat bosses sad.

275
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,380
I don't think anybody really
improved on it. He said, well,

276
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,100
humans change their conditions,

277
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,610
but we were born under certain certain
conditions and we can only change the

278
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,400
conditions we were born into.
Right?

279
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,330
So it's an interesting
interaction between, yes,

280
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,790
I mean the county to do anything,
right,

281
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,170
because we were born into conditions,
but we seen some limits.

282
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:47,280
We can change those
conditions by the vase,

283
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,890
not all that different from hops,
right?

284
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,060
And voluntary action.
The theory of voluntary action.

285
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,680
There is a similarity here.
Now I finish this and get on to the,

286
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,290
uh, German ideology that that is
one thing, but I cannot leave out,

287
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,893
uh,
uh,

288
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,160
I think too insightful and
important to leave it out.

289
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,320
So let me come back to the
subject and object shoe, right?

290
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,240
What I've suggested.
It is so extremely important,

291
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,510
not only for marks but for the whole
critical theory and the in fact a four NT

292
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:34,201
positivism of all sorts in
the 20th and 21st century.

293
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,040
Uh, I mentioned for
instance, cultural theory,

294
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,710
which is very strongly anti positivist,

295
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:46,240
right and rejects social
science as normal science.

296
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,990
So what we have is right, uh, subject

297
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,350
and that is you, right? The,

298
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,620
the person who has a consciousness and

299
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,320
okay

300
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,710
is a cognitive south.

301
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,900
A subject is involved
in cognitive activity,

302
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,960
creating knowledge and then that are
objects about which be create a march,

303
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,533
uh,

304
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,330
ref lecture on theory of,

305
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:22,331
to sad that this is a mirror and
if the objects are accurately,

306
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,050
um, uh, um,

307
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,270
described in the mirror of our mind,
that is true.

308
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,380
This is the whole test of having
verification of hypotheses,

309
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,290
right?
I develop a hypotheses,

310
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,710
then I go there and test it on the
social reality and if it is matches,

311
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,040
then it is verified.

312
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,550
I got through right now
the philosophy of breath.

313
00:23:56,391 --> 00:24:01,391
She says the tools is not
simply a reflection is an
introduction between subject

314
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:07,810
and object.
That's about through cities.

315
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,900
And that is this a
wonderful,

316
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,320
a few Lasha for not that easy to read.
Uh,

317
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,210
but still I think Vonda flew mind.
His name is Adora.

318
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,044
No,

319
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,501
I don't know.

320
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:36,501
Belonged to the Frankfurt school and was
active mainly in the 1940s and sixties

321
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,970
there.
Theism sixties and Bella,

322
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:44,970
he formulated the soul power fully.

323
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,950
[inaudible] sad what is true.
He said,

324
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:54,951
the truth is the force field between
subject and object are not simply a

325
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:00,780
reflection of the object,

326
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,610
but it is between the tension
of subject and object. Right?

327
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,760
I think this is beautiful.
The darn right.

328
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,830
It is in the force field
of subject and object.

329
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,510
Uh, so, uh,

330
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,310
let me also add one more point
and then we can move away, uh,

331
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
the theory of truth.

332
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,290
But I want you guys to
think about what East Jews,

333
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,780
right? Ben, can you say an idea is true?

334
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,810
In fact, Adorno at one
point says about Nazis, man,

335
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,590
you know, he, he said experiencing,

336
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:47,040
he was Jewish.
Shan's Manny off his family,

337
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,090
killed right by the Nazis.
And he said,

338
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,320
the reality [inaudible] reality is so
measurable that it does not deserve to be

339
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:03,570
called true.
You see the point,

340
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,980
you also say that occasionally when you
say something horrible and you can say

341
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,490
no, that cannot be true, right?

342
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,580
This is exactly our door.
Most point,

343
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,830
these can be so miserable that
you say it cannot be true.

344
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:28,831
And the idea is that the
are sure miserable that you
are completely bow or less

345
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:34,660
nervous about this nature like forces do.
It is unacceptable,

346
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,710
right? You should be able to
do something about it, right?

347
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,950
They should have been able to do something
about Auschwitz and they could not do

348
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:46,950
anything about it. And
that's what our door, no sad.

349
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,230
These are reality was such that
it should not be called true.

350
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,270
It cannot be throughs.

351
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,870
You see what it is getting a very final
point about this theory of truth and

352
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:04,530
this is through another guy,
Karl Mannheim.

353
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,313
Okay.

354
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,590
This is very much along these line.
He was very much not a Marxist.

355
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,870
It was a conservative philosopher.
Uh,

356
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,730
his major work was done in England.
Um,

357
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,640
and Manheim once said,

358
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,700
the truth is not being
the truth is becoming

359
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,910
Bingo.
Right?

360
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,790
Wonderful reports,
right?

361
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,800
The juice is not simply that
you describe how things are,

362
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,290
you really know about.

363
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:57,291
The truth is when you know what it
can be and what you can do about it,

364
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,130
the real purpose of cognition is,

365
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,140
is not simply to describe the
word, but to change it, right?

366
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,730
To make it a better world.
That's when you have real truths,

367
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,580
when you know how to make
the world better, right?

368
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,090
So the truth is not being but becoming.

369
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,280
And that's the philosophy of practices.

370
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,040
But I think that's where
Mark's is, um, in, uh, uh, uh,

371
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,070
writing that these are some fire buff
and that's what he is moving away from

372
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,750
when he,
uh,

373
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,110
beginning carite the German ideology,

374
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,973
uh,

375
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,590
what is he writing together,
which read Frederick Engels, uh,

376
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,950
and now you see he has to abandon,
he,

377
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,800
he cannot publish the book,

378
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,720
the thesis on fire because it
is too voluntaristic. Right?

379
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,790
He abandoned the Paris
manuscript because it was fluffy,

380
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,840
right?

381
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Nobody would believe me
that the revolution Viacom
because the proletariat is

382
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,430
alienated. And then when
he finished, I think this,

383
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,300
I mean,
not all 11 sentences are great,

384
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,690
but some of those sentences
are really great sentences.

385
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,520
He wrote it down and he never
published it because he said, well,

386
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,980
this is still voluntary stick,
right?

387
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,130
I have to come up with a more curative,

388
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,950
which we approved the Paul that the
level of [inaudible] meal come capitalism

389
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:38,120
has to fall.

390
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,580
It is not only a question whether we
decide to change it or we don't have to

391
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,510
change it,
right?

392
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,550
I have to come up with a theory which
we approve that capitalism will have to

393
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:49,750
fall,
right?

394
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,190
That's what puts him into
the deterministic mode.

395
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,690
He actually never becomes real
in deterministic. It's uh, uh,

396
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,540
a very simplistic reading of Marx.
You know,

397
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:05,470
after all this guy is a
theorist of the revolution,

398
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,680
he sold that revolutionary idea
should be put into people's head.

399
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,371
Hit this idea.

400
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:17,320
I did not think that ideas do not matter
if he would have believe ideas do not

401
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:21,520
match her. He will not have spent, you
know, all of his Sam eight in the morning,

402
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,470
nine until 9:00 PM in the British library.
And writing books,

403
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,120
right? If ideas do not match her, if I do,

404
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:34,121
you write down ideas because he believed
that ideas for change the world,

405
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,750
right? So he was never
completely a deterministic.

406
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,940
But in the nature of divert,
he's moving Dover's economic determinism.

407
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:48,210
And the reason is that now he
wants to blue that capitalism.

408
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,500
Yes,
it had great achievement.

409
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,040
If during the time of capitalism
society developed more than ever before,

410
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:03,040
uh, capitalism, but nevertheless
it, you'll have to come an end.

411
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,050
Capitalism, they are not last forever
and now he has to prove that these,

412
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,360
that it must come to an end.

413
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,070
So that puts him on a
deterministic trajectory.

414
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,890
That's what makes him,
he has to become,

415
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,720
he has to accept materialism,
that material conditions,

416
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,290
that term mine,
human action and consciousness.

417
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,660
So that's what he does. He,
they are beginning to develop
in the German ideology.

418
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,870
And this is the structure of the book.

419
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:39,090
The first ship that is a critique on fire.
Uh,

420
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,500
Dave's on from the thesis on fire back,

421
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,830
but by tens the argument and becomes
strictly materialist and gets out of these

422
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:52,290
voluntary stick element.
He has some introductory remarks,

423
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:57,291
him about critique of idealism and the
premises of the new materialism he is

424
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,750
proposing now,
but he's beginning to call him now.

425
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,820
He's StoryCorps materialism stays away
from the word dialectic the car and then

426
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:12,750
he develops thrive and material.

427
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:17,700
His conception of history and
historical development. Uh,

428
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,980
he replaces Adam Smith's
categorization of societies as hunting,

429
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:25,770
gathering, um, uh,

430
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,260
grazing agriculture or commercial.

431
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,480
But I knew type ology these new type
Ology of you will be the type Ology of the

432
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,150
modes of production.
Uh,

433
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,920
not in fact in the ideology.

434
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:43,700
He stays pretty close to Adam
Smith's cyber. Your point, the south,

435
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,320
and this is one of his problems.

436
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:50,321
This is one of the reasons by the German
ideology was also left unfinished and

437
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,540
unpublished.
Right as I,

438
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,720
as I indicated it was first
published and not the complete text,

439
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,950
only in 1903,

440
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,850
well after the death of Marx and Engels,

441
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,040
then he was right.
It's about the origins of idealists,

442
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,070
conception of history. There it
is coming from, uh, he's rights,

443
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:21,071
thinking about the development of
productive forces and eventually,

444
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,850
uh, this covers the notion
of relations of production.

445
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,010
I've you make a big deal
out of this because I,

446
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,040
I think that's one of the reasons that
the German ideology fails that until the

447
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:36,200
very end.

448
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,060
He does not know the term of
relations of production and he,

449
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:41,400
uh,

450
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,400
he runs into some very big problems and
then he dies on lunar bower and Mexico

451
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,970
in there.
These are young here.

452
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Galleons people usually don't read
these chapters and volume two,

453
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,690
I mean, you must be a Marx Marx
expert to read this. This is reality.

454
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,950
Basically irrelevant. Not
Very interesting. Okay.

455
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:07,760
What are the major themes
in the German ideology?

456
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,720
First he offers a
materialist view of history.

457
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,380
Then he offers a theory
of modes of production.

458
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,900
Then he beginning to develop
forces of production.

459
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,300
Um, and initially division of
Labor. And this is a problem.

460
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:28,830
This is very much Adam Smith.

461
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:33,831
She's still very strongly on under Adam
Smith and understands the evolution of

462
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:39,320
society as the evolution of division
of Labor. And then he describes,

463
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:39,860
uh,

464
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,660
ties to describe the forces of
production and division of Labor,

465
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,290
uh,

466
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:50,150
more so production and describes subsect
fan most of production and give her

467
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:54,950
view about how human history and
then he develops. But I would call,

468
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:58,370
he's the first who creates
a sociology Maraloge,

469
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,280
how to study sociological.

470
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:06,050
He's socially how you can understand
conscience who human consciousness.

471
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,080
Okay.
So the materials view of history.

472
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:14,081
And now here you can see
marks the positivist social
scientists speaking and in

473
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,210
mice is the first of positive is
social scientist rigorous positive is

474
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,164
scientists.

475
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:28,580
And what he's describes here
will be subscribed and accepted.

476
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Most of the positive is stipes in
your political science or sociology or

477
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,280
economics or psychology departments,
right?

478
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,280
This at the premises from which we begin
with are not arbitrary once now dogmas

479
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,740
about real Ramesses from
which abstractions can only
be made in the imagination.

480
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:00,410
So you start from the objective conditions
and then you speculate from this.

481
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,710
So what we start our,

482
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:07,711
our real individuals and the activities
of these individual actual activities of

483
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:14,600
these individuals. Um, and
then he moves what most,

484
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:15,610
a little Ford,
their,

485
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,650
their conditions of life both
for the find already existing.

486
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,350
And those were the produce
by that activities, right?

487
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,520
So he said, German philosophers
there send it from uh, uh,

488
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,660
uh, uh, uh, the heaven to earth.

489
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,230
Now the artists sending from
Earth to have her right,

490
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,980
you do not deduction.
We do induction.

491
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:47,220
This is the inductive method.
What we use.

492
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,760
And if you add a positivist,
Uva, love it. You see,

493
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:55,530
this is real serious science,
right? Looking at facts.

494
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,190
And then he said, well,
ideas have no history,

495
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,670
no development man developing the
material conditions and their material

496
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:09,360
intercourse, uh, uh,
altered their thinking.

497
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,840
So it is really our material existence,

498
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,980
which has a history and
ideas reflect doors,

499
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:18,630
material conditions.

500
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:23,730
Then then he beginnings to develop the
theory of most of production. He said,

501
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:28,530
well man can distinguish from
animals in different ways.

502
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,040
But most important is that we produce
that we change the environment in a

503
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:38,850
purposeful manner, right?
That he had an image,

504
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:43,851
how to change the physical environment
for us and what lecturey actually

505
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:47,370
mattress is not simply what we produce.

506
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,380
And this is a very important idea,
but the mood of production,

507
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,760
how the produce,
how the Yankee gauge each other.

508
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,840
Because this will change in history since
not simply what we produce. You know,

509
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,360
this is a revolutionary idea.
Again, this is completely new.

510
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,020
In March,

511
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,020
before Numarx you went into a museum
and the museum was about great people,

512
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,053
right?

513
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,860
These were kings and Queens
and genitals and boobs,

514
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,890
whose pictures for presented that,

515
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:25,890
and this is the way how
history was described.

516
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,260
Now you go into a historian,
now you can see this is the living room,

517
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:34,200
how people lived in a Roman times,

518
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,230
and this is the way how they ate.
This is the way how they cooked.

519
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,560
And these are the instrument by
which they produce the stuff,

520
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:43,500
what they cooked in the kitchen.
All right,

521
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,460
this is how a modern
historical museum look slide.

522
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,880
And this comes,
this is really a revolution from March.

523
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,090
History is not the history of great ideas
and great man or great the men history

524
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,110
is the idea of the actual they,

525
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:06,200
how people lived and produced
and reproduced their, uh,

526
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,240
ideas. Now he said, well,

527
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,620
we can distinguish therefore
a differences between nature,

528
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,680
how the productive forces and he means
by technology is developing and how he

529
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:26,911
uses initially the term the Inter
intercourse internal interest course is

530
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,930
changing. And by this here, the
first two division of labor,

531
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,530
that is Smithian idea of
Adam Smith's idea, right?

532
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,610
That history of wolves,
of greater division of Labor.

533
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,480
They will see in Emil Durkheim
also the central idea.

534
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:48,130
You can see the evolution of society
by increasing division of Labor.

535
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,720
Um,

536
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,720
and then he cries to come up with
subsequent he molds of production.

537
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:55,991
Now he said,

538
00:39:55,991 --> 00:40:00,991
now I actually can discard the history
as different types of mood of protocol

539
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,260
production. Uh, moving
from elementary forms.

540
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,290
So most elementary form is tribal society
in tribal society that the technology

541
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,790
is very simple and that is
very little division of labor.

542
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:21,060
He is sexist enough to say there is a
natural division of labor between man and

543
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,740
a man.
Man,

544
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:28,741
go hunting and women go collecting
goods in the forest and that he calls

545
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:34,470
natural. This is of course a
sexist proposition. Loud, you know,

546
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,040
he was writing, it's,
you know, in 1845, uh,

547
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,270
was not the only man who was sexist.

548
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,940
Now the second four ms, he said,
ancient communal or state proper,

549
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,140
the antiquity.

550
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,650
Now you have development of forces
of production and in fact you have a

551
00:40:55,721 --> 00:41:00,721
separation of ownership and greater
division of Labor that now people can

552
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:04,750
produce more than necessarily
for their survival.

553
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,190
Therefore there will be slaves who were
working day and night and there there'll

554
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:13,990
be philosophers who sit in Athens
and Rome and have great ideas,

555
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,260
right?
They caused the slaves producer stuff,

556
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,510
what they can eat and they can enjoy.

557
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,400
So the division of Labor
evolves and then the cure.

558
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:30,500
Now we have the evolution of
few dollars. Well, slaves,

559
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,550
you're a great producing,
cheap bog.

560
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,560
The problem with sleeves that they did
not have Nazi Shin Incentive to use a

561
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,210
very complicated technology.

562
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:46,390
You had to supervise them very closely
because they really hated your guts.

563
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:50,900
And if they could, they didn't break
right? The instruments, if they could.

564
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,310
So he will did not want to give them
complex technologies. Saw you invent,

565
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:57,500
served on, you say, you know,

566
00:41:57,501 --> 00:42:00,320
why don't you become a
surf rather than a slave.

567
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,500
You can have your house and I give
you a piece of land and if you behave

568
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:09,830
yourself two days, you were
on my ass stage. Right?

569
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,250
And you produce stuff for me and I
let you to spend the rest of the week

570
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,263
producing for yourself.

571
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,570
But the big problem is that
the evolution of few dollars,

572
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,500
the fall of Rome and Greece,
um, and uh, you know,

573
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:32,120
rise of Sharla mine. Yeah. And you
know, the dark and Middle Ages,

574
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,370
the division of labor,

575
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:39,371
the not have a law that was last
division of Labor in the 11th century,

576
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:42,980
12th century than it was in
the first and second century.

577
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,880
So the methodology breaks down.

578
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:52,160
She was in deep trouble and as
you can see, you can either text,

579
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,390
he leaves after this,
the page blank, he said,

580
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,580
I'm in trouble, right? I have
to start this all over again.

581
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:05,770
And he starts all over
again and tries to come off.

582
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,410
It's something better now.
Sociology of knowledge,

583
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,020
very important contribution.

584
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,460
This is on the fortunately
completely wrong. What you say,

585
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,850
but the methodology is extremely important
and informed people who were studying

586
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,210
cognition and knowledge ever since.

587
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,720
And he makes these very
important a suggestion.

588
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,140
They'll life that termites consciousness
rather than the other way around.

589
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,930
And the other argument, which I
think is desperately wrong, uh,

590
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,740
but very insightful ruling
class, uh, all of us,

591
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,850
uh,
debtor,

592
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,080
your ruling guardians of each epoch now
live debtor minds consciousness and this

593
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:57,440
is a kind of the essence
right of materialism, right?

594
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,280
Definite individuals who are productive,

595
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:03,320
reactive in definite way,

596
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:08,330
m curled into definite social
and political relationships.

597
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,200
The production of ideas is the first
directly interwoven with material activity

598
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,720
and the material intercourse of men.
Dare me.

599
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:25,721
You know how much money you have in
your pocket and Ivy are telling you what

600
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:30,650
your ideas are to put it very
simplistic right there on me,

601
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,690
which class you belong to and ivy,
we'll be able to tell you,

602
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,330
you write what your ideas are right now.
Indeed,

603
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:43,770
we know that is a strong class component.
For instance,

604
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,390
in voting behavior,

605
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,350
not so much in the United States
because in the United States,

606
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,240
if you are poor, you
usually do not. Whoa. Right?

607
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,100
And therefore,
you know,

608
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,130
the Democratic Party's kind of scrambling
to get a little working class road or

609
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,160
a restyle scaring,
right?

610
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:10,370
The middleclass of a for voting them
as a big traditional trouble of the

611
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,780
Democratic Party. But if you look
at Europe or you look at Australia,

612
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:20,700
the Australian Labor Party was
getting righteous shortage,

613
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:24,870
you know, very keen classroom.
So tell me, you were what right.

614
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,240
He will cast position is,
and either you're Kelly,

615
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:31,680
you how you reward in the next elections.
As I said in the U s doesn't work,

616
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,400
but it doesn't work in Sweden.
He did work in England for a long time.

617
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,240
It by enlarge worked in
Australia. Right? If you are,

618
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,780
to some extent even works in the United
States where there are some very rich

619
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:46,650
people who are Democrats,

620
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,970
but typically those guys
who are very rich, don't,

621
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:55,200
they tend to be Republican, right?
I think they probably do. All right.

622
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,870
So, I mean that, yeah, this is what Mars
is like Yeti. And yeah, try to tell me,

623
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:03,060
you know,
what your material interests are.

624
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,940
And then I tell you what is on your mind.

625
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,550
The reductionist, again,
Vivio read Zigman Fried.

626
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:16,770
He said, well, true, but this
is not only economic interests.

627
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,940
There are me,
the history of your sex life.

628
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,790
And I tell you what is
on your mind, right? Uh,

629
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,240
you know, it's analogous
argument, right? It is existence,

630
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,410
which determines consciousness,
right? Most of them said, well,

631
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:38,490
it's not necessarily true that
what you is in your mind. True.

632
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,330
But I know that it is coming from right.
You are,

633
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,090
you've earned in Lovick your
mother, right? And we have,

634
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:49,860
if you were a man and your soup
last or your desire for your mother,

635
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,300
and that's where you have, you are
these false ideas in your mind, right?

636
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,530
Well, you look good. You have a shy
girl and he would allow him factor.

637
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:00,280
You could not food field these lava.

638
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,040
So press your desire and you have all
these strange ideas that that's why you

639
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:07,560
are neurotic. Right? And
I can tell you right.

640
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,910
That's the way how it Marcel
are you, it sort of, you know,

641
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,930
this is also reduction in spite of it,
but that is a common interesting idea.

642
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:22,590
We'll VR biologically class wise,
race wise,

643
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,100
gender vice.
What makes a difference?

644
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,800
I see in the discussion
sections very often, right?

645
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,530
If you have a real hot
topic, you know, uh,

646
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,740
do you want to have universal
how scared for instance,

647
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,800
that is usually agenda division in
the class, right? Uh, so you know,

648
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:46,200
gender has an impact,
right? Not speaking about,

649
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,320
through to affirmative action,
right? Well, of course,

650
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,230
Vr in a liberal university,

651
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,650
few people dare to speak up
against affirmative action,

652
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,150
but you know, I'm all
may have EITs, males,

653
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,400
well that is usually less
articulation, right? To the fan,

654
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,260
the idea of affirmative action.

655
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,310
The men and minorities are more
likely to the family. Okay. So I,

656
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,830
I know who you are. I don't know
what your ideas, we'll be right.

657
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,810
Your interest for your ideas.
That's the idea.

658
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,810
I think this is a very important idea,
right?

659
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,930
Put in a simplistic way.

660
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:34,080
And that comes to the idea that
the ruling class, um, uh, is, uh,

661
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,740
really producing the ruling ideas bell.
Not quite true,

662
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,170
but that is an element of truth street,
right?

663
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:46,270
There is an ideological hegemony and,
okay.

664
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,080
Um,
that's about it for today.

665
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,820
Thank you.
