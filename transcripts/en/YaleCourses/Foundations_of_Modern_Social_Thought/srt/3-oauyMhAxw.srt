1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,150
Now let's go on to drone shot crews,

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:10,590
soul and Emile
and

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,100
interact with me today. I need your
help. I came back from Helsinki,

4
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,130
Finland yesterday.
I was 16 hours on the road.

5
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:24,540
I then too bad 1:00 AM so
I need your help. You know,

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,960
I want you to interact with
me and Emily is a good,

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,050
a good opportunity to interact and get
excited because it's a very important

8
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,920
tax.
As I pointed out,

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,220
there is no education or theory
base out the Russo's mal and uh,

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,070
everybody who does education has
studied Amiel from cover to cover.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,550
Most of them will disagree
with most of his ideas,

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,110
but you'll be provoked
by his ideas. Um, uh,

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,360
he is intentionally provocative,

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,010
says date switch.

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,030
Do upset you but makes you think
and don't dismiss it too easy.

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,200
Now,
before I go into a meal,

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,830
that is one more issue I would
like to come back about. Uh,

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,990
uh, um, Russo, social contract.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,770
I made this point briefly in last lecture,
but let,

20
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,190
let me make it sharper because in the
questions I am asking questions about the

21
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:33,570
General Ville and I feel I
may not have eva give, uh,

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,330
give even enough meat to you, um, uh,

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,720
about the notion of the General Vale
now before I go.

24
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,970
So I have to come back because
there is one more um, uh,

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,280
Chore Household Chore.
Um,

26
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,370
one of the teaching fellows that reminded
me that the smiths lecture of come at

27
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:58,110
the day.
Then the test is you.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,110
So what to do with this?
Uh, but I suggest, uh,

29
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,610
uh,
I will do a preview of Snitch,

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,180
a jurist day this week and I will put
my powerpoints before the lecture,

31
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,310
um, on the Internet so you can
read the powerpoints. Okay.

32
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,060
That feel yet you up in speed.
I hope you still,

33
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,110
they'll come to the lecture though.

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Those of you who are also in varieties
of capitalism course can skip because out

35
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,150
of the 50 lectures I'm
giving this semester,

36
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,110
this is the only bond which overlaps.
It is the same lecture,

37
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,860
but I was given in the
varieties of capitalism course.

38
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,430
I hope you won't ask for a discount,
right.

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,350
That the professor did sell
the same product twice. Right.

40
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
Uh,

41
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,743
uh,

42
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,200
but anyway,

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,210
so those who did that lecture that they
feel very comfortable with Swiss can

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,310
miss the lecture, but I hope
everybody else, we will come Tuesday.

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,780
Alright, now, uh, Emile
and this is something, uh,

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,270
uh, no, no. Does the gender
reveal the gender reveal?

47
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,790
I didn't finish this file so that
it is right. An interesting, uh,

48
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,140
um, corn, Shasta
development in little show,

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,460
in the theory of social contract,
uh,

50
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,740
because it was so especially emphasizes
right that the social contract has to be

51
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,710
arrived at, uh, uh, by uh, um,

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,710
a universal consent.
Uh,

53
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,420
so he does emphasize that in
that I've into a social contract.

54
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,980
Um, we actually, uh,

55
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,050
have to exercise some popular
Suva identity and this is
an idea which is only an

56
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,920
element in lock, right? In some ways,

57
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,410
Russo moves a big step forward,

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,160
contract theory and theory
towards democratic theory,

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,010
popular silver ethnicity.
And in fact,

60
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:25,011
universal suffrage I mentioned he
did not advocate suffrage for women,

61
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:30,520
but advocated otherwise
universal suffrage. Uh,

62
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,760
what block was not willing to do.

63
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,520
But there is an interesting other
idea in Rousseau, which is, uh,

64
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,103
has,
uh,

65
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,320
important Kennel of tools and a very
disturbing the audio at the same time.

66
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,400
And this is the idea of the genital Ville.

67
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,570
I talked about this as a good example
of metal dialogical collectivism,

68
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,240
right? That Rousseau unlike, um, uh,

69
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,560
uh,

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Hobbes or Locke or vive you'll see later
on meal or Adam Smith does not believe

71
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,340
that studying the individual actions,

72
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,370
we can understand what is society and
what the need of the society ears that is

73
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,490
a general veal over society,

74
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,790
which is more than simply
adding up all individual bills.

75
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,170
Um,

76
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,170
and these idea carried on in social
theory among those whom reveal,

77
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,230
discuss,
particularly by Emil Durkheim.

78
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,400
And that is clearly an
element of truth to it, right?

79
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:49,190
That there is some
universal good, right? Uh,

80
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,030
what is more than just a sum
total of individual interest?

81
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,380
Um, uh, when we are, uh,

82
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,300
you know, talking about how
scared that form, right?

83
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:07,220
And the needs of government's right
to provide health care for everybody.

84
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,380
Right?
Uh,

85
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,160
then the actually do believe that
it should not be left to individual

86
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:17,360
responsibility whether they
have house get insurance.

87
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,340
That would have to be, some people in this
room probably believed that. Right? Uh,

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,340
then you believe that that
is a General Ville, right?

89
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,610
That you have to overrule rather
individual, uh, to, uh, uh,

90
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,800
to, uh, make a decision. And you know,
that is the genital veal everywhere.

91
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,390
When you go to the college, you have
to get certain shots. So that was,

92
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:40,660
you are not allowed into
the college, right? It,

93
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,770
it is not living up to you to
decide, right. Whether you are,

94
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,780
had certain shots, they cannot, you have
to demonstrate to be in residence, right?

95
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,610
That is a general veal.

96
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,560
It's not assume that every individual is
a rational actor and people will not be

97
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,520
foolish.
Right?

98
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,620
And be irresponsible and not to
be up properly protected. You see,

99
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,690
this is a strong case that the
idea of genital veal makes sense.

100
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,080
That is some collective good.
Uh,

101
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,120
but we can understand that individual's
occasionally has to be forced to go by

102
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,410
these general bill right by the public.
Good.

103
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,320
But there is a big carb.
Love it.

104
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:29,321
The general via namely if that is a
general veal as such their own earth,

105
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,650
will it come from a how they will
know what the general deal is.

106
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,160
And Russo is an explicit about this rat.
He confronts it.

107
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,530
That's why he talks about the law
giver. He said, smart people like me,

108
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,150
we know what is good for society and
therefore we should figure it out.

109
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,170
But the genital Ville is and then the
popularly elected parliament will pass.

110
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:59,300
It is a law, but we are
the law givers. Right?

111
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,800
Well this is a very disturbing idea,
right?

112
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,530
And and disturbing idea,

113
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:11,531
which opens a Russo up to a totalitarian
interpretation that he argues that the

114
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,670
government knows better.

115
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,180
And in fact he argues that not the
government but the device philosophers,

116
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,590
v the intellectuals,

117
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,380
we know better but people into the star.

118
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,140
You think this is your interest? No,
I tell you, this is not your interest.

119
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,650
I know. What is your interest? There are,

120
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:41,651
this is a very disturbing idea how
owners do I know what is annual interest.

121
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,370
Uh, and of course, uh,

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Russo's notion of general veal appealed
a great deal to Karl Marx and Raji

123
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:57,340
middle each learning and Moussa tone.

124
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,390
They love the idea that it is the central
committee of the Communist Party who

125
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:07,881
knows better than ordinary Chinese
or Russia what their needs are.

126
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,680
There must be a central planner
rather than individual actor,

127
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,900
which tells people what their needs are.

128
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,150
So the problem of genital Ville
is highly problematic, right?

129
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,780
You can hit,

130
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,240
you can make a case for it that
you need an assumption like that.

131
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,970
As I pointed out, that our
people in this room, right,

132
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,210
who believe that that is general
villa and the common good, right?

133
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,520
Other people here,
anybody believes ah,

134
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,650
that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. There
are people in this room of course,

135
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,410
uh, uh, and that other others
who would not be Dave, that,

136
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:53,720
I mean,
if you add an econ major,

137
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:58,610
I think you got enough in economics
to say no, no, no, no. Never, ever.

138
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,580
Uh, um, okay.

139
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,290
Now let's go to Mel because it's
actually has something to do it,

140
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,780
a different formulation
with the same idea.

141
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,720
So what is the story about Mel?

142
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,923
It's uh,

143
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,280
of course he himself is shock.

144
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,320
Um, and uh, he doused
us that he is a cheater,

145
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,900
a Alpha boy,
Mel,

146
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,530
and educate him from the early age is on
theall reaches adult hood and finds his

147
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,810
wife Sophie.

148
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,490
I told you of course that this is a very
idealized Rousseau because he put all

149
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:46,430
of his children in to orphanage,

150
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,460
employ a very lousy orphanage and
probably most of them or all of them very

151
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,350
early died in this orphanage.
But you know, uh, he's still

152
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,140
has ideas what he should have done if he
would not have been a bastard and will

153
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,360
not have that band on his children.

154
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,180
So what is the table of contents first?
He says,

155
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,050
well,
we have two rare,

156
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,000
a civilize savage,

157
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,180
a child born in the state of
nature in infancy and Chai.

158
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:28,671
Two and three of the lessons is a
gradual transformation from the state of

159
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,520
nature into society. Uh, then, um,

160
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,190
he, uh, Ben, uh,

161
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:40,191
adolescence comes then we have a fully
form App Tomeki individual by now and we

162
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,570
have to bring that person into society.

163
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,570
Okay.

164
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,660
And then,
uh,

165
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,680
he has these very complicated idea
that this transition from the anatomic

166
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,670
individual and state of nature to severe
society is that transition from our

167
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,840
more the salon to are more pro per a val.

168
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:14,410
This is a very complex concept.

169
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,930
Russo could have been more lucid
about what the difference is.

170
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,490
Then he laws, uh, uh, also, uh,

171
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,480
from English.

172
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:30,481
You think you understand it more easily
than you actually do because proper in

173
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,770
a,
in a franchise does not mean proper.

174
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,880
Proper also means myself.

175
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,740
Proper only means myself in
consideration with others.

176
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,660
Soya beans myself, besides
consideration of others, right?

177
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,590
So be careful, right? Uh, um,

178
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:58,190
were proper is not proper love,
right?

179
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,130
It is a self lava,

180
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,410
but of a self love in which
I do take into consideration.

181
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,610
I have had not only Egl
to put it with, uh, uh,

182
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,020
Sigma Fried
well,

183
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,050
and it has to happen otherwise
we will not have citizens.

184
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,720
He links this idea of AML proper ivy.

185
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:27,010
We'll have to talk about this
more in order to have citizens.

186
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,520
And he makes a crucial distinction
between the citizens and the bourgeois.

187
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,340
This is again, uh, the two
faces of who saw, right?

188
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,710
One phase of loose. So is, uh, uh,

189
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,080
a radical Democrat, uh,
deeply democratic individual.

190
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,800
And the other faces, uh, uh,

191
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,400
left radical and he's the first
really as far as I can tell,

192
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,120
but I reasonably know, uh,
the literature of the slams,

193
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,360
the first who is using the term bourgeois
in a pejorative way and makes this

194
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:12,610
crucial distinction between
citizen and Bourgeois.

195
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,753
Uh,

196
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,140
and [inaudible] are the
selfish businessman, right?

197
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,170
Who wants to have money and do not have
a commitment to the collectivity who do

198
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,920
not obey the genital Ville,
but pool,

199
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:36,160
so selfish,
narrow economic interest.

200
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,280
That's bourgeois in some ways.

201
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,570
He gives the tool to Karl Marx,
right,

202
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,110
to develop his theory, as we
will see later on. And March,

203
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:51,250
of course, loved Rousseau. Not only Marx,

204
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,330
Durkheim love to sue as well.

205
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:57,650
I mean that are many people who
love this character, the, his,

206
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,550
um,
uh,

207
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,070
shortcomings of his character. Well, uh,

208
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,400
what our domain teams,
uh,

209
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,550
the first important tms nature is good
society Vichie score rops very important

210
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:18,010
proposition. Um, very
powerful proposition.

211
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,260
This is something what the
marks also takes from Rousseau.

212
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,570
And this is what Durkheim also takes from,
from those short,

213
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,530
uh,
fear of death is not natural.

214
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,840
He continues, uh, if the,

215
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,660
it is forced on us,
forced on us by please,

216
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,400
philosophers and doctors.

217
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,020
And the first task is Magothy education.

218
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,310
Bell Ivy will elaborate on this.
I'll just foreshadow these block of ideas.

219
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,230
The second one is,

220
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,960
now the task is to turn the
savages, mobiles, savages.

221
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,970
That's a noble savage, right? The value,

222
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:05,971
we'll show you an idea into social beings
and from Amada swap to I'm were proper

223
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,880
bell thought makes our social,

224
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,100
it's a lovely idea. Provocative, ironic.

225
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,240
And I just love it.
What makes us social is pity.

226
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,953
All right.

227
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,840
And Ivo labored on this.
It's really so, so wonderful.

228
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,543
MMM.

229
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,660
And the big question is,

230
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,610
can the be citizens out being bourgeois?

231
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,900
What is the distinction? And then, uh,

232
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,350
he said,
what is civilization?

233
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Civilization becomes coacher them
sexy sublimated into imagination.

234
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,840
It's very important. Yeah.
I feel labor on it then. I,

235
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,840
I hope you will be able to
relate to it as much as I am. Um,

236
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,030
uh, the right, uh,

237
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,120
he said that are really two
processes which makes us so shot,

238
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,820
pity and love,
but not sex.

239
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,010
It is Aerotek love, which is in
your mind as much as, as, as,

240
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:22,770
as,
as a newer sexual drives.

241
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,150
And then he suggest love
develops in three stages.

242
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,700
Uh, and I think that this
is absolutely wonderful. Uh,

243
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,180
uh, again, and I didn't
know, I certainly, I,

244
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,060
I can relate to this
rally, val. Right? Um,

245
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,230
the first stage is that you, you aren't
in love, but you don't know yet it home.

246
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,573
Uh,

247
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,040
you write an ad d for love and you
are looking for somebody to be loved,

248
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,340
but you don't really know yet.
You did not identify it.

249
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,030
But that is a sense, right?
That's your art in law. Well,

250
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,060
uh,

251
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,920
it happens certainly for the first time
in adolescence when they are 13 or 14,

252
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:15,921
and we suddenly realize that
there is a romantic stuff,

253
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,560
but we don't have the object of
our romantic feelings, right?

254
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,230
We have to find this out, but it
happens actually overs them. Uh,

255
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,400
one force in lover. Can I
tell you as an, as an old man,

256
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:34,401
it will happen later to life as well
that are rarely one love in life.

257
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,820
Right? Okay. Then, uh, he says,

258
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,553
um,

259
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,480
a lot of brings different people
together on the basis of differences.

260
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,140
Uh, this is very much a dear
Connie and idea, right? Uh,

261
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,640
for what binds people together can be,

262
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,050
there are differences and it makes
it very provocative argument.

263
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,430
Uh, men and women are
different. It's mostly,

264
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:07,080
he's mostly Rad as a
mere shoving his bastard.

265
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,420
But, uh, it's more complicated than
this. And I can your show you text,

266
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,960
but we will make you think,
ah,

267
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,970
this out completely dismissing him
just on some very damaging quotations.

268
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:23,100
What I also will show you,
all right,

269
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:27,730
so nature good society corrupts,
uh,

270
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,010
well. People in nature are good. Uh,

271
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,900
society corrupts well, this
is the opposite. Are you man,

272
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,830
uh, uh, to, um, uh, hops
or in fact, you know,

273
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,770
Durkheim's, uh, idea
that you need, um, uh,

274
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,743
uh,
uh,

275
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,640
more control over our
society is also post to,

276
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,050
um, uh, uh,

277
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,160
Russo's fund on an idea.

278
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,220
And he said, well, in a child does
not know vice and doesn't know error.

279
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,740
Um,
it is introduced to the child by society.

280
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,260
And then he got though he was
not much of a believer. Uh,

281
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,710
he, uh, gives a bit of
theological argument.

282
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Everything is good as it leaves the
hands of the author of things God and

283
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,050
everything degenerates,
um, in the hands of man,

284
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,900
um,
mandarins everything upside down,

285
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,780
right?
He wants nothing as nature made art,

286
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,010
we are being cool to get rid of our
national national now national natural

287
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:52,270
instincts. Um, uh, and
this is again, lovely,

288
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,104
right?

289
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Men must be trained like a school horse.

290
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,510
So it's a lovely also,
I think you sense,

291
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:04,950
right?

292
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,950
[inaudible] is very important distinction
between training and education.

293
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,040
Right?
Um,

294
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,700
once I had a conversation with Danielle
Bell have famous social scientists and

295
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,760
he said, we were talking about graduate
students and he said, you know,

296
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,650
my colleagues said, all of us talking
about training graduate students, he said,

297
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:34,510
what an outrage. You educate
students, you don't change them,

298
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,190
you train a dog. Now that's
through source point, right?

299
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Training Sydney to giving skills and
telling them how to do things right.

300
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,890
A is changing.
Uh,

301
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,410
the point is education and I hope,
you know,

302
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:53,320
we tried to do in discourse
a bit of education.

303
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,270
That's why I don't emphasize that
you have to go back and memorize,

304
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:58,601
you know,

305
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:03,370
the citations from the orders come in
and in the blue book quickly copy in,

306
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:07,750
but you memorize and bill immediately
forget right after the test,

307
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,100
what often are expected
to do that is training.

308
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,790
Education is the process in which
we force you to think on your own,

309
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,820
right? That is education.
And he said, well,

310
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,290
the problem is that that is
too much chaining. Right?

311
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,690
Uh, like, you know, cutting back
to cheese, French garden, you know,

312
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:36,340
they caught back everything.
What grows right. Uh, to fit,

313
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,420
you know, the, what they
flew, mutual beautiful image.

314
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:45,170
It is or there's not unnatural. And I
also like this a great deal then you have,

315
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:50,171
you will not agree with this is a theater
of death is not natural in nature of

316
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:56,920
unaccept sits right.
Russo agrees with hops.

317
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,110
Yeah, indeed. Driven by the fear
of this. But this is not natural.

318
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,710
He claims that animal accepts deaths
right now by that it is true or not.

319
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:14,020
That's another question. I mean you're,
you may have seen, uh, you were a dog die.

320
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,610
You go and you have seen fair
in the eyes of a dog. So I,

321
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:22,310
I'm not so sure how correct
Russo's observation is,

322
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,260
but there is an element of
true story, right? That uh, uh,

323
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,410
Bob follows when they know
it is time to die. You know,

324
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:34,411
they go on their own and they lay down
and wait for death in a peaceful way.

325
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,800
That's what he suggested. He
said, what is put into us?

326
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,990
I think it's a wonderful deep idea.
The fear of theirs by philosophers,

327
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,530
doctors and great idea, right?

328
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,970
It's an a very important idea that we
are ruled by people who will not Polis

329
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:56,130
different type of knowledge.
And the essence, the,

330
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,240
the power of knowledge is that
it put fair of Daesh into us.

331
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,520
The doctors who will say, well,
ideal cure you, right? Uh,

332
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,530
the right and the police who will say
you will burn in Hell and therefore you

333
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:15,470
will, uh, fear of this.

334
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,113
Uh,

335
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,590
he said, you know, naturally, uh,

336
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,200
he would know how to
suffer and how to die,

337
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,770
but we are being sort of indoctrinated
to fear this and have anxieties in my

338
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:34,020
life. Now, uh,

339
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,430
this is why we need
the negative education.

340
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,660
This is a very provocative idea.

341
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,020
Became extremely popular
in the 1960s and seventies.

342
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,560
Those of you who do education probably
know Yvonne earlier trick, right?

343
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,010
Is pushing it to, uh, to the,
as far as you can, right?

344
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,510
But in the kind of counter
cultural educational theories,

345
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,620
it was very important that what
you need is negative education.

346
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,900
You have to get out of doors.

347
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:10,580
Silly ideas from people's
mind was so sad put in there.

348
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,150
Uh, and he said, this is
again, a lovely citation,

349
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,190
how didactic and pedantic craze
is all of us to teach children,

350
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:27,311
but they would learn much
better by themselves and to
forget what via long could

351
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,170
teach them. All right.
Uh, so this is again,

352
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,230
education is giving an opportunity for
people to use their mind rather than

353
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,510
indoctrinating them.

354
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,900
Uh,
uh,

355
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,290
and therefore he said the first act of
education should be purely negative,

356
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,670
right?
It goes,

357
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:58,040
it's not at all in teaching
virtue and a true sales,

358
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,160
but in securing the health from
vice and the mind from error,

359
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,050
that important.

360
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,630
That's right.
Uh,

361
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,410
the task of education, not training is
not good. Tell you what the truth says.

362
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,303
Right?

363
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,370
The task of education is to help your
brain operate sufficiently to tell what is

364
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,770
an ever right and to figure it out.

365
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,690
Then you are making gun at her.

366
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,063
Uh,

367
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,480
that's why that is no easy solutions.

368
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:38,240
That is no right answer to the question.

369
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:42,980
There are competing answers to
every important question, right?

370
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,620
And the task of education is to consider
the pros and cons to consider what

371
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,740
speaks for and against the evidence.
And then to make a judgment,

372
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,920
what is the proposition?
Uv like set, right?

373
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,330
To try to eliminate error.
That's what education is all about.

374
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,560
Okay.
Now,

375
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:15,550
and I'll do an issue is about
commands. And he said, and again,

376
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,370
I love it.
There shall be no commands.

377
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,390
The words or bay and command,

378
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,100
there'd be proscribed from the lexicon
and even more so duty and obligation that

379
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,070
he provocative. But again, I think
very deep thinking about it very hard,

380
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,260
right?
He said,

381
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:43,261
what we really should be in the process
of education do is to emphasize your

382
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:48,430
strengths, right? The emphasize necessity.

383
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,740
We emphasize in we without we,
we tried to figure it out.

384
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:56,860
What is outside of our reach,
what we cannot do,

385
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:02,020
we emphasize constraints, realistic
constraints upon our action, right?

386
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,840
Um, uh, that is the idea
of what should happen in,

387
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,680
in education. So, uh, the argument,

388
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,690
this is your duty to do that
is the wrong way to approach,

389
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:17,260
right?

390
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,210
It's not what the educators
should do to appeal to people's,

391
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,890
uh, um, uh,

392
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,120
guilt feelings to create deals in them.

393
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,510
Maybe I'll talk about this
more in Nicha right there.

394
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,640
The guilt feelings.
It's coming from a no,

395
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,280
don't create guilt.
Uh,

396
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,170
but on the other hand,
there are people what is necessary?

397
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,580
What are the limitations of your action?

398
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Emphasize what you are capable of doing
and cottage them to get the best out of

399
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:54,910
them.

400
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,580
But all of us warn them that I don't
see that you can really go that far.

401
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,550
Don't push yourself too much because
you won't be able to make it.

402
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:06,220
That's what he believes education is.

403
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,650
Now this is a turning savage.
It's into social being.

404
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,570
Moving from our more this
swap to are more proper.

405
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,880
The labile. Seth, I'm more,

406
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,230
dishwasher is all of us good.
That is nothing wrong about it.

407
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,700
What Adam Smith's view call right,
south internist.

408
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,190
Um, now, uh,

409
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,010
the child is bored with [inaudible].

410
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,610
[inaudible]. [inaudible]
it's mine, right? Chad?

411
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,530
We say this is mine, right?
This is on ward the swap.

412
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,270
I want it right.

413
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,620
I'm more just swap as you will know from

414
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,420
uh,
um,

415
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,460
fried. I Vonda abreast
of my mother. Right?

416
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,440
I want to monopolize. This is
mine, right? That's amore the swap.

417
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,040
Well, both on the other hand, uh,

418
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,160
we have to extend our relationships,

419
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,960
we have to interact with other people.
Um,

420
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,970
and I'm more, uh, the proper,

421
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
the then v realize that is another people
who are also led by our more dis swat

422
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,450
and the figure it out, the
way how to live with them, uh,

423
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,990
by interacting with them. Now
that are, how does it, well,

424
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:41,430
does sociality them come from our
more proper valve? Does it come from?

425
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,120
And there are the first maximum is

426
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:51,990
it is not the human heart to put ourself
in the place of people who are happier

427
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,753
than the,

428
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,110
but only of those who are more pitiable.

429
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,930
It's so ironic,

430
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,090
but as far as I can to a whole neuron,

431
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,460
this is a home run,
right?

432
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,040
Think just Betty honestly about yourself.
All right,

433
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,180
man.
You know,

434
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,610
somebody was more successful
that which you can't.

435
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,030
Very hard to love that person.
All right?

436
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,570
If somebody is less successful than you,

437
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,580
you feel pity for them.

438
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Suddenly your hearth farms op
Sadhana in youth theater responsible,

439
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,900
right?
Suddenly you want to call.

440
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,990
All right.
Uh,

441
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,170
the second maxim,
one bit is the others,

442
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,270
only those eels,
Ron,

443
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:53,930
which one does not feel oneself exams.

444
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So we don't necessarily led
by [inaudible] van VC misery.

445
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:05,050
What is sort of outside of
our possible experiences. We,

446
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,270
we have love for pitiable people than
we think we can actually end up in the

447
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:15,210
same situation. That's where
the will have a more approach.

448
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,580
And the third maxim is
now

449
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,540
the pity one has four,

450
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:29,541
another misfortune is measured not
by the quantity of that misfortune,

451
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,910
but the sentiment,

452
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,810
one attribute should Dortch who suffer it.
Right.

453
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,250
Um,
so I think that's wonderful idea.

454
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,960
And now about compassion and pity.
One more time.

455
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:50,810
You said the airborne twice once to exists
and second time to live for Spanish.

456
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:56,421
If species reproduction and the young
adults become sensitive before knowing

457
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,880
what he's sensing,
uh,

458
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,980
is now a man truly born to live fan
it beginning to experience the others.

459
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,363
MMM,

460
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,500
soil.
It is actually our weakness.

461
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,130
What makes us social not that stinks.

462
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,000
It is our common miseries, which
turns sour horse. You feel managed,

463
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,030
I think really ironic but very deep ideas.
You can disagree with it,

464
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,340
but you have to think about it.
This,

465
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,350
that is clearly an element
of tools in the argument.

466
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,263
Okay.

467
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,480
Uh, okay. Uh, and I also
love the last sentence here.

468
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,650
He said,
PT is CV.

469
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,430
This is one of my favorite of
sentences or so. All right.

470
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,080
If he's so sweet to feel
pity for somebody. Oh,

471
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,230
I am so sorry for you.
Right.

472
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,180
Then you were heart this
overflow, right? Yes.

473
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,870
All right.
Uh,

474
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,220
no. And then the citizen and
the bourgeois, this is again,

475
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:12,780
fantastic

476
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,390
[inaudible] dot Astros.
Ron's fourth council of 300 ads.

477
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Here's the fitted not elected in
the 300 representatives in Sparta.

478
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,370
He goes home, then lies tid, uh,

479
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,620
that were 300 men,
verse Yoda,

480
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,050
then he to be founded Sparta.

481
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,920
This is the citizen are U s citizen.

482
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,250
Uh,

483
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,250
when you only got a B minus and there
are 30 people in class who got an a,

484
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,240
do you feel how fortunate I am?

485
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,760
The time is such a great class.

486
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,330
The 30 people are better than I am.
Right?

487
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,200
If you'll figure it out today,
you are a citizen, right?

488
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,840
Then you'd have a lot onward
roper, right? That is his point.

489
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,850
And then another

490
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,420
woman had five songs in the army
and was VT news of the battle.

491
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,510
The hallut arrives scrambling.
She asks him for news.

492
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,060
You were five songs very killed,

493
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,620
and now she answers this slave.
Did I ask you that?

494
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,311
The volume,

495
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:43,311
the victory the manager runs through the
temple and gifts thanks to the guards.

496
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,860
This is the female citizen
I children died,

497
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,480
but the warm the genital Ville.

498
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,770
Well,
uh,

499
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:03,771
he who in a CVO order wants to preserve
the primacy of the sentiments of nature,

500
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,480
does not know what he wants.

501
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,270
All of us in contradiction with himself.

502
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,200
If you will never be
either a man or citizen,

503
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,600
he view would be a bourgeois.
He, there'll be knotting.

504
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,050
That's what Karl Marx loved,
right?

505
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,990
People who just pursue their
own self interest is not much.

506
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,260
No men be men.

507
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,360
Sexuality and love.

508
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Now symbolization becomes sculptured when
sexy sublimated bodily desires turned

509
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:42,060
into imagination,

510
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,070
they will see that is greatly
inspires Zigman fried.

511
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,680
There are two mechanisms which constitute
social compassion, pity, and love.

512
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,070
And he also adds a,
a very provocative idea.

513
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:02,490
His time in the kind of
foreshadows postmodern.

514
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,460
So enlightenment,

515
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,490
the Metal Giles is the hoods
deprived from its meaning.

516
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,260
It's a cool, the rational world
of the marketplace, right?

517
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,770
And competitive,
isolated individuals.

518
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,580
That's what modern word,
enlightenment,

519
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,590
produced and delivered
became unerotic and poetic.

520
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,890
This is something which
will be a big row in Mexico.

521
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:36,060
Weber's idea of this enchantment.
Uh, or if you know mark,

522
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:41,061
who's a wonderful book Arrow
since civilization come
straight out of Rousseau,

523
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,550
Rousseau wants to bring back the Aerotek,
not sacks,

524
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,030
the Aerotek experience bell.

525
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,100
The lab develops since three stages.
As I said,

526
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,020
crest versus a dressed.
You are in love,

527
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,970
but you don't know yet to be at home.
Again. Think back, you were 13 or 14.

528
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,493
Uh,

529
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,870
you begin to search for somebody to love.

530
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,950
Then comes the discovery.
You found it. That's it.

531
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,070
That's the person I am love with Emil.
Find Stuffy,

532
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,240
but brings them together. He
said, is the differences right?

533
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,890
That they compliment each
other? Uh, Durkheim be lag you.

534
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:30,720
It can be similarity. What
brings us together. Uh, it's
a more complex argument,

535
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,880
but the origin of the idea is in rows.

536
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,520
So then the company's Dean bought
them by once you fall in love,

537
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:42,400
dawn thrush, right? As I said,

538
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:47,660
not sex ed course is
what is really the leaf,

539
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,960
right? I don't trust you. Two
beds go to channel. All right?

540
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:57,790
And then when you travel,
you think about the person you love,

541
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,300
you idealize that person and your mind
and that's when you is this love becomes

542
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:05,320
an erotic experience.

543
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,380
Then you can go home and you
can consume the love, right?

544
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,420
I think this is reality.
A wonderful

545
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,660
well and here comes a problem.
Ah,

546
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,130
his views on gender relations.

547
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,683
Oh,

548
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,870
bell men and women a difference.

549
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,590
And that means that they
ought to be told differently.

550
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,060
Uh,
uh,

551
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,490
if you would decide,

552
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,590
he said to raise a VM and
Maya mop the amount of like,

553
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:52,490
man, he said, man, the mill
me gladly consent to this.

554
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,900
Uh,
the more women want to resemble men.

555
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,110
The Last v man deal,
govern damn.

556
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,730
Well you can say separate
the sexy stops vision.

557
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,580
Uh,

558
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,720
but probably idea you heard before.

559
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,290
All right. Uh, um,

560
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:16,610
who wears the hat in the family?
This is the kind of argument right now.

561
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,590
The men are the bosses after at all,

562
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,583
uh,

563
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,420
Dell. Therefore, what
the education should do,

564
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,420
cultivate mass qualities.
Yeah.

565
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,620
Uh,
uh,

566
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,260
knock knock to cultivate man's qualities
in them, man. Right? Uh, but, uh,

567
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,553
uh,

568
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,470
raise it differently now
and here are the citations,

569
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:46,780
which shows you Russo the sexist,

570
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:49,843
uh,

571
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,510
hard to say. He's not the
sexiest pastor. The man is me.

572
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:58,040
It's specialty to please man. Ah, Val,

573
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:03,041
I'm sure at least half of the man in
this room are also outraged and I think

574
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:08,600
probably often outraged.
Uh,

575
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,730
but I hope that other man in this,

576
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:15,960
you'll not only me who is
upset by this statement. Well,

577
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,790
he said the men and men
are made for one another,

578
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,550
but that mutual dependence is not equal.

579
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,030
Men depend on the woman because of
the desire the man depend on man,

580
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,880
because both of their
desires and their need

581
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,560
people survive more. It if you saw
them than they would be south house.

582
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,210
I mean man, I mean this is of
course straight silly, right?

583
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,780
Uh, I mean, I was veto for the vibe. Know

584
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,870
how much more difficult it is for men
to survive this other woman then for a

585
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
woman to survive this out there,
man.

586
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Now and then he goes on almost all
littler girls learn to read and write a

587
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:06,180
veteran Bulger nuns.

588
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,070
But as far as holding needle that they,

589
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:12,530
all those learn and gladly sewing,

590
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,310
embroidery and lace
making come by themselves.

591
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,520
So I mean nothing more should be said,

592
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:24,610
but there are other citations this wrong
and there are some boasts feminists,

593
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:30,170
feminists who actually liked this,
who,

594
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:33,890
so who says men and women
should be different.

595
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,950
Uh, he said, Sophie off to
be a woman as Emil is a man.

596
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,480
And then he goes for it.

597
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:47,830
He said in everything not connected with
sex woman is a man in some ways he's

598
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,060
formulating the idea of the gender,

599
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,750
gender equality, sexual differences.
Right. That's what he said.

600
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:05,360
The problem is if women
tried to look sex wise, like

601
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,600
Dave Man, right? Um,

602
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,480
that's I think an interesting
guy. And then he said, everything,

603
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:16,470
men and women having common
belongs to the species,

604
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:20,190
the human species and everything,

605
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,510
which distinguishes them belong
simply to sexual differences.

606
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,673
Uh,

607
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,830
and then he said in the Union of Saxes,

608
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,220
each contributes equally
to the common name,

609
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,860
but not in the same way.
Well,

610
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,533
uh,

611
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,750
Ivo suspect that most of
you if see him as a sexist,

612
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,550
um,
what some of you may actually see,

613
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,860
uh, the points, what he's making
a in these last sets of quotation.

614
00:43:59,390 --> 00:43:59,840
Thank you.
