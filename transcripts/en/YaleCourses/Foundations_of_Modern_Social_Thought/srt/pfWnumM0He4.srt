1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,340
Good morning. Yeah. Um,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,300
well I think it is high time that you
start thinking about your final paper.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,450
And let me just one more time,
uh,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,320
value what my expectation is a right,

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,330
there are three major blocks in
the course for each of the blocks.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,360
That is a test you have done.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,830
I have one more we'll be
done last week of classes.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,200
Um,
um,

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,010
I mean the idea of the paper is
that you do a little more ambitious,

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,990
very crowds. You link, um, uh,

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,730
two of the blocks to it, to
each other. So you compare,

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,320
uh,
harps,

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,350
theory of human nature with the Durkheim's
theory of human nature or Harps Russo

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,010
and Durkheim or something
like this. Um, or, um,

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,050
uh,
you look at the vision of power in Hops,

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,340
Snitcher and vapor, right? Uh,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,200
do two or three orders as such. Um, uh,

18
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:14,820
I also highly recommend you that you,
um,

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,710
uh, goal. What excites you the
most? Uh, you pick a topic,

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,070
what you find exciting.
If there was anything in this course,

21
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:27,970
what made you excited, right about
it, right? And you can use, uh,

22
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,230
uh, earlier, uh, asset
topics. What you brought up,

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,690
that's no problem. Uh, that there'll be
a new paper. Anyway, I had the class,

24
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:41,691
you have to link occasionally by distant
Otros to each other and talk to your

25
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:47,730
discussion section leader or send
an email. It can be very short, uh,

26
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,940
just to make sure that you
are on the right, um, uh, uh,

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,000
right trajectory, right? And probably
your discussion section leader of you.

28
00:01:56,001 --> 00:02:00,510
I'll give you just a two
sentence response to say, yes,

29
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,400
this seems to be fine or no,
you are taking on too many at the law.

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,180
Too many orders. Why don't you do
only two or three rather than five,

31
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,610
what you suggested or avail, uh, you know,

32
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,240
you should be a little more ambitious,
right?

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,170
This is the kind of feedback
you should expect and advise.

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,290
And let me also say that one
more time. Uh, uh, you know,

35
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,130
was in discourse.
Uh,

36
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,210
we want to make this abstract
dude is relevant to your life.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,320
So therefore don't shy
away if you have opinions,

38
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,630
if you can reflect how,
uh, the course, uh, um, uh,

39
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:44,520
helped or did not help to understand
yourself in society. Do so. Right.

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,010
Um, uh, but I think you really should, uh,

41
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,510
a doctor, your discussion section
leader or email at least on email,

42
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,450
um, uh, before you leave for
the vacation because, um, uh,

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,570
I want van the you,

44
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,070
you were out of tired of Turkey or you
had enough a beer and watching a football

45
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,200
and then you want to have fun,

46
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,400
then you can start working
on your final paper, right?

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,100
You don't leave it to the very end,
right?

48
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:23,101
But you can use your spare time during
Thanksgiving break to get started on it.

49
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,430
And that's not a big deal. You know, we
want you to do something like six store,

50
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,610
uh, more state beaches,
but more like six pages.

51
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,640
This is not really much more than,
you know,

52
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,520
the usual tests and assays. Okay. Um,

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,290
is that all clear and
the question about this?

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,360
No.
Anyway,

55
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,940
maybe we'll try to be as on
bureaucratic about this as a,

56
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,990
in a bureaucratic organization,
you can be all right.

57
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,060
As you have seen in this course,

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,080
we've trying to break the
rules of bureaucracy and
hopefully not at the expense

59
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:06,790
of efficiency or,
right.

60
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,310
So this is labor on the
labor theory on class and um,

61
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,490
Liz is probably neighbor next to Mark's
is the most influential theory of class,

62
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,330
um, uh, and the ad or saw on a
collision course with each other.

63
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,950
Uh, correlation of course
in many ways, uh, uh,

64
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,740
Ivy will elaborate on this,
but just to foreshadow, uh, uh,

65
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,880
uh,
that are really cool fun theory,

66
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:42,190
fundamentally important
issues where Markson Vapor,

67
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,430
these Agri marks,
as you recall,

68
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,810
identified classes in
property relationship I had,

69
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:54,460
the class I caught on me was between
those who own capital and those who own

70
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,410
only their labor power.

71
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,550
Vi Bird in contrast defines classes on
the marketplace as Marcus situations.

72
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,640
So the relationship, uh, this
would be more complicated,

73
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,530
but then the class relationship is
between the employer and the employee.

74
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:18,910
It is between the manager and the
worker and not the owner. Right.

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,240
And, uh, uh, the possessor
of labor power. Then march,

76
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,640
also sad of l a or
history of human Candice,

77
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,530
history of class struggles.

78
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,830
So vapor has a of Marx
has a theory of class,

79
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,150
which is overarching
the whole human history.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,920
The is very specific about this
class is a modern phenomenon.

81
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,390
Classes only emerged with the
emergence of the market economy.

82
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,780
Market capitalism before
capitalism that are,

83
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,430
they are not the stratification
system is not based on class,

84
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,270
but it is based on status
and talking about, uh,

85
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,010
the notion of staters and grade there.
And finally that is obscured,

86
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,030
important political difference.

87
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,630
Marx believed that the class struggle
gets more intense over time and therefore

88
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:15,320
the subordinated class, eventually
you'll revolt and overthrow capitalism.

89
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,760
They were believed, uh, that
uh, the in the opposite, uh,

90
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,460
a class struggle is the most
intense in early stages,

91
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:27,530
rough stages of capitalism.

92
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,700
And as capitalism becomes
consolidated and bureaucratized,

93
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,320
class struggle is the actually reduced.
Um,

94
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,050
so these are the three
fundamental differences.

95
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:44,010
And this is the outline of the
presentation, uh, today. Uh,

96
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,070
so first of all I want to talk about
the usual interpretation of vapor and I

97
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:54,410
want to challenge these interpretation.
Uh,

98
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:59,411
if you ever took a course in which
Weber's theory of class was discussed,

99
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,020
you usually had the interpretation.
What I pleasant. Now,

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,550
if you go on the Internet and you
find what vapor got about class,

101
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,140
this is what you get. I
disagree with it. Um, and, uh,

102
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,220
IVL tried to show you why
this is the wrong approach.

103
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,360
Uh,

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,360
the usual interpretation goes back
to a British sociologists that,

105
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:27,500
uh, um, uh, Runciman who wrote
about this or that in the 1960s,

106
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,810
um, uh, uh, he's still
active actually. And, uh,

107
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:36,380
he interpreted the Labor as a offering,

108
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,290
a theory of social inequality.
Uh, in three dementia.

109
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,070
It's, uh, again, go on the Internet,

110
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,060
90% of,
uh,

111
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,190
Internet posting on vapor and the Class
V or give you this view what our dose

112
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,080
three dimensions,
status or prestige is one dimension.

113
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,330
The second is class, uh, usually
defined by income or avails.

114
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,440
And the third dimension is power.
Um,

115
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,240
and therefore,
if you look at stratification in society,

116
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,310
people can be unequal
in any of these, uh, uh,

117
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,820
can be privileged in any
of these dimensions or all
of the dimensions as such.

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,030
Uh, these, uh, Runciman, uh, uh, uh,

119
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,580
conceptualization of Weber's theory
of class was extremely influential on

120
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,710
empirical research. There was a lot of
empirical survey research carried out,

121
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,220
which was trying to measure,
uh,

122
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,650
how people fare in these three dimensions.
Um,

123
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,490
Gerhard Lenski,
uh,

124
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,500
who was professor and love and marriage
was professor was professor at the

125
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,800
University of North Carolina,
uh,

126
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,340
created a theory of status inconsistency.
Um,

127
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,470
the idea of was that, uh, um, uh,

128
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,220
people actually can be high in one,

129
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,490
one of these dimensions and
relatively low in another dimension.

130
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,360
So for instance, uh, uh, you
are a professor of sociology,

131
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,030
uh, then, you know, you were
prestige is a sort of reasonable,

132
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,780
you know, probably somewhat
higher than average. Um,

133
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,410
if you are a professor that,
you know,

134
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:39,240
it's a sort of even a little higher
than average, you know, uh, um,

135
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,400
substantially higher don't have rich.

136
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,950
Now in terms of intercom, you know,
if you are a professor of sociology,

137
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:47,181
you will,

138
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:52,070
will be again only slightly
higher than average of,

139
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,390
you'll not be very high
in terms of power hour.

140
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,420
You'll have, you'll be very
low in the power hierarchy. Um,

141
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,000
at least in the United
States, right? Nobody listens.

142
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,940
What sociologists are saying,
you know,

143
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,530
students who have to write
and occasionally they have
to take a sociology course.

144
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,460
That's the only power,
the Yali and professor exercises.

145
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,920
Now,
if you are a Supreme Court justice,

146
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,340
uh,
then your prestige is extremely high.

147
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,960
You are on the top of the pastiche
hierarchy, at least in the United States.

148
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,030
If you are asking who,
what,

149
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,060
who is the most prestigious occupation
in the United States in surveys,

150
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,850
people voc to be a supreme court justice,
right?

151
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,740
Serve on the Supreme Court.
Now, um, in terms of Entercom,

152
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,860
the Supreme Court justices
probably don't do all that well.

153
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,010
They probably do about as
university professors do. Uh, right.

154
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,860
Um, people in public service
usually don't do all that well.

155
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,530
I think probably a governor of a state
is not your anymore than a university

156
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:05,940
professor, but in terms of power, uh,

157
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,100
David would be very high,
right?

158
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,430
Supreme Court justices are very high or
occasionally they can even at poet tried

159
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:18,330
to president of the United States
if I may flag this joke. All right.

160
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,050
Anyway, they are very powerful. Well,

161
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,510
if you think about a mafioso,

162
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,100
the prestige of a godfather except
in the mafia will be very low,

163
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,140
right? You regard it as
criminal. Um, in terms of income,

164
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,940
you'll be on the very top,
right? In terms of power, well,

165
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,710
we will have some power, but mainly
in the mafia, not really nationally.

166
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,690
You see what they are getting get.
So therefore you cannot measure, uh,

167
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,330
uh, seizures, class and
power three dimensions.

168
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,120
And this is very helpful to
understand. Vetter, uh, uh, uh,

169
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,150
uh, the social status is crystallized, uh,

170
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,770
people who have high best.

171
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:11,110
These also have high incomes
and high power. And, uh, uh,

172
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,710
let's say somebody who is sleeping
on the floor, right? Um, uh,

173
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,940
uh, uh, we'll have very low prestige,

174
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,250
very low income and low power at all.

175
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,410
So that is a useful way how
to stratify society for upper,

176
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,690
upper class to lower lower class.

177
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,380
That is the way how vapor
usually it has been used.

178
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,680
Now I veal challenge this, uh, uh, uh,

179
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,490
uh, I don't think I'm the
only one who does challenges.

180
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,580
Anthony Giddens I think gets very
close to what I'm describing though.

181
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,140
Probably he doesn't stick his
neck out as much as I do. Um, I,

182
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,410
my fundamental argument is that Weber's
distinction between class and status is

183
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,820
a historical distinction.

184
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,410
And this is not accidental that
this is an English speaking person.

185
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,430
Runciman who reads the notion of status,

186
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:11,590
the way how he reads it.

187
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Because if you know a little German
and you try to read vapor in German,

188
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,490
you know that the word status is actually
a translated from the word she's done

189
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,550
and she's done the val, it can be
translated into English as status,

190
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,730
but it's not very good
translation of the word.

191
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,810
The better translation is a state.
Now,

192
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:41,770
if you would translate dung as a state,

193
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,640
it would become obvious that
what we is trying to suggest,

194
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,940
that that is something our cake about
status stratification as distinct from

195
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,410
class stratification, which
is a modern phenomenon, right?

196
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,820
So this will be one of the major
points of a time trying to make.

197
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,820
And we will try to show
this, uh, um, uh, uh,

198
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,960
from Viber text. Then,
uh, the question is,

199
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,890
where is the third
dimension? Right? As I said,

200
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,690
a status and class art historical
categories, but valley spower.

201
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,880
Uh,
and when I was working on one of my books,

202
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,630
I was very much attracted to Runciman
Saudia idea and try to interpret vapor and

203
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,920
this way.
And in fact it appeared to me,

204
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:37,770
agreed deal to use power as
an independent dimension. Um,

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,230
uh, uh, uh, uh, the class position. Uh,

206
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,250
I was trying to understand the social
structure of communist societies and their

207
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:50,770
power appears to be an
independent dimension.

208
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:55,771
So I was looking into the vapor tax
and I read cover to cover economy and

209
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:01,031
society a couple of times and I could
not find the term dementia read it.

210
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,650
It is not dead. Uh, um, uh,

211
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,960
so, uh, trying to understand what
FIBA is getting yet. I, you know,

212
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,890
I came to the conclusion that for vapor,
uh,

213
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,330
power is the dependent variable.

214
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,740
What he wants to explain their power
comes from and veterans power exercised is

215
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:29,621
exercise on the basis of class privileges
or whether it is a state to stype of,

216
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:36,110
uh, uh, or s state type of power,
which is exercised in society.

217
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,190
And this is very consistent, but you
already knew about Max Faber, right?

218
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,210
Type of authorities
where power comes from.

219
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,640
What legitimate power,
right?

220
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,150
Tradition or legal rational
authority, right? Uh,

221
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,070
class stratification corresponds
to societies based on legal,

222
00:15:55,071 --> 00:16:00,071
rational authority status stratification
corresponds to traditional authority.

223
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,730
All right, well I will, uh,

224
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,810
elaborate a little on this.

225
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:10,811
Wheel qualified is somewhat
primarily because we were like,

226
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,830
uh, in his, uh, uh, types
of authority as well.

227
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,330
Uh,
has two balls in the air at the same time.

228
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,670
He has a macro theory,
right,

229
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,230
of historical variations
of stratification for him.

230
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:31,110
Transition From and you know, um, uh,

231
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,250
traditional society in modern rational
societies is a transition from s state

232
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:40,340
type of stratification
to class stratification.

233
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,650
But vapor also

234
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,410
has a micro theory. He also said, okay,

235
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,220
the society today is
primarily class stratified,

236
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,320
but I can identify status,

237
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,550
power in modern societies as well,

238
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,690
just exactly as he does with
the types of authority. Yes,

239
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:06,710
the United States today is legal,
rational authority,

240
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,890
but I can spot elements of traditional
authority or Charismatic Authority

241
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,920
operating Visene, legal,
rational authority.

242
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,340
Since it is dominantly legal,
rational authority,

243
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,960
it will be secondary law.
We will make a difference.

244
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,980
But traditional tradition in this society,

245
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:31,910
in these very America today
does make a difference, right?

246
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,990
It is contract venture
very well in society.

247
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,280
Traditional Authority is consequential,
right?

248
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,640
Uh,
we are all equal before the law,

249
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,090
but in practice where we end up has a lot
to do with traditional tragedy says th

250
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,330
the traditional, they have power
up on age. The same goes for,

251
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,010
he brings back the idea of status.

252
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,190
This is why I've said translating stoned
the status is not completely wrong.

253
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,500
It only gets the footnote
in the vapor concept,

254
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,100
right?
The fourth north is a stunned,

255
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:19,101
is primarily a historical concept
for past traditional societies.

256
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,020
But by the way,

257
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:27,021
this is the food note even in contemporary
digital sources out society in class,

258
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:32,141
that if I societies that is bowed
occasionally exercise on the basis of,

259
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,220
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, status, uh,

260
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,990
valid.
Obviously,

261
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:44,400
you know the power which is exercised
by a Supreme Court judge or the power

262
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,380
exercise by a university professor,

263
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,410
the little one we have that
the me probably in some way
try to change your mind,

264
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,370
right? Which is an act of power. Or
some would say even an act of course,

265
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,660
if power,
right.

266
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,040
A booty call the symbolic violence,
right?

267
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,650
I violate your mind.
You know,

268
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:12,330
if I can penetrate your mind and
put a new idea into your mind,

269
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:14,760
right?
This is an act of power.

270
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,790
Now it's primarily done
or what grade you done?

271
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,600
Well, I stages, uh,

272
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:26,601
that you save l this is a professor
who has a phd [inaudible].

273
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,820
Right? Uh, then it is really right.

274
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,040
The reason why you started believing
me has a lot to do with my status.

275
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,290
Hopefully not only the status.

276
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,740
Hopefully I can make a good
argument then past radio,

277
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,600
but occasionally it's a mixture. Now you
tend to believe me or this, believe me.

278
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:50,250
Right? And the very fact of the status,
what I, uh, what I am incumbent off,

279
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,300
it has something to do,
right? Uh, uh, uh, a few, uh,

280
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,800
trying to believe your professors. So, uh,

281
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,200
uh, let me vary on the notion
how vapor defines classes.

282
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,010
Um,

283
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,010
and the most important issue
is the uniquely they bury
an idea is that class has

284
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:14,900
to be identified under
Marquette. And then Ivo, uh,

285
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,440
also say a few words about
class interests and how he,

286
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,580
to what extent is different
from marsh in this respect.

287
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,060
So class and market,
uh,

288
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,120
now here you have Themis definitions
and he said class teacher.

289
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,530
And is that your mind by Martha Situation?
Um,

290
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,660
classic tuition is ultimately a market
situation and this is very important.

291
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:44,340
Now the of as follows,
right?

292
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,790
The effects of nature per session per
is only the fore runner of the our class

293
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:53,230
formation slaves he's had,

294
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,240
or you can say sheriffs out of not a
class the hour rather as Steve to school.

295
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,550
Now here you can see by the historical
uses of the distinction between class and

296
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,220
status, right? Uh,

297
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,250
and also the challenge to marks a prop,

298
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,260
those who have property and
the private room property, uh,

299
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,480
do not constitute a class.

300
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,540
And the fundamental argument for this
is that in traditional societies,

301
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,600
it is not really property which puts
you into a high status position.

302
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,150
You being in a high status position has
the concept of events that you are of

303
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:39,220
LC,
right?

304
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,180
So the king or the queen decides to give
you mobility and gives you ns state,

305
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,790
right? Um, in capitalism is
versus the other way around.

306
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,810
In order to become a billionaire,
right?

307
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,670
You don't have to get the approval of
the president of the United States.

308
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,900
Simply enough,
you go to was cheat.

309
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,790
You Invest Your money smartly.

310
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,680
You start with $1,000 and the no
time you have a billion, right?

311
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,930
If you invested it in a smart way
and then you are in the class, right?

312
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,430
Or billionaires,
right?

313
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,040
So here it is your,
your property,

314
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,120
uh,
and your activity on the marketplace,

315
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,960
which end helps you to enter the class,
right?

316
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,890
In the aristocracy, it was
a legal act, right? Uh,

317
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,990
a political act by a king or the Queen,
which made you nobility,

318
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,880
made you are lord.
And then as a construct vents,

319
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,220
you became wealthy, right? It's also
interesting. By the way, that event,

320
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,160
if you lost your valves that were some
poor, noble people, you still repair,

321
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,130
re retained. You are, uh, uh,
status as state privileges.

322
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,940
So if you were mobility in most societies,
for instance,

323
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,820
you did not have to pay taxes.
Now,

324
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,620
if you lost all of your estate, you
know, because you gambled. For instance,

325
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:16,330
right now you wanted to go to Monte Carlo
or you, you gambled everything, go away,

326
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,590
then you became very bored.

327
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,860
You were a seal Lobel and you still
did not have to write a pay taxes.

328
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,120
Your state status be villages
remained the opposite, right? Uh,

329
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,230
in capitalism you start,
eh,

330
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,180
poorly investing your money and you
lose your money on the stock market,

331
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,310
you cease to be a capitalist, right?
Then you will have to safe to find a job,

332
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,760
right? And since you lost all of your
money, who will not find a very good job?

333
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:49,880
Because who wants to hire a loser?
Right?

334
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,430
Okay. Uh, uh,

335
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,070
e this is also a very important
citation from vapor. He said, you know,

336
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:06,071
the class position really means that
people have common life chances,

337
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,450
right? Uh, if, uh,

338
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,980
you are located differently that
are the positively and negatively,

339
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:17,900
this is the way Berean point positively
or negatively privileged positions on

340
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,070
the market place.

341
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,100
And if you are negatively privileges
privilege in their marketplace,

342
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,240
your life, chances are not
very good, right? If you are
positively privileged, uh,

343
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:32,570
in the market place than your life,
chances are great.

344
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,000
You guys in this room are Oh,
very positively privileged,

345
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,900
right? Because you are getting
a Yale degree and you know,

346
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:45,670
probably a Harvard degree would
be even better for you. Uh,

347
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,570
don't tell Rick Levine that I said
that in class, right? Um, but,

348
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:54,850
uh, um, uh, uh, this is, you
know, about the best degree,

349
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,850
what you can have.

350
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,710
So you are extremely valid positions
on the labor market, right?

351
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,620
Your life chances are great,
right?

352
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,630
You have to make a lot of mistakes
to screw this one, right? Yeah.

353
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,210
Right? You are on the
right trajectory. Um, uh,

354
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,750
if you are in a community college,

355
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,140
right or you are a high school drop out,

356
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,510
then your life chances on the labor
market, we will be lousy. Right? Um,

357
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,830
um, especially you are poor.
You are African American,

358
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:31,330
you dropped out of high
school. Uh, well, uh,

359
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,890
your chances that you know,

360
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,900
you will end up in jail before
you turn 30 is I think 70%.

361
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,740
Uh, so, right? This is
life chances, right?

362
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,000
Rigid that it in this case of
course, it is not only class, right?

363
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,350
That is a special type of
status group, right? Race.

364
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,450
It also plays a role right in you
that tell you rating life chances.

365
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,860
Now,
let me also say that the,

366
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,870
but actually suggest that you can
think of classes on every single market

367
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:09,650
situation. Uh, so, uh, for instance,

368
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,450
uh,
some people and I,

369
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,500
myself in my work have been writing
about housing classes that if differences

370
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,540
between the owner of a house and the
tenant who rents this house is at class,

371
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:27,650
relationship can be interpreted
as a class relationship.

372
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,550
The landlords very often by the
tenants are seen as blessed.

373
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,740
Soccer's right?

374
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Because they charge too high rent and
they do not maintain your unit properly.

375
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,480
You know,
when you call them and,

376
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,350
and you say that the water dripping
and I need a proper, they've,

377
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:51,030
you'll find excuses why they were
fixed, you know, your uh, uh, uh,

378
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,240
uh, water or by they do
not fix your eating right.

379
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,430
So they are bloodsuckers right?
Uh,

380
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,010
and as a tenant you are in a
negatively privileged class position.

381
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,070
That's true.
But on the other hand,

382
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:10,071
Labor is quite clear that there are
two important market positions which

383
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:14,410
fundamentally define your class position.
Um,

384
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,640
and these are the labor market
and in fact the capital market,

385
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,690
uh,
will define where a veteran you are,

386
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,870
have good life chances or poor life
chances and all other positions on other

387
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:35,301
markets will be consequences
if you position primarily
on the labor market or on

388
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,490
capital markets.

389
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,970
Now this actually brings a
vapor and Mark's a little
closer than it appeared for

390
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:47,910
the first time, right?
Because as we've, you'll see,

391
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,130
beaver does acknowledge that if there is
a market economy differences in proper,

392
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,420
the are very important to
creating a class positions.

393
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,610
But unlike mark see emphasizes,

394
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,710
this is only the case if that
is a market economy in place.

395
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,900
Now just very briefly about
class interests and class action.

396
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,550
And here he said,
well,

397
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,770
the statement by a talented altar,

398
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,500
he doesn't tell us who that author is.

399
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,190
I assume it must be Karl marks that the
individual may be in error concerning

400
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:27,120
his interest,

401
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,600
but the class is in a fallible about his
interest is false and pseudoscientific.

402
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,660
So he said, well, the classes
are actually not communities,

403
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,720
right of community may have a kind of
collective understanding that you belong

404
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,990
to a class,
uh,

405
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,710
just because of your position of the
labor market. And you actually hear,

406
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:57,240
he subscribes to Adam Smith,
right?

407
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,100
Uh,

408
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:03,100
a class members are individuals acting
out of self interest and not acting out

409
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,700
of collective interests,

410
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,940
but the are in a similar position and
therefore they have common class interests

411
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,050
and surprise, surprise, or occasionally
they will act the same way,

412
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,090
right? Because they have a collective
interest, but not as a community.

413
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,313
But,
uh,

414
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:27,350
as rationally acting individuals that
share mind by their rational actions,

415
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:34,020
right on the market place. Uh,
and therefore he said, well,

416
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,190
classes will really exist.

417
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,650
How can I tell that the
class is really exist?

418
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:44,680
I can tell if I see classes,
acting classes,

419
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:46,870
Metro allies in action,
right?

420
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,820
Because I speculatively cannot
make any class distinction.

421
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:56,821
But people VR made distinctions
for classes by acting
upon their class interest.

422
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,810
Now let's go onto the
ration of status groups.

423
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:08,020
What our status groups and a bell.

424
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,960
I briefly want to identify
who status groups,

425
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,270
our spot status privileges are,

426
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,680
and then a c two stratification, um, uh,

427
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,430
and the cast and question
of ethnicity in Weber's.

428
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:24,820
So what is the status group?
Well,

429
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,010
unlike classes,
status group or skin there,

430
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,160
this is the pollute
all of the done the uh,

431
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,390
momentally groups. Um, uh,

432
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:42,160
seaters groups means that
you belong to a group, right?

433
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,470
And you have a high esteem and you
have a solid additive is in the group.

434
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,950
You have an honor.

435
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,750
A certain honor is attribute it to you
when you are in a status group, right?

436
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,200
You are initiated right into becoming a
noble man by an act of the king or the

437
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:04,320
Queen. Um, uh, well, uh, uh,

438
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,540
in order to get a university degree,

439
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,260
you are initiated right into
a status group. You know,

440
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:15,190
they do earn a university degree,
a bachelor's degree,

441
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,720
a phd is entering in some
ways as a state role.

442
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,250
It's not accidental that we
were this funny, you know,

443
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:28,540
medieval robes on those
ceremonies where uh,

444
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,560
the degree is conferred on you and
many professions which require formal

445
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,820
university training act
as a state has growth. Uh,

446
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,750
like the doctors constitute
write a status group like,

447
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,100
uh, uh, in some ways
university professors, uh,

448
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,840
constitute with the status group.

449
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:55,230
Lawyers constituted a status group and
they somehow control attic sent entrance

450
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,660
into the law profession,
right? Um, uh, the, uh,

451
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:05,800
you have to pass a board exam if
you want to become a lawyer, right?

452
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,930
And in fact, states three all cause
make, you know, in California,

453
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,580
if you want to move to California,

454
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:15,910
you want to get a law degree and
you want to move to California,

455
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,170
you'll be a sweat blood,
right to pass the board exam.

456
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,380
If you want to go to South Dakota,

457
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,330
[inaudible] easily passed the board exam
because there are not many lawyers who

458
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:30,370
want to be lawyers in South Dakota,

459
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,290
but there are many lawyers who want to
be lawyers in San Francisco and therefore

460
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,300
the board,
California board,

461
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,910
we'd be much stricter than the South
Dakota board. The same goes for, uh,

462
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,060
medical eye exams, right? And it would
be, um, again, you have to pass exams.

463
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,880
Um,
and uh,

464
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,730
we will be different depending
on the labor market ocean.

465
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,160
And it's very important.

466
00:32:55,161 --> 00:33:00,110
The C to his honor is best expressed
with specific lifestyle that they,

467
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,400
how you dress, the way how you eat, uh,

468
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:08,450
the way how you behave is constituting
what is status group traditionally,

469
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,490
right? Mobile men could wear
arms, snow mobiles couldn't. Um,

470
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,530
um, and uh, uh,

471
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,630
well if you are a year professor,
You Vale, uh, j press, right?

472
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,520
Uh, uh, I mean, not everybody
does, but you know, it's, you,

473
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,520
you can tell this is a year.
ProfessorB ,

474
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,450
you can see this as a
cheap j press, um, uh, um,

475
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,730
coat. Uh, so there are
writer, uh, lifestyles. Uh,

476
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,520
um, uh, but in a way,

477
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,440
even in modern society
constitute status groups.

478
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,970
Even with, since class stratification,
you have these uniquely, you know,

479
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,890
lifestyle specific stuff,

480
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,070
but you adapt in order to belong to
these status group kind of subgroup in a

481
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:07,010
class. So if you are a Yuppie
young, urban professional,

482
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,780
right? You get a nice job on Wall
Street, you move to Manhattan,

483
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,570
right?
Then you rent out,

484
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,600
try it or buy a condo
somewhere in a Trump building,

485
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,533
right?

486
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,570
Then you want to be driven
by a limo to your workplace.

487
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,130
You've, you'll be reading Wall Street
Journal and you will be going, right?

488
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:35,780
And you'll VOB having crossed
arms for the morning, right?

489
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,580
And you'll see what I'm getting
yet, right? Yeah. You'll be,

490
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:42,680
you'll be dressed in a certain
way. People can tell, right,

491
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,520
this person must be a broker.
Right? On Wall Street,

492
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,370
there are these lifestyle characteristics,

493
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,790
but in a way creates
an almost status group.

494
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,320
You know each other, right? You
recognize each other, right?

495
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,000
There are places where you hang
together, right? There are Erp places.

496
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:05,960
You look outside and you know,
this is a Yuppie Brown field with grps.

497
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,960
This is the lifestyle
and by this shoe as them.

498
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,310
And that also of course
status privileges, um, uh,

499
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,490
which is ideal and material goods,

500
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:21,491
which is the consequence of you being
in that status group read or uh,

501
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,380
uh, then, uh, the source of it. Uh,

502
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,550
and there are also specific
special employment opportunities.

503
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:37,571
If you belong to a status group
and it's being controlled way.

504
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:40,520
I mean, adequate profession
is a very good example.

505
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,610
It's being actually the Beatty.
Then questions,

506
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,970
why on earth do we need a system in
which people have to have registered,

507
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:54,540
you know, do have to have a medical degree
in order to practice medicine, right?

508
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,100
Uh,
why owners,

509
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:59,670
people who have to have a law degree in
order to appear in court and the fence,

510
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:04,560
somebody in court, right? These are
kind of status grew up, uh, uh, uh,

511
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,940
uh, barriers to enter, uh, uh, the sister.

512
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,673
Well,

513
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:16,160
the market on the other hand knows
no personal distinction. Well,

514
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,880
under market it matters whether you are
successful or you are a failure, right?

515
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,290
And therefore, if you have the
status group kind of privileges,

516
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,220
this is a limitation on the
functioning of the market, right?

517
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,790
And therefore stronger
the status groups are,

518
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:37,410
if he can be a hindrance of free
development of a market economy.

519
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,860
And now an idea about the
Kras and that necessity.

520
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:48,460
He said if the boundaries
between car, uh, uh,

521
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,690
status groups are particularly sharp
re drone in that case we can talk about

522
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,250
casts the caste differences occur.
For instance,

523
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:04,251
when that APP low emissions to
intermarry between cast a lower cash,

524
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:09,870
I'll usually seen as polluted as dirty.
You even cannot touch them.

525
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,740
Or if you ha you did
touch a low class person,

526
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:15,240
let's say an Indian culture,

527
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,340
you have to go some purification
procedures. Uh, right.

528
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,540
Uh, and he said, uh,

529
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,190
status group segregation grows into cast.

530
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,520
That dance forms a horizontal coexistence
of ethnically segregated groups into a

531
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,680
vertical social system. Uh, uh,

532
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,170
this is also very important, right? His
notion of ethnicity. It's a very, uh,

533
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,470
very innovative idea in writing
this around 1920 about this I,

534
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,201
the,

535
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:54,201
the differences are held to be ethnic
on based on the belief that it has

536
00:37:56,071 --> 00:38:00,900
something to do with blood relations,
right? He does not believe,

537
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:01,201
right,

538
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:05,460
that ethnic differences really have
anything to do with the blood relations.

539
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,970
You have ethnical racial differences,

540
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,220
then that is a common belief that blood
relations do matter and are socially

541
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,280
construct venture.

542
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,210
He doesn't believe it is now
class and status compared,

543
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,940
uh, um, uh, I, um, sort of
running out of time drawn from to,

544
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,890
uh,
uh,

545
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,990
operate on to do too much on this. Uh, uh,

546
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,480
the, the point right that, uh,

547
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,920
uh, uh, uh, um,

548
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,650
that is some kind of stability in state
to stratification a class certification

549
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,000
is dynamic and,
and conflict shores.

550
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:01,270
This is where his idea of your
come from that in fact, uh, uh, um,

551
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,503
uh,

552
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,740
class relationships are not becoming
more antagonistic over time,

553
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:12,600
but it's becoming less antagonistic
over time. But the point is,

554
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:16,650
as you can see that the main point is
that there are two basic stratification

555
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:20,770
system, one based on uh, uh,

556
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,310
status or Shonda. And
the other one is a, um,

557
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,710
class stratification
historical difference.

558
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:33,711
But that is also a type of stratification
in a class stratified society based on

559
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:36,360
status differences.

560
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,550
So what are he makes a distinction
between different types of classes.

561
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,260
Let me just briefly how, Gosh through
off it. He does not negate that.

562
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:50,070
That is actually a class based on property

563
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:56,630
that is actually the property differences
can be very substantial as long as the

564
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,850
upper think in a market place.

565
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,750
If you know your property
can be sold or bought,

566
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,820
which was not the case under feudalism.

567
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,350
And if that is a labor market
which complements capital markets,

568
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,550
then differences in capital
markets is the source of, uh, uh,

569
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,620
differences. Uh, um, um, uh,

570
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,920
but the most important distinction
is what he calls commercial classes.

571
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,580
And commercial classes are based
right on the market situation,

572
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,020
um, and particularly, uh,
specially based on labor markets.

573
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:42,050
And therefore the Basic Class Distinction
for vapor in modern society is between

574
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:47,361
management and employees
rather than owners of Capitol
and owners of labor power

575
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,020
online marks. And that I think is, uh, uh,

576
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,400
very insightful argument,
at least an important, uh,

577
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,510
uh,

578
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,510
qualification on marsh are probably a
used for replacement of marks with a

579
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,560
better fitting theory to
understand modern societies.

580
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,010
Okay. Uh, and then that are,

581
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:15,430
he introduces the notion of social
classes that is a type of class in modern

582
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:16,914
society,

583
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,280
which is social class and social class
people out in a social class situation.

584
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,490
Then individual and
generational mobility is easy.

585
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:33,270
And typically we see in that class.
Uh,

586
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,210
and then he said, well, what are
social classes? And interestingly,

587
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:42,920
he said, well, these as examples
are working class is a social class.

588
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,130
The petty bourgeoisie is a social class.

589
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,580
The basic argument here
is that, uh, you know,

590
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,640
working class is not a commercial class
working class or valleys writing 19th

591
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:58,850
century, but it's, this is
still to some extent true, uh,

592
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,730
in the United States today, probably
the least. So in the u s uh,

593
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,230
than in other economies.
Then, you know, um, uh,

594
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:11,020
being working class was certainly
very true in Europe. Um, uh,

595
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,280
probably less so now,

596
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:18,281
but even during the second half of
the 20th century in Italy and France,

597
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,520
that it was a very strong
working class consciousness.

598
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,730
You are proud of being working class in
the u s the term working class hardly

599
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:28,880
exist,
right?

600
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,270
We are talking about the working
people rather than a hurricane class,

601
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:37,780
but in Italy or in France where it's a
very strong identity of being a working

602
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:41,900
class, very clearly
identifiable lifestyle features.

603
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,790
Now that if in fact in the United States
you can't really, you usually can tell,

604
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:51,560
I think with 90% certainty
if you walk into a tavern,

605
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,580
right? Um, or you know who,

606
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,850
who is a manual work and who is
not a manual very care, right?

607
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,910
The way how people behave,
the way how people dress,

608
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,850
it gives you a very good clue.
And you know,

609
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:09,590
in France or in Italy to some extent,
even in the United States, uh, you know,

610
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,780
working class, if you'll say, well,

611
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,760
it was good enough for me to be plumper.
Why owners?

612
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:19,850
My son doesn't want to be a plumper
and continue my business as a plumber.

613
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,750
That's good enough. Right?
If it was good enough for me,

614
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,890
it should be good enough for
my son and other, you know,

615
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:32,870
how he understands the social class as a,
as distinct from economic class.

616
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,810
You become a social class when you say,

617
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,860
well you are in working class and uh,
uh,

618
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:44,300
your daughter is dating a lawyer.

619
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,980
He will say, can't you find a
decent working class guy? Uh,

620
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,240
you want to date with this ache had again,

621
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:56,090
in the United States it is
much less common, right?

622
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:01,010
That is many more metro mobility
across class lines, much less so,

623
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,990
uh, in Italy, uh, or uh, or
in France even, even today.

624
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,880
Uh, anyway, this is social class. But
as you can see social class in a way,

625
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:14,000
bringing back the idea of status groups.

626
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,220
It is a modern version of status group,

627
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:21,550
but is being constituted as a social
class cause it has a lot to do bit

628
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,770
lifestyles, values, culture, right?

629
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,520
And typical patterns of mobility
and the aspirations. Um,

630
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,250
uh, such bell, that's about it.

631
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,350
Thank you very much.
