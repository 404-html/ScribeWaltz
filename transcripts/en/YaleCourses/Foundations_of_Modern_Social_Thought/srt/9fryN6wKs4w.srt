1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,400
Good morning.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,110
I want to do what I did it last time
around the test just to walk very quickly

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:14,130
through the test questions
and a sort of test myself.

4
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,870
How would I respond to them? Uh, uh,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,550
there's a lot for today to cover,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,180
so I'm Ivo rush.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,070
Um, uh, oh,

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,380
let me just one more time emphasize,
uh,

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,980
uh, you have plenty of
time to do that, right?

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,680
I have a discussion section at seven,

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,960
so I don't want to reach the, something
is going on their own with the Internet.

12
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:47,490
So I will post this before
my discussion section, uh,

13
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,070
before seven. Exactly. Then I don't know,

14
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:55,071
I mean I have these anxieties hops was
talking about and therefore I don't want,

15
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:01,470
I, I prefer to be five minutes early
rather than being an hour late. Right.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,490
So some,
sometimes before seven UVF find it.

17
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:10,310
Then you have to send you around
set around nine o'clock. Uh, if,

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,030
uh, uh, you know,

19
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:17,031
some of you communicated that you need
another time because you are a already

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,870
engagements, uh, um, uh, it is all of us,

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,730
you have to vary the south beach. You're
a discussion section leader, right?

22
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,190
Um, and your discussion section leader
of yours take care of you or your needs.

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,510
Um, uh, and we be brief, right?

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,110
Sort of the two questions should
be about more like four to six,

25
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,560
um, a double space that babies
that had did and much longer,

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,340
I mean, maybe like Sept
Eight, so we are not,

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,240
you will not be penalized if you are
longer, but the point is not to be long,

28
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:59,160
but to, to be, to be crispy. And again,

29
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,660
the point is, you know, you
know, you try to show, uh,

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,230
the different views of the auteurs
and then comment on it further,

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,570
which is more sense of law,
right?

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,730
And I toured that you're the cure
that have had paper goes this way.

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,350
You spend a turd presenting run water
after about an opponent of that altar,

34
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,310
and then, uh, your reflections
on it, right? That's about it.

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,650
So let me then rush through. This
is not an easy question, right?

36
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,710
Marx theory are fairly young nation
Nicha or fried theory or from a

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,570
civilization.
I mean,

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,560
that is a common feature right?
Between the three orchard. Uh, um,

39
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,010
uh, the city or the ask to create a
controversy between the two. Right?

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,410
You can be too. Um, usually, um,

41
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,480
the common featured is that they are all
concerned about modernity and people's

42
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,110
sense of being lost and being result
control in modernity and the problem of

43
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:13,021
modernity that we are too much control
and the control is increasingly inside us

44
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,580
that, uh, then outside
and coercive. Right?

45
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,260
I think that's the common
feeling. Uh, uh, I think I made,

46
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,100
uh, this point, uh, uh,
in, in the lecture, um,

47
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,630
if you read a 20th century literature,

48
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,340
particularly first half,

49
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,570
you find these feeling
expressed by a lot of novelists.

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,960
You read Franz Kafka, right? Uh, uh, you,

51
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,180
you read the Albert Kami,

52
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,400
that's where you get that
same feeling expressed, uh,

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,700
to what Mark Snitcher and
fried artists bonding too.

54
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,480
But there are big differences,
right? Uh, Mark's,

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,770
uh,

56
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,770
tries to move away from Hagar and wants
to come down to earth and offer a theory

57
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,290
of value our nation, which
is rooted in the economy, in,

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,570
into the production process.

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,960
And Marx has a view of what emancipate
that society VOB and he even has a

60
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:21,940
historic agent will get us
there. Uh, to emancipation,

61
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:26,670
the proletariat, uh, now nutri
is about it different. I,

62
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,760
the genealogical matter does not
really offer you the right solution,

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,633
right?

64
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,850
The genealogical method a orally
shores you about his unique,

65
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,091
uh,
uh,

66
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:44,920
in modernity and modern morality
in the Judeo Christian morality,

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,140
but you think is so attractive
and so mobile and he shows, right?

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,030
Um,
how,

69
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:56,710
right in the workshop
that ideas are produced,

70
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:01,711
it's actually torture and the
pressure and what operates right.

71
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,350
So that is no a good society and
no agent who will get you there,

72
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,830
right? You have to do
it by yourself. Now fry,

73
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,180
there's all sorts is civilization,
um,

74
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,420
as a coming from repression of sexual
drives and I saw a years and a critique of

75
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:28,750
civilization, right? Um,
but at the same time,

76
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,900
pride has these dual attitude
about civilization, right?

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,210
A civilization is coming from repression,

78
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:42,211
but it is still sublimation and the
most beautiful things in human society.

79
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,690
The Art and science are
coming from the sublimation.

80
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,670
And he is also reflecting,

81
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,740
he's writing in 1932 the rise of
Nazism and NT Wright civilization.

82
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,660
And he does not want to support
that. Right? So in a way you,

83
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:04,480
no one can say that. What he does
not have, he does not offer you, um,

84
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,210
uh, uh, division of, with
society to some extent.

85
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,080
He is with Nicha.
He said you have to emancipate yourself.

86
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:16,340
You have to figure it out for
yourself, but your problem is, uh, uh,

87
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,390
and he does certainly does not fit
the head of our historic agent.

88
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Like mark says. Anyway, this is the bay,

89
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,140
Hawaii would be dealing with
this and I've got Vietnam there.

90
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,560
You have what my opinion is.
I want to hear your opinion about them.

91
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,640
Okay. The second question, uh,
that's not, uh, not easy either.

92
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Practical theory of to send
nature genealogical method there,

93
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,240
there is again,

94
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,320
a common Emela LMN
between marks and Nicha.

95
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,140
Neither of them believes Ian.
Objective, abstract throughs,

96
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,330
right? Um, uh,

97
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:57,280
mark says there is no
objective abstract tools. Uh,

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,300
truth is like practical question throughs
is being achieved by the end by human

99
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:07,520
practices, right? Uh,
and Nichelle, of course,

100
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:11,420
does not believing in
objective truths, right? Uh,

101
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,850
he's trying to find truth,

102
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,860
but truth is being
accomplished by comparing,

103
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,191
you know,

104
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:24,191
different notions of mortality and to
show that in comparison with each other,

105
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:30,630
most heavies, upsides and
downsides, right? So that is, uh,

106
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,060
um, uh, uh, uh, he by the very nature,

107
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,250
don't misunderstand him. He is
not a knee healist. He doesn't,

108
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,120
he does not see everything
goes Nikki elitism or is, is,

109
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,670
is a very negative term for nature.

110
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,780
So he does not want to say that
is no two said, oh, he said,

111
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:55,781
truth is just relative and you can
arrive at critical understanding of your

112
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:01,100
situation by comparing your
situation with, with an order bomb.

113
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,910
That is of course, a very
fundamental different, again,

114
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,680
between a marks.

115
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,880
I'm a niche here because what
is this practical truths?

116
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,100
These are human activities.

117
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:17,960
And Mark's basically arrives at
this human activities, uh, uh,

118
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,790
thrill changing the physical words through
the system of production. And again,

119
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,710
he has the agent who is a,
uh,

120
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,150
this is the revolution and the
practices of the product diarrhea,

121
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,210
which really get you to the truth. That
is nothing like that in nature, right?

122
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,090
Nature does not have a history.

123
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:40,380
Got Adrian and does not have the society,
uh,

124
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,410
where after or, uh, uh,

125
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,040
or uveal yet to through society.

126
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,410
Well, this is actually a very
simple question. Can't, you know,

127
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,530
many of you did not like
it. So I'm, you know,

128
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:59,400
I'm thinking very hard that had to put it
on. It's a bit narrow, but very simple.

129
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,430
Um,
a German ideology under good.

130
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,400
Andre's a very simple,

131
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,780
there are two unique features
in the German ideology.

132
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,100
One is when he def,

133
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,810
he does develop the notion
of mode of production for
the first time in this book,

134
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,080
45, uh, 1845,

135
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,120
but he does identify the
nature of, uh, uh, uh, uh,

136
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:28,110
mode of production,
primarily by division of Labor.

137
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,700
And this doesn't serve him very valid
because the division of labor does not

138
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:36,960
capture the conflictuous
relationships between classes,

139
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,440
which eventually will have
to lead to revolution.

140
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:45,441
So he abandoned since it does not finish
the book because only at the very end

141
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:49,620
of the book does he realize that uh,
uh,

142
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,070
the two component of a mode of production
as a forces of production technology

143
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:01,350
and the relations of production and
the relations of production, uh,

144
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,610
for most of the German
ideology is division of Labor.

145
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,330
And then he realized his, no, no,
no, it is not division of labor,

146
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,180
but a [inaudible] relations,

147
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,590
the relationship between those who
have property and those who do not have

148
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,120
property.
Um,

149
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,180
and he also has a very deterministic
view of history in the German ideology.

150
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,990
All societies have to go through
the same modes of production.

151
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,300
Um, dry bullyism slave mode of
production, a few dollars, man capitalism,

152
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,320
uh, in the ground he said
that are two big innovations.

153
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,850
Now the center is property relations.
Uh,

154
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,430
he studied the beak of history.
If capita is van,

155
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,030
the producer is separated from the
means of production completely.

156
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,460
Um, and he breaks from the, uh,

157
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,740
a deterministic view of
history. Right now he has, he,

158
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,220
these Marty linner development of history.

159
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,340
Not every society has to come
through slavery. And feudalism,

160
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,330
the Asiatic societies in a glares,

161
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:16,110
I communal society can move
directly into capitalism. Okay.

162
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,170
So that's basically a
very simple question.

163
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,540
I probably did a very bad job in the
lecture that this did not become clear.

164
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,390
A set form.

165
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,850
Mark's is a historical materialist
and compare him with Frye.

166
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,430
Now, uh, I actually am
inspired here by, uh,

167
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,320
Juergen Habermas and you're going,

168
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,230
Habermas says there are marks in the
thesis on fire Buck. Got It. Right.

169
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,450
Then he said that the real point of
departure is sensors, human activity.

170
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,450
Uh,
at time then harbor moss was writing this.

171
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:58,630
She was still a material
is then he had his culture.

172
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,590
Turnon is probably not a material
is standing wrong. He said,

173
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,670
materialism is,

174
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:08,050
if you point of departure is what
you can get through your senses,

175
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:12,820
not through your ideas. But he
said, Mark's made a mistake. Uh,

176
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:17,080
namely that he reduced census
human activities to the economy,

177
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,140
um, and to production. And there are,

178
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,160
he said a fried is more
interesting because he has
a different kind of sensors,

179
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,170
human activity and this is census,

180
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:32,200
human activities between people,
right?

181
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,150
Sexual relationships. In fact, harbor
must makes it more complicated. You know,

182
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,520
it's,
I don't want to get into harbor mass,

183
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,530
but he's interpretation of Fridays
at fried is also starts from sensors.

184
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,560
Human activity to understand
what is in people's mind.

185
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,100
But it is not economic reductionism.

186
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,420
If anything it is sexual.
Uh, uh, reduction is man,

187
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,080
it is a ban erotic explanation of history,

188
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,640
but in some ways, you know,
they all stars for sensors,

189
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:08,560
human activities in explaining
what can it be in people's mind.

190
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:10,180
What is our ideas though?

191
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:14,500
The starting point is material
sensors experience, right?

192
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,800
And the product ad ideas that this is in
the sense the are most material is but

193
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,950
in different ways.
Is that I,

194
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,980
I suppose it should be pretty clear now.
All right.

195
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,690
Okay. Uh, classes, well,

196
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,670
you can have different views on this
and especially whether in Marx theory of

197
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,040
classes are still applicable.
You know,

198
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,460
Marcy find classes in terms
of property relationship.

199
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,240
He had two classes, uh, in
the communist manifesto.

200
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,660
The bourgeois has the younger
proletariat. Uh, the question is,

201
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:52,420
does it still matter and
you have to reflect on this.

202
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,690
Do you think property relations still
is a major antagonistic divided in

203
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:01,870
American society or not?
Andy longer. And of course,

204
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:06,460
Marx believed in the communist manifesto.
Yes, that is the lower middle class.

205
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:11,050
But it will be that of a middle class of
you'll become either bourgeois artwork,

206
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,850
it'd become a proletarian.
And of course in the United States,

207
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:20,770
the Vista received wisdom is that Vro
or middle class are the or middle class.

208
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,600
Uh, I would love to hear your view about
this. Right? But that's the big question.

209
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,670
Clearly marks the it wrong. That's
undoubtedly, I think everybody agree.

210
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,560
I think Karl Marx, if he wouldn't be
alive, he would say, ah, I screwed it.

211
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,420
I made a mistake. Of course, that
is a big middle class. Right? Um,

212
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,740
so I mean, uh, you don't have,
you don't have to really, uh,

213
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:48,760
hate marks. You know that
there is a middle class. He
believes he made a mistake.

214
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,940
Right. Uh, anyway, but you
can, you can ask the question,

215
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,150
who is the middle class are indeed
V or middle class? Is there,

216
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,500
is this sensible to talk about
the big bourgeoisie that I know,

217
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,850
big Buzz Razia any longer.
This is people's capitalism.

218
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,480
Bolivian as these other questions. I
would like you to deal with it. Okay.

219
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,270
Labor theory of value and that I'm Smith.

220
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,040
I thought this is a very easy
question, right? Uh, Adam Smith Sad,

221
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,750
uh, that you know, or uh, well
value is created by labor,

222
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:25,430
but then he said when it comes
to distributing, yeah, uh, uh,

223
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,260
Val's so or income,
it has to go to labor capital and uh,

224
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,210
land. Uh, Mark's on the other hand
set, val, this is contradiction.

225
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:39,100
If all labor goes to a four,
value is created by labor,

226
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:42,680
but it should go to labor and
therefore it is taken away for labor.

227
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,560
Should be understood as exploitation.

228
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,050
Is this an advance or is this a
misunderstanding? And you can say, well,

229
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:55,520
this is a misunderstanding
because a Adam Smith's was right.

230
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,880
He said, Oh, labor is, or,

231
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,940
or value is created by labor in societies
where capital is not accumulated and

232
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:08,910
the land is not privately owned. And
therefore this is a consistent argument.

233
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,580
Or you can say,
well,

234
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,730
Mark's actually got a very important
point because there is indeed exploitation

235
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:20,330
there. Alex brought to relationships
and he does drive history.

236
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:24,350
I mean how you take your position,
this is up to you.

237
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,060
You have to argue consistently that
and the argument of consistent they've,

238
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,010
you'll be revived at seven.
Well this is again,

239
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:38,210
a lot of people said don't do it because
we have not talked about domination.

240
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,330
I probably alleviate because I've,
you're talking the, uh, in the next, uh,

241
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,020
uh,
uh,

242
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,970
how much I have got 40 minutes about this,

243
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,470
um,
uh,

244
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,500
domination and of production and world
domination is where Protestant ethic

245
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,820
cross, he is an ideal is some people
think that this is a too narrow question.

246
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,860
Then I think you kind of, um, we
can, um, uh, ask the question,

247
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,470
is this really an Nadia is few,
some people said,

248
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,290
but vapor is saying that it is,
uh,

249
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,580
Calvin is in which created a capitalism.
Is this his view?

250
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,290
What is exactly his view? Uh, um, is, uh,

251
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,220
he's uh, is very critical of marks. Um,

252
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,420
uh, is, uh, uh, he believes that,
you know, Mark's has a simplistic,

253
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,640
a materialist explanation.

254
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,320
It is consciousness which letter it is
existence which determines countries and

255
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,160
has that are then the other way around.
Um,

256
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,390
is a vapor saying the opposite.

257
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:45,650
It is a consciousness bitch debtor
and man's existence or capitalism.

258
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,950
And uh, that's, that's what, uh, the
Patterson that is trying to do. Uh,

259
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,770
and of course he has this interesting
notion of elective affinity questions

260
00:17:55,771 --> 00:18:00,690
about that that is really a
causal relationship between
ideas and the economy.

261
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,220
And you can labor on this, uh, what
he might mean and what you think.

262
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:09,810
This is a cop out, right?
That he actually, uh,

263
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,890
um,
uh,

264
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,600
his marks more of a contemporary
social theorist because he has a causal

265
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:18,090
explanation.
He tries to give scores,

266
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:21,450
I'll explanation and that's what you
are taught in political science or

267
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:26,430
economics, but we are social science
comes up with causal explanations, right.

268
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,320
And Mike VBA shy survey and mark
stash to do causal analysis.

269
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,430
Okay.
Uh,

270
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,400
did I miss [inaudible]?
Well,

271
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,530
this is very much a very,

272
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:46,440
very similar to the
previous question here.

273
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:50,780
Only I ask you to compare
the two is mark three yearly,

274
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,800
a simple minded economic determinist,
the the term minister.

275
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,610
It is a existence which debtor and
mass consciousness, what is, he has a,

276
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,550
has a more complicated view.

277
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,590
Is that a contradiction in Mark's
right or the philosophy of Praxis,

278
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:12,000
that yard making history. He also
makes that claim. How does it fit?

279
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,270
That's just simply contradict himself
or is this a consistent ideology and you

280
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:21,660
know, Labor is, he and I are the of the
store. He is not really an idea. This,

281
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,040
what does he mean by these elective
affinity? And then the final,

282
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,390
the final question.

283
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:32,300
I think people seem to be liking
this and now the easy by the vape,

284
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,230
Mark's clearly has a notion of
um, uh, uh, uh, human nature,

285
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,010
right? Mark's beliefs is a real soya
and an even more radical than Russo.

286
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,050
Ian Theory of human nature,
especially in his theory, uh, of, uh,

287
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,620
alienation, right? We are good.

288
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,530
And the problem comes as society,
uh,

289
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,170
makes us alienated.

290
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,040
But I think he goes a
little beyond the, uh, uh,

291
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,710
Rousseau because he thinks
that in the state of nature,

292
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,730
we are actually social being
social is in our nature,

293
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,370
a full ride. Rousseau
did not think so. Um, uh,

294
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,400
the mobile savage has to be
socialized into CVS society.

295
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,810
Mice believes that this whole idea
of state of nature is an abstraction.

296
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:25,900
We are all born in society
and by nature we are social.

297
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,100
All of the capital isn't,
which makes us competitive.

298
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,430
Competitive Bourgeois
individuals makes us our short,

299
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,760
he saw Straw and egoistic now does
vapor has a theory of human nature.

300
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,220
It's a more difficult question to pose.
I think if,

301
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,520
if I would argue, I would say
they [inaudible] last have one.

302
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:53,521
It is closer to hops because he
does believe that people are the,

303
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,410
the history of human can is a
struggle for power. That yeah.

304
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,330
Unending struggle for power.
And that's,

305
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:06,190
that's why he explained human history
with power struggles. That's about it.

306
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:09,850
That's the way how I would do that
much shell try to deal with this.

307
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,690
I hope this was somewhat helpful.

308
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,060
Uh, and, uh,

309
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,920
makes you relaxed, right? That this
will not be a difficult test. Uh,

310
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,600
uh, it will be actually a lot
of fun to deal with this, uh,

311
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,780
intriguing, interesting issues. Okay.

312
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,810
Uh, and believe me, id or
he wants you to have fun. I,

313
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,040
uh, uh, uh,

314
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,120
I think these are interesting
questions. Uh, okay,

315
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:49,121
now we come to labor theory of
domination and that's almost impossible,

316
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:54,710
but I'm trying to do now,
but we'll try to rush you through.

317
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,680
Um, and first of all, if you have
to understand VBA theory of action,

318
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,570
uh, uh, which, uh, uh, has
some similarities to Hoppes,

319
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,000
what Hoppes, Yardi or voluntaristic
action, uh, but then, uh,

320
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,940
we also have to deal with Weber's
a notion of rationality. Uh,

321
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,520
and then, uh, his distinction
between power and domination. Uh,

322
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,640
he's sturdy of legitimacy. This is
very, very important. Uh, it's, um,

323
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,800
uh, one of the most
fundamental, uh, concept, uh,

324
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,140
in particularly in political theory but
also in economics and the in sociology.

325
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,740
Um,

326
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,740
and finally his Stipe's off authority
Viveo deal at great lengths with different

327
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:43,550
types of authority.

328
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:48,551
I just give you a sense of what
this is in the next 25 minutes.

329
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,940
Okay.
The four types of economic action,

330
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:56,510
he makes a distinction that
that question is how can,

331
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,050
how are the orienting with
each other about motivates us,

332
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,620
van Vr interacting with other people.

333
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,600
He said where we can act
instrumental, the rational, the end.

334
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:11,150
I'd be like spelling it to you,
what he means. And then he said,

335
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:15,400
we can or you also act very
rash and Molly and again,

336
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,630
we all come explain what this means.
Uh,

337
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,440
in our interaction we can,
uh,

338
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,270
led by our emotions.
And he said,

339
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:30,230
this is well, this is rational. He said,

340
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:32,240
this is not on the rational thing.
It,

341
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,590
it is not necessarily on rational that
we act out of our emotions and ivy will

342
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:42,200
tell you then he thinks
this is becoming irrational,

343
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,020
acting out of emotion or in our,

344
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,090
we can be led by tradition.
Now to understand this,

345
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:50,960
that you know,

346
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,350
that we actually interact with each
other in very different ways over time.

347
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,390
You know,
be the same person.

348
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:04,391
We can act occasionally instrumentality
or occasionally we can act them a

349
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,940
factually right or occasionally we act
over somebody because we have a great

350
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:16,001
deal of emotion or feeling love or
the hate and occasionally they can act

351
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,200
instrumental, right? The use somebody
in order to achieve somebody.

352
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,300
Can I borrow $20 from you?
Right? Then the Act instrumental,

353
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,700
uh, but we also can act
out of a heat or, or love,

354
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,490
right. Um, in a discussion section,

355
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:39,491
I really hate the guts of somebody
with all of us speaking right in the

356
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:44,300
discussion section and then I just
will contradict because, you know,

357
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:45,134
I just,

358
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,380
it is my antagonism or I just sympathize
with somebody and therefore I also tend

359
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:55,160
to disagree,
basically driven by my emotion.

360
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,790
And now I even not talking about
love of which combines people. Uh,

361
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,673
more.

362
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Now what is behind this is
Weber's fundamental methodology.

363
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,810
He calls his approach to society.
Uh,

364
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,300
interpretative sociology.

365
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,190
The term interpretative sociology
is translated from German.

366
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,460
The German term is Featherston.

367
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,820
Verstehen means understanding occasionally
they also translated into English.

368
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:34,031
That fourth vapor does is understand
Weber's strong commitment.

369
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,940
Is that social analyst be eaten?

370
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,280
Economist be a political scientist.

371
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,820
The sociologists be a historian,

372
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,350
a be an anthropologist is not two
plus value judgements on other,

373
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,590
but to try to understand what drives other
people don't assume that other people

374
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:01,640
because the egg differently than
you would have in that situation,

375
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,180
that they are done evil or irrational.
Right?

376
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,170
This is particularly a
debate with economists.

377
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Economists tend to have very strong
conception that that is one economical,

378
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:18,740
irrational behavior they ever said.
No,

379
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:21,260
I mean that are the values stype of this,

380
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:26,261
how we can act and my job is not to
say now you've already irrational.

381
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,170
My job is to try to put myself into your
position and to understand why you did

382
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,770
and why you did do they,
how you did it.

383
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,940
This is interpretative sociology,
right?

384
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,640
This is understanding fash there,
right? That I am more sure.

385
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,590
Naughty tried to put myself into your
situation and rather than saying,

386
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,490
this is what I will do,
Ivs,

387
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,650
obviously if I were you
right in your situation,

388
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,620
would I do the same thing? Why? Why
do you do that the way how you do,

389
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,270
do assuming that you are
not acting irrationally,

390
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,860
but try to understand by
you, activate you act. Okay.

391
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,030
Now let's talk about
instrumental irrational acture.

392
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,380
This comes through the closest,
but, uh, most economists,

393
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:21,381
especially now classical economists
regard as rational economic action.

394
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,820
He said instantly, mentally,
uh, rational actually cross it.

395
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,960
Sabec Roseo naughty date. Um, uh, uh, uh,

396
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,020
is when the ends and the means,
uh,

397
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:40,200
or rationally taken into
account and they did right?

398
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,040
This is kind of utility maximization,
right?

399
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,170
When you utilitarians defined
this as the rational way to act,

400
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:51,120
right,
that you have,

401
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,170
you are striving for happiness and
you tried to achieve this happiness.

402
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,730
And in this process you maximize utility.

403
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You try to reduce the expenses and
you try to increase the return on,

404
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,610
uh,
what you try to achieve.

405
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,910
But let me also emphasize that Weber's
notion of instrumental rationality does

406
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:19,540
not say that the ends are
irrational, right? Uh,

407
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,840
and they were very much like
John Stuart mill is quiet or via,

408
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,190
that's the actually do have
preferences and there are some ants.

409
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:32,820
What we find more
valuable than other lans.

410
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Instrumental rationality only means if
in order to achieve this end the is too

411
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,200
costly for us,

412
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,790
then we probably revealed wolf for
our second Beth and answer that there.

413
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,600
Then our first [inaudible], right? Uh,

414
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:53,550
so uh, there I would like
to date somebody. Um,

415
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,670
uh, I very much would
like to date that person,

416
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:59,160
but in order to have a successful date,

417
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I have to take this person into a Forbes
five star restaurants bell that Bill

418
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,230
did dinner will cost me $200.

419
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,490
Now there is another person whom I
would not mind to date with, you know,

420
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,520
my second preference and that would go
over it a two star restaurant and would

421
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:24,300
cost me only 50 bucks and therefore,
you know, Ivl vate you know,

422
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,450
is this my preference for the first day
it is so strong that it is verse for me

423
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:35,220
to pay $200 or it's actually
not that much stronger.

424
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:40,430
My second preference is actually pretty
good and therefore I actually go for the

425
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:45,340
$50 at dinner. You see what I'm getting
at? So you are waiting rational,

426
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,460
the balls,
the ends and the means,

427
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,310
and you'll come to a conclusion again,
you know,

428
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,460
not all that far away from hops,
right?

429
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,080
And hops idea, right? Uh,
that we are, you know,

430
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,120
we do have these drives,

431
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:05,950
we have these appetites and we have
these fears and then we arrive at a veal.

432
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,930
This is instrumental rationality,
but he said people can act value,

433
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:13,870
rationality.
And if somebody adds value rationally,

434
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,140
I am not willing to call them
irrational there you rationality.

435
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,470
If somebody says,

436
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,710
this value is so important for me
that I don't care what is the price,

437
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:30,510
I will have to pay for it. Right? Um, uh,

438
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,880
let me give you a very simple example,
right?

439
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,150
You actually made think that human life
is particularly valuable right now.

440
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,590
Uh,

441
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,590
you or your partner may the expectation
get shy and then you will have to make a

442
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:52,120
decision where you give birth to this
child or do you have an abortion? Right?

443
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,140
And then it can come back
to value rationality. Right?

444
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,410
People can say that the life of an
onboard shine is so superior for me.

445
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,831
They'll do.

446
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:07,600
I know it is a very crazy stuff for me
to have a child or my partner to have a

447
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:10,330
child right now, I will do it, you know,

448
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:14,860
because I am active value rationally.
I know it is instrumental,

449
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,090
irrational, right? I may have
to create cool school, you know,

450
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:22,930
in order to earn an income or to
take care of the baby or something.

451
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,830
And I actually screwing my life.
But I don't mind.

452
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,270
I because I have such a strong value
commitment. You see what I'm getting at?

453
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,080
And you cannot say this is
irrational behavior, right?

454
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:40,410
This is rational behavior because people
has a commitment to an alternate value.

455
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,680
And these ultimate value occasionally
is so high that you are sacrificing your

456
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,450
economic interests.
And occasionally you sacrifice your life.

457
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,290
You are willing to die for noble causes,
right?

458
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,820
And you do it right. Um, uh, um, uh, uh,

459
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,080
rationally you vague but
you low that uveal die.

460
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,350
And if you know that you'd be
a die for these noble course,

461
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,840
one cannot say that you are
acting irrationally, uh,

462
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,230
uh,

463
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,230
factual orientation affect [inaudible]
mean that you are led by emotions.

464
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,480
You said it can be on the border line
because if it is simply an uncontrolled

465
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,840
reaction to a situation,
then it is irrational, right?

466
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,120
If you simply acting out of anger,
then you vote irrational, right?

467
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,600
Um, when you are drunk, uh,

468
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,320
in that party and you are saying something
to your partner and your relationship

469
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:42,650
is breaking up, you'll, you'll actually
wanted this relationship to go on.

470
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,930
Next morning you wake up and said, my
goodness gracious. What have I done?

471
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,200
Right? I was dumb. I was irrational.

472
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,910
I was led by emotions. I said,
thanks for that should not have said,

473
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,650
in this case a motion was
irrational. It was, um,

474
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,980
an uncontrolled reaction to a stimulation.

475
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:09,310
But otherwise to act out of love and
to make sacrifices for love is very

476
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:15,260
rational, right? We do this all the
time, right? Your parents do it,

477
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:16,580
you know,
they send you to,

478
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,590
to Yale and they paid $200,000
to get you a year degree.

479
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:25,650
Right. Bell very well over
there that probably they've,

480
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:30,590
you'll never get anything right that back
from you, right? They hope they view it.

481
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,400
Get some love back from you. What they
might or they might not write bots,

482
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:37,670
you know, they act out
of love. And you know,

483
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:42,671
some people may say you are crazy why
you invest so much to your children.

484
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:48,130
Maybe we'll put you in a home of hell
down right when you get old [inaudible]

485
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,690
right. All right. That
day. But the answer is,

486
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,830
but I love my child and I will upon
the best word that my child, right.

487
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,410
This is a very not irrational behavior.
They'll justify it. That'd be great.

488
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:07,411
These are traditional orientation
where you have talk of tradition,

489
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,090
right? Um, uh,

490
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,370
now some people actually still believe
in arranged marriages, right? Uh,

491
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,480
certainly if you are Islamic or
even if you are an Orthodox Jew,

492
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,830
you probably wanted to chip, choose your
partner through an arranged marriage,

493
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,730
right? You go to the rabbi and the
rabbi villa arranged a marriage for you.

494
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,680
You are,
you have to be pretty orthodox.

495
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,520
But there are some words that don't shoot.
So do manage Boston should do that.

496
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,320
Is it irrational, irrational? Actually,

497
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,170
Yvonne can say romantic love is not
all that bloody rational. You know,

498
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:46,410
the whole idea that you see somebody fall
in love and next day you propose that

499
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:49,240
seems to be pretty shitty
thing to do is not,

500
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:52,650
it is much better to go to
the rabbi who knows you,

501
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:57,651
who knows your prayer potential partner
and arrange the marriage what you

502
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,720
anyway,

503
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,720
the point is right tradition can
guide your action and that's again not

504
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,530
irrational.
It is only irrational.

505
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,590
It is completely on thinking.
That's,

506
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,440
I think that's very important to say
that not if it is self conscious,

507
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:18,760
you know what you do.
I do it because I am a Jew.

508
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,170
I am doing yet because I m f fun,
you know,

509
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:28,171
because I am at the born Christian
and that's what reborn Christians do,

510
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:33,880
right? If you follow this way, you
know, then you are acting rationally.

511
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,360
What not acting irrationally
to put it more now,

512
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:43,950
what is rationality now?
I think the key,

513
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,270
it's a very complex notion for me
and that you can have different

514
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,360
interpretation.
Now I will give you my interpretation.

515
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,940
I think what is importance,
right?

516
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:58,941
That the rationality means that
you sub substitute on thinking,

517
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,950
uh, acceptance of a situation
and uh, um, uh, uh, uh,

518
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,580
not thought out or uh,

519
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,760
spuntinos or the actions
do deliberate adaptation.

520
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,790
So when you are conscious about what
you are knowing a then you are actually

521
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:20,940
acting rationally ordered,
at least you are not acting irrationally.

522
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,180
He makes a distinction between
rational, which is, uh,

523
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,860
giving a great deal of
thought and non rational.

524
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,000
Where if actually there is still some
reflection of warring ground, uh,

525
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,330
Schlichter a major,
uh,

526
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,810
Weber's scholar who knows much
more about [inaudible] than I do.

527
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:44,600
Do I have read this book cover to
cover a couple of times? Um, uh,

528
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,240
I haven't tried order 60 volumes
soft faber cover to cover,

529
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:50,510
but have left quite a bit of it anyway.

530
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,970
I'm not sure if they'll have
read everything more than once.

531
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,650
This is his interpretation.

532
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,950
He said the question is means and aunts
instrumental rationality is the automat

533
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:05,670
rationality because you
consider most means and ends.

534
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,751
And he said,

535
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:11,280
value rationality is a lower level of
rationality because you do not consider a

536
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:15,030
really, um, uh, uh,

537
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,170
means annual longer that I'd ans dominate
and try the shrine and the factual

538
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:23,460
nationality are more marginal
types offered nationality.

539
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,680
Well, um, I would offer you
an alternative interpretation.

540
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:33,430
This is my reconstruct and sure enough
Yurigan harbor mass, we said Vale,

541
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,640
the VBA is emphasizing is what is the
level right off your reflectivity.

542
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,660
Do you really think
about what you are doing?

543
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:48,000
And also to what extent you can
communicate to ardors what you are doing.

544
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,920
And if you do it this way, you can
have reflexivity which is very high.

545
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,670
So you think very hard while you
are doing and you are over there,

546
00:37:56,671 --> 00:38:01,200
but the motivation of your extra knees
and you can explain it to a grade due to

547
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,730
others if this is,

548
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:07,200
so I think this is really hard by mass
there your rationality is the highest

549
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,940
level of rationality,
right?

550
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,210
Because you can really
explain your values.

551
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:15,150
Very were instrumental rationality.

552
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,320
That is not much to say this is all in
the I am making more money this way.

553
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,130
Right?

554
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,900
And therefore the level of
communication is relatively low door.

555
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,630
You'll know very well
about you are doing anyway.

556
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,440
I just leave it for you don't
want to elaborate on this anymore,

557
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,520
but the bottom line is for Vba
rationality is he has something to do.

558
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,760
How conscious you are of what you are
doing and how conscious you are of the

559
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,710
consequences of your action.

560
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,980
You are irrational then you are,

561
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,000
you don't know what the
consequences of your actions. Now,

562
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,060
power and domination a ver makes a
fundamental difference between power in

563
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:02,980
German,
mocked and domination.

564
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,790
And this is a very important citation,
right?

565
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,090
Power is the probability
that an an activist and a
social relationship of you'll

566
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,820
be in a position to carry out.
He's only the oldest spy to resistance.

567
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,400
You can resist and never had their last.

568
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:24,400
The person who is in power can
force you to do what you want to do.

569
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,470
He said that these actually vet
rarely happens in social situations,

570
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,430
but typically defined social.
What's the situation?

571
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:37,810
Is relationships of domination.
That's about he costs, had a shaft.

572
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:43,360
Um, uh, um, uh, don't mean nation. Uh,

573
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:47,610
is the probability that a
command VOB obeyed, right?

574
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,780
Uh, the difference right
between, uh, um, uh, uh,

575
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,680
bow the nomination.

576
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,650
This is sort of my
little like lesion here.

577
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,510
Nomination is nothing else but
power and legitimacy, right?

578
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:09,070
The people who hold power
try to legitly mate,

579
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:13,510
what they do, you know, I was trying
to do this in the first 20 minutes.

580
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,160
Oh fuck. You know, you have these
questions, three sounds and if he got the,

581
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm not difficult. They are exciting. You
know, they, I tried to legitimate myself.

582
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,110
This is sensible that you try to answer
discretion. You'll learn, you know,

583
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:28,090
you will understand society better.

584
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,280
You will understand yourself better if
you think about these questions, right?

585
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,780
I was trying to legitimate the process
letter then just acting out of,

586
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,150
or if by nine o'clock to
be or not be here, you've,

587
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:45,640
you'll get an F, right? And then you've,
you'll be in big trouble. Rajeev,

588
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:48,610
you'll not get your degree. No,
I did not want to legitimate.

589
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,050
I try to legitimate what we will
be doing this afternoon, right.

590
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,730
By the legitimacy saying this.
If it would be sensible for you to do,

591
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,800
you benefit from it, right?
I try to internalize, right?

592
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,920
But I want you to do between seven and
nine that you will be getting to believe.

593
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,160
This is good for me, that I'm
doing it. It is fun, right?

594
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:15,340
On the learning and the teaching myself,

595
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,270
this is my self development, right?
So I was trying to corn verb,

596
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,520
right? Power into
domination, um, and right.

597
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:26,410
And that is legitimacy.

598
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,460
A claim that what I'm doing then
I'm asking you a seven clock.

599
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:37,070
You know, not to have a,
um, uh, uh, a cocktail.

600
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,500
But to sit down in front of your computer
and to write a test is good for you,

601
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,610
right?

602
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,630
And if you internalize it and you're
beginning to think how wonderful you know

603
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:52,370
that I can delay the, these, a
cocktail for two hours, right?

604
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,710
Then I achieved, then I, you know, then it
was domination rather than power. Right?

605
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,780
Is that clear?
Now what is legitimacy?

606
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,740
This is a very tricky question.
Under the veil. I have my own view.

607
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:10,010
Many people will then
mentally disagree with to me.

608
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,470
Uh, he said, and that's very
important. Every January one,

609
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:19,730
form of domination implies a
minimum of voluntary compliance.

610
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,920
That is an interest in
obedience, right? Uh,

611
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,790
unless I could persuade you
that you will feel, they'll,

612
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,710
um, uh, I actually, uh,
uh, could, you know,

613
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:37,700
I could drop this course and not to
take this stats. This is too difficult.

614
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:42,330
I just dropped the course. I can live
with Saudi scores. Uh, uh, you, you,

615
00:42:42,331 --> 00:42:46,220
you can have a kind of voluntary
compliance and most important,

616
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:51,110
and in us, you beginning to sing, well,
ivy learn something by doing this.

617
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,040
If I achieve that, then this,
this is really domination.

618
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,750
Uh, uh, now this is also extremely, uh,

619
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,550
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,
important argument, right? Uh,

620
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:11,540
that, um, uh, um, uh, every privilege,

621
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:16,541
globs of our people in position
of power are developing and myth,

622
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:22,520
uh, of their superiority.
We are devil thing emit,

623
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,080
uh, that this is, uh, uh,
useful for you to obey.

624
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:31,070
So the essence right of legitimacy,
that it has a certain,

625
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,540
expect you to believe in the reasons,

626
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:39,920
but those in position of power
try to justify their power.

627
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,190
But also an understanding that this is
a myth because this is a light comes to

628
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:48,960
very close to nature.

629
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,290
This is the niche is sticking
his head out here. All right?

630
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,340
Uh, it is a methodology.
It's not really true, right?

631
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:03,290
You just internalize your own a
submission to the authority, right?

632
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,370
But you,

633
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:08,600
but the tendency in histories
that you will internalize it.

634
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,110
So this is very different
from what we normally say,

635
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:17,140
legitimacy because by legitimacy in
contemporary political discourse reefers

636
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,130
well, uh, uh,

637
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,150
[inaudible] is not legitimate
because he was faking the elections.

638
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,450
If elections are fair, um, and three,

639
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,010
then the person who is elected is
a legitimate glue ruler. No, no,

640
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,300
that's not Weber's view.

641
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,010
It's not a universe of uh,
uh,

642
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,480
suffrage and free and fair elections.

643
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:44,420
What makes the ruler legitimate but maze
the ruler legitimate that the ruler is

644
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:49,421
capable to develop metallurgies to
justified that you better obey the orders,

645
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:56,991
what is given to you because you have
some self interest to do so and you have

646
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:02,781
some level of belief that it is actually
not bad for you to do what the ruler

647
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:06,690
wants you to do.
Right now,

648
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:11,691
there are different types of domination
and authority and this is bad.

649
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:14,930
He clashes right with my,

650
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,570
as you as we have seen Reich's Mark's
developed his diaper ology of societies

651
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,460
from economic systems,
economy drives history.

652
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:31,620
Uh, um, vapor is a new chair and hops,

653
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:35,520
yen or Nichier, right? But
drives history is power,

654
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,120
struggle for power and the nature of our,

655
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:44,121
how power is constructed and how our
power is a sublimated right into a

656
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:51,370
domination to put it in
the Friday and way. Uh,

657
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:55,770
that is how she, you should
understand how societies operate.

658
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,740
So it is not more so production.
What describes the evolution of his 30,

659
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,260
but types of domination,

660
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:09,261
which describes the evolution of history
and that are really three types of,

661
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,850
uh, uh, uh,

662
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,780
what he calls legitimate
authorities that are three days,

663
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:19,860
how rulers in history
legitimated their rules.

664
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:24,540
It can be legal, rational, uh,
easily. You can say liberal,

665
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:25,440
uh,

666
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,440
traditional and charismatic and
Vivio spend the time on this.

667
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,670
Each one of them are just very
briefly tell you what, uh,

668
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:41,150
these different authorities are legal or
National Authority is a system in which

669
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,810
that is a belief in the
legality of enacting the rules.

670
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,280
Um,
uh,

671
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,050
and the doors who are
actually issuing the commands,

672
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,580
they themselves are bound by those rules.

673
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:04,320
By this is the rule of law.
That's why he caused legal,

674
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,760
rational authority.

675
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:10,500
It is rule of law administered
in a bureaucratic manner.

676
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,410
You do not have a personal master.

677
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,170
You do not obey a person.

678
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,580
You obey the rules of
the game, right? And the,

679
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,000
and these rules of the game I prescribed,
you know,

680
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:26,550
in advance because before you act,

681
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,810
it is sad and you followed these,
that is legal, rational authority.

682
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,770
This is not identical
with the avid democracy.

683
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,580
If can be democratic or
it can the authoritarian,

684
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,790
it can be actually a
constitutional monarchy rather
constitutional monarch pass

685
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,660
laws by a separate legislature,

686
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,610
which was or was not democratically
elected, but everybody knew who the,

687
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:59,440
who the rules of the game are. Right?
In our constitutional monarchy,

688
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,320
18th century,
early 19th century England,

689
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,560
no democratically elected parliament.
Right?

690
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,980
But the laws were there and the monarch
followed the law or laws that was legal,

691
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:15,850
rational authority. Uh, uh,

692
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,450
then you have traditional authority,
traditional authority,

693
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:24,451
he said rests on the established
beliefs on the sanctity of in memorial

694
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:29,971
traditions and the legitimacy of those
exercising the authority under them.

695
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,890
In some ways, you know, when
you are obeying, you are father,

696
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,420
you are acting under
traditional authority.

697
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:41,840
The authority,

698
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,660
what your father has is ascribe
to your father by tradition,

699
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,150
right?
The know that this is something,

700
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:53,650
but fathers do have a
legitimate right to say, right?

701
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,450
Uh, that in fact, you know,

702
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,480
fathers do have a legitimate right to
say that by midnight you have to be at

703
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:05,020
home, right? They kind of are not
very happy about this. You know,

704
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:08,950
when you were 16, you started to
the vote against this, but you know,

705
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:13,720
you accepted this is normally what
you know, fathers or mothers to say,

706
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:17,950
you know, and you know, you
also said, well, uh, um,

707
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,910
are you did something and therefore for
this weekend you cannot go out. Right.

708
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:27,580
And they are acting out of
traditional authority or authority,

709
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:31,120
which ascribed to them by tradition.
Um,

710
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,900
uh, and finally, that is charismatic
authority. This is a very complex issue.

711
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,030
We will talk about this a great deal.

712
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:45,390
Charismatic Authority refers to the
fact when a leader is trying to,

713
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,590
um, uh, legitimate,

714
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,610
it's right to issue commands that he's
has some extra ordinary character that

715
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:58,570
he's some single, like a,
you know, an extra ordinary,

716
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:03,610
unusual person,
but is also very important to see,

717
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,763
uh,
that

718
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:11,430
the are often seen as super natural or
events superhuman having exceptional

719
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:17,020
qualities. Uh, but what is
also very important to see,

720
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,490
uh,

721
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:22,490
that charismatic authority in Labor is
not really the characteristics of the

722
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:23,860
individual.

723
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:29,030
This is what we attribute to the
individuals to have these extra ordinary

724
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:30,290
characteristics.

725
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,400
In the most recent US history
during the electoral, uh,

726
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,250
uh, during the presidential
campaign, uh, Barack Obama of it,

727
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,180
he's a charming personality,

728
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:48,710
which is extra ordinary
skills of delivering speeches,

729
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,180
was capable to create a,
um,

730
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,240
a kind of charismatic aura around himself,
right?

731
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:01,400
People got excited, you know, almost
like around the rock star, right?

732
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,760
They, and his whole, uh,

733
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:09,470
arguments for trying to
legitimate himself was very much,

734
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,160
uh, uh, passed in
charismatic terms, right?

735
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,030
A whole you can believe in.
Right?

736
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,690
This is a very typical charismatic appeal.

737
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:26,170
You have to believe in me because I'm
offering you hope in a hopeless situation,

738
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,130
right?
That's what creates charismatic authority.

739
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,060
How much charismatic authority
President Obama's still has.

740
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,000
This is another question,
right?

741
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,170
What you may want to discuss
in the discussion section
is also a problem better.

742
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,720
You know, uh, uh, uh,

743
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:49,190
candidate Obama was really a
charismatic leader, a vapor,

744
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:54,191
basically define charismatic leaders as
the great leaders create the makers of

745
00:51:56,001 --> 00:52:00,830
create world religions.
Jesus Christ was a charismatic leader.

746
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,150
So in some ways to say modern politicians,
they are charismatic.

747
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,890
It's a bit slippery.

748
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,680
But I think the emphasis on hope and,
uh,

749
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,700
the call, you'll believe me because
I, they'll be able to deliver. Yes,

750
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:21,140
we can. You know, I remember when
I first heard him saying that,

751
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,100
I said, yeah, that's exactly
the charismatic at Dia, right?

752
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,310
It's not quite reason.
Doubt, right? It is.

753
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,740
And it moved me when when he,

754
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,070
when Barack Obama came out and he said,

755
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,310
you think nothing can be done,
but yes,

756
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:40,460
we can hope you can believe in.
Right.

757
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:42,690
This is very much a charismatic appeal.

758
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,020
That's what got is medical
product is all about.
