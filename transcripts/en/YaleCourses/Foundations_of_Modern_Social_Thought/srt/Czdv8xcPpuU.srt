1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,820
So today is John, Jack Lew. So, uh,

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,320
I mean one of the most fascinating people,
uh,

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,530
in terms of his life and his ideas
and the way how he reasons he is a

4
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:22,850
provocative right approval culture,
uh,

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,570
and uh,
uh,

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,200
an extra ordinary genius
in more than a rom base,

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,963
um,

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,730
that our fuel people who buy this agrees
so strongly than in Manny proposition

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,410
or zone Jockers so that,
that are for people.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Few people who turn my mind off up
was to own so much that John Shock.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,520
So who was this character?

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,840
And let me just give you
a very brief overview.

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,380
He was worn in Geneva,

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,330
which was a city state at that time,
uh,

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,890
ruled by Calvin. Uh, for awhile.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,450
Like Calvin is strong clue, uh, reveal.

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,460
Talking about this around it comes to
Max Labor and the Protestant ethic.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Calvin Rule Geneva with an iron hands.
That's right.

19
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:27,270
He was born,

20
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,530
his father was Isaac crucial.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,390
He was a watchmaker and the Calvinist,

22
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,280
uh,
well he did run into some trouble.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,660
I don't know exactly what the trouble was.
I think he was in that.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,080
So he jumped the boat and
vent to Istanbul disappeared.

25
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:56,070
We don't know much about
him beyond that. So, uh,

26
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,990
at the very early age of them,
it was a kind of orphan.

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,500
Then in 17,
28,

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,950
he moved to France and
there was a wonderful lady,

29
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,270
uh,
about 10 years,

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,300
his senior Mrs warrants
was running at home.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,100
Um, then are actually more seats
over here, you know, and uh,

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,100
that are, um, uh,

33
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,430
VIP seats right here. So
you can come in here, right?

34
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:37,430
This is specific are these are for
you that are four seats here, right?

35
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,210
And that our fifth and six over
there, don't be embarrassed, right?

36
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,270
You still can see the
power points from here.

37
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,980
It's not like in the bad movie
that when you sit in the front row,

38
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,580
you don't see anything of these.
So he mad.

39
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,660
Mrs Warren's,
who was

40
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,140
a Roman Catholic and her
mission was to Cornell Vert,

41
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,200
right? These, uh, um,

42
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,420
Calvin is through the wrapper fate,

43
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,460
Roman Catholicism and two
young boys into her home,

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,960
but through nose it looks like she had
more interest in people rather than

45
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,170
religion. So, uh, um,

46
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,870
he arrived 28,
two Anansi,

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,410
right? Age of 16. Good Looking,

48
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,040
nice guy.
Uh,

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,560
modern warrants is still a young little
lady here. You can see, you know,

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,250
uh,
um,

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,280
I know Warren's as Ron's
rock rise meeting in 17,

52
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:56,100
28. That is romantic stuff, right?

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,340
Uh, uh, well, uh,

54
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,340
you know, and here another
picture, you know, ah,

55
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,620
ah, I don't blame drawn
shock, right at the age of 16,

56
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,020
a tool called birth to Roman Catholicism,

57
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,220
right from the coal to Calvinist
religion and me and vile,

58
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,400
uh, being got Beth through
a mind tick, right? Well,

59
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,700
as long as Jack is one
of those few people, uh,

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,560
who ruled Akon fashion,
very funny book,

61
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:40,561
he has a sense of self identity
and self criticism rather.

62
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:45,280
This is genuine. Or he thought this
will be the way how to sell their book.

63
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,520
Hard to tell,
but it's worth reading.

64
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,630
It actually was published posts to,
and he said,

65
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,610
madam [inaudible] arms
shaped his character.

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,320
Undoubtedly she did.
Um,

67
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,900
and this affair have
here, who knows, Marty,

68
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:11,340
it looks like it was an affair.
Fascinated people.

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,920
Uh, later on. Um, uh,

70
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,210
I think I already flagged his joke in
the introductory lecture is Rhonda for

71
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,800
French writer,

72
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,300
some diarrhea and he's superb novel La
little rules along the wire was inspired

73
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,320
by these interests in your fear,
right?

74
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,830
A 16 year old boy and
mth age year old woman.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,990
And in fact,

76
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:51,010
a story off Julianne
Shore Rather Means Jones,

77
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,560
Jacques Rousseau and Marge.

78
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm there and I own the right,
um,

79
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,870
as three La the core of the story.

80
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,110
So if you have not read little's Alot,

81
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,180
why this is a must for
an ivy league graduate,

82
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,090
you'll do until I'm to
get that degree from Yale,

83
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,380
not having rat Staun died.
I had a rule,

84
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,460
Sha Alon,

85
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,640
the why it's of course in English then,

86
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:31,040
but you know, enough is enough, uh,

87
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:36,041
in 40 to seven or a year of slasher rules
saw has a now bigger aims and he moves

88
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:45,211
to pays and he becomes the secretary of
[inaudible] who was a French ambassador

89
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,950
to Vantis and that out a lot
of Nice things about, uh,

90
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,650
interesting things about little sore,
but he was not an easy,

91
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,290
um, and not, not an easy guy.

92
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,360
And somehow he all,
there's run into trouble.

93
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,960
So he run into trouble in the vanish and
in order to avoid avast and probable,

94
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:20,910
I don't know exactly what he did,
probably something shot in,

95
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,220
not quite correct.

96
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,210
He had to jump and leave vanish
and corn do more on tech.

97
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,640
Google,
uh,

98
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,470
he most of payers and he knows
how to find good friends.

99
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,850
He also will know how to make
Greek enemies from his gut fence.

100
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,100
So he meets a digital and if he already
know these wrong and we know already all

101
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,470
sequel p d and the French
and light demand. Um,

102
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,930
and uh,

103
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,010
he was asked to write an article on
the music from the [inaudible] the,

104
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,220
and this is Deidre. Um, okay.

105
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:11,870
And then he needs,
ted is a lot of sure.

106
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,710
He was saying, you know,
tell and tear is lava. Sure.

107
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,170
It was a need in these hotel and a long
lasting relationship develops between

108
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:29,240
the two, which, well, I already told you,

109
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:33,270
don't throw worry if you don't
marry instantly. He was not mad.

110
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,110
It instantly either.
Uh,

111
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,790
if took him some time to decide that,
that these date,

112
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,780
uh,

113
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,700
should act surely column in
eight in our legal marriage,

114
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,020
um, she became a companion
for all of his life. Uh,

115
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:52,891
uh,

116
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:57,891
well I would not bet my life that
she was for that essence of life,

117
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,790
the only women in his life,

118
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,450
but suits only as she lost his Bandana.

119
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,790
I don't know about her.

120
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,370
They married in [inaudible] 68
so you can see it took some time,

121
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,390
uh, for Russo to say,
thou this is something,

122
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,980
it should end up in a manage
and here is a cave yellow here.

123
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:27,980
You can't see that, right?
That as Jacques, uh,

124
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,390
well I hope you don't mind.
I'll show you these pictures.

125
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,210
They don't tell all that much.
John Shock,

126
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,081
as I said,

127
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:42,081
was an extra ordinary genius
is not only a philosopher,

128
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,920
not only as social scientist,
not only a scientist,

129
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,150
he was writing on science as well.

130
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,770
He was an artist and their,
you know,

131
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,270
anybody can write a novel,
right?

132
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I am sure half of this class considered
at one point in your life that you will

133
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,510
write poetry or uveal Rato model.
Right? That's easy. You're, you,

134
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,860
you sit down and you write a
novel. My life is a novel, right?

135
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,170
Most people say that Matt Jones,

136
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,170
Rock Road, art, Farrah,

137
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,020
probably a few of you considered right.

138
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,540
And after that Nice kills,
right?

139
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,700
And he did wrong. Lou, the event, if lash,

140
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,970
I own a CD,
it's Alonda wonderful.

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,580
Okoro he's a great composer, right? Um,

142
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,500
well that's quite unusual.

143
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,160
And to make it even more interesting,

144
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,720
he was in an intensive Beatty was all
of us an intense debate with everybody,

145
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,680
but he was an intense
debates with Ron Hall.

146
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,150
And those are few are
level familiar with music.

147
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,290
You know,
Ron Moore,

148
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,370
Ron Moore was the Gri test French composer
of the 18th century and they had a

149
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:19,080
big debate because,

150
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,360
and rules so believed
in the Italian Aaker,

151
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,000
right? Um, he,

152
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:33,030
he believed that the melody should have
a precedence over Harmoni and raw mall.

153
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,060
Um,

154
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,060
one volunteer to create
a French upper and Vic,

155
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,740
you know, um, um, mellowed.
These not so important.

156
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,470
And in fact, uh, the
morning is morning put on.

157
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:58,810
It was a revolutionary break. Um, uh,

158
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,030
Ron Moore, the sea, you know,

159
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,980
creates a new space for the new music.

160
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,300
In some ways.
He beginning to Dave,

161
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:12,250
the vague what we eventually,

162
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:17,251
we all know as modern music
and extra ordinary composer.

163
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,180
Well,
I Rousseau believed in bear country.

164
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:26,730
True [inaudible]. I know,
of course they're not,

165
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:31,690
it was no Pavarotti at that time. They,
but you know what Bel Canto is of Amaria,

166
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:35,440
right? You create our cry,
you can sing it, right?

167
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,690
That's what he really believed in.

168
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,250
And unlike a Rameau who
was much more analytical,

169
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:43,780
right,

170
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,780
and emphasize Harmoni inch and assisting
the person whom I think is the greatest

171
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,110
composer of Ooh,

172
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,040
history of Wolfgang Amadeus,

173
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,950
Mozart loved

174
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,580
and he wrote an opera
but can be very rarely,

175
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:14,581
same scene who quetsion or you can catch
it in the metropole in not done upper

176
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,490
of arts once in a decade.

177
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Bastianich and Bhasin niche
actually inspired by the Devin.

178
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,760
Go on amazon.com you can buy Rommel,

179
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,510
you can buy a Bostonian and
Bostonian and you can buy led event

180
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,780
and you can see the differences.

181
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,600
And of course, publishes
a novel. It does, uh,

182
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,830
Vishy Ha Julie and uh,
or the new hair loss,

183
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,270
which at that time was
an influential novel.

184
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,190
I don't think too many people
read it today. Now this is Rambo

185
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,010
and he is Rameau for shadow and
modern music Gluck in particular,

186
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,590
uh, uh, follows, uh, from
Rommel. In fact, you know,

187
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:19,150
more sad there'll be
changing in his lifetime. Um,

188
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,540
Vivia of talk of how,
you know,

189
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,550
just I thought if that is a
musician you can read other.

190
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,250
Yeah. Um, interestingly,
you know, more, uh,

191
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,740
did not stick quite to the
Italian upper over his life.

192
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,670
Um, uh, you, um, um,

193
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,420
probably her Saba flirter,

194
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,220
the magic flute is a first,
sure.

195
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,160
Oppor Ahh,

196
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,580
you earlier mortality is very much
Italian opera lace shirt in life.

197
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:02,600
More sad prior to create German opera,

198
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,560
which has some theme you allowed if these,
the French music,

199
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:11,060
not quite thousands is more romantic.
Okay.

200
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,980
He is also a philosopher,
scientist, political theorist.

201
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,210
I will also will say sociologist
and Bali think got a scientist.

202
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,570
The first piece of work is
actually science or art. Um,

203
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,390
and the study of society.
Uh,

204
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:33,410
then in 1755,

205
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,050
he writes some very interesting work.
If you have spare time, read it.

206
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,470
This course on the origin of inequality.
Uh,

207
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,040
again, very provocative
worker in some ways. Uh,

208
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,330
that is some sort of hop
Sian idea behind that is sad.

209
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,640
Well,
it starts with love,

210
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,140
but if you are really in love now,

211
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,410
um, you'll tend to be jealous, right?

212
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,460
If you are deeply in love,
passionately in love,

213
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,300
then you don't lie that the person
who is the object of your love May,

214
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,880
however,
all log in somebody else,

215
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,530
then you are jealous.

216
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,570
And the idea is this is the origins
of your neck quality, right?

217
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,250
We are jealous.
All right,

218
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,500
there is a long pressure's good
to put it with hops, right?

219
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,510
The old design.

220
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,140
And if somebody else is ours is that
well and it has a shot at it to get it,

221
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,770
then we become jealous,
right? We want to grab it,

222
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,720
move on to monopolize it.
So this is the source of inequality,

223
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,310
right? Sort of sink idea. All right.

224
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,540
Uh,
have you ever experienced that?

225
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,590
Did you have occasionally a level sense
of jealousy in you and thinking no,

226
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,490
these other ones should
not have the one I do have.

227
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,160
I think you probably did.
I did.

228
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,123
Okay.

229
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,500
And then comes the big here.
62,

230
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,910
he publishes two major books in one year.

231
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,130
Two big scandals,

232
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,790
social contract and Emile and Ivo
draw to social contract today.

233
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,940
And email social contract is really a
culmination of the contract area man hops

234
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,430
lock Andrew was so bit some extra
ordinary important innovations.

235
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,460
All right. Um, as we have seen,

236
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,200
uh, right, uh, in the first contract,

237
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,210
Cesarean harps had a somewhat
limited idea of social contract.

238
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,270
Probably realistic.
Uh,

239
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,590
but not what you necesarrily life.

240
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,260
He said the social contract is not
something what you conclude the video

241
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,280
authority, right? Social contract.

242
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:36,300
What you answered by
fear and social contract,

243
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:41,301
which was done previously before you run
that to have a new contract is binding

244
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:45,710
on you, right? Law Dan,

245
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:50,850
to see that consortium contract
as sort of between the individual.

246
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,200
Right. And the Common Val's, uh,

247
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,220
this is a nice idea,
right?

248
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,910
That you are bind by a
contract you signed. Wow.

249
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,240
You know,
um,

250
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,420
those are you at least two were
born in these United States.

251
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,440
Never signed a contract to
accept the constitution.

252
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,920
I am a naturalized citizen.
You can say I signed a contract,

253
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,140
I had to swear allegiance to the United
States at that time I was supposed to

254
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:28,860
read the constitution.
I have not read it from cover to cover.

255
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,600
But anyway, I signed the contracts,
some VOD on scene, you know,

256
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,670
suspecting what the contract is signing.

257
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,680
But most of you rad worn in this state,
never signed the contract. Right?

258
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,990
It's still binding on you,
right.

259
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Unless you decide to abandon the u s
citizenship and become a citizen of North

260
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,050
Korea. Right. Then you are buying
by the social contract. So that,

261
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,750
that is, you know, the difference
between um, um, uh, uh,

262
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:04,751
harps and Lark as we discussed now
who saw as reviewers see s new,

263
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,090
new, new interesting element
is that, well it's not white.

264
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,700
The individual was,

265
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,680
and he introduces the
notion of general there.

266
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,010
There is a general Ville
which is well above, uh,

267
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,390
the individuals extremely
important idea has a degree of um,

268
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,850
insights and realism.

269
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,450
It's also a very dangerous idea.

270
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,080
Totalitarian regimes very often advocated
General Ville that you and re Ivf

271
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,620
Croak, uh, um,

272
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,240
John Jack for you when he's sad that
individuals have to be forced to be free.

273
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,690
That follows from the idea
of General Vale. Well,

274
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,660
he is a complex thinker,
liberal in Ronaghan,

275
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,190
that contact area and on the other,

276
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:13,191
the other hand and paves the road to
totalitarianism that he was loved by many

277
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:21,251
liberals and he was loved by
many totalitarians like God,

278
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:26,810
Mark Sloughed,
him and like Vladimir Ilyich.

279
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:31,811
Lenin loved him because of the
genital about Durkheim loft him too.

280
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,670
And he was a little bit off. So, uh,

281
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,070
that is Emil Ivy was talking about this
I already mentioned and Yvonne or fewer

282
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,140
that are probably a few people
who will end up in education.

283
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,560
You have to read this book cover to
cover that is no modern education theory.

284
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,340
The south,
the book in meal,

285
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,570
this is the foundation of
modern education or teary.

286
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,760
Okay.
He has a big impact,

287
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,180
a big impact on the American
constitution and the French Revolution.

288
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:16,400
He one of the bass breaker or,

289
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,970
or on on the French revolution,

290
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,830
he was also the first who
advocated pop, Suva, serenity,

291
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,610
um, um, uh, the abolishment of the Turd,

292
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:35,130
the state and creating warm
puppy elected body, right,

293
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,730
strong conflict.

294
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,530
It Montesquieu who want that to
have right to chain barriers.

295
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,090
Uh, one for the aristocracy
and one for the people.

296
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,610
A rooster wanted to have one
universal suffrage except for the man.

297
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,570
He was a male chauvinist pig in one way.
Well,

298
00:22:56,571 --> 00:23:01,571
and as Vivia see the idea of gender veal
over picked up by the radicals of the

299
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:06,070
financial evolution.
Uh,

300
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,080
the Jacobins and Vos speaked up
by later communists of video,

301
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:16,040
Skype would be Atlanta in his store.
A malaise.

302
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,280
No,

303
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,280
the genital Ville and French
radicalism a led to bloodshed,

304
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,650
uh,
Robespierre the major disciple,

305
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,440
I'm believe her of gender,
all veal.

306
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,240
His hats for us also chopped
off so much about it.

307
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,600
Now, uh, Rousseau did not
live the French revolution.

308
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:48,601
His ideas there then that he had to
move in 62 in exile because both books

309
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,190
created an outrage,
particularly by the church,

310
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,750
first event to back to Geneva.
But figure it out.

311
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,280
It doesn't [inaudible] Ronnie longer.
So David Hume,

312
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:09,310
the conservative philosopher who admired
is very invited him to come to England.

313
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,520
And like with everybody
else who was his friends,

314
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,380
right?
He had a fall out of your day.

315
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,820
If it was really a difficulty guy,
right?

316
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,920
Uh,
this is David Hume,

317
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,560
and therefore he left England
and he return to France,

318
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,950
uh,

319
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,950
lived for a long time on the [inaudible]
named to make sure it doesn't get into

320
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,620
trouble flying all the 68 he married
[inaudible] ivo talking about this a meal.

321
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:51,911
They have several children and the
greatest educational theories to tells you

322
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,350
how to raise children.

323
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,480
He put all of his children an orphanage.

324
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,560
She was a real bastard, right? Do that.

325
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,420
Um, and then he was writing
his confessions, um,

326
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,130
which was published,
a boss almost Lee,

327
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,520
and he died in [inaudible] 78,
uh,

328
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:19,160
July the second.

329
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,720
So this is the orchard maybe
he will be discussing today.

330
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,630
And vivio be also discussing,

331
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,120
uh,
uh,

332
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,380
choose today
and I hope I have enough time,

333
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,500
uh,
via TV and

334
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,140
I get home,

335
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:45,141
I'd before the Leibow comms so I
can put this on the intern match.

336
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,780
So you can read the songs.
The ensurer match.

337
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,420
Uh,

338
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,420
this is fried the social contract.

339
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,403
Yes.

340
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,240
So Shaw contract 1782
and I don't know why,

341
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:16,110
but I like your show.
You the first additions,

342
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,983
uh,

343
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,780
doesn't take me too much time
to find it on the intranet.

344
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,630
Whatso occasionally does.
Okay.

345
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,660
So what is the social contract
is all about a book one,

346
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,280
uh, as a, a description.

347
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:38,230
How you move from natural right from
the state of nature to politic or,

348
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,280
um,
uh,

349
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:46,290
the second book is who is
the Silver Silverman and how
does silver and should be

350
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,290
constructed? Created. This
is an issue which, uh,

351
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,670
law did not pay much
attention to. Right. Um,

352
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,690
um, um, reveal, see, you know,

353
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,320
Rousseau himself likes elected,
uh,

354
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,350
selected aristocracy about,

355
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,470
he beginning to think about universal
suffrage and proper constitution of the

356
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:17,570
silver. And then he has a
big section on government.

357
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,410
Um, uh, a section on ancient
Roman CVO religion Ivy.

358
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,770
We'll talk now.
I don't have much time.

359
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,120
I have your try to talk
about cvs Allergan as well.

360
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,530
So what about other major themes?

361
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,880
One question is what is legitimate rule?

362
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,330
And he said rude is only
legitimate when it is, uh, uh, uh,

363
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,940
at, I have that consent. Bart.

364
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,680
He said Justice has to be the Lou
Tiede because genital Ville has to,

365
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,950
could have there I will have to talk
a little about justice being diluted.

366
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,070
The problem is that is
no universal justice.

367
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:10,071
What you can arrive at from the
individual veil that is a General Ville,

368
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,163
right?

369
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,200
And the conception of the comment and
gloves and the individual that the

370
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:23,780
individual is done justice to,
it has to be diluting.

371
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:28,781
It has to be restricted by the demands
of the collective Ville of the collective

372
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:34,650
good.
Now this is a provocative statement.

373
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:38,280
It certainly has a kernel of tools.

374
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,520
It's also very dangerous argument
because it opens up the rule for a

375
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:49,140
totalitarian state which will tell you,
oh,

376
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,090
you think this is your interest,

377
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,340
but you think is your interest is not
really your interest me the server and

378
00:28:56,461 --> 00:29:01,461
knows what is in your restaurants and
ivy or force you to be Free Ivy or force

379
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:05,550
you to understand, right?
What is in your interest.

380
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,000
That is a bit of a tricky
argument, right? It had,

381
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,400
has been abused in history.

382
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:14,550
That's what the notion diluted refers to.

383
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,870
Now perhaps your he advocates for popular
serenity and the need for convention.

384
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,990
Um,
uh,

385
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,080
well the argument is that individual
will express only individual interest and

386
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:37,521
therefore the general deal is not the
veal of simply the sum total of Indivi

387
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,740
individual veils.
He is a metal door,

388
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:47,500
logical collectivist, right? Uh, uh,

389
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,300
as I already pointed out and
then it comes to the law giver,

390
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,383
uh,

391
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,400
it is the law giver who is actually can
inspire what he goes are more pro per.

392
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,020
You need a law giver.

393
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,200
He sees himself as a law giver who act
surely will be able to tell you why your

394
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,440
selfishness is no good by
the law of your country.

395
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:21,190
Younger community is the
right thing to go. Okay.

396
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,640
And the good government means a pop
jewelry elected legislature and the

397
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:34,310
executive is still by an aristocracy,
uh,

398
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,190
by a device man.

399
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,220
That's what he really means by
aristocracy and intellectual aristocracy.

400
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,450
Who is elected? Well, I may
have some bodies notion, right?

401
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,450
That people in government should be smart,
right?

402
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,260
And we have a bit of
concern. Uh, you know,

403
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:57,130
in the past there were some
presidents in the United States,

404
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,320
some people in the United States
through the are not all death smart,

405
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:07,090
right? I don't want to name names,
but you can think, probably have some,

406
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,010
right. Uh, who buys?

407
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:13,430
Some people thought they are a
little on the dumb side, right?

408
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,770
And they did not earn
real much respect right.

409
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,640
By those two things, they are
not smart anyway. That's it.

410
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,440
So legitimate through a,

411
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,640
they all legitimate rule cannot be amazed
or natural title lot aristocracy has

412
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:35,710
to be, um, uh, authorized by consent.

413
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,170
Um, well, I leave the family issue.

414
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,880
That's a family he said is
the only natural society.

415
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,700
Um, uh, Bart,

416
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:53,530
he said even the family does
not come simply from nature.

417
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,640
That is a social contract in
the family. And in fact, you,

418
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:02,620
when you, when you grew
up, um, uh, you know,

419
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,990
when you are not as smart shot anymore,

420
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,380
then you will realize how much
of a contract it is eventually.

421
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:13,900
I mean,
I hope that is nobody in this room,

422
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:18,901
but I suspect that I probably a very
few who at one point thought enough was

423
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:22,750
enough.
You know,

424
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:27,751
my mother and father is really a pain and
therefore I don't want to do much with

425
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,210
them. Need to break the contract. Right.

426
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,590
It does happen to some people
in their life as a father,

427
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:38,900
I hope it will never
happen, but on, fortunately,

428
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,550
it occasionally does.
A Brown people are teenagers.

429
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:48,110
That's when you beginning to think
about the natural right of the family,

430
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,680
right as a contract, right?
And you're beginning to answer,

431
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,040
or some people begin to
answer some kind offer, uh,

432
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,240
your relationship in the parents and try
to corner worth the natural dependence

433
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:07,570
on parents on a contractual relationship.
Right?

434
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,180
Uh,
saying,

435
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,720
what do you mean I have to be back
home by 11:30 AM you remember that?

436
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,450
I remember that. And try
to negotiate the towel. Oh,

437
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:27,560
not 11.
[inaudible] a am right.

438
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,380
I am already 16 or 17,
you know,

439
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,160
um, that span, you walk on
the birthing national. Right?

440
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,830
Okay.
Uh,

441
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,860
now that is a transition from state of
nature to the nature of civil society.

442
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,690
All right. Uh, uh,

443
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,670
uh,
eh,

444
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,280
that is the transition from the state
of nature to cvs or is NASA shut?

445
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:03,831
It is just a remarkable change right now
you substitute justice for ends thing.

446
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,550
Uh, I've contact, um, avid more reality,

447
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:16,230
which was lacking previously
in the state of nature.

448
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,983
MMM.

449
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,460
And in CVS society,
you know,

450
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,500
we deprive ourselves from
some of the advantages,

451
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,430
but we enjoy in the state of nature.
Nevertheless,

452
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,080
this is a great progress.
What has to be taken on.

453
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,570
If you see this also in Emea,

454
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,760
uh, now, uh,

455
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,150
the second theme is about the
question of the looted justice.

456
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,170
And he said, you know, at
the order add to admit,

457
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,260
justice among us has to be
diluted and diluted means,

458
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,030
you know,
uh,

459
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,030
our individual sense of justice has to
be overruled by the general veal and a

460
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:11,120
silver sedan, uh, needs
snow guarantor, uh,

461
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:16,390
and the individuals will
have to be rash constraint,

462
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,990
our device,
the R and [inaudible].

463
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,883
MMM.

464
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,620
And here, um, uh,

465
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,860
here is the argument why the individual
of you'll have to cross strange

466
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,320
individuals cannot adjust,

467
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,680
follow the south in showed us because
the genital veal have to prevail.

468
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,360
The common good has to overrule the
selfish individual interests and very

469
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:53,760
different type of argument.
But from the British liberals,

470
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,541
uh,

471
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:59,430
then he are used for popular sue
vanity and he's the first to do so.

472
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,110
Um, and this is his single
most important, uh, uh,

473
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,460
a contribution right at this has to be
based on a convention and the convention

474
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:15,630
has to be arrived at by
the rule of the majority.

475
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,300
Um, uh, there must be an
assembly of people, right?

476
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,820
And,
and this is also a very radical,

477
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,160
controversial argument that
the must pull the resources.

478
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:34,161
It is almost a communist idea of having
common property of major resources,

479
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:40,750
very problematic argument.
Uh,

480
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,860
and he also makes this interesting claim
that in the state of nature be are the,

481
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:51,390
are not equal.
That's a very different view from hops,

482
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,190
but we are being made equal by convention.

483
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,180
What we, uh, uh, uh, do with each other.

484
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,480
And the problem is this is really does
it lead to totalitarianism is also

485
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,250
advocating for public possessions
as a superior form of procession,

486
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:18,960
uh,
stage procession over a resources.

487
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,870
Very problematic argument.
Again,

488
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,170
paves the foundation drove was
Marxism and communists ideologies.

489
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:34,020
Um, and uh, well, uh,
many of the, you know,

490
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:39,021
all the citations VOB on the intranet
so you can read it much more carefully.

491
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,280
Then you can do it down.

492
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,970
Then we arrive at the idea of
the genital veal individual.

493
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,240
This is something you believe in Adam
Smith's or you believe in the law.

494
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,080
You will be very disturbed,
individual,

495
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:00,420
expressed only private interest.

496
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,780
So there must be a public interest
and the genital Ville is sort of a,

497
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,140
it's unclear where it is coming from,

498
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,490
but it is certainly coming over and above.
Uh,

499
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,530
the individuals. And this is
the, uh, the general veal,

500
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,530
which is represented with
what we call the common of,

501
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,910
right.
The federal authority.

502
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,980
The federal interest
expresses the genital veal.

503
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,740
It is not the veal of all is the bill,

504
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,800
which the interest of everybody
rather than the view of everybody.

505
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,600
Um, as I said, you know,

506
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:47,860
that is an element of true
stewards in discussion sections.

507
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:52,210
Vivio can talk about this.
The class will be divided better.

508
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:54,460
This is acceptable or not.

509
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:59,070
But those of you who believe
in methodological collectivism,

510
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,400
we'll have to take very seriously
the idea of General Ville.

511
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,620
And now comes the question
of the law givers.

512
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,290
And this is a very important argument.
Well,

513
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,990
viaud only free event of the obey the law,
right?

514
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,730
The freedom is a under south impulse law.

515
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:27,070
Uh, they, uh, hey girls
said that, uh, freedom,

516
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,300
uh, is, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

517
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,350
you are free.

518
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,790
Then you are recognized necessity.

519
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:42,450
And therefore a UVL have to go by
the law and this field and inspire,

520
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,220
uh, proper, uh,

521
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:53,140
the love of the country that,
uh, that are more the swap,

522
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,990
which is self love. He makes
this distinction. Yeah.

523
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,950
I am afraid I've, you'll have to
come back to this, uh, um, uh,

524
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,870
uh, cues today. I've, you'll
have to leave it now. Um, uh,

525
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:12,871
the distinction between Amore proper
and Amore the SWOT is a very important

526
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:17,550
distinction. And I have to
elaborate on this, uh, um,

527
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,260
Tuesdays. So I will come back, uh, to, uh,

528
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,970
to a social contract
before we go on to Mel.
