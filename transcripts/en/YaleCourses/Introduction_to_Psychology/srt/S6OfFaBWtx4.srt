1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,180
So just to, um, just to review,

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,410
here's where we left off the discussion
from last lecture and for about half of

3
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,470
this lecture is going
to be social psychology.

4
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,190
And so we started off by talking about
certain fundamental biases and how we see

5
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:36,150
ourselves. We then turn to talk about
a bias and how we see other people,

6
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,740
the fundamental attribution error.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,590
And now we're talking a little bit
about some aspects of how we see other

8
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,424
people.

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,170
So we quickly talked about
certain aspects of um,

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,050
of why we like other
people including proximity,

11
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,640
similarity and attractiveness.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,090
And where we left off was the
discussion of the Matthew effect,

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,830
which is basically that good
things tend to compound. If you're,

14
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,950
if you're rich, you'll get a
better education. If you're
smart, people will like,

15
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:10,890
you will like you more if
you're attractive and so on.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,640
Nobody bring up their
papers at this point. They,

17
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,310
we'll collect them at the end of class.
Um,

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,490
what I want to talk to.

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,110
Okay. Except for you ending it now. Um,

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,530
I'm going to ask the teaching fellows
to stop anybody from approaching that,

21
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,420
that area. I want to begin by talking
about him, about impression formation,

22
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,050
how we form impressions of others and
tell you a couple of interesting things

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,190
about impression formation.

24
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
I'm the first one is first
impressions matter a lot.

25
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,140
They matter a lot. Um,
for different reasons.

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,260
They might matter a lot because humans
have in general a confirmation bias such

27
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,160
that once you believe something,

28
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,370
other information is then encoded along
the lights to support what you believe.

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,930
So the classic study here was done by
Kelly where a guest speaker comes in and

30
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,931
some of the students received a bio
describing the speaker as very warm.

31
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,570
The other as do not bring your paper up
if you're coming in late just at the end

32
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:31,020
of the class. Yeah. Um,

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,540
others got a bio saying, thanks
Eric. This speaker was rather cold.

34
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,060
And then it turned out later on when
they're asked for their impressions of the

35
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:44,894
speaker,

36
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,460
people are very much biased
by what they first assumed.

37
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,180
If I'm described to you as a VI Vaishyas
and creative person and you see me and

38
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:02,410
I'm all kind of bouncing around and you
could then confirm this as look how by

39
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,920
Vaishyas and creative he is. If I'm
described as somebody who drinks too much,

40
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:09,700
you might think he's an alcoholic. It
was you had to describe to somebody who,

41
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,310
who's who's insecure and nervous.

42
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,190
You could interpret my
activity as nervous twitches.

43
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,200
Your first impression sets a framework
from which you interpret everything else.

44
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,230
This was the theme of an excellent
movie called being there starring Peter

45
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,040
Sellers and a running joke of the movie
being there was the domain character,

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,080
the character Chauncey Gardner,

47
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,970
somehow through accident had the
reputation for being a genius.

48
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,110
But while in reality he was
actually mildly retarded,

49
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,420
but he would go around and people would
ask him his opinions on politics and he

50
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,650
would say things like,
oh,

51
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:52,651
well I like being in the garden and
because of his reputation as a genius,

52
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,080
people said, wow, that's very profound.

53
00:03:56,081 --> 00:04:00,700
I wonder what he means and or people
talk to me, just stare at them and say,

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,440
and people would say would be intimidated
by his bold and impetuous stare when

55
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:09,430
match. You just totally
didn't know anything. Um,

56
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,790
so first impressions can
shape subsequent impressions,

57
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,070
not just when dealing with people.

58
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,820
A little while ago there was a sniper,

59
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:22,720
actually a pair of snipers
killing people in Washington.

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,660
And the one thing everybody knew about
it was there was a white van involved.

61
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,520
Turned out there was no white van at all.
But in the first incident,

62
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:37,030
somebody saw a white van,
this was reported in all the newspapers.

63
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,080
Then every other incident people
started seeing the white vans.

64
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,780
They started looking for them, they
started to attending, attending them.

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,700
So first impressions matter hugely when
dealing with people because it sets the

66
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,490
stage for how we
interpret everything else.

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,750
A second finding building on the first
is that we form impressions very fast,

68
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,680
very quickly.

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,480
And this is a literature
known as thin slices.

70
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,850
The idea is you don't have to see much
of a person to get an impression of what

71
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:16,030
they are. The first studies done on
this were actually done on teachers,

72
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,410
on university professors.

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,460
So University professors have teaching
evaluations and you could use this as a

74
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:24,880
rough and ready approximation
of what students think of them.

75
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,130
So what you do then as the question that
these people were interested in, um,

76
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,080
Rosenthal and I'm body, uh,
two social psychologists were,

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,440
how long do you have to
look at a professor to guess
how popular a teacher he

78
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,740
is?
So they show these clips for a full class.

79
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,520
Do you have to see him for a full class?
Do you have to see him for two classes?

80
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,520
Do you have to see him for a half hour?

81
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,500
How long do you have to be
around a person to see him,

82
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,900
to estimate how good a
lecture that person is?

83
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,240
And the answer is five seconds.

84
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,660
So after clips of five seconds,

85
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,950
people are pretty good at predicting
what sort of evaluations that person will

86
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:14,450
have. Um, remember the Big Five,

87
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,060
how we evaluate people on a big five.

88
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,390
Well you have a roommate
and your roommate,

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,930
you could evaluate it under big five.

90
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:28,360
You've had a lot of experience with him
or her, how much time do you need to,

91
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,300
to evaluate somebody on the
five dimensions of personality?

92
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,570
Answer is again,
not much time at all.

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,150
After very brief exposures to people,

94
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,830
people are very accurate at
identifying them on the big five.

95
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,070
One of the more surprising findings

96
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,810
is concerned sexual orientation or
Gaydar is not a scientific term.

97
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,163
Um,

98
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,420
but at the same psychologist
we're interested in studying
how quickly you can,

99
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,110
if at all, how long does it take to
figure out somebody's sexual orientation.

100
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,920
Now what they did was they
were clever psychologists,

101
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,130
so they set it up in a study where the
people did not know sexual orientation

102
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:23,690
was that issue. So for instance, they may
be people like you who filled in a form.

103
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,520
One question along a very long form was
your sexual orientation and then you're

104
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:31,490
sitting down being interviewed by somebody
and your interview is being filmed.

105
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,080
And then other people are shown who
don't know. You are shown the film.

106
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,780
And the finding is

107
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,580
that people based on thin slices

108
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,090
are quite good at detecting
sexual orientation. Um,

109
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,690
everybody's good at it. Gay People
are better at it than straight people.

110
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,110
And again, you don't need much
time. You just need about a second.

111
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,920
You see somebody for about a second.
You can make a guess. You're,

112
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,400
you're far from always right. In fact,
you're just a bit better than chance,

113
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,060
but you are better than chance at
telling sexual orientation. Um,

114
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,910
so these two facts taken together then
slices and the power of first impressions

115
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,420
means that just by a brief
exposure to somebody,

116
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,380
it shaped so much of how you're going
to think about them in the future.

117
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,050
Now we can look at this
from the other direction.

118
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,530
We're talking about the
perceptions of other people,

119
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,600
how we perceive other people.

120
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,850
But social psychologists
are also interested in the
question of what happens to

121
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:38,420
other people as a result of
being perceived in a certain way.

122
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,430
So one question is,
what would cause me to,

123
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:46,431
to perceive somebody as intelligent
or stupid gay or straight anxious or,

124
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,020
or, or levelheaded? A second question is,

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
what are the effects of
being judged that way?

126
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,360
And psychologists have coined a term,
um,

127
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,970
talk about self fulfilling prophecies.

128
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,570
And the claim here more specifically is
what's known as the Pygmalion effect and

129
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,940
the Pygmalion effect is,
um,

130
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,030
if I believe you have a
certain characteristic,

131
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,550
this might cause you to behave as
if you have that characteristic.

132
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,390
Um,

133
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,980
the name comes from the
play by George Bernard Shaw,

134
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,960
Pygmalion.
Um,

135
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,790
and the quote here is the
difference between a lady
and a flower girl is not how

136
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,020
she behaves, but how she's treated.
I shall always be a flower girl,

137
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:33,870
but Professor Higgins,

138
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,890
cause he always treats me as a flower
girl and always will made into a better

139
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,850
known movie. Uh, my fair
lady. But I think that this,

140
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,500
the same theme is better
exemplified in a far better movie.

141
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,121
La femme.

142
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:53,121
Nikita where we're a cold blooded killer
is treated with respect and affection.

143
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,710
And then she becomes,
um,

144
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,940
a much more warm and accessible person
and then she kills a lot of people.

145
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:06,450
But that, but, but, but still,
it illustrates the point.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,280
And this point has tons
of empirical validity.

147
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:15,390
The classic experiment was by
Rosenthal and Jackson where, um,

148
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,690
they told teachers that some of their
kids were really smart and other kids

149
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,810
were, were less, we're not really smart.

150
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,040
They weren't expected to show a
huge jump or spurt in it. Our ICU.

151
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,780
Um, and this was of course trickery.
The children were chosen at random,

152
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,280
but the children who were
described as showing as,

153
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:43,281
as expected to show a jump in Iq in
fact did show a jump in their Iq scores.

154
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,120
And this isn't magic.
It's basically if I am totally,

155
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,140
you're a genius and your genius is about
to be in full flower throughout this

156
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,530
class and it's a small class as these
classes where I'll focus more on you,

157
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,640
I'll give you more of my attention.
If I'm told not so much for you,

158
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,270
you'll put your, y'all, you
all suffer relative to him.

159
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,150
And so the Pygmalion effect shows how
our expectations can really matter.

160
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,460
Um,
this brings us to the final,

161
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,130
the issue of expectations and um,

162
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,940
how we judge people is a story
that can be told but individuals.

163
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,880
But it's also a story that
can be told about groups.

164
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,200
And this is where I want to end this
section on social psychology by talking

165
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,130
about groups.

166
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,320
A lot of social psychology is concerned
with the question of how we think about

167
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:44,130
human groups.

168
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,130
And we've already discussed this in the
lecture on morality when we talked about

169
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,380
the human dynamic pushing us to think in
terms of us versus them as shown in the

170
00:11:56,231 --> 00:12:01,231
robber's cave study and also shown in
the minimal group research by Taj fell.

171
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,980
Showing that from a motivational
emotional standpoint, um,

172
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,690
it's not difficult for us to think in
terms of my group versus your group.

173
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,010
And this way of thinking has real
consequences for our emotional life,

174
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:18,370
our effective life and how we
choose to distribute resources.

175
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,580
What I want to talk about here though
is a different aspect of how we think

176
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:28,090
about human groups. I want to talk
a little bit about stereotypes.

177
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,053
Now.

178
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,370
Stereotypes in English
often just is a bad word.

179
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:40,870
To have. A stereotype is, is to be,
is to have something wrong with you.

180
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,510
You might say it's not
good to have stereotypes.

181
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,950
Psychologists tend to use the
term in a broader sense. Um,

182
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,220
we tend to use the term to refer to
information we have about categories and

183
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,370
intuitions we have about the typicality,

184
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,640
our frequency of certain
features of categories.

185
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,790
And it turns out that
collecting information about
categories is essential to

186
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:10,550
our survival. Um, we, we,

187
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:15,551
we see novel things all the time and
if we were not capable of learning and

188
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:20,450
making guests as educated guesses
about these novel things, um,

189
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,990
we would not be able to survive.

190
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,280
So when you see this object over here,

191
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:32,281
you categorize it as a chair and you
recognize that you could probably sit on

192
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:35,350
it.
This apple is probably addable.

193
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,180
This dog probably barks and has
a tail and eat meat, eats meat,

194
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,500
and doesn't speak English.

195
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,780
These are all stereotypes about chairs
and about apples and about dogs.

196
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,610
That doesn't mean they are logically true.
This can be a vegetarian dog,

197
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:56,590
a poison apple and explosive chair,
but they're typically true.

198
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,210
And if you were suddenly stripped of
your ability to make generalizations,

199
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,510
you'd be at a loss. You wouldn't
know what to eat, how to interact.

200
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,480
So some sort of ability to,

201
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,530
to record information and
make generalizations is
absolutely essential to making

202
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:18,091
it through life was interesting though
is we also categorize types of people.

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,590
So we have stereotypes in our heads
about men and women, about children,

204
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:27,130
adolescents or adults, whites,
blacks, Asians and so on.

205
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,810
Now this is not essentially a bad
thing for a couple of reasons.

206
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,950
First,
some of these stereotypes are positive.

207
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,110
You might have positive
stereotypes about certain groups.

208
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,820
You might believe some groups are
unusually creative or intelligent.

209
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,850
You might have,
um,

210
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,200
you might have a particularly positive
stereotype about your own group,

211
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,360
even if your own group is Yale.

212
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Students are your own group is people
from France or your own group is people

213
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,330
from such and so college you
might have positive stereotypes.

214
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,470
More importantly,
um,

215
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,600
we collect stereotypes about groups
of people through much the same way we

216
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:15,770
collect stereotypes about categories
like cherries and apples and dogs.

217
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,800
And so they're pretty often accurate

218
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,850
when there are studies,
um,

219
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,780
which asks people who is
more likely to be a lawyer,

220
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,820
someone who's Jewish or someone who's
Hispanic, who's likely to be taller.

221
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,970
Somebody from Japan or
somebody from Sweden,

222
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,460
people can answer these things.

223
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,880
They have their stereotypes at guide
your answers and the answers are not

224
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:44,390
arbitrary. I ran under,
answered her often correct. Um,

225
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,950
and often possessing stereotypes
listens to make reasonable and correct

226
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,930
generalizations about the world.

227
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,640
That's a sort of good news about
stereotypes, but it was also bad news.

228
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,380
One problem is they're not always accurate

229
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,860
and there's a couple of factors that
could lead them away from accuracy.

230
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,700
One is what we talked about before
regarding first impressions,

231
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,160
which is a confirmation bias.

232
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,830
If you believe that
homosexuals are FM minute,

233
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,880
that gay men are feminine,
um,

234
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,510
then this is going to shape
how you see future game at.

235
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,890
If you see in a feminine gay
man, you'll probably say, ah,

236
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,990
more evidence for my theory.
Um,

237
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,140
if you see a man who's not a feminist,

238
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,410
you might ignore it or saying maybe
he's not really gay after all. Um,

239
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,470
if you believe black men are criminals,

240
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,930
then when you see a black
man who is a criminal, you,

241
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,670
you'll track it down as support,

242
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,410
but you'll pay less attention to evidence
that white men are criminals and some

243
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:52,430
black men are not criminals. You
won't look at this as a scientist. Um,

244
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,260
objectively scanning data. Rather,
you'll be biased in certain ways.

245
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:57,770
Um,

246
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,660
you'll be biased to put extra weight on
the cases that support your theory and,

247
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,700
um, and diminish cases that
refute it. Furthermore,

248
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,240
our data is not always reliable.
So,

249
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,080
oh, and this is actually an
example of this at work. Um,

250
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,400
it turns out, uh, in the
world of classical music,

251
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,580
there's a stereotype of women being
simply less proficient than men.

252
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,300
They play smaller than men. They don't
have the same force. And, and, and,

253
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,140
and they have smaller techniques.
They're more temperamental and so on. Um,

254
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,100
if you asked somebody who was a
judge, the judge would say, look,

255
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,130
this is just the way things are.
I'm not being biased at all.

256
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,440
The tests of this then is to how blind
auditions where people do their auditions

257
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
behind screen.

258
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,620
So you can't tell whether they're a
man or a woman or for that matter,

259
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,820
white or black or Asian or whatever.
It turns out when you do that,

260
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,850
women get hired far more suggesting that
the stereotype is a incorrect and B has

261
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:11,640
a real negative and unfair
effect on people getting hired.

262
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,780
A second problem is what I was talking
about immediately before this is some of

263
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:19,230
our data are misleading.

264
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,000
So we get a lot of the information
about the world from the media.

265
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,040
The media would include
television and movies, but um,

266
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,330
but would also include
plays and books and stories.

267
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,130
And to the extent these for Trey,
um,

268
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,910
an unrealistic or unfair or
biased perception of the world,

269
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,440
we could construct stereotypes that
are faithful to the data we're getting,

270
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,150
but the data is not
representative. Um, and so people,

271
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:51,900
for instance,

272
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,900
a object to the fact that that when
there's Italian Americans on TV,

273
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,470
they're often members of the
sopranos, a mobster family. Uh,

274
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,640
throughout history,

275
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,140
Jews have been upset at the portrayal
of Shylock in merchant of Venice,

276
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,870
not a very nice guy.
Um,

277
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,600
and often in response, people who
want to foster more positive views,

278
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,800
we'll often try to,
we'll,

279
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,600
we'll often put in representatives from
other groups in unusual ways to make

280
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,900
that point.
Anybody here ever seen a television show?

281
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,740
Battlestar Galactica.
Okay.

282
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,310
Was that
he's the star of Battlestar Galactica.

283
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,680
You don't know cause you're,

284
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:42,681
you're too young in the
original Battlestar and,

285
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,780
and I, I hate you. And in an original,

286
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,950
in the original Battlestar Galactica,
this was the star.

287
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,520
This was the main character known as
Starbuck who got transformed into a woman

288
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,010
in the more reason.
One,

289
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,380
I sort of example of how portrayals
are shifting in interesting ways.

290
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,520
There's also of course,
um,

291
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,110
moral problems over stereotypes.

292
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,470
So it's fine to judge chairs and
apples and dogs based on a stereotype.

293
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,520
It's even find to judge breeds of dogs.
If I told you that I decided to,

294
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,413
to,
um,

295
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,680
to buy a grey hound instead of a pit
bull because I wanted a dog of a gentle

296
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:36,600
temperament, nobody would scream
that I'm a dog racist involvement.

297
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,820
And,
but honestly it's a stereotype.

298
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,210
Greyhounds are supposed to be more
passive in gentle then pimples.

299
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,080
I think it's a true stereotype
but as a stereotype nonetheless,

300
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,860
but we have no problems when it comes
to things like breeds of dogs with

301
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:54,820
stereotypes. We have serious
problems judging people this way.

302
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,680
So for instance, it's a moral principle
at some of us would hold to that.

303
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,960
Even if stereotypes are correct,

304
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,070
it is still immoral to apply
them in day to day life. Um,

305
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,430
the term for this would be profiling.

306
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,630
Now it gets complicated because there
some cases where we do allow stereotypes

307
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,674
to play a role.

308
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,450
When you all go and get driver's licenses
or when you did get driver's licenses,

309
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,530
you have to pay higher,
higher auto insurance premiums than I do.

310
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,250
I think this is perfectly fair because
young people like you get into a lot more

311
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,590
accidents with your
reefer and your alcohol

312
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,670
and so it is now.

313
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,240
Now some of you were saying that's
a stereotype and it is a stereotype,

314
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,470
but this is distinctly robust one
and nobody lives up to protest this.

315
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,610
It's an acceptable stereotype
to make a generalization from.

316
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,870
On the other hand,

317
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,130
what if insurance companies a determined
that people from Asia got into more

318
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:59,290
accidents than people from Europe?

319
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,760
Would people be equally comfortable
charging people from Asia?

320
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,090
Higher rates of insurance?
Almost certainly not.

321
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,550
So the issues are complicated as to
what sort of generalizations where are

322
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:17,350
reasonable to make and what what aren't.
There's also a second problem.

323
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,310
Stereotypes have all sorts of effects.
Now some of them are obvious effects.

324
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,520
Um, you know, if people, for instance,

325
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,640
if people pull pull you over while
you're driving because you're black,

326
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,690
um, this could have a huge effect on how
you feel welcome in a society on race

327
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,740
relations and so on.

328
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,030
But some of the affects are more
subtle and more interesting.

329
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,220
And you might not expect this.

330
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,900
And this is some work done
by the psychologist Claude
Steele and his colleagues

331
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,860
at Stanford.
And the issue is called stereotype threat.

332
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,750
Imagine you have a math test and
this is the front of the math test.

333
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Claude Steele made an
interesting discovery here is
how to make black people do

334
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:10,940
worse on this math test.
It's very simple.

335
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,040
The finding is that if your race or
your group has a negative stereotype

336
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:23,370
associated with it in
any particular domain,

337
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,580
being reminded of it serves as a
stereotype threat and hence damages your

338
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,670
performance in all sorts of domains.

339
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,970
If the stereotype is your
group doesn't do goodness,

340
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,020
if I remind you that you remember that
group immediately before doing it,

341
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,310
your performance will drop.
Um,

342
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,120
now you know how make women
do worse on math tests too

343
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,733
like that.

344
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,280
And this has a demonstrative effect.

345
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,650
So stereotypes are complicated
and morally fraught things.

346
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,940
Um,
when people study stereotypes,

347
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,550
they often make certain distinctions
between three levels of stereotypes.

348
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,590
Um, and this is nicely
summarized here. There is public,

349
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,940
if I asked you, um, one of the,

350
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,740
one of the people running for the
Democratic nominee for president is black.

351
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,770
Another one is female.
Um,

352
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,130
if I ask people to raise their hands for,
um,

353
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,890
who thinks that because being black,
because being female,

354
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,920
they should be automatically
disqualified for being president.

355
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,380
Few of you would raise your hands.

356
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,940
Those are your public
presentations of stereotypes.

357
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,700
Even if I was to ask
you on a sheet of paper,

358
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,180
you might deny it because you might
be afraid that it's not anonymous.

359
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,080
Then there's private.
Private is what you really think,

360
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,120
but you don't tell people.
Some of you,

361
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,210
some of the population United States are
not going to vote for somebody because

362
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:07,440
he or she is black, but they won't
tell you, but they know it to be true.

363
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,780
That's common sense.

364
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,960
What's more interesting is below even
that there may be unconscious associations

365
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,740
that work that people don't actually know
about but affects their thoughts about

366
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:26,580
race, gender, and other social groups.

367
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,723
Okay,

368
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,360
so here's some data about
what people publicly say. Um,

369
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,990
this is the proportion of
people who say they will vote.

370
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:41,310
They would vote for an African
American president. Um,

371
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,990
what's interesting is when I'm around,
when I was born dancer,

372
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,520
United States was about half.

373
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,320
Now it is as close to a hundred
percent as you can get it.

374
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,730
Here's another one.
This is also public stereotypes of blacks.

375
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,610
Proportion of white respondents
endorsing each trait.

376
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,780
Now it's infant decimal.

377
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,670
These numbers are so are so low,

378
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,480
they could be dismissed as people filling
in the wrong things or making jokes or

379
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:14,190
just being confused. Um, compared
to compared to, you know,

380
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:18,720
stunningly superstitious high rankings.

381
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,870
And so there's been a profound
change in public presentations,

382
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,880
public views on race.

383
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,590
But what about implicit views?
This gets more complicated.

384
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,960
Here's a simple study. This is a sort
of study that you might do here at Yale.

385
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,690
Um, where you might do, for instance,

386
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:44,691
is be sitting in a computer screen and
you'll be an incomplete words to fill out

387
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,690
like Haas,
and you have to fill out this word.

388
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,120
What you don't know is that pictures of
black faces or pictures of white faces

389
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:55,590
are being flashed on the screen,

390
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,830
but it being flashed on the
screen subliminally so fast,

391
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:05,130
you don't even know you're seeing them.
Still,

392
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,240
this has an effect when
you see black faces.

393
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:13,200
Subjects are more likely to fill
this before it's like hostile,

394
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,490
while Weiss, more likely to fill
it out. Words like hospital.

395
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,800
Um,

396
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I will now welcome you to participate
in an experiment on implicit attitudes.

397
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,680
This was developed by Mazarine Banaji
who used to be a Yale and now is in a

398
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:36,130
inferior university in
Boston. Um, and um, and,

399
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:39,780
and it's called the implicit attitudes
test is the biggest psychology experiment

400
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:41,760
ever done in terms of people I don't like.

401
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,300
1 million people have participated in
this, and you could just go online,

402
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,540
implicit.harvard.edu.
Uh,

403
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,770
and then you could do it yourself,
but we'll do it now as a group.

404
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,250
If you did it in the lab
are on your computer screen,

405
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,430
you would do it by pushing buttons.
We'll do it by speaking,

406
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,650
and it's very simple.

407
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,950
You're going to see things over here and
you're are going to be words or they're

408
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:08,784
going to be pictures.

409
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,580
If it's an African American or a bad word,
a negative word.

410
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,320
I want you to shout out right this side,
right?

411
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,970
If it's a white American or a good word,
I want you to shut out,

412
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,430
left people ready.

413
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,360
Try to do it as fast as possible
without making any mistakes,

414
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,020
okay? Because of the very loud wrong
person, we're going to try it again.

415
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,693
Ready?

416
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,073
Good.

417
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,260
That is congruent.

418
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,880
Congruent according to a
theory that says that people,

419
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:05,470
both African Americans
and white Americans, um,

420
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,330
have biases to favor white
Americans or African Americans.

421
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,960
How do we know about this? Where
we compare it? That's congruent.

422
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,660
Now it's different
if it's a white American or a bad word,

423
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,490
say right? If it's an African
American or a good word,

424
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,570
say left.

425
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,780
Okay.
Um,

426
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,070
for all I can tell
people did equally well,

427
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,400
but this experiment has been done tens
of thousands of times and you could do it

428
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:47,050
yourself on a computer screen
and this is one way of doing it.

429
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,960
But I'll alternate and I'll give you
different ones to shift around and

430
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:50,740
everything.

431
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,740
And it turns out that this version
people are slower at than other version

432
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,040
suggesting that they're suggesting that
there are associations run one way and

433
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:07,510
not the other. And this work has
been extended for all sorts of ways.

434
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,420
I'm looking at, for example, a gender,

435
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,860
looking at the connection between
women and English and men at math,

436
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,630
looking at age,
uh,

437
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,720
attitudes towards,
uh,

438
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,420
people who are obese versus people who
are thin attitudes towards people who are

439
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:27,250
straight versus people who are gay.

440
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,930
And you could go online and do these
studies and I'll give you some feeling for

441
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:35,650
the sort of implicit attitudes
that we have within us.

442
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:41,920
Well, a legitimate question
is who cares? I mean,

443
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,170
if you do the,
if you look at the results for this study,

444
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:49,120
it turns out that there is an association
as bias to view White Americans as

445
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:52,120
positive and African
Americans as negative,

446
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,340
but it shows up like half a second
difference. Who Cares? Well,

447
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,690
there's two answers to
this. One answer is, um,

448
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,490
there are times in your life we're
half a second can matter a lot. Um,

449
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,640
so studies with police officers using
reaction time and split second choices on

450
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:16,790
who to shoot, fine, that your
stereotypical attitudes, um,

451
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,550
play a huge role in who you're likely to
shoot when they're holding an object in

452
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:26,470
their hand.
That's unclear also more generally.

453
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,680
It could be that these implicit attitudes
play a role in judgment calls in cases

454
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:38,260
where you have a hard decision to
make. You know, you're not racist.

455
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,060
You have no explicit racist
attitudes. Honestly, you really don't.

456
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,470
But the argument is that these stereotypes
can affect your behavior in all sorts

457
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:51,220
of subtle ways. Here's one example. Um,

458
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,910
what they do is they do an experiment
where somebody is in trouble.

459
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,340
You hear a scream from outside,

460
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,590
either from a black person or a
white person in one condition,

461
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,370
you're the only person
around in another condition.

462
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,690
There's other people around you.

463
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,880
Now we know from work in the
bystander effect that in general,

464
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,980
which one are we more likely to help him
when were the only person or multiple

465
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,130
only. Exactly. And in fact,

466
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,070
when it's the only person just about
everybody helps regardless of the color of

467
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:31,600
the person in trouble.
But when you're with other people,

468
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,960
there's a big difference.
Now again, this isn't,

469
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,380
these studies are not done
with members of the KKK.

470
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,710
They're done with winter in standard
university undergraduates like you. Um,

471
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,120
and these are,
and if you were in this group,

472
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,100
you wouldn't say, oh, I didn't want
to help because the person's black.

473
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,330
Rather what you would say is,
well,

474
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,850
I didn't think it was worth helping or
other people around someone else would

475
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,480
help.

476
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,460
But we know by looking at it that this
difference makes a real difference.

477
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,430
A final study,
um,

478
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,960
and this was done by my colleague who
just got hired here, Jack to video,

479
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,280
who's done some wonderful work,

480
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,240
looked at how people judge to hire
somebody based on their recommendations.

481
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,080
Um,
this is a little bit of a confusing thing.

482
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,840
The green bars are to African Americans.

483
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,860
The blue bars are to white Americans and
in some cases these people have strong

484
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:35,930
recommendations when they have
strong recommendations. In 1989,

485
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,980
you're willing to hire everybody. And,
uh, this is not a difference at all,

486
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,880
but one of the recommendations are so,
so when it's a judgment call,

487
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,320
the subjects are significantly more
likely to hire the white American.

488
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,410
Then the African American 1989 was a
long time ago for the same results showed

489
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:59,651
up in 1999 the same results also
showed up about a year and a half ago.

490
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,230
And again, this doesn't show that
people are explicit, terrible racist.

491
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,970
It does show that people possess these
stereotypes that make a difference in

492
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,770
their real world behavior.

493
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,040
A way to put this all together is in a
interest divine's automaticity theory

494
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,290
theory,
which goes something like this.

495
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,080
The idea is that everybody
holds stereotypes.

496
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,700
These are automatically activated when
we come into contact with individuals.

497
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,300
In order to not act in
a stereotyped fashion,

498
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,210
we have to consciously push them down.

499
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,800
We have to consciously override
them and that's possible,

500
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,970
but it takes work.

501
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:46,150
It takes work both at the individual level
and it takes work at the group level.

502
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,790
Any questions or thoughts about this?

503
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,323
Yes.

504
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,703
Yup.

505
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,030
It's a good question.

506
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,570
It's a good question. These results,
these results are surprising, um,

507
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,010
and disturbing.
And I said there's,

508
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:21,440
there's work to be done in
individual and group level and,

509
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,340
and this young man challenged me to be
more explicit about that. Here's one case.

510
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,960
We have job searches
and and sometime jobs,

511
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,970
senior job searches involve the faculty
sitting around in a room and tossing out

512
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:39,150
names and we use these names as a
basis for further discussion. Hey,

513
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:42,210
I wonder what about that person?
That person does great work.

514
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,130
What we do now in a psychology department
is we make a special point of trying

515
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:49,830
to get names from disadvantaged groups,

516
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,370
not with an eye towards an
affirmative action policy,

517
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,720
but rather because there's
a lot of evidence suggesting
that people who are just

518
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:02,721
as qualified don't come to mind unless
you make some sort of procedure to do it.

519
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,250
Here's another example.

520
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,140
A lot of journals do blind reviewing now
because of the evidence I talked about

521
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:14,610
before regarding sexual stereotypes that
whether it has a male name or a female

522
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:17,520
name makes a difference.
So those are not,

523
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:21,870
those are group level and that they're
not saying you get rid of your prejudices

524
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:22,890
by trying harder.

525
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,540
It's rather let's set up a system
so that your prejudices can't work.

526
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,950
The blind auditions,
for instance,

527
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:32,670
being a beautiful example of
that at an individual level.

528
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:35,790
Your questions a harder one.
And I'm not exactly sure what we could do,

529
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,910
but I think what we should
do is be conscious of these
things and know that it's

530
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:43,920
not enough to say, well,
I'm explicitly not racist,

531
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,200
so I'll give everybody a fair shake.

532
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:50,610
But to recognize we might have biases
and to work hard to overcome them,

533
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,910
not by overcorrecting in some, in
some random way, but trying to,

534
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,610
if you're interested, for
instance, in qualifications,

535
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,900
setting up some system that these
qualifications can be observed absent

536
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,720
knowledge of race or sex. Yeah. And back.

537
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,473
Yeah.

538
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,010
Yes.
The question is a good one.

539
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,050
How much of this is due to stereotypes
and how much of this is due to an own

540
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:20,460
group bias? Um, so the fact that, so,

541
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,980
so the experiments as I've described
them are to some extent ambiguous.

542
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,690
The fact that white Americans favor white
Americans over black Americans might

543
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:32,170
be because of, um, of stereotypes,

544
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,160
but they also might be of
ingroup favoritism. Uh,

545
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,370
I think the answer is
that both play a role,

546
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,370
but some of the effects
are due to stereotypes, um,

547
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,990
above and beyond in group favoritism.
And one reason why we know that is in,

548
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,990
in studies like the IAT,

549
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,020
the implicit attitudes test
African-american show much
the same effect as white

550
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:55,864
Americans.

551
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,960
So African Americans also are biased
against African Americans and in favor of

552
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:04,720
white Americans showing it doesn't
reduce the group favoritism though that

553
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:05,860
probably plays a big role.

554
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,213
Okay.

555
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,810
Okay.
Um,

556
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm going to shift and spend the rest
of this class on a couple of mysteries.

557
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,810
Here's the summary.
Um,

558
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,480
the first one is a minor mystery.

559
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,790
I think we have some
progress and explaining it.

560
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,590
The second one is a total
mystery. The first one, sleep.

561
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:36,070
Um, sleep is a motivation. It is,

562
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:39,130
it is a motivation like food or drink.
Um,

563
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,900
if it is a form of torture, I won't get
into definitions of what torture is,

564
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,020
but it would cause somebody tremendous
pain and anguish to keep them from

565
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:50,620
sleeping. Uh, when you're really
tired, sleep is what you want to do.

566
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,780
Like when you're really hungry,
you wanna eat.

567
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,860
How many people here on average from the
beginning of the semester till now get

568
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:03,910
on average more than eight hours
of sleep a night? It's good. Good.

569
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,900
There's this sort of school of sleep.
There's a school of sleep macho.

570
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:12,490
I sleep macho used to be, I only get,
you know, 42 minutes of sleep a night.

571
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,700
Now Sleeve Mantras,
I sleep 11 hours.

572
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,000
Who gets on average more than seven
on average?

573
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:22,990
More than six.

574
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,850
Who here has been making it since the
beginning of semester on under six hours

575
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:30,550
in a night.
Okay.

576
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,320
Anybody viewed them as getting an
under five hours a night? Okay.

577
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,800
There's big individual differences in
how much sleep people need and sleep

578
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:45,640
itself is what we spend
a lot of our life on.

579
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,620
But it's very hard to study and we
didn't use to know much of it because you

580
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,550
can't ask people what's happening during
it cause they're sleeping. So you need,

581
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,890
you need sort of clever methods.
One such clever method is an EEG.

582
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,870
You bring somebody in a sleep lab,

583
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,940
you put electrodes on her
scalp and you see what these,

584
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:10,270
what sort of electoral activities
you get in the brain right now,

585
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,340
many of you are showing irregular Beta
waves suggesting intense comprehension

586
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,410
and great intellectual focus.

587
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,240
Some of you are awake but non attentive
and your brain's giving these large

588
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:29,470
regular alpha waves. Some of you
are sound asleep, deepened delta.

589
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,770
When you sleep, you get
the following stages. Uh,

590
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,380
you start off of a transition period.
When you're falling asleep,

591
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:43,330
we call that stage one. Then you get
successively deeper, two through four,

592
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,870
slow in regular,
high amplitude Delta waves.

593
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,600
And then once you reach stage four,

594
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,930
you start going up again up
through stage three and two.

595
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,480
Then rem sleep emerge as
rapid eye movement. Sleep.

596
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,770
Rem Sleep is neat cause your
brain looks like it's wide awake.

597
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,670
But, and I'm going to go talk a little
bit more in detail about this later.

598
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,780
You're relaxed, you're rapid eye
movements occur. That's where your,

599
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:16,330
the name comes from and dreams occur.

600
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,980
And then on a good night's sleep you've
got four to five sleep cycles and it

601
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:25,450
looks like this.
You start off,

602
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,550
you go down, down, down,
and now you come up.

603
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,080
Then you do your first
rem cycle again again,

604
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,760
again, again, and then you wake up.

605
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,860
So the general takeaway message here
is that there's two types of sleep.

606
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,370
There was slow wave sleep or quiet sleep.

607
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,800
Your eyes drift separately and slowly.
Your um,

608
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,810
your hard to wake up
vendor is rem sleep.

609
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,620
Your brain is active as if you were awake.

610
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:05,370
You're egs are similar to waking
paralyzed except for the eyes.

611
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,550
Oh men get erections
and you have dreams.

612
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,390
One sleep researcher joke that
these two are connected because um,

613
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,160
what happens is dreams fly around
through the ether and then the erection

614
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,080
service antennas.
So you picked up,

615
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,730
don't,
don't write that down.

616
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,840
Why do we sleep and why don't we,
why aren't we always wake there?

617
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,880
There's a couple of answers to this.
Um,

618
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,570
probably the best answer is um,

619
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,860
our body's worn out during the day and
sleep is necessary to put it back into

620
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:50,704
shape.

621
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,000
So when you sleep growth producing
hormone goes through the body,

622
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,690
your brain and other organs get restored.
Uh,

623
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,860
there are, um, you need less food.

624
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,150
Your immune system seems to
be hard at work. And in fact,

625
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,470
one answer. So people always wonder
what happens if you'd stopped sleeping?

626
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,670
And the answer is not a,
is not one discovered in the laboratory,

627
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:19,420
but it's been reported in different
cases. If you stopped sleeping, you die,

628
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,180
you don't die in some dramatic way,
you get sick and then you die.

629
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,590
Suggesting that sleeping is
good to keep you healthy. And a,

630
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,950
and an analogy I like to think
about is, um, is that you're,

631
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,750
when you bring your car into repair it
for repairs, when you repairing your car,

632
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,380
the first thing you do is you
stop it and shut off the engine.

633
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,980
You make it stable and at rest
so you can work on repair. Um,

634
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,600
a related view is that sleep,
uh,

635
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,970
emerged to preserve energy and
keep you at a trouble at night.

636
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:59,470
And these views are of
course not incompatible. Um,

637
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,150
this explains why we sleep at all and
this probably explains why we sleep at

638
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:09,070
night.
There are sleep disorders.

639
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,580
Um, I won't go through them. I
just list a few of them here.

640
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,640
Those sorts of bad things that could
happen to you when you're asleep. Um,

641
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,290
one particularly trendy sleep disorder
that's been discovered recently are side

642
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:24,420
effects of sleeping pills
such as ambien. So, um,

643
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,250
one of the bizarre side effects
is peep some people of Ambien, um,

644
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,080
while sleeping go downstairs,
open up their refrigeration,

645
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,540
eat huge amounts of food,
um,

646
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,040
are more recent side effect of Ambien.

647
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,080
That's quite serious
as some people become,

648
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,140
had the compulsion Waller
sleeping to go driving,

649
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,660
which is not not good.

650
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,420
What we're really interested in though,
when it comes to sleep, his dreams,

651
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,900
so remember Hamlet,
um,

652
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,550
people you all studied to hamlet to
be or not to be. That's all I know.

653
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,410
But basically he was deciding.
He, I wrote this down though,

654
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,770
he was deciding whether
or not to kill himself.

655
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,060
And so he made up two lists,
the list of reasons to kill himself.

656
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,690
We're the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

657
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:25,100
a sea of troubles and the heartache and
the thousand natural shocks that flesh

658
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:26,604
is heir to.

659
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,400
He only had one argument not
to kill himself, nightmares

660
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,650
to sleep per chance to dream
for it in that sleep of death.

661
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:41,100
What dreams may come when we have shuffled
off this mortal coil might give us

662
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:43,680
pause. Um, he was
worried about nightmares.

663
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:48,870
Now dreams have always fascinated
people and philosophers.

664
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,280
If you take a philosophy course,

665
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,370
there'll be a couple of questions about
dreams that you were wondering about. Um,

666
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,340
one is,
are you dreaming right now?

667
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:02,030
So Rene Descartes famously wondered
whether the real world doesn't exist.

668
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,170
Maybe right now it's just a dream.

669
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,150
See also to matrix and can
you be a moral in a dream?

670
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:14,390
We do all sorts of things in dreams that
are bad are these since and the great

671
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,320
and the great theologians and philosophers
like Augustan wondered about this.

672
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,830
Can you sit in a dream?
I will answer both questions.

673
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,730
You are not dreaming right now
unless you're asleep. But if you're,

674
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:30,990
if you're normal and you can't
usually be immoral in a dream,

675
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,500
the exceptions are lucid dreams
where you choose what to dream about.

676
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,390
And then possibly you could be a moral
if you encourage bad habits of thought.

677
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,460
What do we know about dreams?
Well, first as a distinction,

678
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,790
a distinction between real
dreams versus sleep thought.

679
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,240
So real dreams are,
you know,

680
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,320
you're in a submarine wrestling
a chicken while your grandmother,

681
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:02,710
it looks disapprovingly on.
Those are real dreams. Um,

682
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,690
sleep thought is the sort of thing you
get typically before you fall asleep.

683
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,840
And it's like, did I take the garbage
out? Go ahead, take the garbage out.

684
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,270
Where's the garbage? Good
data garbage. They date the
garbage. And so sort of this,

685
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,540
this kind of rumination, and you
could do this while you're sleeping.

686
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,840
So if you're woken up during slow wave
sleep when we think and he'd take the

687
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,790
garden. Yeah, that's what I was dreaming.
I was thinking about the garbage.

688
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,040
But if you're woken up
during rem but a monkey,

689
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:34,090
it was eating my grandmother and that sort
of thing. So, so there's a distinction.

690
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,790
What do people dream about while we know
some facts but dream everybody dreams.

691
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,800
Not Everybody remembers their dreams.
If you want to remember your dream,

692
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:48,940
by the way, keep your dreams.
Keep a dream diary. Very useful.

693
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,470
But everybody dreams
three to four times a night.

694
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:57,910
That depends on how much sleep you get.
But Dreams, leaf, fragile memories,

695
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,350
they fade quickly.

696
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,670
This is why a dream diary or writing up
writing your dreams as soon as you wake

697
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:07,840
up, it turns out to be useful.
What do people dream about? Well,

698
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,880
basically the way to find that out is
you ask people and people have site

699
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,630
psychologists and sociologists have,
have collected dream reports.

700
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,300
Um, if you go to a Dream bank.net, um,

701
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,230
guy named hill collected
50,000 dream reports.

702
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,420
You can make some generalizations.
Most dreams are bad.

703
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,750
They're not bad, bad. They're not
nightmares. But most dreams are,

704
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,170
you know,
from a scale of one to 10,

705
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,960
with five and a half in the
middle there on the negative side,

706
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,030
they report misfortunes.

707
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,913
MMM.

708
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,070
People in tribal societies have dreams
with more physical aggression than people

709
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:56,510
in industrialized societies. Men have
more aggressive dreams than women.

710
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:01,390
Americans have more aggressive
dreams and Europeans. Yeah. Um,

711
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,920
what do people want to dream about?
While psychologist did this,

712
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:11,450
the findings were totally not going to
surprise you. Um, women want to greenbelt,

713
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,500
romance, and adventure. Men want
to dream about sex with strangers.

714
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:23,720
Turns out that once you get past the
hormonal blast of adolescence, um,

715
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:28,040
though 10% of dreams have
explicit sexual content,

716
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,020
what's the most common
dream guesses? Falling.

717
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:39,280
That's a good guess. Falling is among
the top names, but falling is not,

718
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:43,450
is not the winner.
Somebody else flying.

719
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,260
Also close public speaking,

720
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,150
good phobic dream but not it

721
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,770
naked in public Nigga budget.
Not at awesome.

722
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,760
Excellent being chased.

723
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,880
Evolutionary psychologists and cognitive
neuroscientists have puzzled over this

724
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:10,000
one.
It seems to be a sort of a primal dream,

725
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,120
but the dream about
being chased is a biggie.

726
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:17,620
Has Anybody here ever dreamt of being
chased that you could remember? Yeah.

727
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,990
You chase the big one,
make it and public

728
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:27,350
grandmother killed by monkey.
So

729
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,480
what are your dreams for

730
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,760
either our 40 and theories
that dreams are disguised?

731
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:40,980
Wish fulfillment and other things?
Um,

732
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,720
there's not much support for these.
One theory,

733
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:46,910
which is popular,

734
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,530
is that dreams are a side effect of
memory consolidation. So your body,

735
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,150
your body sort of below the neck
rebuilds itself while you're sleeping.

736
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:01,520
But also what happens while
you're sleeping is your
memories get played over and

737
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:05,330
over again. To consolidate them
in a different parts of the brain.

738
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,720
Almost the best analogy here
is backing up a computer.

739
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:13,280
Your brain backs itself up in
the course of backing itself up.

740
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,170
They're sort of random events,

741
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:19,340
flash to consciousness and get
put together in a coherent story.

742
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,110
From this perspective.
Dreams serve no adaptive function at all,

743
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:29,170
but rather their epi phenomenon are
the byproducts of another system.

744
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,680
Final topic is laughter

745
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,740
and this is a true mystery.
I am,

746
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,900
I got interested in as well.

747
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:48,200
I got interested as a
developmental psychologist
watching my own children laugh

748
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,500
and, and it's trying to figure out
what it is that made them laugh.

749
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,050
This is my son Zachary,
pretty young.

750
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,740
Um, for, this is not the youngest
record of, of laughing. Um,

751
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,310
I found this on the web.

752
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,353
Yeah,

753
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:03,620
it's, it's, it's,

754
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,090
it's a huge puzzle from an
evolutionary point of view.

755
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,990
People's pursuit of sex and food and
drink and sleep are not these huge

756
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:20,390
mysteries are abilities to understand
language and make sense of the visual

757
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:25,170
world and coherent groups. But,
but the fact that we make this,

758
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:30,171
this weird noise at bizarre
circumstances is a huge puzzle.

759
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,900
Um, and typical typically, um,

760
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:40,160
psychologists have failed to explain
this puzzle. So here's something I'm,

761
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,320
here's the first guess I read
in a neuroscience textbook.

762
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,720
We laugh when there is
incongruities between what we
expect and what we actually,

763
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,180
what actually happens unless
the outcome is frightening.

764
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,110
Now this is a fair effort.

765
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:00,140
It is about as wrong as anything
can be wrong in any possible way.

766
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:04,260
Um, first thing is it
doesn't really explain why.

767
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,390
So why should be a non frightening
incongruity caused people to make a

768
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:14,391
distinctive loud noise consisted of
Staccato stigmas of one 15th of a second,

769
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:16,740
each separated by a fifth of a second.

770
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,300
It doesn't explain why we make that loud
noise when dealing with incongruities.

771
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,170
It's not the case. That incongruity,
um, causes laughter. If there was,

772
00:54:28,171 --> 00:54:33,150
um, if there was a bowl of
fruit up there as you walked in,

773
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,440
it'd be incongruous,

774
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,030
but people wouldn't shriek with
laughter and pointed a fruit. Um,

775
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,010
it's also

776
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,870
a lot of laughter isn't
caused by incongruity.

777
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,300
So a lot of times we laughed.

778
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:51,750
There's nothing in congruous
in any deep sense about it.

779
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:57,010
So laughter is kind of a puzzle. We
don't know why we laugh. We don't know.

780
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:01,740
Um,
what makes us laugh over the last five,

781
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:03,840
10 years,
there's been some work done on us.

782
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:09,230
A lot of the work is done by
Robert provene who summarizes
this in his excellent

783
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:10,890
book,

784
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:15,890
laughter and probing decided
to do something that nobody
in the history of the

785
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:18,120
world has done.

786
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:23,670
He decided to send himself in
his students to different places,

787
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:27,630
including shopping malls and
observe when people laughed

788
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,290
and write down what made them laugh.

789
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,730
And this is a first descriptive step
to developing a theory of laughter.

790
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:40,770
And his big finding is
that you could separate

791
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:43,440
people.

792
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:49,250
You could separate the
question of laughter from
the question of a joke or the

793
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:50,580
question of humor.

794
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,880
Most of what people would make people
laugh wasn't in any sense a joke or

795
00:55:56,941 --> 00:56:01,920
humorous. So he had over a
thousand laughter initiated,

796
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,680
uh, situations. And here's him.

797
00:56:04,681 --> 00:56:08,420
Typical comments that initiated
laughter sometimes are Rorty,

798
00:56:08,421 --> 00:56:13,350
is laughter under parts of people.
I'll see you guys later.

799
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,810
Look, it's Andre. Are you sure? I know.

800
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,590
How are you? I try to lead a
normal life. It's sort of funny.

801
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:29,900
Does anyone in a context where it
wasn't particularly I'm using, um,

802
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,950
it wasn't you.
We can handle this.

803
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,340
Only 10% of the comments were it could be,

804
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:40,210
were coded later on as people as
actually humorous in any sense.

805
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,540
And these included, um, poor
boy looks just like his father.

806
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,340
You smell like you've had a good workout.
Did you find that in your nose?

807
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,190
Referenced the dormitory food.
Um,

808
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:56,570
he has a job holding back
skin and operating room. So,

809
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,280
so probing suggest we separate
the question of laughter, of,

810
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,670
of laughter and jokes,

811
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:09,250
and then ask what do we
know about laughter? Well,
here's some basic facts that,

812
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,270
that, remember, we're trying to think
like evolutionary biologists here.

813
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,170
Humans had this universal trait.
There's no society without laughter.

814
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:21,730
It's early emerging as we saw in
those clips. So what's it for?

815
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:25,960
What does it do is if it's an accident
and what's an accident from, well,

816
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:27,490
what properties does it have?

817
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,100
And there's some obvious properties
that are important to know.

818
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:35,170
It's social and communicative. Why
do we know that? Because it's loud.

819
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:41,230
Laughter is not, is not like
hunger. Hunger can be silent.

820
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,070
Hunger is not essentially a message
to other people. But when humans,

821
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:47,080
when it involves a loud noise,

822
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,550
the reason why we've evolved loud noises
is to communicate with other people.

823
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,680
Laughter could be viewed as a form
of involuntary, a noise making

824
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:03,050
and it's contagious. That's another
interesting thing about it. Um,

825
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:07,900
one of the great discoveries
in television and movies was,

826
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,990
um,
was the invention of the laugh track.

827
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,400
The laugh track makes things a lot funnier
because people laugh a lot more when

828
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:17,020
they were in groups.
Uh,

829
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:22,050
the rim shot after a comic remark is
an attempt to simulate as sort of a pre

830
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:26,020
technological attempt to
simulate the sound of laughter.

831
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,650
Children are particularly
influenced by the,

832
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,090
the contagiousness of laughter.
But just in general,

833
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,430
if you hear somebody laughing like,

834
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:40,840
like the kids you saw before is a sort of
thing that could easily make you laugh.

835
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,190
Other primates do it to some extent.

836
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,890
And it's interesting when they do it.
Um,

837
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:53,530
monkeys laugh when they
shit when they attack. Uh,

838
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,320
when monkeys get together
to kill an eat somebody,

839
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,330
they make a kind of a laughing noise

840
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:05,430
and chimpanzees laugh when they tickle
each other and we could see and what's

841
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:07,960
tickling?
Well,

842
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:12,160
a fair definition of tickling is touching
parts of the body in a mock attack.

843
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,600
Um, you sort of attack somebody and
they're laughing, but, but if it's,

844
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,360
but as far as trying to Mug you, you're
not, ah, that was so funny. You have to,

845
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:26,070
you have to realize that this is a
mock attack. You're simulating attack.

846
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:32,100
So one theory is, is a signal of mock
aggression and collective aggression.

847
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,143
It's basically a,

848
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,790
it's like a sound of some
sort of mob attack. Um,

849
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,990
it's mock aggression in a
sense that when people laugh,

850
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:47,880
they're often teasing kidding
around. Um, they're, they're,

851
00:59:47,881 --> 00:59:51,550
they're, they're throwing out insults.
Maybe they're tickling each other.

852
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,360
Maybe they're making fun of each other.
Me and making fun of themselves.

853
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,760
And there's some aggression to it.

854
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,200
Most laughter is inspired by
some degree of aggression,

855
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:05,610
but it's attenuated and it's not real.
And the laughter is a signal.

856
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:10,590
This isn't a real and
collective aggression. Um,

857
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,460
a lot of mob assaults,
executions, lynchings,

858
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:18,900
rapes are accompanied to sound of
laughter when you were in a group doing

859
01:00:18,901 --> 01:00:21,330
something terribly
aggressive and you are not,

860
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:22,860
you don't feel like you're at risk,

861
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:27,480
you might laugh and laughter's is a
signal to other members of the group as a

862
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:32,420
signal of solidarity and what
you're doing together. Um,

863
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,950
a different way of putting it.
And none of this is going to come in with,

864
01:00:35,951 --> 01:00:40,440
with a sharp, decisive theory. These are
sort of flailing away at different ideas.

865
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,880
But another way of doing an older way is,
is bill brose by Plato.

866
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:49,290
Who of you. Laughter as a form of
bonding against the common enemy.

867
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:54,120
It's a sound. It's a sound of group
cohesion against the common enemy.

868
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,550
Um, comedians have not missed the
aggressive nature of laughter. Uh,

869
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:02,700
Dave Berry, right? The
most important humor,

870
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:05,970
truth of all is that to really
see the humor in a situation,

871
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,960
you have to have perspective. Perspective
is right from two ancient Greek words,

872
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,660
perse, meaning something bad
had happened to someone else.

873
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,030
And active meaning ideally
somebody like Donald Trump.

874
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,710
And the idea is that it's
something bad happening,

875
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:23,540
but not to you or to somebody you love.
Um,

876
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,850
Mel Brooks puts it in
so much sharper terms,

877
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:31,710
distinguishing between comedy and tragedy.
Tragedy is when I cut my finger.

878
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,880
Comedy's when you fall
an open sewer in guy

879
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,520
to sum up ingredients,

880
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:47,250
if humor is there has to be a
target who experiences some harm.

881
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,850
It can be an enemy. It could be
a friend, it could be yourself.

882
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:56,690
The harm shouldn't be as so serious
that it elicits strong negative emotions

883
01:01:56,941 --> 01:02:01,830
like fear, grief, or
pity. So if a stranger,

884
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,190
you know, slips on a banana,
peel and lands on his butt,

885
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,420
I might laugh cause I'm not
overcome by compassion. You know,

886
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,340
if he split his head open,
there's blood everywhere,

887
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,370
I'm less likely to laugh unless
I don't like him or something.

888
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,780
And this is why the humor,

889
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,620
why damage is often a
certain sort of damage. Um,

890
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:27,570
involving things like embarrassment, sex,
autology, a banana peel pie in the face,

891
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:32,310
your pants fall down or something where
there was no real harm. So empathy,

892
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:35,970
caring, sympathy, don't
kick in. But instead,

893
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:40,150
here's the aggression
unleashed at somebody's. Um,

894
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,270
and it has to be some level of surprise.
This is what I'm,

895
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,800
this is where the humor
for that baby comes in,

896
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,160
which is why he couldn't predict when
the sound was coming and some aspect of

897
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:58,980
that was what made it so funny.
Then what elicited the laughter?

898
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:06,110
This is what elicit laughter for Zachary
was watching the classic film Winnie

899
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,060
the Pooh and a blustery day.
Um,

900
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:13,680
we're rabbit climbed in a high bunch of
shelves and it all came crashing down on

901
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:16,790
him, but he didn't, wasn't dead.
He was just kind of stunning.

902
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:23,650
Final question for anybody interested
in laughter is why can't we tickle

903
01:03:23,651 --> 01:03:25,010
ourselves?
Now?

904
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:30,011
I've talked about laughter on two separate
occasions and Anesia they occasions

905
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:32,480
when I talked in front of
a large group like this,

906
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:36,410
somebody came up to me
afterwards and said, but I can,

907
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,860
and
I don't,

908
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,840
and they seem sincere, but people saying,
you know, I could do it all myself.

909
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:50,670
How many hate people here will own up
to being able to take on themselves?

910
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,460
It's a fascinating question
why some people can,

911
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:04,110
the general story of why we can't in
general is cause there's no surprise.

912
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,310
Um, there's no mark aggression and also
to maybe a general deadening of self

913
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:11,740
stimulation.
Um,

914
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,930
I'm going to end with the
final reading response.

915
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,603
Um,

916
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:23,250
think up an interesting testable
idea about either dreams or laughter.

917
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,880
You could go into as much
detail as you want if you want.

918
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:31,620
Your thing can be one sentence long,
but, but it could be longer. Um,

919
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:38,210
I will ask the teaching fellows does
each send me their one or two most

920
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:39,510
interesting remarks.

921
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:44,690
I will then judge and then the
winner will win some small price,

922
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,800
either of a literary or a food nature.
Okay,

923
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,630
I'll see you all on Wednesday.
