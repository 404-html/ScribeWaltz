1
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,370
I'll begin the class officially,
um,

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,380
with a different sort of demonstration.

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,580
I want to just show you one of the change
blindness studies that has been done

4
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,810
in the real world

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
and these videotapes are not available
publicly be get them from the web and see

6
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:36,820
him as as little javascripts.

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,260
So this is a one of the first studies
done by Dan Simons when he was at Cornell

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,590
and his advisor at the time,
um, was uh, our friend Kyle,

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,350
who's now in our department.
So here's the study

10
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,763
and

11
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,730
you don't notice it. Um, changed.

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,740
Linus is one of the more
striking phenomenon discovered
by laboratory scientists

13
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,350
and by site,
by psychologists.

14
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,490
But it's important to realize to get
away from the sort of surprise of the

15
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,110
gorilla and the fact that it's
hard to see the flickering,

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,860
the object that's flickering and
appreciate the big moral of this cause.

17
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:37,300
The big moral of this is actually I
think striking and quite important. Um,

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,590
you think right now that you
are perceiving the world.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,970
I looked down on you and I think I have
a whole sense of where everybody is.

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,420
I can't see everybody perfectly and back,
you're going to far away and blurry.

21
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,460
But there's a sense in which I,
I have a world around me. Um,

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,430
similarly,
if I'm to close my eyes for a second,

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,600
everything just remains and I can sort
of remember some of the things that are

24
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:09,810
there that's really good sound
localization by me. Um, the,

25
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,410
so you're looking up and, and you
think you have a sense of the world,

26
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,850
both in perception and memory,

27
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,760
the change blindness experiments
suggested this isn't true.

28
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,170
The change minus the experiments suggest
that if you look at me for a second,

29
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,080
and during that second,
um,

30
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,580
all of your classmates changed positions,
including those next to you,

31
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,620
you are extremely unlikely to notice
the change blindness experiments suggest

32
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,940
that if you turn your eyes away from me
towards there for a second and turn back

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,170
and I'm dressed entirely differently,
you wouldn't notice.

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,890
The exceptions would be if
you told yourself consciously,

35
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:51,040
remember what this guy's wearing?
He's wearing this, that another.

36
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,120
But if you don't do it
consciously, you'll lose it. Um,

37
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,480
and usually this is okay.

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Usually it's okay because your memory
and your visual system exploits the basic

39
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,600
fact about the universe,
which is that most things stay the same.

40
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,630
Most of the time I don't
have to explicitly remember
that you're over there when

41
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:17,380
I turned my head for a second because
you'll be over there in any case,

42
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,880
you don't need to hold precise
representations of the world. Um,

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,960
and so you only notice it in
certain clever circumstances.

44
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:30,520
One sort of clever circumstance is when
psychologists change reality as in a

45
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:34,540
change blindness studies. A second
sort of circumstance is in movies.

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,320
So one of the big surprises when people
started making movies involving cuts was

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,150
it is extremely difficult to get
everything continuously right?

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,610
And you need to work very hard to notice.

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,960
So there's all these continuity errors
that creep up into movies and you have to

50
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,080
be a film buff or writing
it down to even notice this.

51
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,980
And the overall moral here then is that
your perception of reality is a lot more

52
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,040
sparse, a lot more limited
than you might think it is.

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,080
So this is where we were
at the end of last class.

54
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:15,010
We were talking about the different
sorts of memories, um, sensory memory,

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,480
which is the sort of fraction
of a second of sensory residue,

56
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,350
what you're hearing and what you're
seeing, working memory, short term memory,

57
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,390
and then longterm memory.

58
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,830
And we talked last class about how
things get into sensory memory,

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,170
into working memory,
the role of attention.

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,580
And in fact the change blindness
studies are actually just studies of how

61
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:40,750
something gets from your senses to your
consciousness and what does and what

62
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,410
doesn't. Now I want to move to
distinction in working memory,

63
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:47,950
short term memory and,
and longterm memory.

64
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,610
Now the obvious distinction
is actually just in fact,

65
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,380
um,
is storage differences.

66
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,520
So longterm memory or Ltm
has a huge storage capacity.

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,510
This is your memory,
like the hard drive of your computer.

68
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,820
This is the memory you walk around with.
Um, it includes all the words in English,

69
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,710
just for example, 60, 80,000 words.
It includes everybody you've ever met.

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,050
Languages, faces, um, stories, locations,

71
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:27,790
nursery rhyme, songs, TV programs.
Nobody knows the storage.

72
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,870
It is not true that you remember
everything that has ever happened to you.

73
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,600
That there's no reasonably that this
is true. At the same time though,

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,870
you have a huge amount stored in your
brain in longterm storage and nobody

75
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,900
actually, it has to be limited
because it's a finite limited brain,

76
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,780
but nobody knows how big it is.

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,730
Nobody knows how many terabytes you
carry around in your brain. And um,

78
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,460
but it's a lot.
Compare this to working memory,

79
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,690
the short term memory,
which is actually very limited.

80
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,460
Your memory of what you could store on
and where you can hold in consciousness

81
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:11,810
right now is quite limited.
Um, here's an exercise.

82
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,690
Do not write these, these things
down. I want you to remember them.

83
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,910
I'm just going to give you a few numbers.

84
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,300
1459,

85
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,020
11 109-4358-NINETY 848720538954.

86
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,903
Please write them down.

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,570
View this as Nike test
if that would relax you.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,833
Okay.

89
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,023
Um,

90
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,060
how many of you who decided to participate
in this experiment got three or less?

91
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,620
Good, good. Um, four, five,

92
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,770
six, seven, eight,

93
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,230
nine or more.
Anybody get all 11?

94
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,240
Um, this is a particularly
difficult memory task.

95
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,810
The numbers are
meaningless and I told him,

96
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:46,030
and I forgot to tell you to get your
pen and pencil ready so some of you just

97
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,680
glared at me,
but um,

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,720
but under normal circumstances,
the cognitive psychologists,

99
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:57,721
George Miller said that the sort of
suggested that the standard memory storage

100
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:02,380
of short term memory is
seven plus or minus two.

101
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,270
And what that means is anywhere
from five to nine, roughly,

102
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,210
some of you I bet can beat that.
Some of you on a not so good day,

103
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,740
maybe it won't make it that much.
Um,

104
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,200
now seven plus or minus two is what year?

105
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:24,550
So that's what you hold in consciousness.
You know, I'm telling you 14,

106
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:29,110
21 walk around. All right, 1421, you
hold that unconscious, no problem.

107
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,680
But I throw 11 numbers at you.
You can't some dribble out.

108
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:36,520
You can't hold that in your conscious
window in your short term memory.

109
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,070
Now this raises the question
seven plus or minus two. What?

110
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,660
And the answer seems to be what George
Miller calls chunks and a chunk.

111
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,070
Is it basic memory unit?

112
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,120
Something you think of as
a single individual entity.

113
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,850
Um,
so suppose you see the string of letters,

114
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,530
l a, m, a, I. S. O. N. Um,

115
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,030
if you don't know if you can form these
into words and you have to remember

116
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,720
them, these are eight chunks. You
have to just pick them up separately.

117
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,070
On the other hand,
if you break them up into four words,

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,980
you could just remember
that's four chunks.

119
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,110
And if you break it up into two words
in French, uh, Lemay zone, the house,

120
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,930
um,
it could just be one or two.

121
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,660
How much you know,

122
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,890
depends on affects how much you memorize,
how much,

123
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,540
how much you could store in memory,

124
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,960
because it affects what counts
as a basic unit of memory.

125
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,570
And there's all sorts of examples of this.
If I tell you one,

126
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:52,550
one zero, one, one zero, zero,
one zero, one, one zero, um,

127
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,110
those of you who don't know binary numbers
might have to remember that as one,

128
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:59,410
one, zero, zero, whatever. I said. Um,

129
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,650
those of you who are computer
scientists or mathematicians,

130
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,300
or for whatever reason,

131
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:08,780
no binary numbers could convert
into a single binary number.

132
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,960
Anybody know what the number is?
No,

133
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:18,100
I cannot say it again. Um, some number 24,

134
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,840
not 24 to 224 and then you remember 24,
it's easier.

135
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Suppose you see a chessboard and a Chess
Board is set up and you don't know how

136
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:29,920
to play chess.

137
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
It is murderously hard to remember
that they've done the experiments.

138
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:36,190
We taking people in the lab who
don't know how to play chess.

139
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,480
They set up a chess board and then they
say, okay, look at this for five minutes.

140
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,710
Looks at it. Then they take it
away, set it up again and it's it.

141
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,240
It's murderously hard.

142
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
There was a horsey thing on
the side there and everything.

143
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,380
But if these chess pieces are set up
in some way that's logical for a chess

144
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:56,824
player,

145
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,660
then a chess master could look at
it and remember it in a glance, oh,

146
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,160
it's the Fibonacci defense or
something like that. Um, and,

147
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,580
and then immediately recover it.
Similarly,

148
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,320
football coaches have been tested on
their memories of football diagrams and

149
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:17,350
they have like a photographic memory
for football diamonds because it

150
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,960
corresponds to the things that
makes sense. Arik attacks.

151
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,130
Architects could have a photographic
memory of perfect memory for four plants

152
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,500
because it makes sense to
them. They understand it. Um,

153
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,700
and so the way you store things in memory,

154
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,120
and this is a theme we're going to return
to when we get to long term memory,

155
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,440
depends in a large extent on
how much you understand it

156
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,970
and it shows up and expertise affects.
Now

157
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,850
this is what's happening so far in short
term memory, how much you hold in there.

158
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,750
The question is how do you
get it into longterm memory?

159
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,770
So you have longterm memory, your,
your, your major storage system.

160
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,490
How does information get from your
consciousness to longterm storage?

161
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,170
Well,
there's one thing,

162
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,420
there's one way which sort
of works sometimes but not
very well and it's called

163
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,630
maintenance rehearsal.
Suppose I said,

164
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,820
you have to remember this number,

165
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,950
this string of numbers and if you remember
it in 20 minutes you will get $1,000

166
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,570
and a string is the string is my
phone number when I was a kid.

167
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,040
And include the area code (514) 688-9057.

168
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,290
Now if you tell that to it to a four
year old, what four year old said,

169
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,500
I remember it.
And then you asked him what I just say.

170
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,400
Well I don't know if you tell it to
an act cause cause you know something,

171
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,400
if a lot depended on you
would know to do something.

172
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,150
What you would do is
you'd say there's 500,

173
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:56,151
four (688) 995-7514 (689) 575-1468 you'd
rehearse it in your head over and over

174
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:01,300
again. The problem is you could
hold it as long as you can do that.

175
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,970
Um, it's like these movies, you see this
all the time, like an episode of 24,

176
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,620
you know, Jack Call Ctu until
them agent 11 is trapped in there.

177
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,130
And I can't even remember this.
But the way to remember that you hold,

178
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,950
you just got to repeat it over
and over again in your head.

179
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,200
But this will not typically get things
into longterm memory to get things in the

180
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:27,640
longterm memory.
Rehearsal is usually not enough.

181
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,860
You need to do other things.

182
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,120
Typically what you need is
structure and organization.

183
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,163
Okay.

184
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,600
And one way to demonstrate this was
in a class at depth of processing

185
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,434
experiment,

186
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,940
which nicely illustrates the fact that
the more you structure something deeper,

187
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:47,960
you think about it,

188
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,260
okay?

189
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,710
The better it gets entrenched in
longterm memory. So in this study,

190
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,270
what they did was they asked people,

191
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,330
they told people that there's going to
be words flashed on the screen and all of

192
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:03,540
the subjects are the same strings
of words. There were 48 words.

193
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,300
They were not told to memorize the words.

194
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,120
Okay?

195
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,580
One third of the subjects was told,
look,

196
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,160
some of these words are going
to come out in capital letters.

197
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,470
Some of them not capital letters, press a
button for capital's non capitals. Sure.

198
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,910
The other group was told,
some of these words will rhyme with train.

199
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,180
Others won't press a button
if it rhymes and train.

200
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,320
The third group was told,
does it fit into the sentence,

201
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,580
the girl placed a blank on
the table, press a button.
If it does, press a button.

202
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:35,414
If it doesn't,

203
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,983
yeah.

204
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,570
Then they were asked as a surprise.
What words did you see?

205
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,740
And the findings look like this when
they were asked to focus on just what the

206
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:47,560
word look like,
memory was very poor.

207
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,530
The sound better,
the meaning better.

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,500
If you want to remember something,

209
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,340
the best way to remember it is to
give it meaning to give it sense.

210
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,350
Um, this is illustrated through
an a very ancient technique,

211
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,910
which is that the way to remember things
that are otherwise arbitrary is to give

212
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,550
them some organization
through memory tricks,

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,780
through vivid imagery or, or, or, um,

214
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,110
songs or poetry.
Um,

215
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,050
and there's a lot of examples of this.
Do you know how to remember that?

216
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,700
The hippocampus, there's part of
your brain called the hippocampus.

217
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,470
This is the worst memory Craig ever,
but it will stick with you for 20 years.

218
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,450
The HIPPA campus is involved
in spatial memory. Um,

219
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,040
it's involved in finding your way around.
Think you yourself.

220
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,750
The way I find my way around
campus is through the hippocampus.

221
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,090
That's stupid.

222
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,110
But you'll never forget now that the
hippocampus is in charge of spatial memory

223
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,680
because we all you retained
from this course, um, memory,

224
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,200
memory books on,
on how to,

225
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,050
on how to remember people's names.
Um,

226
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,820
usually try to exploit this sort of
thing where you try to get poetry are

227
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:13,100
dramatic images. So that memory books
always typically involve somebody.

228
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,900
Like you meet somebody very spiky
here and they say, my name is Mr Fish.

229
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,910
And then you remember, you think of
they're a big fish and paygov under here.

230
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,670
And then whenever you see them,
you remember their name.

231
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,120
It only really works for
names like fish, but, but the,

232
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,800
but the idea is you try to
generate vivid imagery when stock,

233
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,490
when stuck with a situation where
you have to remember 10 letters,

234
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,180
turn it into a song where are
are, are, are a dirty poem.

235
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,230
What each of the letters is.

236
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:48,160
The first words of it when having to
remember something that seems totally

237
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:50,230
arbitrary,
try to figure out

238
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,340
a grant and obscene image that
will come to mind easily. And,

239
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,390
and this is how these are one
way to get things into memory

240
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,370
at a deep level though,
the way to get things into memory,

241
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,060
and this applies to this course
no less than anything else,

242
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,850
is by understanding that understanding.
Again,

243
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,610
I'm going to read you something and I
want you to try your best to remember what

244
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:16,444
I tell you.

245
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,780
These are not going to be strings
of numbers they use are going to be,

246
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,640
this is going to be a series of sentences,

247
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,450
a newspapers better than a magazine.

248
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,020
A sea shore is a better place
than the street at first.

249
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:32,440
It is better to run then to walk.
You may have to try several times.

250
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:36,450
It takes some skill, but it's easy to
learn. Even young children can enjoy it.

251
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,460
One successful complications are minimal.

252
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,140
Bird seldom get to close reign,
however, soaks in very fast.

253
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,740
Too many people doing the same
things can also cause problems.

254
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,930
One needs lots of room. If there are no
complications, that can be very peaceful.

255
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,610
Finally, a rock will serve as an anchor
if things break loose from it. However,

256
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,170
you will not have a second chance.

257
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,010
And here's what I said.

258
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,843
Okay,

259
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,380
this is murderously hard to remember.
Now try it.

260
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,680
Knowing what this is about,

261
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,040
being able to put a context to it
helps the memory and, and, and,

262
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,280
and helps it come to mind.

263
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,903
Okay?

264
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,060
So this is about how to get memory,
how to get information into your memory.

265
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,320
How did you get information out?
So you know,

266
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,460
it's an exam period. You got this
stuff presumably into your head.

267
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,260
You have to get it out. You have to
retrieve it. There's a court case,

268
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:50,760
you have to figure out. You have to
recount the crime that you witnessed.

269
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,480
Um,

270
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,480
you see somebody and you want to know
his or her name and you heard it.

271
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,480
You just have to get it out.
Well, how do you do that? Well,

272
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,870
here's the retrieval cues.
Retrieval cues makes sense.

273
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,240
Retrieval cues are just things that,

274
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:10,980
that have been associated with what
you, um, what you're trying to remember?

275
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,493
MMM.

276
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,621
If I,

277
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:18,730
if I have to remember to
replace the windows when I
walk into my living room and

278
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:22,990
see that a window is cracked, that will
remind me to replace the windows. If, if,

279
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:26,850
um, if I had a lunch date with you
and forgot about it when I see you.

280
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,670
Oh yeah. We were supposed to
get together and have lunch. Um,

281
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,920
retrieval cue is bring things back,

282
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,120
but it's a little bit more complicated
in that there's a more general

283
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:44,590
relationship between encoding
and retrieval call the
compatibility principle.

284
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,710
And what this means is you're much better
to remember something in the context

285
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,510
in which you have learnt it.

286
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,700
And this is also known as
context dependent memory
and state dependent memory.

287
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,630
It's illustrated by one of the
strangest experiments in the history of

288
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:06,631
psychology where they had people on a
boat and then they had them scuba dive

289
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,130
underwater and they taught them things
either on the boat or underwater,

290
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,080
like with things that they held up.
And then they tested them later and uh,

291
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:22,081
turns out that you'll remember it better
if you're tested on it in the context

292
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:23,614
in which you learn it.

293
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,860
And it might be because then the
retrieval cues help bring it back. Um,

294
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,350
but it's more general in that if you
have to remember something you learned in

295
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:34,630
this class,
you will do better.

296
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,260
If you try to think about the
room in which you learned at it,

297
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,680
you will do better on your final exam
if you were to take it in this room than

298
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:48,280
if you were to take it in another room.
Because being in this room,

299
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,570
we'll bring back the cues.
It's not just the environment.

300
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,390
People will learn things
when they're stoned.

301
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,950
Remember them better keeping
stone that is sort of a low level.

302
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:01,660
It doesn't disrupt
other mental activities.

303
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,310
Remember them better when
they're sort of stone again

304
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,750
then after non stone.
Similarly. So, you know,

305
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,910
if you study while you drink,

306
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,810
you should typically a little bit
before coming into the final exam.

307
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,650
It's sort of like what happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas, sort of results. Um,

308
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,630
and so similarly,

309
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:30,631
it even applies to moods in that if you
learn something when depressed used to

310
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,900
have a slightly better recovery of
it when you're in that same mood of

311
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,580
depression than when you're elated.

312
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,660
And the idea is that part of what
memory is part of recovering memories is

313
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:45,661
getting back your original context
in which you've learned it.

314
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,273
Um,

315
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,470
elaborative rehearsal and retrieval a
lot involves the connections between

316
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,410
different things.
Um,

317
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,660
elaborative rehearsal is that the
more you think about something,

318
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:07,300
the easier it is to remember.
If you have to think about,

319
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,620
if you have to remember something,

320
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,850
try to connect it to as many things
as possible. Think of an image,

321
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,740
make a joke out of it. Imagine how
you would explain it to somebody else.

322
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,030
Um, imagine how the world, what the
world will be like if it wasn't. So,

323
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,650
and the idea is that this sort of thinking
about it makes connections in your

324
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:31,210
memory from that thing you have to learn
to other memories and so it makes it

325
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:33,200
easier to recover.
Um,

326
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,410
elaborative retrieval
refers to a finding that,

327
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,080
um, when you want to get
something back at a memory,

328
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,730
people tend to give up too soon.

329
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,930
It turns out that there's a lot
of stuff that's in your memory,

330
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,170
but it needs work to extract.

331
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,620
It needs various sort of
searching strategies. Um,

332
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,270
one study asks people,
um,

333
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,560
who were considerably older than you to
remember their high school classmates.

334
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,620
And in the first pass people are terrible.

335
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,450
Maybe they had a couple of friends they
kept in touch with otherwise pretty bad.

336
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,410
And this is a good experiment because
you could use high school yearbooks to

337
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:19,120
judge whether or not they get it right.

338
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,330
But then what you do is you tell the
person, look, keep trying. Um, where you,

339
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,930
what sort of, who is your teacher?
What sort of clubs that you belong to?

340
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,100
What sort of sports did you participate
in? How did you get to school?

341
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,930
How did you get from school? Um, what
did you do during lunch? What did you do?

342
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:41,610
Or during break. And You keep asking,
you know, have any friends whose letter,

343
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,470
whose last name began with B with C,
with D,

344
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,100
and you keep pushing and pushing and
pushing and over the span of time,

345
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:53,870
things come back again.
It's not true that you never forget.

346
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,130
There is honest to God, forget it.
But sometimes you think you forget as,

347
00:23:58,131 --> 00:23:59,540
because you haven't looked long enough.

348
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,830
There's a real physical notion of
searching for the right answer.

349
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,850
We've talked about retrieval.
Oh, every class I've given,

350
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,100
somebody asks either in class or by email.
What about Deja Vu?

351
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,710
And Deja Vu is a feeling that
an event has happened before.

352
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,810
So you're looking at me and I'm lecturing.
He said, I've heard this before. No,

353
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,980
I know this before you see somebody and
say, I've been in a situation before.

354
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,960
This is not evidence for psychic powers.
Um,

355
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,610
which many people say it is,

356
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,870
but nobody really knows why this exists.
We know,

357
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:44,780
and this is a clue.
It's worse with frontal lobe damage.

358
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,760
You get damaged as part of the brain.
You get a lot more deja Vu experiences.

359
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,980
I asked some experts in memory,
um, including Marsha Johnson,

360
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,030
who's chair of our department,
what the best explanation for Deja Vu is.

361
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:04,230
And the answer she gave the one
big theory goes like this. Um,

362
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,280
Deja Vu is a feeling
that has happened before.

363
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,860
The answer is it has happened before.
It's happened half a second ago.

364
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,800
And so what happens is
sometimes there's a glitch.

365
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,440
Yeah,

366
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,820
a disturbance in the force.

367
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:26,821
I don't know if there's a glitch and you
were talking and then something happens

368
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:29,530
to you and you put it in your memory.

369
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,430
But it's as if you don't put the stamp
on it of what time and what date.

370
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,140
So you're talking to me and
then you store it in memory,

371
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,500
but you don't store it in
memory as happening right now.

372
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,020
Then have a second goes by and
you're talking to me. He says,

373
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,790
this is strangely familiar

374
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,670
and that's one theory of what
goes on in Deja Vu. Okay.

375
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,020
So far. Does this sort of good news
remembering? But then there's bad news.

376
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,893
Forgetting

377
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,240
how many people can remember
without looking down at your notes.

378
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,270
At least two of the
numbers I gave you earlier.

379
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,660
Okay.

380
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,620
How many people can remember
at least four. Oh, impressive.

381
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,720
Um, if I asked you in an hour,
the number would go down.

382
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,160
These are sort of statistics in a similar
experiment in this graph illustrates

383
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:26,570
that people forget over time,
you'll forget.

384
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,310
Why do you forget? Why is
there forgetting at all? Well,

385
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:32,930
there's different explanations for this.

386
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,730
One explanation is your
brain is a physical thing.

387
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,810
It's a physical piece of meat and
a kind of goes bad physical decay.

388
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,470
And so the memory traces that are laid
onto your brain will just decay over time.

389
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,380
The second answer is interference.
So remember those numbers.

390
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,300
Here's a few more.
Hundred and 1480160640 two.

391
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,380
Well, the more information that comes
in at similar to stuff you're trying to

392
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:04,950
remember,

393
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,510
it blocks your recovery
of original information.

394
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,360
So your ability to remember something
can be impaired by learning more things

395
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:18,840
which are related to it because
they get confused in memory.

396
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,050
Finally, and maybe this is
most interesting, there are
changes in retrieval cues.

397
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,740
So the more time goes by,
the more the world changes.

398
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,600
And if your memory is to some extent
dependent on qs bringing it back to life,

399
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,770
then um,
the change in retrieval cues,

400
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,200
okay.

401
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,280
Can make it more difficult to,
um, to recall certain things.

402
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:48,790
This leads to a puzzle where there's
considerable scientific debate over the

403
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:51,110
case of Childhood Amnesia.

404
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,320
And the case of Childhood Amnesia is,
um,

405
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,370
it doesn't refer to when a child
gets brain damage. You Guys Amnesia,

406
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:04,100
whatever refers to is people have a
difficult time recovering very early

407
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:04,934
memories.

408
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,170
I want people to just take a second and
try to think back on what your first

409
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,550
memory is and roughly how old you were.

410
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,663
Okay.

411
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,140
How many people don't think you have a
first memory until you were about five

412
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:26,860
years old or older.

413
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,223
Okay.

414
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:35,060
How many people think you have a first
memory of around age four or younger?

415
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,700
How many people think you have a first
memory of around age three or younger?

416
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,810
Two or younger?

417
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,670
Yeah.

418
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,430
How many of you think you have a first
memory when you were about one years old

419
00:28:48,431 --> 00:28:49,264
or younger?

420
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,140
Okay.

421
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,340
And I'm not asking about past lives that,
that had happened last year.

422
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,110
Um, how, how, how old is your
roughly your first memory, you think

423
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,093
how old

424
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,900
between one and two.
Anybody think they can beat that

425
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,440
same guy?
Yep.

426
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,933
One.

427
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,823
Anybody else?

428
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,553
MMM.

429
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,040
The literature is unclear on this because
it's very difficult to test people's

430
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,500
recollections of their first memories.

431
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,610
If I'm to ask people about your first
memories, they'll often say, oh yeah,

432
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:37,170
I remember I was in this room and there
was a crib and I going to gag a Gugu

433
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,690
and, um, I was on a potty.
I was, I was walking,

434
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:48,550
I was so cute. I remember it.
It's very difficult to tell.

435
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,740
And as we'll discuss in some detail,

436
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,310
there are a lot of reasons
to distrust people when they,

437
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,360
not that they're lying, but to distress,
to accuracy of people's memories.

438
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,920
We also know from studies about trauma
where people have terrible experiences

439
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,140
when there are one or two. Typically this
trauma is not men remembered later on.

440
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,320
People know of trauma because
you're told about it. Um,

441
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,660
but they don't typically remember
with any accuracy. Even children,

442
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,690
older children don't remember
back beyond that age.

443
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,700
Nobody knows why Childhood Amnesia occurs.
Nobody knows why.

444
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:31,750
It's very difficult to recover
memories before about the age of three.

445
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,200
One theory is that the
retrieval cues change radically.

446
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,360
I had a friend of mine who's a clinical
psychologist and he suggested a new form

447
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:44,680
of therapy where they make these giant
tables and chairs and then they bring you

448
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:48,670
into the office and you're standing at
the giant tables and chairs and all these

449
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:53,580
memories of being a baby would
come flooding back. And uh, he,

450
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:57,360
he dropped out at the
field. And really, um,

451
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:02,170
but it's such a cool idea. Um, some
people think language is to blame.

452
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,740
So a child,

453
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:09,370
a baby starts out with no
spoken or sign language.

454
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:13,030
Language comes to be learned
at around one, two and three.

455
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:18,180
And it might be that the learning of a
language reformat your memory and once

456
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:19,840
the memory is reformatted,

457
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:23,680
it can't go back to the previous
state prior to language.

458
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,470
In the end, it could be neuro maturation.
It could be that there's memory,

459
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:34,471
parts of the brains grow around age two
or three that just weren't there prior

460
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:38,790
to that and nobody really knows.
It's a,

461
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,660
it's a fascinating research area.

462
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,230
Why about memory changes early on?

463
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,850
Another case of memory
failure is brain damage

464
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,750
and brain damage comes in.
A couple of flavors.

465
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,980
There is retrograde Amnesia Retro for
past Retrograde Amnesia is when you lose

466
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:02,110
some memory of the past.

467
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,950
This could be in a case where you get
some sort of head trauma and you lose

468
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,020
memory of your entire episodic memory,

469
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,780
but typically if you have any sort of
serious accident involves you losing

470
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:14,620
consciousness,

471
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,930
you'll have a blackout of some period
prior to that say bloated ahead.

472
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,350
And the reason for this is as you're
having these experiences now they need to

473
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:29,260
kind of get,
get consolidated into your brain.

474
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,480
The brain needs to rewire and catch up
to the experiences you're having a sudden

475
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,860
bloated ahead,

476
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,160
we'll knock you unconscious and then
the memories have happened immediately

477
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:43,430
prior. Well not get consolidated
and there'll be lost forever.

478
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,290
Another sort of memory is
anterior grade amnesia.

479
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,160
And this was the case of this
happens and causes a cough syndrome.

480
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,640
It happens to a very famous patient known
as h m who actually lives in Hartford,

481
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,480
Connecticut.
Um,

482
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,190
and it happened to Clive wearing
the film you saw last class.

483
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,850
And this as heard of Amnesia is a sort
of Amnesia where you lose the abilities

484
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,050
to form new memories.
And so you live in a perpetual present,

485
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,540
unable to accumulate new memories,

486
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,250
but it's actually a little bit
more complicated than that.

487
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,410
What happens is,

488
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,800
and this was an exciting discovery about
these patients that led to some real

489
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,420
insights about normal memory.
What happens is,

490
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:34,480
and this is the brain
damage in these cases,

491
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,660
the temporal lobe and the hippocampus,
very useful for spatial memory.

492
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:43,661
You'll know when discovery made about
people who couldn't form new memories is

493
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,870
that they could form new memories.
But if certain types,

494
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,890
so for example, this is a
task care involving, um,

495
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,570
filling in a star while looking into
a mirror. And if I asked you to do,

496
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,950
you'd find it pretty difficult.
It's just kind of difficult to do.

497
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,690
You'd be clumsy at it.

498
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,880
You bring in an amnesic who can't
form new memories and you say, Hey,

499
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,530
I want you to try something new. I want
you to try this star game. Say, okay,

500
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:15,830
I've never seen it before, but I'll
do it. Tries it does very badly.

501
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,530
You bring him in over and over again.

502
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:24,110
Each time he does it,
he starts off by saying,

503
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,870
I've never seen this before.
I'll, I'm sure I'll give it a try.

504
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,660
But he gets better and better at it.

505
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,570
And this is known as implicit memory.

506
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,730
The claim is that in these sorts of cases,

507
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,340
you lose the abilities to form explicit
conscious memories that you're aware of,

508
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,360
that you understand,

509
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,100
but some sorts of memories persist
and you are able to form them.

510
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,913
Um,

511
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:55,460
this is actually been illustrated
in a couple of dramatic movies.

512
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,380
One of them are very bad
dramatic movie. Um, where, uh,

513
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:04,970
drew Barrymore loses the ability to form
new memories and somehow falls in love

514
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:09,500
with Adam Sandler.
Definitely don't watch that,

515
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,910
but a very good movie called Memento,

516
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,480
which is about a character who loses
his ability to form new memories.

517
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:24,350
While trying to track down his
wife's killer memento is a movie,

518
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:28,580
which is fascinating because it's told
backwards. But through my mentors,

519
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,410
it's another story told forwards.

520
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,760
And I like this story because it very
dramatically illustrates what does and

521
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:38,570
what what is and is not
impaired in, um, in,

522
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,650
in cases of severe memory damage.

523
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,970
So I'm going to show you a couple of clips
that illustrate the dissociation from

524
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,863
Momento.

525
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,920
Those have you seen the movie knows,

526
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,130
know that this ends up quite
tragically for Sammy. Um,

527
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,270
you recommend a movie.
We've,

528
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,390
we've dealt right now with two
sorts of failures of memory.

529
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,410
One is every day failure
of memory when you forget.

530
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,470
How many of you remember three are more
of the numbers I originally presented?

531
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,810
Yeah,
go ahead.

532
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,200
1459, 11. Is that right?

533
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,493
Fine.

534
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,720
I'm going to ask you again in a month.
Um,

535
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,640
well people are supposed to forget. Um,
and some things will, you will forget.

536
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,270
That's normal.

537
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:46,270
Forgetting a second case is I'm forgetting
due to brain damage for getting due

538
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:51,020
to brain damage is exotic and unusual.
Um,

539
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,580
but it's interesting and that illustrates
some of the more general themes about

540
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,050
how the mind works.
Remember,

541
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:02,051
one theme of this course is we're going
to look at exotic cases like the case of

542
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:03,990
Clive wearing,
um,

543
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,790
not just because they're
interesting in their own rights,

544
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,070
but sometimes by looking at the extremes,

545
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,190
we can learn something about
how normal people's normal,

546
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:15,290
intact minds and brains work.

547
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,830
The third case of forgetting is
more interesting and it actually,

548
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,053
well,

549
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,950
I want to do a little trial here.

550
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,230
What I want to do is I want you
to hit listen to three children.

551
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,330
Describe an event that happened.

552
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,560
I want you to come to some your own gas.

553
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:43,880
Imagine you were a judge,
you were a child care worker.

554
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:47,360
You want it to be, I want you
to do become to your own guests.

555
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,610
But who you believe and
what you think happened.

556
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,600
You've heard three children.
Who Do you believe?

557
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,700
Who believes? There's three of them? One,
two, three. Who believes the first one?

558
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,780
Yeah.

559
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,180
Who believes? The second one?
Who believes the third one?

560
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,530
Sort of an even split.

561
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,853
MMM.

562
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,760
2100 experts were shown
these films and asked, um,

563
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,190
about the different actions,

564
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,910
whether or not the person ripped
the book messed up the bear,

565
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:32,330
tossed the book in the air.
Um, and as you can see,

566
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:36,910
the majority thought that they did.
Um,

567
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,520
this is, uh, work done

568
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,500
by a Steve CC who was gracious enough to,
um,

569
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,260
to lend me the film to
use for teaching purposes.

570
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,760
It turns out the second girl was right.
Absolutely nothing happened.

571
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,090
Um, the teacher said there's
somebody named Sam Stone.

572
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:02,740
He's going to come in.
Guy Walks in, says hi,

573
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,140
walks around and leaves

574
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,310
the first and third children had
their memories implanted. Um,

575
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,430
not through any sort of science fiction
means they had their memories implanted.

576
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,670
Well,
they had memories implanted it like this.

577
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,370
Some of the children were just ask
questions. The interviewer, by the way,

578
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,860
was herself unaware of what happened.

579
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,940
So the interview was a
perfectly naive interviewer. Um,

580
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,720
and it turns out if you just interview
children and you ask them questions about

581
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,270
whether the book was ripped, did
you see him? Did he really do it?

582
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,910
They don't say anything. They didn't
see anything and he won't say anything.

583
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,380
Other children were told about Sam stone.

584
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,820
They were told a
stereotype about Sam stone,

585
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,850
that he's very clumsy and he tends to
rip things and he trips and he breaks

586
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,520
things and he spills things.
And in fact,

587
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:02,150
the third child mentioned that in
passing. He said he always does that. Um,

588
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,440
just knowing this about Sam stone tends
to raise the proportion of kids who say

589
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:10,480
for instance,
that he ripped the book.

590
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,540
Other children were given suggestions.
They were given suggestive questioning.

591
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,880
They were, um, a series of
leading questions like, oh,

592
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,730
Sam stone came in,
did he rip a book while he was there?

593
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,370
And still more children got both.
And in fact,

594
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:33,310
the children he used saw
were from this group.

595
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,330
They heard Sam stone being described as
a clumsy fellow and they were given a

596
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:40,060
series of suggestive
questionings in this condition.

597
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,830
They were given several
suggestive questionings over
a period of several months.

598
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,290
These children, like the first
child, the third child are not lying.

599
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:56,590
They honestly believe that Sam
stone came in and did these things.

600
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:02,730
Also they believe it and they're so
convincing in their belief that experts,

601
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:07,801
including police officers and child
caseworkers and judges and lawyers find

602
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,010
these children to be extremely believable.

603
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,060
And I think they probably find them
to be extremely believable because the

604
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:20,590
children are not blind. They really
believe they saw what they saw.

605
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,190
But these memories were an implanted and
cc and many other investigators study

606
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:32,310
how memories can be implanted in people's
minds through suggestion and through

607
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,940
leading questions.

608
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:40,330
It turns out that the same
sort of experiment and same
sort of research has been

609
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:45,701
done with considerable success in an
planting false memories in adults.

610
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,333
Um,

611
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,410
there are dramatic cases of
people remembering terrible
crimes and confessing to

612
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:56,270
them when actually they
didn't commit them.

613
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,430
And this is not because,
um,

614
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,510
they are lying is not even because
they're in some obvious sense the range or

615
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:10,511
schizophrenia or delusional rather they
have persuaded themselves are more often

616
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,100
been persuaded by others that these
things have actually happened.

617
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,020
Psychologists have studied in the
laboratory how one could do this,

618
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,320
how one can implant memories
in other people. Um,

619
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,150
and some things are sort of standard.

620
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Suppose I was to tell you a story about
a trip I took to the dentist or a visit

621
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:38,360
I took to our time when I ate out at
a restaurant and I'm to omit certain

622
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:42,980
details like I omit the fact that I
paid the bill in a restaurant. Say, oh,

623
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,780
I finished a meal and then I went home.

624
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,380
Still you'll tend to fill in the blanks.

625
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,710
You'll tend to fill in the
blanks with things you know.

626
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,030
So you might remember this later saying,
Oh yeah, he told me he finished eating,

627
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,750
paid the bill and left cause paying
the bills. What you do in a restaurant,

628
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,740
this is benign and enough if
you fill in the blanks, um,

629
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,660
you also

630
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,910
can integrate suppositions made by others.

631
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,780
And the clearest case of this
is eye witness testimony.

632
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,430
And the best research on this has been
done by Elizabeth Loftus who has an a

633
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,600
series of studies,

634
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:25,601
some discussed in a textbook showing
how people's memories can be swayed by

635
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:29,930
leading questions.
And it can be extremely subtle.

636
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,880
In one experiment,

637
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,080
the person was just asked in the course
of a series of questions shown a scene

638
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:43,601
where there's a car accident and as either
did you see a broken headlight or did

639
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:48,420
you see the broken headlight?
The,

640
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:53,060
the pre supposes there was a
broken headlight and in fact,

641
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,500
the people told as did you see the broken
headlight later on are more likely to

642
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,930
remember? One, it creates an
image and they fill it in. Um,

643
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,560
in another study, uh, she would
show film segments and then ask,

644
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,080
did you see the children getting on a
school bus? Now there was no school bus,

645
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,590
but people who hear that
question later on when asked,

646
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:18,710
did you see a school bus in the
film are more likely to say yes.

647
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,000
In another study,

648
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,420
she would show people film segments and
asked them either how fast were the cars

649
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:28,130
going when they hit each other,

650
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,110
or how fast were the cars going
when they smashed into each other.

651
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,200
A week later, she bring people
back into the laboratory and ask,

652
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,850
did you see any broken glass?

653
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,670
Those who hear smash tend to see the
broken glass more than those who hear hit

654
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,340
because the question has
changed their memory.

655
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,360
Making it more of a dramatic event
have knows us as the clearest case.

656
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:03,420
Where, um, where does the sort
of reconstructive effort led by,

657
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:08,400
um, led as a result of
leading and probing questions?

658
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,513
Um,

659
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,370
some of you are readily hypnotizable
and you can be hypnotized.

660
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,630
And what we would learn
about a past event, um,

661
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,540
from hypnotizing you will not
necessarily been be inaccurate.

662
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:26,340
What hypnotizing does is it makes
people very willing to cooperate. Um,

663
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,410
unfortunately it isn't as if there's a
memory storage there where you could just

664
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:33,930
go through and look as in the
movies where you just say,

665
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,060
what's the license plate?
The person is hypnotized.

666
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,540
And then the flashback comes in in
the zoom in on the license plate.

667
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,220
Memory doesn't work that way.

668
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,380
What happens is what somebody will do in
hypnotizable status that we very eager

669
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,300
to please the hypnotist.

670
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,480
And so it will make stuff up and people
under hypnosis just make stuff up and

671
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:56,560
they do very enthusiastically,
um,

672
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,430
and very believably make stuff up.

673
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,220
This is particularly the case
with hypnotic regression.

674
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,420
When we ask you to go back to your
sixth birthday party for instance,

675
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,440
and what's great as a developmental
psychologist is if I ask you to go back to

676
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:13,350
your fourth birthday party
and you're hypnotizable,

677
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,840
you'll be all just like a four year old,

678
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,930
except you won't be like
a real four year old.

679
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,380
Where you'll be like is an adult's notion
of what a four year old is supposed to

680
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:25,290
be. Um, in fact,

681
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:28,680
this has happened in the extreme case
with hypnotic regression where people

682
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:33,090
claim to speak a language is like from,
from ancient Egypt.

683
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,110
And linguists love these studies
because then you don't, of course,

684
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:40,410
you don't really sound like
you're speaking a language
from ancient Egypt where

685
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,090
you sound is uh,

686
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:47,050
like a North American who believes he's
speaking a language from ancient Egypt

687
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,480
over right there.
I got her for that.

688
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,980
And so what it makes you is it hidden.
It is and brings out the actor in you.

689
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,750
It makes you want to give a
persuasive account of what happened.

690
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:07,010
And so hypnotism is just an extreme form
of what normally happens in eyewitness

691
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,520
testimony.
Repressed memories.

692
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:13,560
We could devote a class,

693
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:18,561
we could devote a semester to the very
heated debate in the United States,

694
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,030
mostly about repressed memories.

695
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,540
There are many adults who have claimed
to have experienced traumatic sexual

696
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:31,270
abuse. Um, in some cases,

697
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:33,370
this is unexceptional from
a memory point of view.

698
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,490
People know this happened to them.
They've always known it happens to them,

699
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,110
and then they tell people about it.

700
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,890
But there's a subset of cases where
people have had no memory up to a point of

701
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:49,360
what happened to them. Then they go
to a psychologist or a psychiatrist,

702
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,040
they undergo questioning,
um,

703
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,300
often using hypnotic techniques and then
they recover a memory of past traumatic

704
00:47:58,181 --> 00:48:00,130
sexual abuse.
And what,

705
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:04,300
this is what makes us so debatable
and there is a debate about this.

706
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,520
I don't want to try to
preclude it one way or another.

707
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,990
What makes us debatable is
some psychologists believe
that at least some cases

708
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:15,240
these memories are real and they have
been repressed through a Freud he and

709
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,450
mechanism that there are two terrible to
bring to consciousness and the therapy

710
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:21,160
brings them out into real life.

711
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,780
But most psychologists believe that
these memories could not be trusted,

712
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,320
that these memories are created
through the actions of the therapists.

713
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,583
Um,

714
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,160
and so there's actually a considerable
psychological and legal battles over the

715
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:42,780
voracity of the therapist where women
who have claimed to have sexual be

716
00:48:42,781 --> 00:48:44,020
sexually abused for instance,

717
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,370
have press criminal charges against her
father's on the basis of false memories.

718
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,323
Similarly,

719
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,020
people who have been accused of sexual
abuse have press criminal charges against

720
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:58,030
psychiatry address claiming that these
psychiatrists have implanted the memories

721
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,100
into their sons and daughters.

722
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,450
It is controversial whether
memories are ever repressed.

723
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:09,630
What isn't controversial is that for at
least some cases you can implant false

724
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:13,990
memories in people.
Not because you're a sinister evil person,

725
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,400
but because you really believe something
happened and you talk to them about it

726
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,980
and then you cause these
memories to come into being

727
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,320
a final case is flashbulb memories.
I asked us early in the semester,

728
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:27,220
I'll ask it again.

729
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,320
How many of you remember where
you were in September 11th, 2001

730
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,690
there anybody who doesn't remember
where they were in September 11th,

731
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,920
2001 it would be interesting because
it's socially relevant event.

732
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:47,200
Um, but here's the problem
with these flashbulb memories.

733
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:51,280
Flashbulb memories aren't idea that these
memories being so vivid and they are

734
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:55,990
vivid for many of us. Exactly
where we stood, what happened. Um,

735
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,290
well they can't really be
trusted and here's why.

736
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:03,760
Not because they're such important events.

737
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,080
I bet many of you have actually
heard the question before,

738
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,620
where were you on September
11th and talked about it.

739
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:16,570
What happens in these
conversations is stories change.

740
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,090
I have my event, I knew where
I was on September 11th,
my wife knew where she was,

741
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,710
but I spent as much time listening to
her talk about it as I spent time me

742
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:27,710
talking about it.

743
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,890
And now maybe my memory is actually
of her experience and not mine.

744
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,460
It's not for all of these cases.

745
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:39,350
The temptation you have
to resist is saying, yes,

746
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,190
I know memories can be swayed.
I know they could be distorted everything,

747
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,730
but you see,
I really am sure that happened.

748
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,530
You have to resist that temptation
because there are so many cases we know,

749
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,790
including the tape of the girls that we
just saw where people aren't entirely

750
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:59,270
sure things happen and we know
full well that they didn't exist.

751
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:04,510
Being sure is no guarantee that a
memory isn't false reconstructed or even

752
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:10,400
implanted. So this part of
memory has three made morals.

753
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,270
There are many types of memories.
I talked about short term memory,

754
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:19,160
long term memory. I talked about
implicit memory and explicit memory. Um,

755
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,200
these are sort of
separable sort of memories.

756
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:23,300
You could break one while
having the other one impaired.

757
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,930
Arguably there assist rain systems.
Um,

758
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,830
dedicated to memory for faces,
memory for everyday objects,

759
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:33,950
memory for spatial locations.
Um,

760
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,840
the key to remembering his
organization and understanding

761
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,360
introduction,

762
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,160
introduction to x courses
including introduction to
psychology courses are among

763
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,750
the hardest courses at Yale.

764
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,280
And the reason why is there's
just a lot of material, um,

765
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,100
that that is diverse and you have
to command each aspects separately.

766
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,840
The easiest courses at Yale tend to be
high Falutin seminars where you kind of

767
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:05,780
have enough of a background that
everything is going to be clear and

768
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:09,350
understandable. Um, the more
you understand something,

769
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,360
the easy or easier you'll remember it.

770
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,500
And finally you can't trust
some of your memories.

771
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,580
Um,
your reading response for this week

772
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:26,210
is, um, you have to use your
powers for good and not for evil.

773
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:31,220
Um, though, if you managed to succeed
at this, I will be very impressed.

774
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:33,950
But you have to,

775
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:38,000
you have to describe it based on the
lecture materials and the readings,

776
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,760
how to implant a false memory.

777
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,613
MMM.

778
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,980
We have a few minutes. Any,
any questions on memory?

779
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,310
Yes.
You play music.

780
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,033
Hey,
please.

781
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,260
Yeah.
Is that like

782
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,920
the example is, what sort of memory is
it when you know how to play the piano?

783
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,660
It's a very good question.

784
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:21,570
It is long term memory because you might
know how to do a concerto or a song and

785
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:24,000
if you have it stored in your head,
you carry it around with you.

786
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,110
You'll remember it a from now two
years from now. It is longterm memory,

787
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:33,120
but it is also an excellent example of
implicit memory because you know how to

788
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:36,570
do it. But, but you could do it
unconsciously. You Vet attendings,

789
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:38,040
it's as it's not century,

790
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:42,630
but it's as if put a crudely that
your fingers now and not your mind.

791
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,650
We have time for one more question.
Yes.

792
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,340
The question is about photographic memory.
Um,

793
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,200
there are a lot of claims
about photographic memory.

794
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,460
My understanding is they do
not tend to be substantiated.

795
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,100
Sometimes photographic memory,

796
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,450
and this came up when we talked about
autism a few classes ago is linked with

797
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,650
savant like skills.

798
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:12,000
People have severe impairments in some
ways may have photographic memories in

799
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:12,834
others.

800
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:17,790
I am not convinced that photographic
memory in a sense that you see something,

801
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,320
you take a picture of it, you
hold in memory really exists. Um,

802
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:26,640
I think there may be one or two case
studies that suggested might be real,

803
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,740
but I think it's controversial. Okay. Um,

804
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,770
we have a guest lecture on
Wednesday. Uh, Dean Peter Salivate.

805
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,700
We'll talk to us about love.
