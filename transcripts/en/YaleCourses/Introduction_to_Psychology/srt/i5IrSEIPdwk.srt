1
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,190
What we're doing today is
continuing on the theme of emotions.

2
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,980
Emotions is a two part lecture.
Um,

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,470
and we're continuing along certain themes.

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,860
I want to begin by responding
to a question which was
raised in the last class

5
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,850
concerning smiling in nonhuman primates.
It was a very good question.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,610
The issue was,
um,

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,480
we know that humans have different sorts
of smiles to convey different sorts of

8
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,010
information.
The question was,

9
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:46,011
do nonhuman primates like chimpanzees or
gorillas or Gibbons have the same many

10
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:47,490
sorts of smiles?

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,140
So I contacted the world's expert on
smiling who did not return my emails.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,820
So I contacted the second world's
expert on smiling who, um,

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,610
who told me that answer's no, that, um,

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,760
that primate nonhuman primates smiles
actually correspond almost entirely to

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,180
appeasement smiles there.
Don't hurt me. Smiles. Um,

16
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,560
they're equivalent to the Koi
smile that we saw in humans. Um,

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,550
but that nonhuman primates do
not use smiles for greetings.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,000
There's no equivalent of the greeting,
smile or Pan Am smile,

19
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,090
nor do they use them as genuine
expressions of happiness.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,930
There's no equivalent to the Duchenne
smile. So that's as far as I know.

21
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:31,040
If the world's expert gets back to
me and says something different, um,

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,340
I'll keep you posted. Uh, another thing,

23
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,700
going back to the beginning
theme of the class, um,

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,120
w what we started just to review,

25
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,750
we talked about the different functions
of emotions and then we talked about

26
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,540
smiling and facial expressions and then
we turned to some nut to a nonsocial

27
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,420
motion,
the case of fear.

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,780
And then we shifted to social emotions
and we talked about social emotions

29
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:56,781
towards kin and a special evolutionary
reasons that would lead them to evolve.

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,620
Um, and as we were ending,
we were talking about, um,

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,310
about the relationship between
an animal and its children,

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,910
particularly in cases like humans and
birds and mammals where there tends to be

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,160
a close relationship with our trailer.
We invest in quality, not quantity. Um,

34
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,300
I might produce very few
children in my life, uh,

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,360
and my evolutionary trick then is to
focus very intently on them and make sure

36
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:31,350
they survive. If I were to produce a 100
children, I could stand to lose a few.

37
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,190
But if I just produced five
in my lifetime or two or one,

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,730
they become very precious
to me. And so, um,

39
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,330
the story of the evolution of species
like us involves a long period of

40
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:47,280
dependence and deep, deep bonds
between the parent and the child.

41
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,610
And that's part of what I talked
about how parents respond to children.

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,800
And I want to begin this class by,
by giving a,

43
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:57,960
an illustration from a documentary
about parental response to children.

44
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,700
But I want to give it a
species that's not us.

45
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,650
And here's why.
I'll explain why with an analogy.

46
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,520
I have a friend of mine who
studies the psychology of religion.

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,190
You studies why people
hold religious beliefs.

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,460
And he tells me that when he's
talking to a non specialist,

49
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:20,560
somebody not in the field, he
doesn't ever tell them. Yeah,

50
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:25,561
I'm really interested in
why people believe in the
Bible or why people light the

51
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,840
candles on Sabbath are
why people go to church.

52
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,170
Cause these are religions
that people around here hold.

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,680
And if you tell people you study them,
belts would be puzzled.

54
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,220
Why would you want to study
something like that or a or offended?

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,480
If you want to talk about the psychology
of religion to an audience like this,

56
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,550
what you do is you start with the exotic.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,570
So you start by talking about people
who um, who put butter under heads.

58
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,620
There's a Dan Sperber talks
about a culture where the
men put butter under heads

59
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:56,560
in the summer and a kind of melts and
that's part of one of the things that they

60
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,510
do. Or do you talk about, um,

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,710
about a culture that believes in
spirits or that trees can talk.

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,440
You say you're setting, they
say, oh, that's interesting.

63
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,090
I wonder why they believe that.

64
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,500
And you use that as a way
to look at more general, uh,

65
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,700
facts that exist even in our culture.
You use the fact that,

66
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,740
that we don't take the exotic for granted
as a way to motivate the scientific

67
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,120
study of things we do take for granted.

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,520
And this is of course true more generally.

69
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:28,360
This was the point in the William James
quote when he talked about things that

70
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:32,590
are natural to us and notice that some
very odd things are equally natural to

71
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,630
other species.
And it's true,

72
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:38,020
I think in particular when we talk about
things like the love we have for our

73
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,410
children.
Um,

74
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,570
so one way to look at the love we have
for our children scientifically isn't to

75
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:47,590
look at it head on because the love we
feel towards their own children feel

76
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:51,040
sacred if feel special,
but look at it in other species.

77
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,750
And so one of the nicest illustrations
of this is to emperors a penguin,

78
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,390
um, which was, uh, which,

79
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,490
whose childcare and mating practices were
dramatized in a wonderful movie called

80
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,880
March of the penguins. Um, and um,

81
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,780
this is interesting because they had
this incredibly elaborate and quite

82
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:14,680
precarious system of generating
and taking care of offspring.

83
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,700
So I want to show you a brief clip of the
movie to illustrate some parts of this.

84
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,940
Um, what they do at the beginning, which
is not, which leads up to this is, um,

85
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,310
they take a very long trek from the
water to their breeding grounds.

86
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,410
Their breeding grounds is protect our,

87
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:33,100
protected from the wind and are on a
firm piece of ice so they could hold a

88
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:37,780
whole pack. They do the breeding there
and it's there that the eggs are created.

89
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,410
So this is where, um, the
movie begins at this point.

90
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,510
March of the penguins was the second best,

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,270
second most popular
documentary of all time, um,

92
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,460
beaten only by Fahrenheit
nine, 11. And, um,

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,220
and people responded to it in
different ways, which are informative.

94
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,380
When we think about the
generalizations you can make, uh,

95
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,110
from animal behavior to human behavior.

96
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,410
Some conservative commentators saw this
as a celebration of family values such

97
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,030
as love and trust and monogamy.
Um,

98
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,780
some liberals who hate everything
that's good and true, uh,

99
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,690
responded, responded by saying, well, yet,
or monogamous for one breeding season,

100
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,310
it's a year. Then they go and find another
mate. You add it up. It's pretty slutty.

101
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,473
Um,

102
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,340
I think more to the point,

103
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:39,341
people were impressed and stunned by
the rich and articulate and systematic

104
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:42,950
behavior that these animals
were showing plainly.

105
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:47,060
They didn't pick it up from
television, movies, culture,
learning, schooling. So on,

106
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:51,380
to some extent this sort of complicated
behavior came natural to them.

107
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,510
And it's understandable that some
proponents of intelligent design or

108
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,690
creationism pointed to
this as an example of,

109
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,960
of how God creates things that are deeply,

110
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,970
richly intricate so as to perpetrate
the survival of different animals.

111
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,890
From a Darwinian standpoint.
Either Darwinian would
agree with the creationist.

112
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,910
It is, couldn't have happened by accident.
This is just far too complicated,

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,800
but would appeal to the,
um,

114
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,840
to this as an exquisite example of a
biological adaptation in particular,

115
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,020
a biological adaptation regarding parental
care to children shaped by the fact

116
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,450
that children share the parents' genes.

117
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,930
And so parents will evolve in ways
that perpetrate the survival of their

118
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,720
children.
Then there's the other direction,

119
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,940
which is how children
respond to parents, how, um,

120
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,920
how the young ones are wired
up to resonate and respond
in different ways to the

121
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,450
adults around them.

122
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,940
And we quickly talked about about
some different theories of this. Um,

123
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,470
and I'll just review what we
talked about last class. Um,

124
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,300
babies will develop an
attachment to whoever's closest.

125
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,280
They'll usually prefer their mothers
because their mothers are typically those

126
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:15,120
who are closest to them to prefer
her voice, her face, her smell. Um,

127
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,340
it used to be thought that there's some
sort of magical moment of imprinting

128
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,080
that when the baby is born, the baby
must see his or her mother and boom,

129
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:26,900
a connection is made.
If the baby doesn't terrible,

130
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:30,050
things will happen with attachment
later on. This is silly.

131
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,580
There's no reason to believe there's some
special moment or special five minutes

132
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,730
or special hour.
It's just in the fullness of time,

133
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,170
babies will look up an attachment
to the animal that's closest to it.

134
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:45,440
They will recognize it as at a,
at an implicit level,

135
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:50,240
at an unconscious level as their
kin. Well, how does this work?

136
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,450
How does the baby's brain develop come
to develop an emotional attachment to,

137
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,540
to that creature?
Well,

138
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,630
you remember from Skinner that operant
conditioning could provide a good answer

139
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,670
to this. And this is a known
as the cupboard theory,

140
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,990
which is babies love their moms
because the moms provide food.

141
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,620
So law of effect is
operating conditioning. Um,

142
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,030
they will approach their mothers to get
the food from them and they will develop

143
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,700
an attachment because
their mother provides food.

144
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,930
And this is contrasted
with a more nativist,

145
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,350
hardwired theory developed by a Bowlby,

146
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,050
which claims that there's
two things going on.

147
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,440
There is a drawn to mum for comfort
and social interaction and afraid of

148
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,614
strangers.

149
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,370
Now in the real world it's difficult to
pull apart these two means of attraction

150
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,780
because the very same woman
who's giving you comfort and um,

151
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,620
and social interaction because
also the one giving you milk,

152
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,190
but in the laboratory
you can pull them apart.

153
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,760
And that's what Henry Harlow did
in the movies you saw last week.

154
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,540
So Harlow exposed primates
to two different mothers.

155
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,280
One is a wire mother that's a Skinnerian
mother, that's a mother who gave food,

156
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,650
the other's a cloth mother set up
so that she'd be comfortable and,

157
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:18,420
and give warmth and cuddling. And the
question is, which one do babies go for?

158
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,260
And as you can remember from the movies,
the results are fairly decisive.

159
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,990
Babies go to the wire,
mother, uh, to eat. Yes.

160
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,430
As one of the characters
said you got to eat to live.

161
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,960
But they viewed the day
they loved the cloth mother.

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,940
They develop an attachment to the warm
cuddly mother that that's the one they

163
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,710
use as a base.
When they were threatened,

164
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,650
that's the one they use as a
base from which to explore.

165
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,940
Okay. And that actually,
oh, that's just a picture.

166
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,590
Um, and that actually takes me
to the, Oh, except for one thing,

167
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,660
it almost takes me to the end of the
question of our emotions towards Ken.

168
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,370
Um, one question you could ask is
what if there's no contact at all?

169
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,780
Now you could imagine that the effects
of how a lot of people are interested in

170
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:19,941
the question of the effects of the child's
early relationship to adults around

171
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:24,360
him or her and how the
child turns out later.

172
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,970
This becomes hugely relevant for
social debates like daycare. So,

173
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,720
for instance, a lot of psychologists
are interested in the question,

174
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,470
is it better for a child
to be raised by a parent,

175
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,060
usually a mother,

176
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,560
or does it make a difference
if the child goes to daycare?

177
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,020
What if a child goes to
daycare at six months?

178
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,130
What if child goes to daycare at two
years? How does this affect the child?

179
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,940
The short answer,
nobody really knows.

180
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:59,140
There's a lot of debate over whether or
not there's subtle differences and it's

181
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:03,640
deeply controversial. But we do know
that it doesn't make a big difference.

182
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,690
We do know that, that if, um,

183
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,430
if you got raised by mom or perhaps mum
and dad or maybe just dad all through

184
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,740
your life until going up for school and I,

185
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:19,290
my parents threw me in a
daycare at a three months, um,

186
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,200
it's not gonna make a big difference for
us. Maybe a subtle difference though.

187
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,290
It's not clear which way it would go,
but it won't make a big difference.

188
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,370
But what if there's no
contact at all? What if, um,

189
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,410
what about terrible circumstances
where people get no cloth mother,

190
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,170
they get nobody for attachment.

191
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,060
This is a really, in the
real world, of course,

192
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,600
you can't do experiments on this.
And in the real world with humans,

193
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,020
this only happens in tragic cases.
Um,

194
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,470
but this has been studied. Um, so,

195
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,810
so Harlow again,
raise monkeys and solitary confinement.

196
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,970
So they were, they were, um,

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,030
race and steel cages with only
a wire mother. In other words,

198
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,930
they got older nutrition they needed,
but they got no mothering.

199
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,720
It turned out that,
um,

200
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,780
that you kind of get monkey psychotics,
um,

201
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,630
they're withdrawn, they don't
play, they bite themselves.

202
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,770
Um, they're incompetent
sexually. They're in socially,

203
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,610
they're incompetent. Maternally
in one case, one of these monkeys,

204
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:35,500
race and college, Harry confinement was
artificially inseminated. Um, when she,

205
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,810
um, when she had a child, she, um,

206
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,030
banged his head on the floor
and in bid it to death.

207
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,800
So you need to be,
you need this shows.

208
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:49,801
This is kind of a stark demonstration
that some early connections,

209
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:54,940
some early attachment is critical
for the developing of a primate.

210
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,750
Um, obviously you don't do
these experiments with people,

211
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,530
but there are natural experiments.
Um,

212
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,160
humans raised in harsh orphanages
with little social contact.

213
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,180
And, um, and these children, Dave,
if the, if the, in other words,

214
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:14,920
they get fed barely, but nobody
picks them up and cuddles them. Um,

215
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,010
these children, if this
happens for long enough, um,

216
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,020
they ended up with severe problems with
social and emotional development. Um,

217
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,110
from an emotional point of view.
They're often insatiable.

218
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,040
Like they really need cuddling
and support or they're apathetic.

219
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,400
They don't care at all.
Now there's some sort of good news,

220
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,000
which is if you get these people
or these monkeys early enough, um,

221
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,840
you can reverse the effects
of this bad development.

222
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,510
So there's some research done
with monkey therapists. So anyway,

223
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,130
they do is they take the monkey,
they raised in a steel cage to monkey,

224
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,170
comes out the monkeys kind of psycho,

225
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,780
and then they send in a younger
monkey who's just goofing around,

226
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,450
jumping all around the place
and, and, and everything.

227
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,690
And experience with this younger monkey
who just follows him around and cleaning

228
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,820
to them, um, leads to gradual improvement.

229
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,060
It makes the solitary
monkey become better. Um,

230
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,240
there might be a similar
effect with human.

231
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:16,241
So one story more about of an anecdote
than an experiment was this situation

232
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:20,480
where at the age of one and a half
a children were taken away, um,

233
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,110
from a really harsh orphanage where he
had no contact and brought into a home

234
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:28,880
for mentally retarded
women are these women,

235
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:33,680
gave them plenty of contact and cuddling
and apparently from what we know

236
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,970
brought them back to normal.

237
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:36,980
Yeah.

238
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,480
And this is all I want to talk about,

239
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,530
about the emotions we feel towards our
kin to protect children and towards their

240
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:45,350
parents. Um, any questions or thoughts?

241
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,550
Yes.
Children in pretty chilly.

242
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,800
Um, it's a good question. Do Children
orphanages comfort each other? Um,

243
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,460
I don't know.
The situation probably wouldn't be there.

244
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,270
The problem is children in orphanages
who are in these terrible situation,

245
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:14,020
that'd be babies and very young and
they wouldn't be thrown together in

246
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,880
situations where they
could comfort each other.

247
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,890
It's a really interesting question.

248
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,300
What if it was a situation where children
were raised without a support of cloth?

249
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:24,730
Mother adol they'll be able
to pick them up and hold them,

250
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,330
but they could play amongst
themselves and support each other.

251
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,790
I don't know the answer to that.

252
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,530
Yes. Yes. Is there evidence on that? Yes.

253
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,013
Yes.

254
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,830
Um, bands or is there is evidence
as it, as everybody knows

255
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,781
that I'm,

256
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:49,781
that this sort of amongst the young
support can actually help the monkey in a

257
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:51,254
told me,

258
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,620
somebody else had a question here.
Yes.

259
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,310
So what does that tell
us about the middle of

260
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,500
comforting with just a little
bit, you know, not that much,

261
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,270
right?
So this is,

262
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,660
this is the question is what does
that tell us about the middle ground?

263
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,350
So this is an extreme case,
but what do we know about the middle case?

264
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:19,580
Say Your parents, you're not raised in
a cage and not in a Romanian orphanage,

265
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,450
but your parents just don't pick you up
very much. They don't love you very much.

266
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,460
Um, there's no good evidence that
that has any effect on a person.

267
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,810
The problem is,

268
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:33,410
and we're going to talk about this in
much more detail in a couple of weeks,

269
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,740
is it's true that parents who
aren't affectionate have kids,

270
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,140
don't, aren't that aren't
affectionate, but it's not clear.

271
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:45,380
This is because of a genetic connection
or an environmental connection.

272
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,830
The one thing we do know is that in
the middle ground effects 10 not to be

273
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:50,664
dramatic.

274
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,990
So when you get away from extreme cases
affects our heart to see in require

275
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,420
careful experimental
research to tease out,

276
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,660
I think what it's safe to say for a lot,
for everything.

277
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:05,661
But the severe conditions is we don't
know what kind of effects there are,

278
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,330
but if there are effects,
they are not big and dramatic ones.

279
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,510
Okay.

280
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,220
Okay. Animals, good feelings. Animals.

281
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:22,790
Emotional attraction to their
kin is not a huge puzzle.

282
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,990
From an evolutionary point of
view. Evolution is driven by, um,

283
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,040
forces that operate on the fact of how
many genes get reproduced and replicated,

284
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,920
uh,
among your descendants.

285
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,690
So it makes sense that animals would
be wired up to care for their kids.

286
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,400
It would make sense that kids who
are wired up to survive would develop

287
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:50,060
attachments to their parents.
What's more of a puzzle though,

288
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,040
is that animals, including humans,
seem to have exquisite Lee,

289
00:18:55,041 --> 00:19:00,041
complicated relationships
with non-kin in particular.

290
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,330
Animals are nice to non-kin. You are nice
to people that you're not related to.

291
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,250
A lot of examples of this. Um, animals
groom one another. You know, you go,

292
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:15,230
you pick off the lights and the bugs
off your friend, they pick it off you.

293
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,240
Um, they, um,

294
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,270
they give warning cries so I'm warning
cries all sorts of animals give warning

295
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,420
Christ um, you are um, I dunno,

296
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,200
you're like a little animal and a big
animal comes charging and say, Hey,

297
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,320
you know, oh, you made some sort
of cry and everybody runs away.

298
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,530
That very risky for you.
Um,

299
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,460
but you do it anyway often to protect
people. You aren't related to, um,

300
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,670
often animal sheer childcare and from a
cold blooded natural selection survival

301
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,160
of the gene point of view, you
wouldn't imagine that, you know,

302
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,020
if you lend me your kid for today,
I would eat them for protein and you know,

303
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:57,590
it's not my jeans. And I hear
it gives more, more for my kids.

304
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,510
That's not quite how it works though.
Animal share food,

305
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,780
in fact, that animal,
you know, hugely ugly.

306
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,390
The Vampire Bat shares food.

307
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,420
What happens is the vampire bat vampire
bats live in caves and they fly out.

308
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,440
And what they do is often about,
we'll strike it big. So find a horse,

309
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:22,274
for instance,

310
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,050
bite the Horse Pumbaa and tons
of blood and then fly back.

311
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,990
And what it does is it
doesn't keep it to itself,

312
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,180
rather it goes around the whole cave and
vomits blood into the mouth of all the

313
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:39,350
other vampire bats. So everybody
benefits. Isn't that nice?

314
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,700
Now what you're tempted to say is,
well,

315
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:48,400
that's really nice,
everybody benefits.

316
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,550
But this raises a puzzle from
evolutionary point of view. Remember, um,

317
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,480
animals benefit, um, more
under this situation.

318
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:02,080
And if it's animals benefit more by
working together, by working alone,

319
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,730
the benefits outweigh the cost.
This is known as reciprocal altruism,

320
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,720
meaning my behavior to you,
my good behavior to you,

321
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,460
my altruism for you, um, is predicated
on the idea of reciprocation.

322
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:18,730
I'll benefit from you and you imagine
how vampire bats, for instance,

323
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,080
why this makes sense. Um, this
is, uh, if you're a vampire,

324
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:28,030
bat is a better system when anybody's
strikes a big to feed you rather than for

325
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:31,660
anybody who strike it big, used the
blood and it spit out all the rest of it.

326
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,380
But here's the problem.
Here's why it's such a puzzle.

327
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,370
The problem is the existence of
cheaters and an economics and sociology,

328
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,080
these are also known as free riders.

329
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,950
And what a cheater or free rider does
is it takes the benefits without paying

330
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,510
the cost.
Imagine two genes.

331
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,630
Imagine one builds a vampire bat that
accepts blood from others and shares

332
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,313
blood.

333
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,640
The other gene excepts blood from
others and doesn't share blood.

334
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:14,010
In the long run be we'll actually
outproduced GNA because in fact be will be

335
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:19,840
healthy while other vampire bats get sick.
And um,

336
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,700
and then so the offspring will do better.
Um,

337
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,440
and even sharper example is
an example of warning Christ.

338
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,110
So gophers give warning cries.
When there's a Predator,

339
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,820
it is extremely adaptive to
give a warning cry, sorry.

340
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:37,450
It's really reactive to, to respond to
a warning cry. You hear a warning cry,

341
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:38,950
how crap your runaway.

342
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,560
It is not very adaptive
to give a warning cry.

343
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,930
A really good solution then is to x to
listen to warning Christ put not to give

344
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:53,260
them, you know, suppose we had a system.

345
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,010
It is very adaptive when
people are going to the bar,

346
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,910
when people buy drinks
to accept the drinks,

347
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,270
it is not so adaptive from the standpoint
of ones wallet to buy. People drinks.

348
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,170
Here's a solution except drinks,
but don't pay for drinks.

349
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,930
And if everybody fell to that solution,
the idea of buying around would fade.

350
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,930
So there's the puzzle.
Since cheating,

351
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,940
since a cheater in the short run can
always out when does better than a non

352
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:28,240
cheater?
How could this cooperation evolve?

353
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,760
How could it be an
evolutionarily stable strategy?

354
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,670
And the answer is cheater detection.
Um,

355
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,010
reciprocal altruism can only evolve if
animals are wired up to punish cheaters.

356
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,280
Now that requires a lot of mental
apparatus. You have to recognize cheaters,

357
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:51,100
you have to remember cheaters, and you had
to be motivated to punish cheaters. Um,

358
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,210
and not every animal has this
degree of complicated apparatus,

359
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,720
but actually we know,
um, that vampire bats do.

360
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,120
So in one clever study.

361
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,420
So there's sort of the theory says
evolutionary theory says, yeah,

362
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,880
I see what he's vampire bats are doing.
But you see,

363
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:11,930
and this is a case where evolution makes
a nice prediction that couldn't evolve

364
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,760
in less.
Bats are keeping track.

365
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,390
If bats aren't keeping track then the
system could never exist because the

366
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:22,550
cheaters would just take it over.
They must be watching for cheaters.

367
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,060
So the experiment which was done is
you are vampire bats strikes at big,

368
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,690
it flies back and then you
keep it as a scientist,

369
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,640
you keep it from giving blood to
anybody else. Then what happens?

370
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,180
Well, what happens is when
the other bats strike it big,

371
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,570
they starve the selfish bat.

372
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,450
Just as if we go to bars and
everybody buys around except for me.

373
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,120
And this happens over and over over again.

374
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,400
Pretty soon you're going to buy around,
but you're not going to give me one.

375
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,110
And so just as humans are keeping their
eyes out for people who are taking the

376
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:03,410
benefits without paying the costs.
So are other animals.

377
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,060
And it is argued that this
sensitivity to cheating,

378
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,590
there's this focus on reciprocity.
Reciprocation,

379
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,850
um,

380
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,740
plays a powerful role in the evolution
of social behavior and evolution of

381
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:22,860
social emotions. And the classic
illustration of this, um,

382
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,320
is the prisoner's
dilemma. Now, many of you,

383
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:31,880
I think I've seen the prisoner's dilemma
in one course or another. It shows up.

384
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,030
It is one of the main constructs
in the social sciences.

385
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,060
It shows up in cognitive science,
psychology, economics that you could, um,

386
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,490
the teaching fellows are passing around
something which you're not going to use

387
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,410
right away.
But for some of you,

388
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,710
this is the first time you're going to
be exposed to the prisoner's dilemma.

389
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,650
So let me spell it out.
Here's the idea.

390
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,130
You and a friend commit a crime.
You Rob a bank for instance.

391
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,190
For the sake of this example,
you are a prisoner to,

392
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,860
you get caught,

393
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,480
the police put you in a
little room and they say,

394
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,920
we want to know everything that happened.
In particular,

395
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,490
we want you to rat out your friend.
Now,

396
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,110
here are the options. And one thing
about this is nothing is hidden.

397
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,890
The police officer could actually print
out a copy of the prisoner's dilemma and

398
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:29,540
put it right in front of you. And when he
could say is, look, I'm your prisoner to,

399
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,850
you could cooperate. Um, where
you, you have two options.

400
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,980
You can either cooperate with your friend,
um,

401
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,410
you can stay silent or you could
defect or you could squeal.

402
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,410
But the police officer says, look,
if you let me tell you something,

403
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,570
if you cooperate with your
friend and he squeals on you,

404
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,200
you go to prison for life
and he'll walk it, walk out.

405
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,720
However,

406
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,570
if you squeal on him and he cooperates,
he's,

407
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,810
he keeps quiet. He'll go to prison
for life and you'll walk out.

408
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:16,500
So what do you do now on the nice side,
where you can do is you can say,

409
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,250
no, I'm going to be quiet.
I'm going to cooperate. Now,

410
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:23,550
if you could trust your friend
to cooperate, you're fine.

411
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,050
You just get a little stint in prison.

412
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,550
But of course your friend might
affect your friend might squeal.

413
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,190
Here's, here's the important
structure of the prisoner's dilemma.

414
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,180
No matter what you,
what your friend chooses to do,

415
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,030
you're better off squealing.

416
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,300
So suppose you're a prisoner to you,

417
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:48,570
believe your friends going to cooperate
with you. He's not going to be,

418
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:50,130
he's not going to give
the information out.

419
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,890
Well then your best thing
to do is squeal on him.

420
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,270
What if you believe he's
going to squeal on you? Well,

421
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,070
your best thing to do is squeal on him.

422
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,430
But if you could get your act together
and you could coordinate this,

423
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,270
you would both be quiet and
get a fairly minor penalty.

424
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,400
And you could see this. This
is the standard origin at
a prisoner's dilemma, why?

425
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:20,880
It's called a prisoner's dilemma. Um,
but you can see this all over the place.

426
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,750
So here's the logic.

427
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,950
The best case for you is to defect
while the other person cooperates.

428
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,500
The worst case is to cooperate
while other person defects.

429
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,330
Back to the police thing.

430
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,810
The best case for you is to give up all
information to other guys. Stay silent.

431
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,680
You cut a deal, you walk home that
day. The worst case is you're quiet.

432
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,080
He cuts a deal.
You go to prison for life.

433
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,290
But overall the best is that
each cooperate and overall
the worst for both is if

434
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:53,250
each defect and the reason
that makes this tragic is this,

435
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,030
regardless of what your opponent does,
it pays to defect.

436
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,330
But if both people to
affect both are worse off.

437
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,720
I'll give a couple of other examples.
Oh,

438
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,660
that's just to show that
there is a cartoon, of course,

439
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,610
Barton to the prisoner's dilemma. It
is that common. Here's the idea. I am,

440
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,350
I break off my wife.
We've been married for a while,

441
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:20,910
we've decided we're not going to go go
through it together anymore and we break

442
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:23,400
up, we living in separate houses
and we're starting to talk divorce.

443
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,590
It occurs to me, here's
me, I put that to me.

444
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,940
Should I get a divorce lawyer? I ask. Now,

445
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,120
I know divorce lawyers are
really expensive and it's
kind of difficult to get a

446
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:42,040
divorce lawyer.
But if I get a divorce lawyer,

447
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,840
and so neither one of us get a
divorce lawyer, we'll just do, okay.

448
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,320
We'll get a mediator will split the money
down in the middle. That'll be okay.

449
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,040
But I'm kind of tempted if I get a
divorce lawyer and she doesn't and she

450
00:29:56,621 --> 00:30:01,360
doesn't, my divorce lawyer will take
everything she got. I get everything.

451
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,620
She loses everything. Maybe
I should be nice. Hold it.

452
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,950
What if she gets a divorce
lawyer and I don't?

453
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,790
Well then I'll lose everything.
She'll get everything.

454
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,090
Well, we should both get a divorce
player then, but we both do pretty badly.

455
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,150
Imagine where two countries,
country a country B, should I newco.

456
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,230
How do nuclear disarmament?
That's pretty good.

457
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,310
We do okay if we both countries disarmed,
you know, we live our lives, you know,

458
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,270
raise taxes.
We'll do whatever countries do,

459
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,550
but wouldn't it be cool if I build
up my weaponry and they don't?

460
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,770
I'll invade, take everything they
got. That's kind of tempting. Oh,

461
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,880
also, if I don't do anything and
they do it, Dylan, invade my country,

462
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,350
take everything. So we both build up
our weaponry. We both do pretty badly.

463
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,890
Once you start thinking
about things this way,

464
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,340
there's no end to the sort of notions
that could fall under the prisoner's

465
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:02,740
dilemma. Um, a good
example is a drug deal.

466
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,690
Suppose I want to buy
marijuana from you or um,

467
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,040
or refer as they call it on the street.

468
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,443
MMM.

469
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,463
So,

470
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,940
so I have $1,000 and from you,

471
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:22,330
I'd like to buy a ton of reefer,
so

472
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,210
I'm rounding up. Um, so you say wonderful.

473
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,540
Wonderful.
Let's meet behind the gym.

474
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,920
Two in the morning on Friday, and
we'll do to change. You bring $1,000.

475
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,610
I bring the river. All
right. Oh, cool. Okay, good.

476
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,930
And I think that's pretty good. Thousand
Bucks. I get to refer you 1000 bucks.

477
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:45,790
That's my name. That's okay.
That's the normal thing.

478
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,010
But now something occurs to me.

479
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,370
Nobody's going to go to the
cops if things go badly.

480
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,780
So instead of doing green, no
money, why don't I just bring a gun?

481
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,550
You come with your reefer, I stick a gun
in your face, take the reefer, go home.

482
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,890
Maybe I want to do that. But now I worry
because you're thinking the same thing.

483
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,970
So you could show up with a gun,
stick the gun in my face,

484
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,840
take the thousand bucks, go home,
I'll have no refer. What will I smoke?

485
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,620
So we both think this way.

486
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,910
So we both show up behind the
gym two in the morning with guns.

487
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,290
Well that's not as bad
for either one of us.

488
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,520
If if I had you had a gun,
I didn't have a gun,

489
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:37,030
but still we're both worse off then if
we could cooperate and just do the damn

490
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:41,480
trade. And that's the structure
of prisoner's dilemma.

491
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,980
You can only appreciate the prisoner's
dilemma by actually doing it.

492
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,230
So here's,

493
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,200
here is a new miracle equivalent
to the prisoner's dilemma.

494
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,670
Everybody should have a card in front
of you, a file card. If you don't,

495
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:58,820
if you didn't get a card,
a piece of paper will do just as well.

496
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,470
Please write on one side,

497
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,250
cooperate and on the other side defect.

498
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:12,030
And then please find a partner
with whom to play one game.

499
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,420
This is a one shot game.

500
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,263
Yeah,

501
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,680
one of you is player one,

502
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,290
the player on the right most side from
my right could be played or one the other

503
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,240
one is player to do.
You each have a partner.

504
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,680
If you have three people you could
cluster together and do two and then two

505
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,000
and just think and is actually best if
you've never met or spoken to the person

506
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,100
you're about to deal with.
Um,

507
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,900
and the game is when I say go simply
show the person your choice to be clear.

508
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,030
If you are a player one and you cooperate
and player two cooperates as well,

509
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:16,840
you each get $3. If you are a player, one
of you cooperate, we'll play to Defax.

510
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,050
Player two gets $5.
You get bupkis um,

511
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,930
and so on,
on three,

512
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,600
just show the card to your opponent,

513
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,080
to your person you're
playing with one, two, three.

514
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,043
Okay.

515
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,330
People in this room,
people in this room cooperated.

516
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,540
How many cooperated?
How many defected?

517
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,300
Okay, how many people
are now $5 richer? Okay.

518
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,740
How many of you got nothing?
Okay,

519
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,300
so you're learning, you're learning that
the person next to you is really an sob.

520
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,073
Now

521
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,750
person next to you and you get to play
again and you get to play five games in a

522
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,990
row.
Play five games in a row and keep score.

523
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,040
You just show it to each other. Record
the numbers, show it, show it, show it,

524
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,190
show it.
Go now.

525
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,280
Anybody here?
$25.

526
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,790
Yes.
25

527
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,573
so you,

528
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,080
that's 20,
20,

529
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,880
21. Okay. It's good.
It's good. It's a really,

530
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:54,490
as a measure

531
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:58,120
of honesty. Um, anybody win 20 or more?

532
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,180
15 or more. 15, 14 or less.

533
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,290
Anybody do five or less?

534
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,740
Good. You're a good person. It's
good. It's good. You played at him,

535
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,420
bad person. Um, it's not,

536
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,270
it's not really about about
good or bad. Um, there was a

537
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,150
great game once. It's a simple game.
Um, but there was a great game,

538
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:33,170
a great famous competition a
long time ago, but 20 years ago,

539
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:38,390
set up by the great computer scientist,
Robert Axelrod,

540
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,760
and he put together a competition where
people brought in computer programs to

541
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:44,594
play this game.

542
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,310
To play the prisoner's dilemma and there
were 63 competitors and these computer

543
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:54,020
programs were incredibly, some of
them were very simple, always be nice,

544
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:55,520
always be,
always cooperate,

545
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,120
always defect somewhere elegant
prime numbers, solutions and,

546
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:05,180
and prototype responses,
genetic algorithms crafted to to,

547
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,720
to to figure out what the other
person was doing and sussed him out.

548
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,750
But the winner,

549
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,500
the winner was developed by Anatol
Rapoport and Anatol Rapoport actually died

550
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,740
about a month ago, um,
at quite an old age,

551
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,480
a great scientist.

552
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,730
What was interesting about this was
he was the winner with this program,

553
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,560
but this program was also one of the
simplest, it may well be the simplest,

554
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,240
it was called tit for tat and it worked.
Very simple.

555
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,940
Took four lines of basic code.

556
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,210
The first time you meet a new program,

557
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,150
cooperate the first
time you meet somebody,

558
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:51,830
be nice after that.
Do on each trial.

559
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,560
What the other program
did on a previous trial,

560
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,860
this beat 62 others.

561
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,110
And here's why it has certain
beautiful features. It starts friendly.

562
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,670
Remember, the best longterm solution
is everybody's busy, everybody's nice.

563
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,330
It starts off nice, but you
can't, it's not a sucker.

564
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,740
If you screw with it, it will, it
will defect back on an external.

565
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:22,340
It is however forgiving
you want to get nice with it.

566
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,780
Be Nice. If you're nice, it'll,
it'll be nice back at you later on.

567
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,490
As also transparent, nothing complicated
about it and that's actually important.

568
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,600
It's not merely, that is not
a sucker and forgiving. Um,

569
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,400
more to the point, um,
it is, um, it is you,

570
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:45,401
you could tell it's not a sucker and you
could tell it's forgiving and this very

571
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:50,671
powerful algorithm learn to cooperate
even in a situation and help you learn to

572
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:53,920
make it out the best.

573
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,550
Even in a situation where there's
a risk of cheating and betrayal.

574
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,660
Some psychologists have argued that our
emotions correspond to the different

575
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:08,260
permutations on the prisoner's dilemma.

576
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,470
We like people who cooperate with us.

577
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,020
This motivates us to be
nice to them in the future.

578
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,120
Much as a tit for tat algorithm says,
if you're nice to me now,

579
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,080
I'll be nice to you back.
We don't like being screwed with.

580
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,870
We feel anger and distrust towards those
portrayals that motivates us to betray

581
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:29,110
or avoid them in the future.

582
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,160
And we feel bad when we were traced
somebody who cooperates with us.

583
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,360
This motivates us to behave
better in the future. Um,

584
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,670
you can break down the cells
of the prisoner's dilemma
in terms of emotions that

585
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,044
they give rise to.

586
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,670
I didn't experiment last night with
my seven year old and my 10 year old.

587
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,300
I explained to them
the prisoner's dilemma.

588
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,130
I didn't give the divorce lawyer
example, but um, but, and I,

589
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,610
and we gave him a big thing
of chocolate chips and,

590
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,710
and the good chocolate
chips we had to good yet.

591
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,450
And we had to matrix and we had them play.

592
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,720
Now what they did is so interesting,

593
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,430
but what's interesting is they
were furious at each other.

594
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,230
One of them, the younger boy was
kept being betrayed by the older boy,

595
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,790
including tricks. Like you'd say,
okay, let's both cooperate. Okay, okay.

596
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,890
And you cooperate, defect. And,

597
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,113
and,

598
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,000
and the response was anger though.

599
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:38,440
Not Actually guilt on the
part of the other, but rage.

600
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,840
Um, and we see these sorts of
things all the time in real life.

601
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,940
You're familiar to prisoner's dilemma,

602
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,920
but there's another game which you
might not be familiar with. Um,

603
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,900
it's called the ultimatum game. How many
of you have encountered ultimatum game?

604
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,140
Okay, some of you very simple. Choose
a partner is a very simple game.

605
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,130
When the economists study this,
they actually do this with real money.

606
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,930
I do not have real money to let you
do this too. Um, one of you is a,

607
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:12,790
one of you is be the one on the
right most from this side is a,

608
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,580
the other one is B.
Here's a very simple rule.

609
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,930
I like a to turn to be and make an offer.

610
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,570
A has $10.

611
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,460
You can give me any amount you
choose from that $10 from $1 to $10.

612
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,600
B can do only one thing.
B can accept it.

613
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,650
If you accept it and you agree to
take home, no money and a keeps,

614
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:44,300
whatever's left or rejected. If
you reject it, you get nothing.

615
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,980
Nobody gets anything. Everybody.
Claire's. So A's going to say,

616
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,290
I'll give you so and so dollars. People
say, okay, in which case be walks away.

617
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:56,810
If so and so dollars
or I'm an a walks away,

618
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,840
whatever arrest or B could say reject
in which case nobody gets anything.

619
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,450
So this game cards in two steps.

620
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:09,020
The first thing I like a to
turn to be and make your offer.

621
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,570
Don't beat, doesn't do
anything yet. Make your offer.

622
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,160
Your offer should be one word.
People aren't explaining their offer.

623
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,120
Make your offer. Okay? Stage two.

624
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,510
Stage two do not negotiate.

625
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,070
Then I see people waving her
hands in this complicated.

626
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,760
It should be a number from one to 10.
A positive integer.

627
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,920
Now B,

628
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:47,921
I like B to say one word and you could
say it really loud on three except or

629
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,410
reject. One. Two, three.

630
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,560
Wow.
How many people accepted?

631
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,210
Anybody rejected? Good. Okay.

632
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,090
How many people offered $10.

633
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,380
How many people are

634
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,250
for more than $5? Okay. I
don't even got offered $1.

635
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,100
Okay. When you offered
$1, did you accept? Yup.

636
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,350
Anybody else offer $1? When you offered
$1 did you partner? Except, Yup.

637
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,790
Okay. Um, how many people
offered either four or $5.

638
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,620
Okay.
Um,

639
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:38,030
this is an interesting game because the
person who offered who accepted $1 was

640
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:43,630
being rational. $1 is
better than no dollars. Um,

641
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,890
so the psychology of human rationality
is such that that from a logical point of

642
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:53,430
view, you should reason
$1 is better than nothing.

643
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,650
I rational poaching should accept
$1 and because we're smart,

644
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,420
a should offer $1, but not
many of you offered a $1. Why?

645
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,000
Because you know,

646
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,750
people are not purely rational people
even in a one shot game won't accept

647
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:15,840
unfair distributions.
They'll reject them just out of spite.

648
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,040
And so you need to offer more.

649
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,420
And this has been studied from
a neuro economic point of view,

650
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,740
which basically provides
neuroanatomical evidence that people,

651
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,780
if you offered them $1,
they get really,

652
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,260
nobody likes to be offered a dollar.
Now there's a more general moral here,

653
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,240
which is actually an interesting surprise
of some relevance to everyday life.

654
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,960
I rational person is easily exploited

655
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,410
a rational person.

656
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:55,030
So responses to provocations to
assaults will always be measured and

657
00:44:55,291 --> 00:45:00,210
appropriate. If you know I'm rational and
you're in a sharing situation with me,

658
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,720
you could say to me, hey, here's
a dollar. Hey mister rational,

659
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,510
a dollar is better than nothing,
okay, because I'm rational. Um,

660
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:13,530
similarly you could mess with me because
you could like harass me in all sorts

661
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:13,900
of ways.

662
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,270
Take things that I own as long as you
reason that a rational person wouldn't

663
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:19,350
start a fuss about this,

664
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,180
there is some advantage to being
irrational to having a temper.

665
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,330
Because if you have a temper and
you're known to be irrational,

666
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,410
people are forced by dint of your
irrationality to treat you better. Um,

667
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:40,550
who am I going to take from the person
who's extremely reasonable or the person

668
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:45,360
who has a here trigger temper? Well,
I'm going to focus, I'm going to,

669
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:48,990
I'm going to pick on a reasonable person
cause the unreasonable person might do

670
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:53,640
unreasonable things.
And this is faintly paradoxical,

671
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:58,620
but often to be irrational or at
least to have a reputation for mile

672
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:01,650
irrationality gives you an edge.
Now,

673
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:03,630
this is in focus of provocation,

674
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,380
but this is also been presented in
a theory of why people fall in love.

675
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,910
Suppose you're choosing
who to devote your life to.

676
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,180
And as a matter of huge trust,
we're going to raise kids together.

677
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,890
It's very important for you that I
don't leave and I'm very irrational.

678
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,480
So I say to you,

679
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,520
we should make and have children because
I find you the most attractive of

680
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:31,200
everybody who was available that
I've met so far. I'm very irrational.

681
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,080
And as so long as this continues
to be the case, we'll be together.

682
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,800
Well that's reasonable and rational.

683
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,670
But wouldn't you rather be with somebody
who was head over heels in love,

684
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,820
head over heels in love is irrational,

685
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,940
but it's also within certain parameters
in deray because the irrationality of

686
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:54,120
the person means you could
trust them more in the long run.

687
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:59,010
Just like their rationality of somebody
who has a temper means you don't mess

688
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:00,060
with them as much.

689
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,030
The studies have been done more with
regard to violence, then we'll fluff.

690
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,440
And in fact,

691
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,450
the irrationality that the
benefits of irrational violence,

692
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,610
um, have been translated in terms of, um,

693
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,130
the study of homocide and other crimes.

694
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,490
A Daly and Wilson describe
the cause of murder.

695
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:30,740
Most murder is not caused
by reasonable provocation.

696
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,860
Most murder is not
rational in this response.

697
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,150
Most murder is generated by
insult, curse, petty and fraction.

698
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,940
But this is not crazy irrationality.
It's adaptive irrationality,

699
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:50,100
Daly and Wilson point out and chronically
feuding and warning societies and

700
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:54,640
essential manual manly virtue is the
capacity for violence to turn the other

701
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:58,510
cheek is not saintly but stupid or
contempt. Contemptible Lee weak.

702
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,220
If I show myself a rash or irrational
person when picked on or harassed,

703
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,880
I'll be known as somebody you
can pick on and harass. Um,

704
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,130
and in fact,
it turns out even in a modern world,

705
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,050
this is from a New York Times I
just picked up a year ago today. Um,

706
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:21,370
and the point is that the violence is
due to people disrespecting each other or

707
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:24,940
giving a dirty look. And you might
think, isn't that irrational?

708
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,350
But it's not irrational circumstances
where people live together in an

709
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:32,860
environment where you have to deal with
each other over and over again and often

710
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,790
where there's not much support,
um,

711
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,960
by the police as in the
cases they talked about here.

712
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,040
What's particularly interesting is this
sort of importance of a reputation for

713
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,880
violence differs from culture to culture.

714
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,580
And I've been talking so far in this
class and in fact so far in this course,

715
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,470
um,
about universals,

716
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,280
but things that are built in things that
show up across humans and other animals.

717
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,090
Um,

718
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:06,090
I want to turn now and end this lecture
by talking a little bit about a cultural

719
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:11,380
difference and as a
psychologically interesting
cultural difference with regard

720
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,520
to the emotions and it's
built around a difference. Um,

721
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:21,180
turning around what sociologists
call cultures of honor. Um,

722
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:26,250
a culture of honor has certain properties
you can rely on the law and I'm,

723
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:32,461
and it has resources that are easily
taken and sociologists have argued that

724
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:34,210
when those conditions are met,

725
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,140
it becomes important to develop a
reputation provile and retaliation that

726
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:42,110
becomes important.
Um,

727
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,030
examples of culture of honors
include Scottish highlanders,

728
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:49,060
Mussai warriors better when
tradesmen in western cowboys,

729
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:54,450
all cases where there's resources such
as cattle that are vulnerable and easily

730
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:55,060
taken,

731
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,500
but you can't count on calling nine one
one and having people kind of help you.

732
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:04,230
But the culture of honor
that's been studied the most
by modern psychologists is

733
00:50:04,231 --> 00:50:06,470
an American south.
Um,

734
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,420
this was settled by herdsmen and
traditionally has less centralized legal

735
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:11,254
control.

736
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,490
So sociologists say the American south
is more of a culture of honor then the

737
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:19,780
American north. But how do you know,
I mean, what does that do? We're,

738
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:23,740
we're interested in this class
in claims about psychology.

739
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,600
So it took,
um,

740
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,490
Richard Nisbett and Doug Cohen to
study cultures of honors and look at

741
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,790
differences and they found some
interesting differences. Um,

742
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,630
gun laws tend to be more
permissive in the southern, in,

743
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,000
in the American south and American north.
Um,

744
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,040
corporal punishment and capital
punishment at tend to be more approved of

745
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,450
attitudes towards the military are
more positive in a questionnaire.

746
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:53,180
Studies people are more forgiving
towards cultures of honor.

747
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,690
Somebody insults my woman and
I punched him in the face. Um,

748
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,760
this is considered less bad in
American south than the American north.

749
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,410
There's a higher rate of violence,
but only in certain circumstances.

750
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:10,910
The streets at American south as a rule
are not more dangerous than the American

751
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:15,380
north. The differences, there's a higher
rate of crimes that are crimes of honor,

752
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,760
such as, for instance, if somebody
breaks into my house, me shooting them,

753
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,000
or if somebody insults me,
me killing him.

754
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,880
Now this is sort of survey studies.
So it has been,

755
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:28,970
and Cohen didn't,

756
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:32,090
one of the more interesting
psychological studies I've ever heard of,

757
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,770
and they did this at, I'm just
sorry, this is this button. Wilson.

758
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,540
They did this with University
of Michigan undergraduates. Um,

759
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,410
they did a subject pool thing
like you're doing now and on it,

760
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:49,100
your demographic information was
listed and what they did was they took

761
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,320
white males who are not
Hispanic and not Jewish.

762
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:59,350
That was your sample culture of honor
is a phenomena limited to males and they

763
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:01,970
wanted to make us sort of a clean study.
So they want to focus,

764
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,540
get a homogeneous samples.
So not Hispanic, not Jewish,

765
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,970
and they provoke them.
And the provocation was genius.

766
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,550
What he did was they said,
they brought people into,

767
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,660
into the psychology building as you'd be
brought into Kirtland or sss or Dunham.

768
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,780
And they said they had somebody go
in, there's a desk, and he said, yeah,

769
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,830
go down the hall for the experiment.
There's a hallway.

770
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:29,810
And then you walk through the hallway
and walking the other direction.

771
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:31,370
At that moment,
a graduate student,

772
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:35,450
a male graduate student would start to
walk and he's holding some files and what

773
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:40,190
he does is he bumps to person,
looks at them and says, asshole,

774
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,930
and keep walking.
Now to be fair,

775
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:50,180
the graduate students survived
bumping into like hundreds of mails,

776
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:53,540
calling them assholes and, and then
walking through fights did not break out.

777
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:57,230
Nobody was shot,
but then they brought them in.

778
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,910
Now went into a room and they were
tested and it turned out that,

779
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:02,744
um,

780
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,330
that there were differences in
the stress response. On average,

781
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:13,700
males from American south showed higher
hormone response and stress response,

782
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,350
then males in American north increases
in testosterone and cortisol.

783
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,560
Um, there's also differences in
later behavior. Um, the mirror,

784
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,100
the people suggest that
they were made angry. Um,

785
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,380
they gave differences in fill in the
blank questions. For instance, um,

786
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,760
you know, I, I don't remember the
examples, but it's examples like, uh,

787
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,050
like John went to the store and bought
a blank and then, and then, you know,

788
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,870
and the north end of the
say, and by, you know,

789
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:46,970
an apple and a southern state and AK 47
to kill that freaking graduate students.

790
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,280
Now again,
the Americans have,

791
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:56,790
people in American south were not
overall more violent than American north,

792
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:01,050
but they worn more sensitive
to provocations of honor. Now,

793
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,700
when they gave this lecture a few years
ago, um, uh, southern student, uh,

794
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:10,730
contacted me afterwards and said that
she felt that picking out the southern

795
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:16,020
minority at Yale was to some
regard offensive and that
people say things at Yale

796
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,900
about southerners, American
southerner's that they would never say,

797
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,580
but any other minority group.

798
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,120
So there's two points I want to make
regarding this. One is of course,

799
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,220
these are average differences,
um,

800
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,760
not every northerner and south and
would differ along these lines.

801
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,760
But another one is I
think the effect is real,

802
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:37,860
but it's not entirely clear
that it reflects poorly on
the cultures of honor as

803
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:40,350
opposed to other cultures.
So Nisbet for instance,

804
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:44,940
is himself a southerner and he points
out that, that when he went to the north,

805
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,090
he was most astonished
by how rude people are.

806
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,990
And this is because the North American
north is not particularly a culture of

807
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,130
honor.
Um,

808
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,360
and so and so there's less proper behavior
towards other people because there

809
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:01,980
was no fear of retaliation
or response. Um, moreover,

810
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,990
um, the culture of honor of
honor virtues like, um, honor,

811
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:10,620
loyalty, courage and self
reliance or on the face of it,

812
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,100
not necessarily bad.
Thanks. In any case, um,

813
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,370
this is an interesting example of how
there's an evolutionary background,

814
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,300
um,

815
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,890
but culture modifies and shifts it
in different ways more generally.

816
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,790
Um,

817
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:31,080
I've suggested over the last couple of
lectures that emotions like fear to love

818
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,400
you have to,
your children anger,

819
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:36,150
gratitude are not aberrations
or noise in the system. Rather,

820
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:40,020
they're exquisitely complicated
motivational systems
that are crafted to deal

821
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:42,370
with the natural and social environment.
Um,

822
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,720
and we know this only from an analysis
that starts from an evolutionary

823
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:51,070
approach. So to bring us
back to Darcy Thompson, um,

824
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,940
everything is the way it
is because it got that way.

825
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,400
And your reading response
for this week is, is that,

826
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,770
and, um, and I wish you good luck on an
exam on Wednesday. I'll see you there.
