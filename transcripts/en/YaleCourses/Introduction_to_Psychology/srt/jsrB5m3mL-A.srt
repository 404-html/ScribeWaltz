1
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,620
This is going to begin a two lecture
sequence on social psychology,

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,020
on how we think about ourselves,
how we think about other people,

3
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,330
how we think about other groups of people.

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,680
We've talked a lot about the capacities
of the human mind and some of these

5
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:36,681
capacities involve adapting and
dealing with the material world.

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,360
So we have to choose foods,
we have to navigate around the world,

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,570
we have to recognize objects,
we have to be able to um,

8
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,870
to understand physical interactions.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,440
But probably the most interesting aspect
of our evolved minds is our capacity to

10
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,060
understand and neo of other people,

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,410
we are intensely interested
in how other people work.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,993
Um,

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,240
the story that was the dominant
news story in 2005 was this,

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,150
and some of you,
this,

15
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:16,350
for those of you who run seeing the screen
is the separation of Jennifer Aniston

16
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:21,150
and Brad Pitt. I remember where I
was when I first heard about this

17
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,300
and it's an interesting site.
Just remember stepping back, um,

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,000
as psychologists we have
to question the natural.

19
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,330
We have to take things that are
common sense and explore them.

20
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,100
And one thing which was just happens
is we're fascinated by this stuff.

21
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,590
We're fascinated by the
lives of celebrities,

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,260
were fascinated by the
social lives of other people.

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,580
And it's an interesting
question to ask why. Um,

24
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,920
and this is one of the questions which
I'm going to deal with in the next couple

25
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:59,660
of lectures, but before I get to
the theory of social psychology,

26
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,480
I want to talk about an
individual difference.

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,720
So we devoted a lecture early on about
a couple of weeks ago to individual

28
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:11,960
differences across people in
intelligence and personality.

29
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,150
I want to talk a little bit about India,

30
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,000
an individual difference
in our social natures.

31
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,040
And then I want people to do a test
that we'll explore where you stand on a

32
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,390
continuum. Um, that test is the piece
of paper you have in front of you.

33
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,880
Anybody who doesn't have it,
please raise your hand.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,770
And when a teaching fellows
will bring it to you,

35
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,040
you don't know what to do yet
with it. Um, so don't worry.

36
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,320
The test was developed actually by
Malcolm Gladwell, who's a science writer,

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,680
um, in his wonderful
book, the tipping point.

38
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,810
And as he introduces the
test, Gladwell recounts, um,

39
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,200
another experiment done by
Stanley Milgram, of course,

40
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:54,920
famous for his obedience work,
but he did a lot of interesting things.

41
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,790
And one classic study he did was he gave a

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,050
to hundred and 60 people randomly
chosen in Omaha, Nebraska.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,260
And he asked these people
to get the package somehow.

44
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,230
And this was many years
ago before the internet,

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,260
before email to get the package to a
stockbroker who worked in Boston but lived

46
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,180
in Sharon,
Massachusetts.

47
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,500
What he found was that most
people were able to do it.

48
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,710
Nobody of course knew this man,

49
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,710
but they knew people who might know
people who would know this man.

50
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,050
So most people succeeded.

51
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:40,000
Most people were able to get
the packages to this man and um,

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,560
and it took at maximum
six degrees of separation,

53
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,420
which is where the frame is famous race
comes about that we're all separated

54
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,980
from another person by six degrees of
separation. This is not true in general.

55
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,550
This was a very, a single experiment
done within the United States.

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,620
But the idea is appealing that people are
connected to one another via chains of

57
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,454
people.

58
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,613
MMM.

59
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,210
But what milligram found was
particularly interesting was that

60
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,860
in about half of the cases these
packages went through to people.

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,630
That is, if you plot the
relationships between people,

62
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,760
we can take each person in this room,

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,380
find everybody you know,
and who knows you and draw a line.

64
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,720
But if we were to do this,
you wouldn't find an even mesh of wires.

65
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,630
Rather you'd find that
some people are clusters,

66
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,490
some people are what Gladwell calls
connectors. It's like air traffic.

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,810
Air traffic used to be um,
everything flew to,

68
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,690
to two places local to it.
But now there's a system of hubs.

69
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,470
Chicago O'hare for instance,
our Newark,

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,280
we're planes fly through.
Some people are hubs.

71
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,200
Some people are the sort of
people who know a lot of people.

72
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,950
Some people in this room might be hubs
and it is not impossible to find out.

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
The piece of paper you have here is
250 names rent chosen randomly from a

74
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,840
Manhattan phone book.

75
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,370
Okay.

76
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,930
They capture a range of ethnicities,
different parts of the world.

77
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,480
Different, uh, different national origins.

78
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,230
Here's what I'd like you to do and I'll
give you about five minutes for this.

79
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Go through these names and
circle how many people you know.

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,110
Now the rules of this are to
know somebody. You have to,

81
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,220
um, they have to know you back. So, um,

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,550
so if it's a celebrity,
um,

83
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,540
well here I'm one of the
names here is Johnson.

84
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,640
Now I've heard a magic Johnson,

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,160
but magic Johnson has never heard of me
so I cannot circle it. On the other hand,

86
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,900
our department chair is Marsha Johnson.
She has heard of me so I could circle it,

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,790
go through and circle it.

88
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,090
Circle all the people
you know who know you.

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,330
Those are the people you're connected to.

90
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,620
If you know more than one person
with us with the same last name,

91
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,610
circle it twice.

92
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,190
If you don't have this piece of
paper and you want to participate,

93
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,800
please raise your hand. And when did
teaching fellows will bring it to you.

94
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,353
Okay,

95
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,300
I'm going to talk a little bit more about
this while people go through this. Um,

96
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,400
the issue of connections between
people is intellectually interesting.

97
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,760
For many reasons and might allow us to,
um,

98
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,870
to develop some generalizations
about how people interact.

99
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,080
The game of six degrees of separation
has of course turned into a famous movie

100
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,680
trivia thing,
um,

101
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,640
revolving around to actor Kevin Bacon I
think chosen just because at Ryan's was

102
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,110
separation.
Um,

103
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,680
and the game of six degrees of Kevin
Bacon is played by taking any actor and

104
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:48,100
computing how many steps it
would take to get to Kevin Bacon.

105
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,130
And some computer scientists have
developed this. They've gone through, uh,

106
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,150
each of the quarter million actors,

107
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,120
actresses on the international movie
database and computed their bacon number.

108
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,780
And the Bacon number is the number of
steps it takes for them to get to Kevin

109
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,280
Bacon. Um, so for instance,

110
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Ed Asner was in the movie a
change of JFK with Kevin Bacon.

111
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,800
So Ed Asner has a bacon number of one.

112
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Elvis Presley was in the movie
change of habit with Ed Asner,

113
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,280
and that's as closest
connection to Kevin Bacon.

114
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,430
So Elvis Presley has
a bacon number of two.

115
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,840
It turns out that if you look at the 2.5,
sorry,

116
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,700
the quarter million people,
um,

117
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,650
on the movie database and
compute their bacon number,

118
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,500
the average bacon number is 2.8.

119
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,490
That's how many steps your average
person is away from Kevin Bacon.

120
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,350
You could then for any actor or actress
compute the most connected one to the

121
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:03,051
most connected one would be the one for
whom the quarter million are on average.

122
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,800
The most connected to,

123
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,020
and the answer of the most connected
actor or actress is reasonably surprising.

124
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,190
Does anybody want to guess?

125
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,700
I'll start you off of what the
wrong answer. And this, by the way,

126
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:23,150
can be found on this website.
It's not John Wayne.

127
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,510
John Wayne has been in many
movies, 180 movies, in fact,

128
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:33,770
over 60 years. But he isn't well
connected at all because mostly he,

129
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:38,420
he was in Westerns. So we saw the
same people over and over again.

130
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,140
Meryl Streep also isn't dead because
Meryl Streep has the misfortune of playing

131
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,860
only in good movies.

132
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,940
So she has no connection with people
like Adam Sandler and John Claude Vonda.

133
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,080
Guess any guesses?
Christopher Walken is a good one.

134
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,030
We could look it up.

135
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,940
I only know a few names are
Christopher Walken is not a finalist.

136
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,660
Nicholas cage is an interesting case
of Nicolas Cage. Been in good movies.

137
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,110
I don't want to get, I'm going to
get more controversial. I want to um,

138
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,870
pardon me one step up.

139
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,460
The most connected guy.
The list accurate,

140
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,990
the most connected guy.

141
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,430
And I think this shows that
you're right is rod Steiger.

142
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,540
He's the most connected actor in the
history of acting because it isn't that

143
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,340
he's been in more movies
than everybody else.

144
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,900
Michael Caine private and most
movies have any person on earth. Um,

145
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,400
but he's been all sorts of movies.

146
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,550
He was in on the waterfront in the heat
of the night and really bad movies like

147
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:00,400
car pool. Um, he's been in dramas
and crime serial thrillers,

148
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:04,780
Westerns, horror movies,
science fiction, musicals. Um,

149
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,430
now some people are like Rod Steiger.

150
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,200
So some people in their day to
day lives have many interactions.

151
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,100
And I think one of the things we know
from interacting with people is we can

152
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:22,150
distinguish them from other people.
How many people are finished there?

153
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,180
Things right now. Okay. Um,

154
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,590
I know one person in the department who
is one of the most connected people I

155
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:34,240
know on earth. If I wanted, if I
really had to talk to Rumsfeld,

156
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,560
I go to this person and say,
can you get me in touch with Rumsfeld?

157
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,280
If I wanted to get somebody whacked,
I'd asked this guy. Um, then I,

158
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:46,090
I know someone else in the
department and as best I know,

159
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:50,230
I'm the only person she knows.
So,

160
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,010
um,
how many people scores below 10

161
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,533
on this?

162
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,180
How many? Between 10 and
20? Between 20 and 30.

163
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,680
30 and 40.
Between 40 and 50.

164
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,570
50 and 60.

165
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,620
How many people scored above 60?

166
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,080
Anybody above 60.

167
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,530
Um, Gladwell's done this
in a lot of places. Um,

168
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,230
the average is 21 among a college crowd.

169
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,530
Some people score as high as over
a hundred. Um, the older you are,

170
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,500
the more the higher you tend to score,
maybe,

171
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:48,130
obviously not the longer you've been in
the country, the high you tend to score.

172
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,620
Um, journalists tend to
score reasonably high. Um,

173
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,290
academics not so high.
And,

174
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,240
but what Gladwell points out
that some people have the gift,

175
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,510
some people are more social than others.

176
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,370
And this connects in all sorts of
interesting ways. The issue of connection,

177
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,743
um,

178
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,810
has social factors and it's one answer
that sociologists give for why it's good

179
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,310
to go to Yale.

180
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,393
So

181
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,850
one answer is well, because of
the great intellectual benefits,

182
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,840
put that aside, let's be
more cynical here. Um,

183
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,220
another answer is that you
develop powerful friends,

184
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,613
okay.

185
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,930
And that's closer.

186
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,030
But the interesting answers sociologists
come to is it's not so much you develop

187
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,080
powerful friends.

188
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,530
Rather you developed powerful
acquaintances through Yale.

189
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:54,740
You a lot of people and they don't have
to be your close friends but they're

190
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:59,741
acquaintances and sociologists point out
that for a lot of aspects of your life,

191
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,990
like getting a job,
acquaintances matter,

192
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,090
connections matter and the connections
you established by going to a place like

193
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,390
Yale hold you in good stead
for the rest of your life.

194
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,230
Above and beyond any intellectual
qualities of this place may offer.

195
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,870
Um, here's what going to do
for next lecture and a half,

196
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,210
two lectures.
We're first going to talk about the self,

197
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,280
then when talk about the self and other
basically differences between how we

198
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:32,360
think of ourselves and how
we think about other people.

199
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,390
Then want to talk exclusively,
but how we think about other people.

200
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,830
And then we'll talk about how we think
about groups like Harvard students or gay

201
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:43,190
people or black people.
Um,

202
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,950
I'll start with my favorite
finding of all time.

203
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,150
And this is about the
self and this is about

204
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,940
the spotlight effect.

205
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,550
So my mornings are often
rushed because I have two kids.

206
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:04,520
So I get up and sometimes they don't
set the alarm and they get up late.

207
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,530
I stagger it a bed, I wake the kids,
I greet the servants, I get ready,

208
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,780
I make,
I make breakfast,

209
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,070
I run out of the house and then
usually around three o'clock,

210
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,110
so many points out,
in one case,

211
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,700
a homeless man that I have a big glob
of shaving cream in my ear or cause I

212
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,090
neglected to actually look in
the mirror while I shaved. Um,

213
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,920
or I won't spend to a party and I found
my shirt was misaligned. Seriously.

214
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,740
Misalign not one button. But anyway, um,

215
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,320
so and so I feel when this happens,
um,

216
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,110
I'm very mature and I basically feel
this is the end of the world. This is,

217
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,780
this is humiliating and everybody notices.

218
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,260
And so the question is how many people
notice when something happens and the

219
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:53,270
spotlight effect?
Well,

220
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,260
before talking about my
favorite experiment ever, um,

221
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,660
there was an episode of the Simpsons
that provides a beautiful illustration of

222
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:04,010
the spotlight effect and then it has a
beautiful illustration of psychological

223
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:07,070
testing. So I'll give you them
quickly, one after the other.

224
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,240
So Tom Gilovich,
a social psychologist,

225
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,330
was interested in the question
of the spotlight effect,

226
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,630
which is when we wear a pink shirt to
work shaving cream in her ear or whatever,

227
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,810
do we systematically over estimate
how much other people notice?

228
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,910
And he did a series of experiments and
in one experiment what he did was he got

229
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:40,640
it and subject standard
intro psych drill and said,

230
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,970
I want you to wear a tee shirt for the
next day and I want it to have a picture

231
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:46,844
on it.

232
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,330
And he got them to wear tee shirts that
had pictures on it that were the most

233
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:57,000
embarrassing pictures that they could
have on it. It turns out that I'm,

234
00:17:57,001 --> 00:18:01,350
if you ask people what's the worst
picture to have on a tee shirt that you're

235
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,410
wearing?
The number one answer is Hitler

236
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,220
tied with Barry Manilow.

237
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,773
MMM.

238
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,350
The best pictures to have
on your tee shirt are, um,

239
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,370
Martin Luther King Jr and Jerry Seinfeld.

240
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,810
It turns out that people in any had
them go about their day and asked him,

241
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,710
how many people noticed your t shirt?

242
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,720
And then the psychologist went
around and they asked the people,

243
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,540
how many of you noticed
this person's tee shirt?

244
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:44,010
And it turned out they got it
wrong by a factor of about to,

245
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,320
about, they thought, say
a hundred people notice.

246
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,420
But 50 people noticed and across study
after study after study deal Lubitsch and

247
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,930
his colleagues have found
support for the spotlight effect,

248
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,730
which is that you believe that
people are noticing you all the time,

249
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,290
but they aren't. They're
busy noticing themselves. Um,

250
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,030
and this is actually a
useful thing to know.

251
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,590
Um, Gilovich got interested in this, um,

252
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,810
because he's interested in
the psychology of regret.

253
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,570
And it turns out that if you actually
asked dying people are really old people

254
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,470
basically, what do you
regret from your life? Um,

255
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,430
they regret the things as a
rule that they didn't try,

256
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,180
but when you asked them
why they didn't try it,

257
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,760
the answers tended to be I would look
silly and it turns out interesting to know

258
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,850
that people just don't care as
much as other people think you are.

259
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,500
You could take that as good
news or bad news. But um,

260
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,730
but the spotlight is not on
us as much as we think it is.

261
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,960
There's a second effect Gilovich
discovers called the transparency effect.

262
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,180
And the transparency effect
is quite interesting.

263
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,420
The transparency effect is that we believe
that we're more transparent than we

264
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:14,940
are.
I need somebody up here

265
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,070
who thinks that he or she is a bad liar.

266
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,440
Just I just need you
to say three sentences.

267
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,480
I'll even tell you what
it is ahead of time.

268
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm going to ask you three questions.
Have you been in London?

269
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,170
Do you have a younger sibling?
And do you like Sushi?

270
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,590
I want you to answer one
of those answers there.

271
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,080
I want you to lie about one of them.

272
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,340
The task will be for everybody else to
recognize and guess which one you're

273
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:53,070
lying about. Do you want to go? Yeah. And,

274
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,680
and I will even write down
which one you should lie.

275
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,350
So I want you to lie as to that number.

276
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,353
Okay.

277
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,640
Have you ever been in London?
No,

278
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,960
I am not going in London.
Do you have a younger sibling?

279
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,320
Do you like Sushi? No, I do not. See,

280
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,020
okay, let's have a vote. She
was lying of a, one of them

281
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,340
who votes for one?
Who Votes?

282
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,840
Who Votes for three? Pretty much
of a tie between two and three.

283
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,760
You could say which one you were lying.
Three.

284
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,530
The fact there are two
aspects of the effect.

285
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,330
One aspect is um,
people are actually quite good at lying.

286
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,260
It is a rare person who
couldn't stand up there and the,

287
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:07,790
and everybody would figure
out what they're lying about.

288
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,460
But the transparency of fact
is we don't feel that way.

289
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,700
We often feel like things bleed out of us.

290
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,110
And so people will systematically over
estimate the extent to which other people

291
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,610
notice their secrets.

292
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,910
And this is actually in general why it's
sometimes difficult to teach or to door

293
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:33,830
to tell stories because we constantly
overestimate how much other people know.

294
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,230
Um, we think of ourselves as
more transparent than we are.

295
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,630
A second social psychological
phenomena is you think you're terrific.

296
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,520
Um,

297
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,170
if I ask people how well are
you doing in intro psych,

298
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,660
uh, this semester and I asked you to
give yourself a percentage rating,

299
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,420
um,
relative to the rest of the class,

300
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,480
then if everybody was accurate or
at least not systematically biased,

301
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,540
the number should add to add up to 50%.
I mean,

302
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,570
roughly half of you are doing better
than average and roughly half of you are

303
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:12,740
doing worse than average.

304
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,190
It turns out though that people will
systematically and dramatically view

305
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:21,140
themselves as better than average.

306
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,890
They will view themselves as better than
average when asked how good they are as

307
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:29,330
a student, as a teacher, as her lover,

308
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,180
and particularly as a driver,

309
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,670
everybody who drives thinks that
he or she is a wonderful driver.

310
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,600
This has been called the lake woebegone
effect based on garrison Keillor's story

311
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,900
about place where all the
children are above average.

312
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,740
And the lake woebegone
effect in psychology involves
a systematic bias to see

313
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,570
ourselves as better than average.

314
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,440
What psychologists don't really know is
why the lake woebegone effect exists.

315
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,150
And there are a couple of proposals.
Um,

316
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:12,200
one is the nature of the
feedback we get. So, um,

317
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,120
so for a lot of aspects of your life,
you only get feedback when you're good.

318
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,670
When you do something good in a normal,
productive, healthy, happy environment,

319
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,800
people don't scream at you,
but how bad you're doing,

320
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,330
but they compliment how good you are.

321
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,070
And that could lead to an inflated self
esteem on the part of people in certain

322
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:35,600
domains. Another possibility is there's
different criteria for goodness.

323
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,020
Um, for a driver. For instance,

324
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,910
when I asked you to rank how
good you are as a driver, um,

325
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,930
what people often do is they think
they say I'm better than an average,

326
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,440
but what they do is they focus
on one aspect of their driving.

327
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,190
So some of you might say, Hey,
I'm just a great parallel Parker.

328
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,900
I'm a great driver. Others might
say, I'm very careful. Great driver.

329
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,800
Others might say, I take chances,
no one else will. Great driver.

330
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,110
But above and beyond that,

331
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,460
there does seem to be a psychological
effect manifested here in manifested

332
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:17,120
elsewhere, which is a motivation
to feel good about yourself.

333
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,370
You think you're important, which
is why the spotlight effect, um,

334
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,660
exists.
You think your thoughts bleed out,

335
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,910
which is why the
transparency effect exists.

336
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,050
But above and beyond that in a normal,
healthy mind,

337
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,000
you think you're terrific.
And so this shows up in all sorts of ways.

338
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,440
It shows up as well in what's
been called a self serving bias.

339
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,030
Half of you did above
average on the midterm,

340
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,690
half of you did below
average on the midterm.

341
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,960
But if I went up and asked each of you,
um,

342
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,040
why the answers would not be symmetrical,

343
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,970
people who did well in the midterm
would describe it in terms of their

344
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,600
capacities or abilities.
They'd say it's cause I'm smart,

345
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,060
hardworking,
brilliant.

346
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,920
People who did poorly would
say the midterm was unfair.

347
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,750
I was busy, I had better
things to do with my time. Um,

348
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,510
professors as well.
Um,

349
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,780
when people get papers accepted it
is because the papers are brilliant.

350
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,660
When they got them rejected it's because
there's a conspiracy against them by

351
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:33,590
jealous editors and reviewers.

352
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,800
There's this asymmetry all the time they
cemetery has been found in athletes and

353
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:40,820
CEOs and an accident reports.

354
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,750
And again this is a sort of a
positive enhancement technique.

355
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,520
You think that you're terrific
and because you're a terrific, um,

356
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,670
the good things that happened to you
are due to your terrific minus the bad

357
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,140
things are due to accident in misfortune.

358
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,050
The final aspect of self that I want to
talk about is the idea that what you do

359
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:07,740
make sense,

360
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,050
and this is one of the more interesting
sub domains of social psychology.

361
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,500
The idea was developed by
the social psychologist Leon
Festinger and it's called

362
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,180
cognitive dissonance theory.

363
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,640
And would Festinger was interested in was
the idea that what happens when people

364
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,700
experience an inconsistency in their
heads and he claimed it causes an

365
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:33,540
unpleasant emotional state.

366
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,900
What he described as dissonance and
he argued that we act so as to reduce

367
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:42,720
dissonance.
When there's a contradiction in our heads,

368
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,810
we're not happy and we'll take steps
to make the contradiction go away.

369
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,330
This all sounds very general,

370
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,680
but there are some striking demonstrations
of this and how it could work in

371
00:27:55,681 --> 00:28:00,350
everyday life. So it's
very simple example. Um,

372
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,210
is that is the confirmation bias.

373
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,800
Some of you are politically right wing.
Some of you are politically left wing.

374
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,380
If I asked you what magazines you read,

375
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,130
it turns out people who are right
wing read, right wing magazines,

376
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,880
people are left wing. We
left wing magazines. Um,

377
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,150
because people don't as a rule enjoy
getting information that disconfirms what

378
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:25,214
they believe in.

379
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,070
They want to have information that
confirms what they believe in and that

380
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:31,860
supports if you support Bush,

381
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,060
you're going to be looking for good news
about Bush. If you don't support them,

382
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:38,790
you'd be looking for bad news.
Um,

383
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,330
and this manifests itself in
all sorts of interesting ways.

384
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:50,280
I'll tell you about a very simple
experiment. Um, I, it was done by, um,

385
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,010
by Louisa Eagan here at Yale.

386
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,140
And it illustrates a point
which is going to end,

387
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,750
and I'll talk about real world
implications of this. It's very simple.

388
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,300
You have three m and m's.

389
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,910
You pretest to make sure the person
doesn't like any M and m more than the

390
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:11,430
other. There's three m
announced, who cares?

391
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,980
But then you ask them to choose between
two of them. So I suppose they choose,

392
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:21,480
uh, the red one. You got to choose
one. So they get to eat the red one.

393
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,700
Now they're offered you take the red one
away and now they're offered a choice

394
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:31,470
between the two remaining ones.
It turns out to a tremendous degree.

395
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,390
And you could imagine yourself in
that situation. They choose this one,

396
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,260
the one that wasn't the one they turn
now and the is that when you choose this,

397
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,040
in order to justify your decision,
you Denon great.

398
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,110
The one you didn't choose.

399
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,070
And so this one you didn't choose
is then tainted and you turn.

400
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,180
And then when compared to a third one,
you favor that third one.

401
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,193
Um,

402
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,780
what's particularly interesting
is you get this effect easily with

403
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:12,160
undergraduates, but you also get
with four year olds and with monkeys.

404
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,860
So the same denigration tends
to be more general. Well

405
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,600
that's a laboratory effect,

406
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,390
but there's some more interesting
manifestations of cognitive business.

407
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,280
One is the insufficient
justification effect,

408
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,560
which is so famous that had a cartoon
based on it. Um, the guys has,

409
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:39,160
why should I hire you as my,
as my consultant, the dog.

410
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,130
Some dog says I'll use my special,

411
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,090
the special process of cognitive
dissonance to improve employee morale.

412
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,060
How does it work?
Well,

413
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,790
when people are in an absurd situation,

414
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,850
their minds rationalize it by
inventing a comfortable illusion.

415
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,330
Not quite right when people
are having internal conflict,

416
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,170
when there's something uncomfortable.
That's, that's right. Um,

417
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,360
so it says that this person,

418
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,630
isn't it strange you have this dead end
job when you're twice as smart as your

419
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:12,010
boss. The hours are long,
the pay as mediocre. Nobody
respects your contribution,

420
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,760
yet you freely choose to work
here. It's absurd. No, wait,

421
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:20,350
there must be a reason I must work here
cause I love this work. I love this job.

422
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:25,750
This actually works. Um,
here's the classic experiment.

423
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:29,140
A Festinger gave two groups
of people are really boring.

424
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:31,990
Task paid one of them $20,

425
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,750
which back when this study
was done was real money,

426
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,900
gave another group of subjects $1,

427
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,010
which was insultingly small,
then asked them later,

428
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:43,600
what do you think of the task?

429
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:49,110
It turns out that the group that
had were paid a dollar rated,

430
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:53,950
the task is much more fun
than the group given $20.

431
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,860
So think about that for a moment.

432
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,060
You might have predicted it the other
way around a $20. Wow. Well, $20.

433
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:04,240
I must've enjoyed it cause I got $20.
But in fact,

434
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,990
the logic here is the people who have $20.
When asked,

435
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:11,950
what do you think of the task?
Could say it was boring.

436
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,870
I did it for $20.
The people paid $1.

437
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,010
We're like the character and the
Dilbert cartoon when paid a dollar.

438
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,330
Um, they, they said, well,

439
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,890
I don't want to be a donkey.

440
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:30,430
I don't want to be a sort of guy who
does this boring thing for a dollar.

441
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,830
It wasn't that bad, really.
It was kind of interesting.

442
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,180
I learned a lot to justify what they did.

443
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,540
This has a of real world implications.
Um,

444
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,370
Festinger did a wonderful study
with people, a group of people,

445
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:49,730
and he wrote this up in a book
called when prophecy fails,

446
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,600
who were convinced that
the world was going to end.

447
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,520
So they went on a mountain and
they waited for the world to end.

448
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,180
They had a certain time and date
when the world was going to end.

449
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,620
He hung out with them and then the
time passed and the world didn't end.

450
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,660
What people then said, and this
is what he was interested. So,

451
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,070
so people's predictions were totally
proven wrong and they stayed.

452
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:21,020
They left their families,
they gave away their houses,

453
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:23,630
they gave way older possessions,
they lost all their money.

454
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,310
But what Festinger found
was they didn't say,

455
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,560
God, I'm such a moron. Rather they said,

456
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,010
this is fantastic.
This is exactly,

457
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,160
this shows that us going to the mountain
has delayed the ending of the world and

458
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,590
this shows that we're doing
exactly the right things.

459
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:49,520
I couldn't have been smarter.
And in general,

460
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,960
when people devote a lot of energy
or money or expenses, something,

461
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,670
they are extraordinarily resistant
to having a proven wrong.

462
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,590
Now people have manipulated cognitive
dissonance in all sorts of ways.

463
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,060
And for instance, um, hazing,

464
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,900
hazing is cognitive dissonance at work.
Um,

465
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:15,980
fraternities and med schools
and other organizations,

466
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,080
haze people. What they do is when people
entered a group, they humiliate them,

467
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:22,130
they cause them pain,

468
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:26,210
they caused him various forms of
torture and unpleasantness. Why?

469
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,890
Well,

470
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,580
because it's very successful at
getting somebody to like the group.

471
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:39,200
If I join a fraternity, it
is also by the way, illegal.

472
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,310
So, but if I were to join
a fraternity and they say,

473
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,180
welcome to the fraternity, Dr
Loom here, have a mint and,

474
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,690
and then we have good time and
everything. I'm thinking, okay,

475
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,370
sounds like a fun idea.

476
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:58,180
But if I join a fraternity and they pour
cow poop on my head and make me make me

477
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:04,031
stand in the rain for a month wearing
candy hose while they throw rocks at me,

478
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,720
I even think it,
I think God,

479
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,720
I went through a lot of stuff
to get into this fraternity.

480
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,490
It must be really good. And
in fact, hazing through card,

481
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:22,130
inner dissonance draws the inference
that this is really, really valuable.

482
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,800
Um,
and this is why it exists.

483
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,620
If you are a political,
if you are running for office,

484
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,050
you will tend to have volunteers
and not necessarily pay people.

485
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,390
One reason, this is obvious,
it's cheaper not to pay people,

486
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,860
but the other reason is more interesting.
If you don't pay people,

487
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,870
they are more committed to the cause.
Again, it's cognitive dissonance.

488
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,290
If you pay me $10,000 a
month to work for you,

489
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,890
I'll work for you and I'll think
I'm doing it for $10,000 a month.

490
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:59,460
That makes a lot of sense.
But if I do it for nothing,

491
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,050
then I have asked myself, why am
I doing it? And I will conclude,

492
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,890
I must think very highly of you.
Um,

493
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,420
therapy for free tends
to be useless therapy.

494
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,910
This is one therapist asked for
money for all sorts of reasons,

495
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:19,050
including they like money.

496
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,520
But one reason why they asked for
money is if you don't pay for therapy,

497
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:26,370
you don't think it has any value.
You have to give up something.

498
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,960
So cognitive dissonance will lead you
then to think that what you are giving up

499
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:35,961
for has some value and then
you establish a liking for it.

500
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,530
Finally called her destination
shows up with children.

501
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,130
One of the most robust and replicated
findings in education or developmental

502
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:52,050
psychology is very simple.

503
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,620
You take two groups of kids and you ask
them to do something like draw pictures.

504
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,390
Half of the kids you reward,
maybe give them a sticker or a toy.

505
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,090
The other half you don't reward.

506
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Now according to a sort of a simple
minded view of operant conditioning and

507
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:17,010
behavior psychology,
the children you reward should do it more.

508
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,030
That's how operating conditioning works.
In fact though,

509
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,280
the children who you reward later on,

510
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:28,950
I think that this activity has less value
and they're less likely to do it when

511
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:30,330
there's no reward present.

512
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,310
And the idea again is the kids who don't
get rewarded say to themselves, well,

513
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:38,340
I just spend time doing it.
It must have an intrinsic value.

514
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,690
While the children who get rewarded,
say, I did it for the sticker,

515
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:45,240
I did it for the toy.
I don't care much for this.

516
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,060
And so rewarding children has a danger,

517
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,140
which is if you give them too much reward
and too much of value for what they're

518
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:56,550
doing, um, they will then
in grade the activity.

519
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,800
Now we need to be careful
here about what's going on.

520
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,640
It's not simple inconsistency. So go
back to this insufficient justification,

521
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,960
a effect.

522
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,490
So the doner group rated a task
is more fun than a $20 group.

523
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,620
And it's true. Each group needed a
justification for lying about the task.

524
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,310
Each group need a justification for
saying how interested in task was,

525
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,380
but they each had a justification. They
were each doing it for money after all.

526
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,920
So cognitive dissonance is
a little bit more subtle.

527
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:35,100
It's not just that there's a clash.
Rather,

528
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,300
um,

529
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,070
we adjust our belief to make ourselves
look more moral and rational than we are.

530
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,480
Go back to hazing.

531
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,830
There's a perfectly good reason why I
let them do all those things. To me,

532
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,790
I'm the sort of person who will
let people do those things. To me.

533
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,930
The problem is that's not
an answer I can live with.

534
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,120
So cognitive dissonance motivates me to
create an answer that's more comfortable

535
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:01,954
for me.

536
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:06,820
An answer such as this must be a really
wonderful group with a wonderful bunch

537
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:07,654
of people.

538
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,170
Okay.

539
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:14,280
And in other words, we are biased
to believe that we are terrific.

540
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,590
So to sum up,

541
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,930
there are three main findings about you
that come out from social psychology.

542
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,210
One is you believe everybody
notices you even when they don't.

543
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,210
You're,
you're the hero of your story.

544
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,810
The second one is you're terrific.

545
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,310
You are better than average in
every possible way, each one of you.

546
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,190
And finally, what you do make
sense. If it doesn't make sense,

547
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:47,070
you'll destroy. It doesn't make
sense, are more to the point.

548
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,290
If it's something that would,
that,

549
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:52,680
that you do that's foolish or makes
you look manipulative, are cheap,

550
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,810
um, you will distort it in your
head so that it does make sense.

551
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,040
I want to move now to how we
think about self and other,

552
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,080
how we think about ourselves relative
to how we think about other people.

553
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,580
And this brings us to the
notion of attribution.

554
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,590
Attribution is a claim about the
cause of somebody's behavior.

555
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,330
Um,
and

556
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,060
Hyder.

557
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,320
Now there's all sorts of
reasons for somebody's behavior.

558
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:33,100
Suppose as you insult me or
suppose you're very kind to me,

559
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,340
I could say you're a kind
person or you're a rude person.

560
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,400
I could say this must be
a great day for you are,

561
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:42,220
you must be a lot of stress under a
lot of stress. You must want something.

562
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,520
There's different sorts of
attributions we could make to people.

563
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,180
But hiders insight is we tend to
attribute other people's actions to their

564
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:54,340
personality characteristics,
to,

565
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:58,720
to longstanding aspects of what they are.

566
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,123
Okay.

567
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:06,190
And this is known as a person bias and
more generally people tend to give too

568
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:11,870
much weight to the person and not
enough weight to this situation.

569
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,870
This is also sometimes known as
the fundamental attribution error,

570
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,240
the fundamental attribution error,

571
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:25,800
which is one of the core
ideas in psychology is that
we tend to over attribute

572
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:30,801
things to a person's personality
or desires or nature.

573
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,463
Um,

574
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and not enough to the
situation or the context.

575
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,910
There's a lot of demonstrations of this.

576
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:48,350
A lot of demonstrations have to do
with intelligence. So for example,

577
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,380
there's that human studies showing
that people tend to overestimate the

578
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,230
intelligence of professors.
Why?

579
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,890
Because I stand up here and I talk about
the one or more than one thing I know

580
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:04,514
about.

581
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,080
And so it's easy to infer
that I must know a lot,

582
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,870
but in fact by the time this
semester ends, I will tell you,

583
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:13,430
told you everything I know.

584
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
And if you stood up and started
talking to everything you knew,

585
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,960
you'd look really smart too.

586
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,260
The best study to show
this is a quiz show study,

587
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,130
which is you take two
people and you flip a coin.

588
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,790
And one of them is the quiz master and
the quizmaster gets to ask questions,

589
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:38,540
any question he or she wants and the
other person has to answer the questions

590
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,760
and if they play seriously, the quizmaster
is going to destroy the other person.

591
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,950
You know,
what was my dog's name?

592
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,160
Well I dunno what's the capital of the
city in which I was born on? I don't know.

593
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,130
And then you'd expect a third person
watching this to say, who cares?

594
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,420
It's just they're just doing this because
of the coin. A flipped. But in fact,

595
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,450
when the person watching this
has to assess their intelligence,

596
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,630
they give the quiz asker a higher
intelligence rate and another person after

597
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,120
all, he seemed to know a lot of answers.
The other person didn't get much. Right.

598
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,020
We tend to fail to discount the situation.

599
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,890
If you are giving a job talk and the slot,

600
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,260
this is for people in graduate school,

601
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:27,800
particularly if you were given a job
talk in a slide, projector breaks,

602
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,880
you're screwed.
Nobody is going to say to themselves,

603
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,970
oh well it's not such a good talk
cause the slide projector broke.

604
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,710
They'll say it's not such a
good talk because if the person,

605
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,210
somebody could give a talk and we get
throw smarties at him the whole time and

606
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:45,380
then you could,
then other people would say,

607
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,480
the person will kind of
upset during the whole talk.

608
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,700
I wonder if they seem like a nervous type.
Um,

609
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,440
this can be taken to extremes.

610
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,390
And the biggest extreme
is the case of actors. Um,

611
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,670
which is if there's ever a case,
anybody know who this is? The actor

612
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,730
had,
none of you have been alive in 1950.

613
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,250
This is Robert Young does.
Anyway, no, the part he plays,

614
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:23,300
he played and he played a doctor called
Marcus Welby in this famous show,

615
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:24,710
Marcus Welby MD.

616
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,490
And Marcus Welby was a wonderful doctor.

617
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,550
He was compassionate and kind. He
made house calls, he saved lives,

618
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:33,780
he council people.

619
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,040
And it turned out that Robert
Young was then the luge with male,

620
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:43,130
thousands of pieces of mail by people
asking for his advice on health matters.

621
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,700
Um,
and he then in a twist,

622
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:50,670
exploited the fundamental
attribution error.

623
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,720
People confusing the actor for the role.
Um,

624
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,700
exploited this by going on TV.

625
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,200
And exposing the benefits of Sanka
decaffeinated coffee where he produced the

626
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,520
famous line. I am not a
doctor, but I play one on TV.

627
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,340
We're upon people heard it and said,
well,

628
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,950
he must have some authority
then about medical matters.

629
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,970
It turns out that the confusion
between actors and their roles is,

630
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:22,050
is extremely common. Um, many people,

631
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:22,920
for instance,

632
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:29,090
view Sylvester Stallone as
either an actual hero during
the Vietnam war are sort

633
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:35,190
of a hero during the Vietnam War, given
all this Rambo's stuff. But in fact,

634
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:39,420
of course he played, um, he was in
a Swiss boarding school teaching,

635
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,800
teaching girls, uh, age 12
to 15 during the Vietnam war.

636
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,180
But it doesn't seem that way
because the role in facts,

637
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,340
how we think about the person.
Um,

638
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,730
when this movie came out 20 years ago,

639
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,760
they needed a character to play a gay man
according to IMD be where I get all my

640
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:03,480
information. They hit up all the big
stars, Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas,

641
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:04,530
and Richard Gere.

642
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,080
And they all turned it down because
they didn't want to play a game at him

643
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,520
because people would
think that they were gay.

644
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,500
Friday they got Harry Hamlin to do it.
Who was kind of a fearless sorta guy.

645
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,330
The biggest extreme of the fundamental
attribution error confusing the actor for

646
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:23,220
his role is Leonard Nimoy,

647
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,700
who because he played the emotionless
Vulcan smock on star trek was then

648
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:34,860
repeatedly viewed by people who saw him
on the street as if he was an actual

649
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:36,000
Vulcan.
Um,

650
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,640
he got sufficiently upset about this
to write a book called I am not Spock,

651
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,880
where he described all the ways
in which he was not a Vulcan, um,

652
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,530
his career where he attempted many times
to play roles that were different from

653
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,870
his Vulcan nature.
I'm stalled until finally,

654
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:00,570
many years later he gave
up and wrote another book

655
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,690
called I am smock,

656
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,950
where he finally conceded to the
fundamental attribution error.

657
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,870
Um,
if I gave this lecture

658
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,450
10 years ago,

659
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,900
I would say that the
fundamental attribution error
is a human universal, um,

660
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:24,960
something that we're born with a
fundamental aspect of human nature.

661
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,350
This is not entirely true though.

662
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:33,470
And we know through some very interesting
cross cultural research that compares

663
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,150
these biases,
um,

664
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,780
across different countries in this study
between the United States and India.

665
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,530
And it turns out that for whatever reason,

666
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,130
and it would take another course to
talk about the different explanations,

667
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,520
but people start off as a age eight not
committing to fundamental attribution

668
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:58,384
error,

669
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,840
but in western cultures where there's
an ideology perhaps that people are in

670
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:08,860
charge of their own destiny, the error
occurs and people over attribute,

671
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,110
um,
the role to the person.

672
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,190
In some eastern cultures there's
more of a view about faith and more

673
00:48:17,191 --> 00:48:21,240
attributions to situation.
And this has been shown in many ways.

674
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,223
For instance,

675
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,800
if you look at newspaper reports about
murders in cultures like the United

676
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,070
States,

677
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:34,050
the report tends to emphasize the personal
characteristics of the person accused

678
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:36,690
of the murder.
In countries like India,

679
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:41,870
the reports tend to emphasize to a greater
degree the situation that the person

680
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:45,420
found himself in that might have
driven him to commit a murder.

681
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,800
So this is an important reminder that
just because we find something in our

682
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:54,650
culture and just because it
might well be pervasive, um,

683
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,670
doesn't mean necessarily
that it's universal.

684
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:03,860
Okay.

685
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,530
So to summarize so far, and we're going
to get just a little bit more, um,

686
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,040
for the rest of this lecture,

687
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,670
we've talked about two to
morals from social psychology.

688
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,800
One is enhancement of the self,

689
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,063
okay.

690
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,150
But the other is where you could call
over simplification of the other.

691
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:27,590
So we know ourselves that our behaviors
due to a complicated a cluster of the

692
00:49:28,921 --> 00:49:33,270
situation and our personal nature's
when things go badly, in fact,

693
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,260
we'll blame the situation
when things go well.

694
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:41,460
The self-serving attribution bias,
we'll, we'll credit ourselves.

695
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,380
We don't do this for other people, for
other people where a lot less forgiving.

696
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,930
You do something stupid, that's
you're a stupid person. Um,

697
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,630
I do something stupid.
It's an off day.

698
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,310
And so you have this difference between
how we think about ourselves and how we

699
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:00,720
think about other people.

700
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,580
Let's talk a little bit about what we
think about other people and start by

701
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:11,100
talking about why we like other people.

702
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,750
And hearing when are to some extent go
over material that was raised earlier in

703
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:19,560
the course, um, in Peter
Salovey's wonderful lecture.

704
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,360
So some of this are liking of
other people. It is obvious
and we talked about it.

705
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:26,580
It needs Salloway's lecture.

706
00:50:26,581 --> 00:50:30,140
We talked it when we talked
about sexual attractiveness. Um,

707
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,790
we like people who are honest, who are
kind, who are smart, who are funny.

708
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,233
Um,

709
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,580
but study after study finds more
fundamental processes are also at work.

710
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,340
And here's a list of three of
them. One is proximity. Um,

711
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:53,470
we tend to like people who
were close to physically,

712
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:59,210
who we are physically and spatially
close to who we spend a lot of time with.

713
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:00,463
Um,

714
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,050
in one study they looked at a
housing project in Manhattan
and they asked people,

715
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,960
um,
where their best friend was.

716
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,710
And 90% of them said,

717
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,810
my best friends in the same building as
me and 50% of them says the same floor.

718
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,450
Um, ask yourself, who's
your best friend at Yale?

719
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:26,330
For how many of you is it somebody
in your same college? Okay,

720
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:31,460
how many different college?
So call it a tie,

721
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,820
but then there's a lot more
colleges that aren't yours than one.

722
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,310
How many of you would you
say your best friend is?

723
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:42,120
Somebody you're currently
on your same floor? Yeah.

724
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,320
If you were gonna marry
somebody from this class,

725
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,300
it is the person you were sitting next to

726
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,910
now,
now,

727
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,513
now

728
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,810
in some sense this, this, this is an
incredibly, a rather trivial finding.

729
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:08,420
Of course you're going to
get more involved in people
you encounter frequently.

730
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:12,570
Um, you know, how else is it kind of
work. But it's actually more than that.

731
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,010
The more you see something,
the more you like it.

732
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,880
And this is sometimes known
as the mere exposure effect.

733
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:25,950
The mirror exposure effect is
simply seeing something, um,

734
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:30,570
makes it likable perhaps because
it becomes comfortable and safe.

735
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,570
In one study by James Cutting,

736
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,200
cutting Todd and introduction
to psychology course,

737
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,530
and before each lecture he'd
flashed pictures on the screen.

738
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:45,450
You'd have a screensaver showing pictures
on the screen paintings and wouldn't

739
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:47,160
say anything about him.
He will sit down,

740
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,940
look at them while they prepared her
notes at the end of the semester.

741
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,680
He then asked people to rate different
pictures as to how much they liked them.

742
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,650
And even though people had no memory,

743
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,150
I've seen one or versus the other.
Um,

744
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,080
they tend to like the pictures
more than they had seen before.

745
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,680
They were somehow familiar
and somehow more likable.

746
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,030
If I showed you a picture of yourself,
um,

747
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:20,090
versus a mirror image of yourself
and ask which one you'd like more,

748
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,270
the answer is very strong.
You'd like your mirror image more.

749
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,020
Cause the image is what you
tend to see from day to day.

750
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,630
If I showed you your best friend,

751
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,170
a picture of you versus a
mirror image picture of you,

752
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,400
your best friend would say he or she
likes to picture more because that

753
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:41,460
corresponds to what he
or she sees each day.

754
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:46,790
Familiarity is itself a desire
for liking a force for liking

755
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:56,010
similarity. Um, we like
people who are similar to us.

756
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,750
Um, friends tend to be highly
similar to one another.

757
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,960
So to husbands and wives.
Now to some extent,

758
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,590
similarity is hard to
pull apart from proximity.

759
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:13,310
So the fact that you're similar to your
friends at Yale might just be because

760
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,250
you're close to your friends at Yale
and people who are at Yale tend to be

761
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,050
fairly similar to one another.

762
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:24,470
But there's a lot of evidence
that similarity above and
beyond proximity has an

763
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:28,430
effect on attractiveness and unliking.
Um,

764
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:33,620
similarity predicts the success of a
marriage and through a phenomena people

765
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:38,040
aren't exactly sure about couples become
more and more similar over the course

766
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,770
of a relationship.
Finally,

767
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,860
people like good looking people,
people like attractive people,

768
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,760
um,
physically attractive,

769
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:55,530
people are thought to be smarter,
more competent, more social and nicer.

770
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,640
Now some of you who are very cynical and
or very good looking might wonder yes,

771
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:08,460
but good looking.
People like me actually are smarter,

772
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,940
more competent,
more social and morally better.

773
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,650
This is not a crazy response. Um, it,

774
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,660
it could be for instance,
that the advantages of being good looking,

775
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:25,410
make your life run a lot easier.
Teachers are more responsive to you.

776
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,180
People treat you better,

777
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,330
you have more opportunities to
make your way through the world.

778
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:35,310
You make more money, you have more
access to things. And that can turn, um,

779
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,020
caused you to improve your life.

780
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,940
This would be what's known in the
Bible as a Matthew effect. Uh,

781
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:46,290
Matthew effect is a
developmental psychology phrase
for the sort of thing where,

782
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:51,070
well, as Jesus said, for
an to everyone that has,

783
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:55,440
shall be given and he shall
have abundance. That means
if you're good looking,

784
00:55:55,470 --> 00:56:00,360
you'll also be smart. But from him
that hath not shall be taken away.

785
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:05,100
Even that which he hath, um, it's, it's,

786
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:09,780
it's a long version of the rich get richer
and the poor even lose what they have.

787
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,953
Um,

788
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:16,680
so there's a variety of studies
suggesting that teachers rate attractive

789
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:21,270
children as smarter and higher
achieving. Um, adults. Um,

790
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:26,040
think that when an ugly kid misbehaves,
it's because they have an ugly soul.

791
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,560
While an attractive kid.
Oh,

792
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,780
that little scamp somebody
must've been bothering them

793
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,150
when I was in University of
Arizona and we live next and all,

794
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,260
I remember my neighborhoods,

795
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:42,790
we lived next to this little
boy and his name was Adonis.

796
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,910
Cute Kid. Come on. Um,
also in mock trials,

797
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:51,520
judges give longer prisons
and it's just ugly people.

798
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,700
That's the Matthew effect.
It,

799
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,600
those who have little get even that
taken away and thrown into prison.

800
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,760
There was a reason study,
which I'll tell you about,

801
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,080
but I am not comfortable
with it as an experiment.

802
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:12,560
The study observed people in, in
a, in a shopping and in, in the,

803
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:14,710
in the parking lot of um,

804
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,800
of a supermarket and found that parents
were a lot refer to the kids if their

805
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:21,940
kids are ugly,

806
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,950
then if the kids are good looking and
they attributed it to the fact that for

807
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:30,960
all sorts of reasons, to ugly kid
just matters less to the parent. Um,

808
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:35,980
I was watching a poker game once
on TV and somebody who lost said,

809
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,790
and I quote,
they beat me like an ugly stepchild.

810
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,560
And the fate of the ugly stepchild
is in fact not a very good fate.

811
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,550
But this is not a good
study for one thing,

812
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,060
and I don't know how to phrase
this in a politically correct way,

813
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:56,890
but the parents have ugly kids are
likely to themselves be ugly people.

814
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,920
And maybe what they're
finding is just ugly.

815
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:02,770
People are more violent
than good looking people.

816
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,840
This is an excellent
time to stop the lecture.

817
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,520
So I'm going to stop the lecture and
we're going to continue social psychology

818
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,720
on Wednesday.
