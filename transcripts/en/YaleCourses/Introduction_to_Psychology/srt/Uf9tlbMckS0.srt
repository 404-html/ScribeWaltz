1
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,410
This class today is about language
and language is to a large extent,

2
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:20,970
um,

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,110
where the action is.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,360
The study of human language has been the
battleground over different theories of

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,194
human nature.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,480
So every philosopher or a psychologist
or humanist or neuroscientists who has

7
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:38,481
ever thought about people has had to
make some claim about the nature of

8
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,900
language and how it works.

9
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm including here people
like Aristotle and Plato,

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:43,561
Hume,

11
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,340
lock,

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,570
Freud and Skinner.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,070
I'm also including modern day
approaches to computational theory,

14
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,450
cognitive neuroscience,

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,150
evolutionary theory and
cultural psychology.

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,260
Um,

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,790
if you hope to make it with a theory
of what people are and how people work,

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,760
you have to explain and
talk about language.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,510
Um,

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,961
in fact,

21
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:08,430
language is sufficiently interesting
that unlike most other things I'll talk

22
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,510
about in this class,

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,190
there is an entire field devoted to it.

24
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:17,191
Study the field of linguistics that is
entirely devoted to studying the nuances

25
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,430
and structures of different languages.

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,570
Now,

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,111
our first,

28
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,930
before getting the details
make a definitional point.

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,940
When I'm talking about language,

30
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:31,941
I meaning a systems like English and
Dutch and wall Perri and Italian and

31
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,780
Turkish and Urdu.

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,110
And what we've seen and heard right
now in class and a demonstration that

33
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,050
proceeded,

34
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,200
uh,

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
the formal lecture.

36
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,323
Um,

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,810
now you could use language
in a different sense.

38
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,050
You could use no term language to describe
what dogs do or with chimpanzees do

39
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,930
our birds.

40
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,120
You could use language to describe music,

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,130
talk about immune musical language
or art or any communicative system.

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,590
And there's absolutely
nothing wrong with that.

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,890
There's no rule about how you're
supposed to use the word language.

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,810
But the problem is if you use the word
language impossibly incredibly broadly,

45
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,940
then from a scientific point of view,

46
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:15,060
it becomes useless to ask
interesting questions about it.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,860
If language can again refer to just
about everything from English to traffic

48
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,694
signals,

49
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,480
then we're not going to be able to find
interesting generalizations or do good

50
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,440
science about it.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,300
So what I want to do is I want to discuss
a scientific notion of language at

52
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:35,301
first restricting myself to systems
like English and Dutch and American sign

53
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,730
language and Navajo and so on.

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,590
Once we've made some generalizations
about language in this narrow sense,

55
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,770
we could then ask and we will ask to what
extent do other systems such as animal

56
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,460
communication systems,

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,533
um,

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,760
relate to this narrower definition.

59
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,070
So we could ask him this narrow sense,

60
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,160
what properties do languages have and
then go on to ask in a broader sense what

61
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,490
other communicative systems
also possess those properties.

62
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,121
Well,

63
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,890
some things are obvious about language.

64
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,053
Um,

65
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,410
so,

66
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:08,980
um,

67
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,340
here's,

68
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,780
here are the questions we will ask.

69
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,790
This will frame our discussion today.

70
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,340
We'll first go over some
basic facts about language.

71
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,320
We'll talk about what language is share,

72
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,650
we'll talk about how language develops
and we'll talk about language and

73
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,600
communication in nonhumans.

74
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,210
I began this class who have a,

75
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:30,211
a demonstration of that that illustrates
two very important facts about

76
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,224
language.

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,380
One is that language is all share
some deep and intricate universals in

78
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,001
particular.

79
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:45,001
All languages at minimum are powerful
enough to convey an abstract notion like

80
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:49,000
this abstract in the sense that it talks
about thoughts and it talks about our

81
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,800
proposition and and,

82
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,081
and,

83
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:53,380
and spatial relations and objects.

84
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,240
There is no language in the world that
you just cannot talk about abstract

85
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,820
things with every language can do this.

86
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,050
But the demonstration also illustrated
another fact about language,

87
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,610
which is how different languages are.

88
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,350
They sound different.

89
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,150
If you know one language,

90
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,740
you don't necessarily know another.

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,220
It's not merely that
you can't understand it.

92
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,660
It could sound strange or or or look
unusual in the case of a sign language.

93
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,410
And so there any adequate theory of
language has to allow for both the

94
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:29,710
commonalities and the
differences across languages.

95
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,150
And this is the puzzle faced by the
psychology and cognitive science of

96
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:34,984
language.

97
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,220
Well,

98
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,180
let's start with an interesting claim
about language made by Charles Darwin.

99
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,860
So Darwin rights man has an instinctive
tendency to speak as we see in the

100
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,890
babble of our young children.

101
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,400
While no child has an
instinctive tendency to bake,

102
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,270
brew or right.

103
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,360
And what Darwin is claiming here,

104
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,700
and it's a controversial
and interesting claim,

105
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,300
is that language is special
in that there's some sort
of propensity or capacity

106
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:05,770
or instinct for language.

107
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,020
Unlike the other examples,

108
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:08,854
he gifts,

109
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,990
not everything comes natural to us,

110
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,110
but Darwin suggests
that language does well.

111
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,310
Why should we believe this?

112
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,223
Well,

113
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,250
there are some basic facts
that support Darwin's claim.

114
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,600
Um,

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,200
for one thing,

116
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,921
every normal,

117
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:28,921
every human society has language
in the course of traveling.

118
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,730
Cultures encounter other cultures and
they often encounter cultures that are

119
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,980
very different from their own.

120
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,350
But through the course of human history,

121
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:42,490
nobody has ever encountered another group
of humans that did not have language.

122
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,190
Does this show that is built in?

123
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,451
Well,

124
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,560
not necessarily.

125
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,230
It could be a cultural innovation.

126
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,581
It could be,

127
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,061
for instance,

128
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:57,061
that language is such a good idea that
every culture comes across and develops

129
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,664
it.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Just about every culture uses some sort
of utensils to eat food with a knife and

131
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:04,660
a fork,

132
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,960
chopsticks a spoon.

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,433
Um,

134
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,770
this probably is not because use of,

135
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:10,850
of eating utensils,

136
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:11,780
it's human nature,

137
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,100
but rather it's because it's just a very
useful thing that culture is discover

138
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,750
over and over again.

139
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,461
Well,

140
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:23,000
we know that this probably is
not true with regard to language.

141
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,970
And one reason we know
this is because of the,

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,300
the demonstrated,

143
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,313
um,

144
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,330
case studies where a language is
created within a single generation.

145
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,010
And these case studies
have happened over history.

146
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,370
The client that the standard example is,

147
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:43,610
um,

148
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,590
people involved in the slave trade.

149
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,130
The slave trade revolving around tobacco
or cotton or coffee or sugar would tend

150
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:55,730
to mix slaves and labors from
different language backgrounds in part

151
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,030
deliberately so as to avoid
the possibility of revolt.

152
00:06:59,650 --> 00:06:59,870
Um,

153
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,260
what would happen is these people who
were in slave from different cultures

154
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,250
would develop a makeshift communication
system so they could talk to one

155
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,060
another.

156
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,470
And this is called a pigeon,

157
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,660
Piv Gin,

158
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,583
a pigeon.

159
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,700
Um,

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,990
and this pigeon was how they were talk
and this pigeon was not a language,

161
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:21,890
it was strings of words borrowed from
the different languages around them and

162
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,080
put together and sort of haphazard ways.

163
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,360
The question is what happens to the
children who are raised in this society?

164
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,160
And you might expect it that they
would come to speak a pigeon,

165
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,690
but they don't.

166
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,320
What happens is in the course
of a single generation,

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,480
they develop their own language.

168
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,610
They create a language with rich syntax
and morphology and more and phonology

169
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,340
terms that will understand
in a few minutes.

170
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,600
Um,

171
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,550
and this language that they create is
called a cradle and languages that we know

172
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,100
now as creoles.

173
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,770
Um,

174
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,600
the word refers back to their history.

175
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,420
That means that they were
developed from pigeons.

176
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,890
Um,

177
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,390
and this is interesting cause this
suggest that to some extent the ability to

178
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:11,540
use and understand and learn
languages part of human nature.

179
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,740
It doesn't require an extensive cultural
history rather just about any normal

180
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:20,720
child even when not exposed to a full
fledge language can create a language.

181
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,320
And more recently there's been case
studies of children who acquire sign

182
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,164
language.

183
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,490
Um,

184
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,280
there was a wonderful case
of Nicaraguan sign language,

185
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,120
um,

186
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,770
where they acquire sign language from
adults who themselves are not versed in

187
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,580
sign language.

188
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,830
They're sort of second language learners
struggling along what you might've

189
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,110
expected would be the children would
then use whatever system they're adults

190
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,650
use,

191
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,483
but they don't,

192
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,420
they creole lies it.

193
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,950
They take this makeshift communication
system developed by adults and again,

194
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,070
they turn it into a full blown language
suggesting that to some extent it's part

195
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:00,540
of our human nature to create languages.

196
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,430
Um,

197
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,960
also every normal human has language.

198
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,750
Not everybody in this
room can ride a bicycle.

199
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,600
Not Everybody in this room can play chess,

200
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,200
but everybody possesses at least one
language and everybody started to possess

201
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,160
at least one language.

202
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,730
Um,

203
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,810
when they were a child.

204
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,030
There are exceptions,

205
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,840
but the exceptions come about
due to some sort of brain damage.

206
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,030
Any neurologically normal human
will come to possess a language.

207
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,790
What else do we know?

208
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,773
Well,

209
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,260
the claim that language is part of human
nature is supported by neurological

210
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:43,020
studies,

211
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,440
some which were referred to in the
chapter on the brain that you read earlier

212
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,770
that talk about dedicated
parts of the brain,

213
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,730
um,

214
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,140
that work for language.

215
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,690
And if parts of these brains as parts,

216
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,410
if these parts of the brain are damaged,

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you get language deficits or or aphasias
where you might lose the ability to

218
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:04,410
understand or create language.

219
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,490
Um,

220
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,920
more speculatively.

221
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,900
There has been some fairly recent work
studying the genetic basis of language,

222
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,050
looking at the genes that are directly
responsible for the capacity to learn and

223
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:20,514
use language.

224
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,070
And one bit of evidence that these genes
are implicated is that some unfortunate

225
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:31,050
people have point mutations in these
genes and such people are unable to learn

226
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,280
and use language.

227
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,510
So in general there was some support
at least at a very broad level for the

228
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:38,791
claim.

229
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,820
That language is in some
sense part of human nature.

230
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,421
Well,

231
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,770
what do we mean by language?

232
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,110
What are we talking about
when we talk about language?

233
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:47,310
We don't want to restrict ourselves.

234
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,141
For instance,

235
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:49,440
the English or French.

236
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,590
What do all languages share?

237
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,443
Well,

238
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,840
all languages are creative

239
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,080
and this means a couple of things.

240
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,990
One meaning is the meaning,

241
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,650
um,

242
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,540
emphasized by Rene Descartes when Rene
Descartes argued that we are more than

243
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,680
merely machines.

244
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,060
His best piece of evidence for him
was the human capacity for language.

245
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,010
No machine could do this because our
capacity for language is unbounded and

246
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,844
free.

247
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,910
We could say anything we choose to say
we have free will and in fact language

248
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,140
allows us to produce a
virtual infinity of sentences.

249
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,250
Um,

250
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,430
so we could create an understand sentences
we never heard before and there are a

251
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,470
lot of sentences.

252
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,320
So if you want to estimate how many
grammatical sentences under 20 words in

253
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:46,110
English to answer is a lot.

254
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,663
Um,

255
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,910
and what this means is that any
theory of language use and language

256
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:58,690
comprehension cannot
simply appeal to a list.

257
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,190
Yeah.

258
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,660
When you understand the sentence,

259
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:05,830
I said you have to have the capacity to
understand the sentence even if you've

260
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:06,940
never heard it before.

261
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,350
And this is because we get effortlessly
produced and understand sentences that

262
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:15,160
no human has ever said before on earth.

263
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,300
Okay.

264
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,660
Would anybody volunteer to
say a sentence non obscene,

265
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,580
non derogatory but has never
been spoken before on earth ever.

266
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,693
Okay.

267
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,020
Here I'll,

268
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,853
I'll start.

269
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,783
Um,

270
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,590
it's surprisingly easy to get a purple
tie on Ebay if you don't care much about

271
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,424
quality.

272
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,270
I could imagine no one else in the world.

273
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,133
He said this before.

274
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,743
Um,

275
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,800
I am upset that one cannot easily
download Buffy the vampire slayer through

276
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:51,634
iTunes.

277
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,383
Now.

278
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,220
Now there's possible somebody
said both those sentences before.

279
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,270
Um,

280
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,120
but you probably have not heard them,

281
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,080
but you understand them immediately.

282
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,120
So how do you do it?

283
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,073
Well,

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,450
okay,

285
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,330
you have rules,

286
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,800
you have rules in your head.

287
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,140
You've learnt what the words mean,

288
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,150
but you have abstract and unconscious
rules that take these words,

289
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,640
figure out the order and in a fraction
of a second give rise to understanding.

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,710
And that's the sort of
thing linguists study.

291
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,430
So take some standard examples
from the linguistic study of um,

292
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,723
of English.

293
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,930
And bear in mind,

294
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,420
the rules we're talking
about here are not rules.

295
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,500
You explicitly know.

296
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,250
They're automatic rules of the same
sort we're going to talk about in the

297
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:44,251
context of visual perception in that
they're implicit and unconscious and not

298
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:45,850
accessible to,

299
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,860
to explicit understanding.

300
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,520
Um,

301
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,360
so for instance,

302
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:49,900
um,

303
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,870
immediately you read
the pig is eager to eat

304
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,320
versus the pig is easy to eat
and then a fraction of a second,

305
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,154
you know,

306
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,960
there's an important difference.

307
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,730
The pig is eager to eat means,

308
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,360
uh,

309
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,290
the state of affairs that we're talking
about is when to pig does the eating the

310
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,080
pig is easy to eat is when
the pig is being eaten.

311
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,940
You see a sentence like,

312
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,920
Bill knew that John liked him.

313
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,871
And you know,

314
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:18,310
without even knowing how,

315
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:19,144
you know,

316
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,470
did this can mean that bill
knew that John Liked bill?

317
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,620
Or it could mean that
bill knew that John Liked,

318
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,280
uh,

319
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,150
Fred.

320
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,450
But it can't mean that bill
knew that John Liked John.

321
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,680
The natural interpretation factors
that bill knew that John like bill,

322
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,840
the two words co refer.

323
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,560
Contrast that with bill knew
that John Liked himself,

324
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,450
which only has to meaning.

325
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,830
Bill knew that John like John,

326
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,530
and this is what
linguists do for a living.

327
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,170
So if you hear me talking
with them and say,

328
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,110
I want to spend the next 40 years of my
life studying that you should become a

329
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:54,830
linguist.

330
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,663
Um,

331
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,840
but that's the sort of,

332
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:59,510
those are the sort of phenomenon
that we're interested in.

333
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,670
Now it gets more complicated.

334
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:03,560
Those are examples from syntax,

335
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,690
but language has many structures.

336
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,620
Language has structures going
from the bottom to the top,

337
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,150
all languages,

338
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,390
all human languages have phonology,

339
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,140
which is the system of
sounds or science morphology,

340
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,140
which is a system of words or morphemes
basic units of meaning and syntax which

341
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:31,670
refer to rules and principles that
put together words and phrases into

342
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,350
meaningful utterances.

343
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,940
And I want to talk briefly about each
of these three parts of language before

344
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,540
looking at some other issues.

345
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,320
Um,

346
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm indebted here to Steven
Pinker's excellent book,

347
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,490
the language instinct,

348
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,400
which provides I think a superb
discussion of these phenomena.

349
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,980
And I'm going to steal some
of my examples from pinker.

350
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,740
So phonology,

351
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,420
phonology is the system of
sounds that languages have.

352
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,773
Um,

353
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,193
okay.

354
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,330
There's a subset,

355
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:13,590
there's a list of finite list of
possible sounds that language can use.

356
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,250
I'm going to put aside for the moment
the question of sign languages and how

357
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:17,701
they work.

358
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,590
We'll talk about them in a little bit.

359
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,820
Um,

360
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,170
the idea is that English has
about 40 of these phonemes.

361
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,440
So if you're a native
monolingual speaker of English,

362
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,330
you hear speech and each sound you hear
is categorized as falling into one of

363
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:34,164
those 40,

364
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,950
um,

365
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,910
morphemes sorry,

366
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,744
phonemes.

367
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,673
Um,

368
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,700
so for example,

369
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:43,701
English has a phoneme of
Maror l and a phoneme of our,

370
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,170
and so an English speaker can hear the
difference between lip and rip and that

371
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,330
corresponds to two
different words in English.

372
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,180
Other languages don't
have that distinction.

373
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,710
And so those,

374
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:03,630
those distinctions are very difficult
for non native English speakers to learn.

375
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,270
So part of what goes on when you learn
is you have to learn the language,

376
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:09,870
um,

377
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,060
the phonemes that your language has.

378
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,110
Um,

379
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,470
another part of the problem
of learning languages,

380
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,070
you have to figure out what the
boundaries are between the words.

381
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,940
You have to use sound signals to figure
out the boundaries between the words.

382
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,360
Now that if the only language
you've ever heard his English,

383
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,410
that's going to seem like a really weird
example of a problem because you're

384
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:32,700
listening to me speak.

385
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,770
And in between each of my words,

386
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:35,850
you're hearing a pause.

387
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,530
Don't have to be very smart to figure
out where one word begins and one word

388
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:41,364
ends.

389
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,980
But the pause is a psychological illusion.

390
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,110
If you were to talk into an
oscilloscope that measured your sound,

391
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,200
there are no pauses between the words.

392
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,620
Rather the pauses are
inserted by your mind,

393
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:56,790
um,

394
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,660
as you already know where one
word begins and another one ends,

395
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,180
and you insert a pause at that point,

396
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,900
um,

397
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,920
you could see this.

398
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,400
When you hear a language
you don't already know.

399
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,160
So for those of you who have
never heard French before,

400
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,610
when you hear somebody say [inaudible],

401
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,420
you could say remarkable French
has no pauses between words.

402
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,650
Um,

403
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,011
and you,

404
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,930
and now a French speaker of course,

405
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,290
hears Juna set par for Hebrew.

406
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,000
I know one sentence in Hebrew,

407
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,273
[inaudible] copy,

408
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,761
AFO,

409
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:29,700
habitual Mousse,

410
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,220
which I think is a
request for the bathroom.

411
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,360
Um,

412
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,100
but if you don't know Hebrew,

413
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:36,120
there's no pauses.

414
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,210
And the truth is when you
each gave your demonstrations,

415
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,300
nobody spoke properly
because nobody spoke at,

416
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:42,960
Oh,

417
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,381
here's the,

418
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,800
here's the sand glory,

419
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,540
fennel,

420
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,590
smug wiggle.

421
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,761
Rather,

422
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:48,860
you all sounded like Boobie,

423
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,100
Boobie,

424
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,370
Boobie,

425
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,150
boobie without any pauses.

426
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,460
Because I don't know your languages.

427
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,860
Children come into the world without
knowing any specific language.

428
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,930
And so they have to learn,

429
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:01,860
um,

430
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,693
pauses.

431
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,120
They have to learn to
interpret sounds in context.

432
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:06,900
Um,

433
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,970
and sometimes they make mistakes,

434
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,390
they get problems of segmentation.

435
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,980
And there's some illustrations you could
see the mistakes after trying to repeat

436
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,220
back something that's already
known within a society.

437
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,020
So songs are a good example.

438
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,850
These are excerpts from children.

439
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,863
Um,

440
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,490
I'll never be your pizza Vernon.

441
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,900
Anybody know,

442
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,160
pick her up with that corresponds to

443
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,741
beast of burden.

444
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:32,574
Very good.

445
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,010
A girl have collitus goes by

446
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,963
somebody.

447
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,161
The answer,

448
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,960
my friends that are blowing in the wind

449
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,053
and,

450
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,470
and this is a religious one.

451
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,880
Our father was Barton Heaven.

452
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:56,740
Harold be thy name lead
us not into Penn station.

453
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:57,574
Yeah.

454
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,990
Now phonological understanding illustrates
all sorts of aspects of language

455
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:07,790
processing and in fact of consciousness.

456
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,750
Because remember I said
that typically when you,

457
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:12,350
um,

458
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,110
when you hear a sentence you make,

459
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,560
do you manufacturer in your
mind gaps between the words?

460
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,873
Um,

461
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,970
typically when there's
something which is unclear,

462
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,260
you'll fill in the gap and
figure out what the word is.

463
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,520
And you'll hear it that way.

464
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,230
So there's a few examples.

465
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,590
The best examples again
are for when it goes wrong.

466
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,160
So classic example is from the
Song Super Freak by Rick James.

467
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,590
I got a big lecture of
a copyright laws and,

468
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,460
and this is going to violate most of them.

469
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,643
Um,

470
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,100
Rick James is going to be sitting on no
at steering at the web two years from

471
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:51,401
now saying,

472
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:51,760
Hey,

473
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,593
that's my thing.

474
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,380
Okay.

475
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,720
So I want you to listen to this line.

476
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm sure.

477
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm sure most of you
have heard this before.

478
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,980
Um,

479
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,990
but I want you to listen closely.

480
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,830
What was that last line?

481
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,180
The kind of girl you read about?

482
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,360
Well,

483
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,550
it turns out that nobody really knows.

484
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,713
Um,

485
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,750
and it sounds to many people who do top
down interpretation as to meet as well,

486
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,670
that she used to kind of go,

487
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,990
you read about in Newsweek magazine,

488
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:37,010
but that makes no sense at all given that
you don't want to bring home to mamma

489
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:39,930
and she's just not the end.

490
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:40,764
In fact,

491
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,980
if you check the notes on a song,

492
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,430
she's in fact the kind of girl you
read about in new wave magazines.

493
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,810
Now when you listen to it,

494
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:56,811
then again knowing that
you hear it that way.

495
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,980
Now this top down,

496
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,990
this is known as top down processing,

497
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,980
top down processing is an example of um,

498
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,980
when you know what something is,

499
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,150
you hear it that way.

500
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,760
And this is extremely useful
when it comes to filling in gaps,

501
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,910
um,

502
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,130
in,

503
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,410
in,

504
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,370
in the sounds,

505
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,080
in normal conversation.

506
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:23,230
If I'm just to say,

507
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:24,360
I said endurance.

508
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,700
Yeah,

509
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,830
you won't hear that as it cough.

510
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,080
Rather you hear a sentence,

511
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,580
you fill in the gap.

512
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,540
Um,

513
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,160
this can lead to problems.

514
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,210
The problem is led to in my life
revolves around the song get crunk.

515
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,433
Um,

516
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,350
because because,

517
00:22:42,351 --> 00:22:42,501
um,

518
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,050
I heard get crunk and,

519
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:44,750
and um,

520
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,060
my children asked me if I would buy them,

521
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,410
get crunk from iTunes.

522
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,980
My children are eight and
10 and now now get crunk.

523
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,250
As I was aware from
having heard it before,

524
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,810
involves a consistent refrain
of get crunk extremely bad word,

525
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,730
get crunk extremely bad word.

526
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,230
And so I said No.

527
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,251
And then they said,

528
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:04,371
well,

529
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,670
there's a clean version of,

530
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,050
so I downloaded the clean version.

531
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,980
Um,

532
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,060
unfortunately,

533
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,830
knowing what the clean version,

534
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,470
knowing what the word is means to me.

535
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,780
The clean version is not very clean.

536
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,810
Now I will add,

537
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,883
I will add

538
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,760
before people write letters and stuff.

539
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,980
This is the clean version.

540
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,660
Thank,

541
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,090
thank goodness they took
away that I've seen work.

542
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,833
Okay.

543
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,290
So top down processing affects how we
hear things usually almost always the

544
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,124
better.

545
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,323
And in fact,

546
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,320
this is a theme we're going to return
to next class when we talk about vision

547
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,380
because the same thing's
going to happen there.

548
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,130
Um,

549
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,390
how we see the world is often
confusing and be fuddle.

550
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,930
But what we know can clear things up.

551
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,130
Same with sound.

552
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,540
Morphology is the next level up.

553
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:14,780
Phonology is sounds morphology as words
and human language uses this amazing

554
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:17,214
trick,

555
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,103
um,

556
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,590
described by Ferdinand de.

557
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,191
So sir,

558
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:23,370
the great linguist as the
arbitrariness of the sign.

559
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,120
And what this means is we can use,

560
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,550
take any arbitrary idea in the world,

561
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,760
the idea of a chair or a story or a
country and make a sound or assigned to

562
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:37,344
connect to it.

563
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,270
And the link is arbitrary.

564
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,460
I mean you might choose to use the word
for dog as wolf wolf cause it sounds

565
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:45,294
like a dog,

566
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,950
but you can't use a word for
country that sounds like a country.

567
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,990
You could use a sign
language thing for um,

568
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,910
for drink that looks sort
of like the act of drinking,

569
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,440
but you can't use a sign language word
for country that looks like a country or

570
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,270
for idea that looks like an idea.

571
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,250
So way language has work is it
allows for arbitrary naming.

572
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,190
It allows for this map between a symbol,

573
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,190
say a spoken word and uh,

574
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,580
any sort of thought we want to use.

575
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,800
And those arbitrary mappings as we come
to learn them make up the vocabulary of

576
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:23,634
a language.

577
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,853
MMM.

578
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm talking about words,

579
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,550
but the more technical term is morphine.

580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,260
And what a morpheme is,

581
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,440
is the smallest meaningful
unit in a language.

582
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,800
Now often this is the
same thing as a word.

583
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,740
So dog is a word and
dog is also a morphine,

584
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,400
but not always because
there a single morphemes.

585
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,050
And then there are words that
are composed of many more themes.

586
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,750
So dogs and complained our one word,

587
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,890
but to morphemes.

588
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,240
And what this means is that you make the
word by putting together two morphemes

589
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,720
to put it differently.

590
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,090
In order to know what dogs means,

591
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,580
you never had to learn the word dogs.

592
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
All you had to know is the word dog and
the plural morpheme s and you could put

593
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,680
them together to create a word.

594
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,670
How many morphemes does
the average speaker?

595
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:19,504
Now,

596
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,840
um,

597
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,180
the answer is fairly startling.

598
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,510
The average speaker knows as a low
ball estimate about 60,000 words.

599
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,600
I think the proper estimate is
closer to 80,000 or 100,000.

600
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,530
What this means,

601
00:26:35,531 --> 00:26:36,850
if you average it out,

602
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,690
is that since children start learning
their first words that about their first

603
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:41,620
year of life,

604
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,703
um,

605
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,730
they about nine new words a day.

606
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,410
And it's not a continuous,

607
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,430
uh,

608
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,840
nine words every day.

609
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,150
It goes up and down depending on the age.

610
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,240
But still the amount of
words we know is staggering.

611
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,570
How many of you know more than
one language pretty fluidly?

612
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:02,790
Okay?

613
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,590
Those of you who know other languages
might have in your heads 200,000 words or

614
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:08,910
300,000 words,

615
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,000
and you're accessing them
in a fraction of a second,

616
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,950
it,

617
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,060
it is legitimate,

618
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,430
could legitimately be seen as
one of the most astonishing,

619
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,543
um,

620
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,800
things that people do.

621
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,931
Finally,

622
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,770
Syntax.

623
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,130
So we have the sound system of language,

624
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:27,030
the phonology,

625
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,430
we have the words of a language,

626
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,450
their morphology,

627
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,620
but all of that gives
you his dog cup chair,

628
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,790
House story,

629
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:40,560
idea that won't allow us to
communicate complicated ideas.

630
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,280
So the final step in the story is syntax.

631
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,610
And Syntax refers to those rules and
principles that allow us to combine words

632
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:55,521
into phrases and phrases and descendants
and syntax uses another neat trick.

633
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,840
And this is defined by Belheim von Humbolt
as the infinite use of finite media.

634
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,090
So here's the question.

635
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,370
Your vocabulary is finite.

636
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,230
There are just so many words.

637
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,370
You have to learn them one by one,

638
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:12,940
okay?

639
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,120
But you could produce a
virtual infinity of sentences.

640
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,890
How can you do that?

641
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,610
How can you go from a
finite list of symbols to an
infinite number of sentences?

642
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,290
And the answer is you have
a common editorial system.

643
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:30,821
Now,

644
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:35,821
language is not the only thing in
culture or nature that has a sort of

645
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:37,030
combination tutorial system.

646
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:37,780
Um,

647
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,030
music also has a common tutorial system.

648
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,980
There's a finite number of notes,

649
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:44,530
but a limitless number
of musical compositions.

650
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,740
DNA also has this sort of common tutorial
system where you have a finite number

651
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:52,660
of,

652
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,640
I guess bases are amino acids that
could combine to a possible infinity of

653
00:28:57,641 --> 00:28:58,480
strings,

654
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,251
uh,

655
00:28:59,251 --> 00:28:59,520
of,

656
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,610
of DNA strings.

657
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,290
So how does this happen?

658
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:06,780
Well,

659
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,140
infinity mechanism,

660
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,730
and many of you will be familiar with
this from mathematics or computer science

661
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
is recursion.

662
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,970
And there's a lot to be said about this,

663
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,270
but it can be pretty simply
illustrated in language.

664
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,030
So here's an example of a simple language.

665
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,860
It's not,

666
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,400
it's actually close to how linguist
described normal languages,

667
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,540
but it's very simple.

668
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,310
It has three nouns.

669
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,970
Fred Barney and woman and two verbs
thinks and likes the very simple language.

670
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,520
And one rule.

671
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,970
And the way to this rule is you
make a sentence by taking a noun,

672
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,553
any noun,

673
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,240
putting a verb after it.

674
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,790
And then following that verb with a noun.

675
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,670
Now when you do this,

676
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,290
how many?

677
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:56,591
And then,

678
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:57,191
so for instance,

679
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,090
you get the sentence,

680
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,410
Fred likes Wilma.

681
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,690
When you do this,

682
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,790
how many possible sentences are there?

683
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,500
Can we just take a second?

684
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,150
Okay.

685
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,451
Okay.

686
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:08,284
Any guesses?

687
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,213
Yeah.

688
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,163
18.

689
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,040
Um,

690
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,680
the sentences are Fred likes Fred.

691
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,491
Fred likes Marnie.

692
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:18,360
Fred likes Wilma.

693
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,650
Fred thinks red.

694
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,490
Fred thinks Barney,

695
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:21,360
Fred thinks woman.

696
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,660
And so on the three nouns followed by
any of the two verbs followed by any of

697
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:27,660
the three nouns.

698
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,060
That is not a very interesting language,

699
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,740
but now take a more complicated language.

700
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,910
Same vocabulary,

701
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,440
the same three nouns,

702
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:38,640
the same two verbs,

703
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,860
the same sentence.

704
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,690
But now one other sentence.

705
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,160
This sentence expands to
a noun followed by a verb,

706
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,660
followed by a sentence.

707
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,730
And there you get recursion.

708
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,360
You have one rule invoking another rule,

709
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,610
and then you can get a
sentence like Fred thinks,

710
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,500
okay,

711
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,490
Barney likes woman,

712
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,680
okay.

713
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,890
And here you get a potential
infinity of sentences.

714
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,330
And this is obviously a toy example,

715
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,080
but you could see their use of recursion
in everyday life in everyday use of

716
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:19,794
language.

717
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,350
You could say John hates cheese.

718
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,080
My roommate heard a rumor
that John hates cheese.

719
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,180
It disturbed Mary when I
told her that my roommate,

720
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:28,380
her roommate at John hates cheese.

721
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,690
I was amazed at the disturbed
Mary when I told her that.

722
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:33,880
My roommate heard a rumor that John
hates cheese professor voluma devoted way

723
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,711
too much of his lecture.

724
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:36,950
Talking about how he was amazed at
Mister mayor when I told her that,

725
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,560
my roommate heard a rumor that John H,

726
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,394
Jeez,

727
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,620
it really bothered me that,

728
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,533
and,

729
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,953
and there's no limit.

730
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,330
There's no longest sentence.

731
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,650
You could keep producing a sentence
deeper and deeper in bed until you die.

732
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,000
Um,

733
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,130
and this is part of the power of language.

734
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Now the syntactic rules are complicated
and one of the puzzles of syntactic

735
00:31:58,831 --> 00:31:59,101
rules are,

736
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:04,101
one of the issues of them is that
different rules can conspire to create the

737
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:06,390
same sentence.

738
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,730
So you take a sentence like this is
a classic line from Groucho Marx.

739
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,130
I wanted to shot an
elephant in my pajamas,

740
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,170
Howard gone into my pajamas,

741
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:17,100
I'll never know.

742
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,560
And the humor such that it is,

743
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,800
revolves around the ambiguity of rules
that generate it like this versus like

744
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:29,190
this often to illustrate
issues of ambiguity,

745
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,340
people have collected poorly thought
out headlines in newspaper reports,

746
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,610
um,

747
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,960
that play on that,

748
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,200
that,

749
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,520
that inadvertently,

750
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,980
uh,

751
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,630
have ambiguity complaints of
an NBA referees growing ugly.

752
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,360
He says you really have that structure.

753
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,360
Kids make nutritious snacks.

754
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,780
No one was injured in a blast,

755
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,570
which was attributed to the bill
of gas by one town official.

756
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,743
Um,

757
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,863
last,

758
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,620
last summer I was in Seoul,

759
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,350
uh,

760
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,280
visiting the visiting Korea
University and the big headline,

761
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,450
their front page was general
arrested for fondling privates.

762
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,693
Um,

763
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,790
now there actually is,

764
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,450
there ambiguity is that is actually quite
difficult to avoid in the construction

765
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,490
and understanding of sentences.

766
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,541
It's one of the,

767
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,750
it's one of the ways in which is
often difficult to write clearly.

768
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,621
And in fact,

769
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:35,621
there's a whole subfield of the law
involving the use of linguistic theory to

770
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:39,920
disambiguate sentences both in,

771
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:40,730
um,

772
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,020
in the constitution,

773
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,681
in a,

774
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:42,921
in,

775
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:43,220
in,

776
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,360
in legislation,

777
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,720
in legislation as well as
in some criminal cases.

778
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,230
And there was several years ago a very
serious criminal case that rested on a

779
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,684
sentence.

780
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,890
And here's what happened.

781
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,330
There were two brothers,

782
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:04,331
one of them retarded and they get into
a robbery and a police officer sees them

783
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,330
and points the gun at them.

784
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,250
And uh,

785
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,330
one of the brothers points
a gun at a police officer.

786
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,420
The police officer shouts for the brother,

787
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,430
the non retarded brother to
drop the gun as she said,

788
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:23,264
give me the gun.

789
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,420
The retarded brother shouted,

790
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,810
let him have it were upon to brother
shot and killed a police officer.

791
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,560
Now the brother had did the
shooting was plainly a murder.

792
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,860
What about that brother who
showed it to let them have it?

793
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,720
Well,

794
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,940
it depends on what on,

795
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,790
on how you interpret that sentence.

796
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,190
Because this sentence is
beautifully ambiguous.

797
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,730
It could mean shoot him,

798
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,180
let him have it or it could
mean give him the gun.

799
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,223
Let him have it.

800
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,690
And in fact the trial,

801
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:00,770
which I think somebody could,

802
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,630
if people have the know about this,

803
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:03,650
please send me an email.

804
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,360
My understanding was he was found guilty.

805
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,673
Um,

806
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,830
but a lot to turn on the
ambiguity of a sentence.

807
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I want to shift now and talk about
where does all this knowledge come from,

808
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,410
but I'll stop and answer any
questions about material so far.

809
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,790
What are your questions?

810
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,193
Yes.

811
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,431
Syntax.

812
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:30,650
And the question is how is
syntax different from grammar?

813
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,240
They're exactly the same.

814
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,270
Uh,

815
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,150
syntax is a more technical term,

816
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:35,871
but typically,

817
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:37,100
but it means the same thing as grammar.

818
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,943
Yes.

819
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,090
Every normal like normal
human being is born.

820
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,370
Others,

821
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,490
that kind of language.

822
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:47,324
How about,

823
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,110
are there cases where people were
born when they had the culture?

824
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,770
Never really spoke life
into them physically?

825
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:58,961
Yes.

826
00:35:58,961 --> 00:35:59,411
I'm glad.

827
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:01,720
I'm glad you actually asked me
about that because as I said it,

828
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:03,550
I realized it wasn't quite right.

829
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,690
The point that was just raised here is
I had said before to everybody who's

830
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:12,250
neurologically normal comes to
acquire and learn a language.

831
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,110
But what about people who
are neurologically normal
but they don't have language

832
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:17,944
around them?

833
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:18,891
And in fact,

834
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:21,520
there's been historically
some cases of this,

835
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,510
um,

836
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:27,160
there's been probably apocryphal stories
about children who are raised by wolves

837
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,060
or by dogs.

838
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,620
There are stories,

839
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,120
horrible stories summon that summon a
20th century about children who are locked

840
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:39,121
away by insane or evil parents
and who never learned to speak.

841
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,560
There are stories of deaf people who are
within certain societies where nobody

842
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,580
signs to them.

843
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,720
And so they're what's known as linguistic
isolates and they themselves never

844
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:50,554
learned to speak.

845
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,063
Um,

846
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,150
and those cases are
the dramatic exception.

847
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,860
And they do tell you something.

848
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:59,740
They tell you that it's not enough
to have a brain for language.

849
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,960
Somebody does have to use it with you.

850
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,390
Interestingly,

851
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,260
um,

852
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,090
it doesn't have to be that many people.

853
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,450
So as Susan Golden Meadow has studied
deaf children that nobody signed to,

854
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,570
but what she studies is deaf
children with deaf siblings.

855
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,030
And these children don't just sit there.

856
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
They create their own language.

857
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,470
It's not a full blown language like
American sign language are long,

858
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:25,390
the scene Quebecois.

859
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,010
But it's a language.

860
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,980
Nonetheless with words
and syntax and phonology.

861
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,440
It's an interesting question.

862
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,113
Um,

863
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,163
any other

864
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,413
questions?

865
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,803
Yes,

866
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,521
it's a good question.

867
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:58,354
The question is,

868
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,170
are there inherent limits in our
abilities to come up with grammars?

869
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,510
And most linguists would argue yes,

870
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,950
that languages are highly
constrained in how they do things.

871
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,941
So for instance,

872
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:11,050
one example is,

873
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,860
um,

874
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,860
there's no language in the world that
ever constructs a question by switching

875
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:20,170
the order of words around in a sentence.

876
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,310
Um,

877
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:26,310
there's no language in the world that has
a rule that says the fifth word has to

878
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,304
be a verb.

879
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,230
And linguists have all these conditions.

880
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:31,420
They no language in the
world works this way.

881
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,820
Now this is,

882
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,170
so these are on grammar and they're really
interesting cause they tell us what's

883
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:42,220
the human not humanly natural language
versus what's not a humanly natural

884
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:42,970
language.

885
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,970
But notice even after it was incredible
constraints on grammars still we could

886
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,290
still produce an infinite
number of sentences.

887
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,760
It's just like if you restrict
me to only a subset of numbers,

888
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,410
only the odd numbers,

889
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,580
um,

890
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,740
still there's an infinity of odd numbers.

891
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,050
So grammar can be restricted but still
give rise to an infinity of possible

892
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:05,884
sentences.

893
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:10,980
Well,

894
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,790
there's a radical claim
about the origin of language,

895
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,510
um,

896
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:19,650
associated with the guy who we met
when we talked about behaviorism,

897
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,281
who,

898
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:20,790
um,

899
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,830
who wrote the review of verbal behavior,

900
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,451
the linguist,

901
00:39:23,451 --> 00:39:26,190
Noam Chomsky and Chomsky
makes us radical claim.

902
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,620
And this is that we shouldn't view
language learning as learning at all.

903
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,220
Instead we should view it as
something similar to growth.

904
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,020
So he says no one would
take seriously to proposal.

905
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:43,800
The human organism learns
through experience to have
arms rather than wings or

906
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:47,190
did the basic structure
particular Oregon's results
from accidental experience.

907
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,640
Language proves to be no less marvelous,

908
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,390
an intricate and east physical structures.

909
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,810
Why then should we not stay the
acquisition of a cognitive structure like

910
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:55,500
language,

911
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,680
more or less as we study
some complex bodily organ.

912
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,010
So you might learn to play baseball,

913
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,680
you might learn about
the American civil war,

914
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,630
but if Chomsky is right,

915
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,310
you didn't learn to speak English.

916
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,301
Rather,

917
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:14,301
what happened is you hurting leash and
and but the capacity grew in your head

918
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,110
and something a lot more similar to the
development of arms or legs or a visual

919
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:19,944
system.

920
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,360
Well,

921
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,500
should we believe this?

922
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,530
We know there has to be some effect
of the environment shaping language

923
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,640
obviously because in order to know
English you have to have heard English.

924
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,020
In order to know Dutch,

925
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,910
you have had to herd to add,

926
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:38,190
to have learned and heard Dutch.

927
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,000
And in fact languages differ in all
the ways that we were talking about.

928
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,530
Um,

929
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,760
some languages like English has it
have a distinction mean Ellen are other

930
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:48,900
languages do not.

931
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:49,770
Um,

932
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,270
for language like English,

933
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,900
that creature there is referred
to with the morphine dog.

934
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,420
That's a historical accident of English.

935
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,550
In French it's shit.

936
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:00,870
And then,

937
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,840
and in Greek it's something else.

938
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,240
And each of those 6,000 languages and
people in a room who know other languages,

939
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:09,540
they,

940
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:09,721
yeah.

941
00:41:09,721 --> 00:41:11,400
In Vietnamese is this inner do,

942
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:12,810
what is this in check?

943
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:13,644
It's that.

944
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,520
Okay.

945
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,810
Finally there's syntax.

946
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,770
So English is what's
known as a subject verb,

947
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:21,640
object language.

948
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,020
That means if you want to convey
the idea that bill hit John,

949
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,900
you would say bill hit John.

950
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,810
But not all languages work that way.

951
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,521
In fact,

952
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,880
a majority of language is more languages,

953
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,750
uh,

954
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,860
are actually subject,

955
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:37,251
object,

956
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,210
verb languages.

957
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:42,260
So you would say if you wanted to convey
that bill was to hit her and John was

958
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,880
hit bill John hit.

959
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,720
All of this has to be learned and all of
this has to be learned through exposure

960
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,070
to language users.

961
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,590
On the other hand,

962
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,800
there is considerable evidence that the
development of these language skills,

963
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,783
um,

964
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,820
in some way is similar to growth
in a way that Chompsky suggests.

965
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,780
So here's some basic facts
about language development.

966
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,450
One is something which
I had mentioned before.

967
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,433
Um,

968
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,350
all normal children learn language.

969
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,350
There can be specific
impairments of language.

970
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,371
Now again,

971
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:27,890
we spoke about them before
when talking about the brain.

972
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,230
Some of these impairments
could be due to trauma.

973
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,220
Um,

974
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,590
the phase aphasias trauma,

975
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,850
a bloated ahead,

976
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,400
a stroke can read,

977
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:38,450
you have your language,

978
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,480
but also there are genetic disorders.

979
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,530
Um,

980
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,340
some falling under the rubric of what's
known as specific language impairment,

981
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:51,610
where children are born without the same
ability as the rest of us to learn to

982
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:54,134
speak.

983
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,590
And these are interesting in many ways.

984
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,810
One reason that they're interesting is
that he illustrates something about human

985
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:03,644
language.

986
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,271
It is not,

987
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:09,440
it would not be unreasonable for you to
think before listening to his lecture.

988
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,633
Look,

989
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,593
all you need to,

990
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,690
to have to learn a language is to be
smart or all you need to have to learn a

991
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:22,070
language is to want to communicate or
all you need to have to learn a language

992
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,620
is to be a social person wanting to,

993
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,590
having the ability to understand
others and deal with others.

994
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,530
But the cases,

995
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,400
specific language impairments suggest
that all of that is wrong because there

996
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:39,401
are children in this world right now
who are plenty smart who really want to

997
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:45,611
communicate and who are entirely social
creatures but they can't learn language.

998
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,490
And this suggests that the ability to
learn language and understand language is

999
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:57,260
to some extent separate from these
other aspects of mental life.

1000
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,693
Um,

1001
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,430
continuing on this theme,

1002
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:06,170
we also know that language is learned
without any sort of feedback or training.

1003
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,353
Um,

1004
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,690
there are many Americans who believe
that they need to teach your children

1005
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:16,610
language and there's a huge industry
with DVDs and flashcards and all sorts of

1006
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:17,061
things,

1007
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:17,480
um,

1008
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,400
designed to teach your children language.

1009
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,480
And I think many parents believe that
they didn't persist in using these things.

1010
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:25,250
Their children would never learn to speak.

1011
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,300
Um,

1012
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,650
but we know that that's not true.

1013
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,590
We know this isn't true
because there are communities,

1014
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,483
um,

1015
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,480
where they,

1016
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:34,080
um,

1017
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,310
they don't speak to their kids.

1018
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,510
They don't speak to your kids because
they don't believe it's important to speak

1019
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,344
to their kids.

1020
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,040
Um,

1021
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,940
some linguists it would interview
linguist would interview adults in these

1022
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:45,960
communities and say,

1023
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,540
why don't you speak to your babies?

1024
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,540
And these adults would respond.

1025
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,760
It is ridiculous to speak to a baby.

1026
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,140
The baby has nothing to say.

1027
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,560
You might as well just speak to your dog.

1028
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,510
And then the American linguist would say,

1029
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:00,751
yeah,

1030
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:01,860
we speak to our dogs.

1031
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,003
Um,

1032
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,370
Americans and Europeans speak
to everything and everybody,

1033
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,270
um,

1034
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,420
other cultures are more picky and they
don't talk to children until their

1035
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:13,860
children and themselves are talking.

1036
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,323
Um,

1037
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,390
this doesn't seem to make much of
a difference in language learning.

1038
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,130
Some studies have motivated
by Chomsky's work,

1039
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,053
um,

1040
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,403
in uh,

1041
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:25,741
in,

1042
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:26,610
in express,

1043
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:27,060
sorry,

1044
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:32,060
motivated by Chomsky's
critique of Skinner's verbal
behavior have asked even in

1045
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,610
what if we just looked at
children within the United States?

1046
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,440
Don't these,

1047
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,690
these children get feedback?

1048
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,970
And answer is yes and no.

1049
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,670
So your average highly educated
Western parent does give their children

1050
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:48,390
feedback,

1051
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,830
do give their children feedback,

1052
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,330
um,

1053
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,980
based on what they say,

1054
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,130
but they don't typically give feedback
based on the syntax or grammatical

1055
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,150
quality of what they say.

1056
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:01,530
Um,

1057
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:06,530
the example given by Brown and handling
and the classic study in the 1970s,

1058
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,380
is they did all these studies looking
at what children say and how parents

1059
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:11,214
responded.

1060
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,550
And it turns out parents respond
not to the grammatical correctness,

1061
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:22,250
but to the effect or acuteness our
associate ability of the utterance.

1062
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,681
So,

1063
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,514
for instance,

1064
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,390
um,

1065
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,070
if a child says to his mother,

1066
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,300
I loves you mummy,

1067
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,910
it's a very unusual parent who say,

1068
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:30,421
oh no,

1069
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,100
the verb agreement is mistaken.

1070
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:34,320
You've,

1071
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,460
you've added a redundant s uh,

1072
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,160
it is not appropriate.

1073
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:38,940
Um,

1074
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,511
similarly,

1075
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:40,560
if a child has to say,

1076
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:41,040
you know,

1077
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,240
I hate your guts,

1078
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:43,074
mother,

1079
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,250
it's an unusual mother.

1080
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,300
That's wonderful.

1081
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:45,991
And subject,

1082
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:46,410
verb,

1083
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:46,921
object,

1084
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,420
the whole thing structurally fine.

1085
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:48,991
You know,

1086
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:53,730
we respond to our kids like we respond
to each other based on a message that's

1087
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:56,280
conveyed not to grammatic
Cali to utterances.

1088
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,920
Children make grammatical
mistakes all the time,

1089
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,030
but then they go away and they
go away without correction.

1090
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,000
So those are some basic facts.

1091
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,470
Um,

1092
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,630
what do we know about the
time course of language?

1093
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:10,973
Well,

1094
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,970
early on,

1095
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:17,190
children's start off and they prefer
the melody of their own language.

1096
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,060
Um,

1097
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,650
these studies were done in a,

1098
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:20,550
in France,

1099
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,310
um,

1100
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:26,130
we're four day old babies and what they
did was they used a sucking method.

1101
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:26,551
Remember,

1102
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:28,430
there's a limited number
of things babies can do it.

1103
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:32,440
One of the things they can do is suck
and these babies would suck on a pacifier

1104
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,640
to hear French.

1105
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,463
Um,

1106
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,640
and they would prefer to hear
French than to hear Russian.

1107
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,920
And these investigators claim this
is because they had been exposed to,

1108
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,610
um,

1109
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,460
to French in the first
four days of their lives.

1110
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,080
Reviewers mostly from
France objected and said,

1111
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,381
no,

1112
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:54,790
maybe French sounds better.

1113
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,100
Everybody kind of like French.

1114
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,320
Somebody redid this study in Russia.

1115
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,580
Russian kids sucked harder to hear
Russian than he did to French.

1116
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,820
And what they're listening
to isn't the words,

1117
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:07,840
they don't know words yet.

1118
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:08,890
They don't know how to syntax yet.

1119
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,690
It's the rhythm of the language.

1120
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:11,500
Um,

1121
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,333
for you.

1122
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,900
French and Russian sound different.

1123
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:14,950
Even if you're like me,

1124
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,630
you don't know word of either language.

1125
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,070
They still sound different.

1126
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,040
They sound different to babies too.

1127
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:26,500
And a baby being raised in France or a
baby being raised in Russia knows enough

1128
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,460
to um,

1129
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,940
to tell what's his
language and what isn't.

1130
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,580
Um,

1131
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,413
early on,

1132
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,400
children are sensitive to
every phoneme there is.

1133
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,450
Um,

1134
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,120
so English speaking children for instance,

1135
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,730
can English speaking babies,

1136
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:49,690
babies who are born in the United
States can distinguish between English

1137
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:51,700
phonemes like lip and rip,

1138
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,300
but it can also distinguish
between phonemic contrasts,

1139
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,930
um,

1140
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,800
that are not exemplified in English
such as phonemic contrasts and check or

1141
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:00,400
Hindi.

1142
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,233
Yes.

1143
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,740
Gaggle and Kubek had a baby.

1144
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:39,703
No,

1145
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,910
I mean it doesn't matter what you say.

1146
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:50,070
There's,

1147
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,650
there's a lot going on in your question.

1148
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,280
There's a lot going on.

1149
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,320
Your question.

1150
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,020
Um,

1151
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,450
the question,

1152
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:00,320
the question was,

1153
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,100
um,

1154
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,360
your baby's going to
crew and gag at Google.

1155
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,170
Doesn't matter if you coop and gag.

1156
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,004
I go back.

1157
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,490
No,

1158
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:08,360
it doesn't make a difference.

1159
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,370
Your hatred towards them was,

1160
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:11,330
was unmotivated.

1161
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:12,970
Um,

1162
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,980
you can be relieved of that debt.

1163
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,900
And I know you feel bad now I guess.

1164
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:19,603
Um,

1165
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,271
if you,

1166
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:22,760
if you speak to your
children and perfect English,

1167
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,230
it's very strange.

1168
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,130
You know,

1169
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,950
nobody speaks to their
babies and you know,

1170
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,530
no.

1171
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:27,831
Hello.

1172
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:28,960
Because I understand going.

1173
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:30,350
Okay.

1174
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,330
What changed your diaper
right now since he's still,

1175
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,820
that's bad parenting sounds kind of silly.

1176
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:36,350
More than what most people do.

1177
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:36,531
Oh,

1178
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:37,700
you're such a cute little baby.

1179
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:38,840
Um,

1180
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,120
and it probably one,

1181
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,421
there's,

1182
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:46,130
there's evolutionary psychologists debate
the function of why we talk funny to

1183
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:50,420
babies and some people have argued
it does help their language learning.

1184
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,860
Um,

1185
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,340
and some people have argued instead
that what it does is it calms them.

1186
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,960
They like to hear the music of,

1187
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,580
of a smooth voice and so on.

1188
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,270
But whether or not you do so it
doesn't need to make a big difference.

1189
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,780
It is very difficult to find any effects
of how parents talk to their kids on

1190
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,340
how their kids learn language,

1191
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,710
particularly when it comes to babies.

1192
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,690
So early on,

1193
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,540
babies can are sensitive to old phonemes.

1194
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:19,340
Um,

1195
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,173
and then that goes away,

1196
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:21,531
uh,

1197
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:22,610
around 12 months of age.

1198
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:23,330
It goes away.

1199
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,620
This is one thing.

1200
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,300
You were much better that when
you were a baby then you are now,

1201
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,680
when you were a baby,

1202
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,630
you were a multilingual for,

1203
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,780
you could understand the sound
differences of every language on earth.

1204
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,760
Now if you're like me,

1205
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:42,470
you could barely understand English.

1206
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:43,330
You've,

1207
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,163
you,

1208
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,890
you narrow down to your sensitive
just to the language you hear.

1209
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,920
And this narrowing down is largely
in place by about 12 months of age.

1210
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,730
Around seven months is babbling

1211
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,140
and I want to stop at this point.

1212
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,450
To go back to the issue I promised you,

1213
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,660
I would turn a bit to sign language and
I want to describe now a very elegant,

1214
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,070
I want to show a little film now,

1215
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:17,060
have a very elegant series of experiments
looking at the question of whether

1216
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:19,790
babies who are exposed with sign language

1217
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:20,943
babble.

1218
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:29,290
One of the real surprising findings in
my field over the last 10 20 years has

1219
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:35,210
been that the acquisition of sign
languages as turned out to be,

1220
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:36,840
yeah,

1221
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,100
almost exactly the same.

1222
00:52:38,101 --> 00:52:38,401
In fact,

1223
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:42,420
as far as we know exactly the same
as acquisition of spoken languages,

1224
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,040
it didn't have to be that way.

1225
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,700
I mean,

1226
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:49,500
it could have been just as reasonable to
expect that there'd be an advantage for

1227
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:53,700
speech over sign that sign languages
may be full blown languages,

1228
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:54,534
but you know,

1229
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,501
they just take heart.

1230
00:52:55,501 --> 00:52:59,730
They're just harder to learn because
the brain and the body have adapted for

1231
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:00,564
speech.

1232
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,550
It turns out that this
just isn't the case.

1233
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:07,551
It turns out that sign and at
the developmental milestones
of sign languages and

1234
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:11,850
the development milestones or spoken
languages are precisely the same.

1235
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,100
They start babbling at the same point.

1236
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:15,570
They start using first words,

1237
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,950
first sentences,

1238
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,200
first complicated constructions.

1239
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,040
Um,

1240
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,670
there seems to be no interesting
difference between how the brain comes to

1241
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:27,870
acquire and use spoken language
versus a sign language.

1242
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,810
Around 12 months of age,

1243
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:31,890
children,

1244
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,190
um,

1245
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,900
started using their first words.

1246
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,120
These are words for,

1247
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:36,954
um,

1248
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,490
objects and actions like
dog and op and milk.

1249
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,863
Um,

1250
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,970
they start showing some sensitivity to
the order of words so they know that,

1251
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:48,241
you know,

1252
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:52,320
dog bites cat is different from cat bites.

1253
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:55,620
Dog Ran 18 months of age.

1254
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:57,450
They start learning words faster.

1255
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,120
They start producing
little miniature sentences,

1256
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,170
um,

1257
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:01,501
like,

1258
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:01,711
you know,

1259
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:04,710
want cookie or milk spill.

1260
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:05,620
Um,

1261
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,720
and a function morphine's a
little words in of the and so on.

1262
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,790
Start to gradually up here.

1263
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,853
Okay.

1264
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,000
Then the,

1265
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,320
then there's the bad news.

1266
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,100
Um,

1267
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,930
around seven years of age,

1268
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,690
I'm going up through puberty.

1269
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,300
The ability to learn
language starts to go away.

1270
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,273
Um,

1271
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,110
the best work on this has been done
by Alyssa Newport and Samsung Holla,

1272
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,190
um,

1273
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:37,660
who have studied people who have
been in the United States for many,

1274
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:38,261
many years,

1275
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:38,771
like 30,

1276
00:54:38,771 --> 00:54:43,630
40 years and seeing how well
they have come to speak English.

1277
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,680
And it turns out the big determinant
of how well you speak English as an

1278
00:54:47,681 --> 00:54:49,840
immigrant isn't how smart you are.

1279
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,230
It's not how many family members
you have when you're here.

1280
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,970
It's not your motivation is how
old you were when you started.

1281
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,930
It turns out that if you
start learning a language,

1282
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:06,760
a second language is where most of the
work's been done within the first few

1283
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,361
years of life.

1284
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:08,194
You're fine,

1285
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,310
you'll speak like a native,

1286
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,690
but then it starts
getting worse and worse.

1287
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,280
And once you hit puberty,

1288
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:20,370
suddenly there's huge variation in the
abilities you have to learn language.

1289
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,600
It is very rare.

1290
00:55:22,601 --> 00:55:23,171
For instance,

1291
00:55:23,171 --> 00:55:27,280
for somebody who has learned English
passed puberty to speak without an accent,

1292
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,940
an accent is very hard to shake and it's
not just an accent is also funnel is

1293
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:34,810
also other aspects of phonology,

1294
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,610
syntax and morphology.

1295
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:40,720
It's like the part of the brain that's
responsible for language learning is only

1296
00:55:40,721 --> 00:55:43,210
around early in development.

1297
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,080
Um,

1298
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,210
and if you don't get
your language by then,

1299
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,110
um,

1300
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:47,950
it'll just run out.

1301
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,590
I want us to begin next
class with this question.

1302
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,403
Yeah.

1303
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:00,290
The question of animals and that will
shut down the language learning part.

1304
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,393
But one thing

1305
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,640
put up here

1306
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,850
is your second reading response.

1307
