1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,700
We began the course by talking about
one of the foundational ideas of modern

2
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:18,534
psychology.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,450
This is what a Francis Crick described
as the astonishing hypothesis.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,470
The idea that our mental life,
our consciousness, our morality,

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,570
our capacity to make decisions
and judgments is a product
of a material physical

6
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:37,440
brain. What I want to talk
about today and introduce it,

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,930
it's going to be a theme that dough we're
going to continue throughout the rest

8
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:44,640
of the course is a second idea,
which I think is equally shocking,

9
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,560
perhaps more shocking.
Um,

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,240
and this has to do with we're mental
life comes from not necessarily its

11
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:55,230
material nature, but rather
its origin. And the notion,

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
this other astonishing hypothesis is
what the philosopher Daniel Dennett has

13
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,770
described as Darwin's dangerous idea.
Um,

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,190
and this is the modern biological account
of the origin of biological phenomenon

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,590
including psychological phenomena.

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Now people have long been interested in
the evolution of complicated things and

17
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:25,410
there is an argument that's been repeated
throughout history and many people

18
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:29,520
have found it deeply compelling,
including Darwin himself.

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,530
Darwin,
as he wrote,

20
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:36,531
the origin of species was deeply persuaded
and move by this argument from in the

21
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,380
form presented by the
theologian William Paley.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,410
So Paleo has an example here.
Paly tells,

23
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:47,940
gives the example of you're walking down
the beach and your foot hits a rock and

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,680
then you wonder where
did that rock come from?

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,010
And you don't really expect an
interesting answer to that question.

26
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:56,550
Maybe it was always there, maybe
it fell from the sky, who cares?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,650
But suppose you found a watch on the
ground and then you ask where to watch had

28
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,630
come from.
Um,

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,170
Paly points out that it would not be
satisfying to simply say it's always been

30
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,490
there or it came there as an accident.

31
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,560
And he uses this comparison to,
to make a point,

32
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,420
which is a watch is a very
complicated and interesting thing. Um,

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,381
Paley is,

34
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:27,381
it was a medical doctor and Paly goes on
to describe a watch and compare a watch

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,960
to the eye and noticing that a
watch and I contain multitudes,

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,260
multitudes of parts that interact in
complicated ways to do interesting things.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,400
In fact, to change and to update
the analogy a little bit. Um,

38
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,460
an I is very much like a machine
known as a camera. Um, and,

39
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,360
and,
and they're similar at a deep way.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,810
They both have lenses that Ben
Light and project an image onto,

41
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:58,470
a light sensitive surface for the eye.
Light sensitive surfaces,

42
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:02,020
the retina for the camera to film.
Um,

43
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,530
they both have a focusing
mechanism, um, for the eye.

44
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:09,160
It's muscles that change the
shape of the Lens. Um, for,

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,840
for a camera it's a diaphragm that
governs the amount of incoming light. Um,

46
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,840
even they're both in Cayston
black, the light sensitive, uh,

47
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,760
part of the eye and part of the
camera are both in case than black,

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,980
the differences. So, so in fact,

49
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:28,981
the eye and a camera look a lot alike
and we know the camera is an artifact.

50
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,980
A camera has been constructed
by an intelligent,

51
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:37,270
by intelligent beings to
fulfill a purpose. In fact,

52
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,260
if there's any difference between things
like the eye and things like a camera,

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,910
um, the difference is that, um,

54
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,350
the things like the eye are far more
complicated than things like the camera.

55
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,630
And I was a kid. I had this incredible
TV show called the $6 million man.

56
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,820
Anybody here ever seen it or heard of it?
Anyway,

57
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,660
the idea is there's a test pilot,
Steve Austin and his,

58
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,460
his rocket jet crashes and
he loses his both legs,

59
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,850
his arm in his eye,
which sounds really bad,

60
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,480
but they replaced them with
bionic stuff with artificial leg,

61
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:17,500
artificial arm and an artificial eye that
are really super powered in any fights

62
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:22,260
crime. It was really the best
show on it was really good. Um,

63
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,330
but the thing is, this
was in 1974. It's now,

64
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,740
uh, over 30 years later and
it's true then is true now.

65
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,390
This is fantasy. It doesn't make it to the
level of science fiction. It's fantasy.

66
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,380
We are,

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,940
are impossibly far away from
developing machines that could do this.

68
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,560
We are impossibly far away from building
a machine that can do what the human

69
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:52,420
eye does. And so suddenly,
like Haley points that look,

70
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,520
the complexity of the biological
world suggests that these things are

71
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:02,521
complicated artifacts created
by a designer far smarter
than any human engineer.

72
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,760
And the designer, of course would be, God,

73
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,920
I went to Google images and I don't mean
that to be sacra religious in any sense.

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,820
I, you could try this. I went to
Google images and type in God,

75
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:18,790
and this was the showed up
right in the middle. Um,

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,900
so, and this, this paly argued it and
it was, it's been convincing throughout.

77
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,720
Most of history is, um, is,

78
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:32,440
is a perfectly logical explanation for
these complicated things come from. Um,

79
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,910
it also has the advantage
of being compatible with
scripture and compatible for

80
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:40,030
religious beliefs. But paly made
the point is, stands on its own.

81
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,700
If you find complicated things, um,
that, that, that complicated artifacts,

82
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,770
you don't assume they emerge by accident.

83
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:51,820
You assume that they were created
by an intelligent, uh, being.

84
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,070
Now this view has always had
problems. This view, you could,

85
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,610
you could call it creationism,

86
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,500
which is that biological structures
were created by an intelligent being has

87
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:08,000
always had problems. One problem
is it pushes back the question.

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,940
So you asked where did that
intelligent being coming from?

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,170
And this is a particularly serious problem
from the standpoint of evolution of

90
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,550
psychological structures.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So we want to know how is
it that creature's came
across upon this earth with

92
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:27,470
the ability to reason and plan and do
things and then the answer as well,

93
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,020
another creature with
that ability created us.

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,580
That doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong,
but it means it's unsatisfying.

95
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,910
You immediately want to get an explanation
for that other creature comes from.

96
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,350
Um, more to the point, there's
always been evidence for evolution.

97
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,250
And what I mean by evolution here
isn't necessarily a specific mechanism,

98
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,090
but merely the fact that
that body parts like the,

99
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,130
I didn't emerge all of a sudden,

100
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,610
but rather have parallels both within
other existing animals and across a human

101
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,990
and biological history.
Um, this, this, uh,

102
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,880
evidence comes in different forms.

103
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,600
There's fossil evidence for different
body parts cause suggesting that they have

104
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,500
evolved for more rudimentary form.
Um,

105
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,700
there is Vesta Joel characteristics
and what this means is there are

106
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:21,530
characteristics that human bodies have
that are somewhat inexplicably will,

107
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,453
um,

108
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,520
like the human tailbone or goosebumps
unless you've used them at the human body.

109
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,450
In this current form as modifications
from a previous form. Um,

110
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,380
there are parallels with other animals
and this is clear in psychology.

111
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:40,070
So human brain is different
from the rat cat monkey brain,

112
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,870
but at the same time you see them
following a sort of common plan and common

113
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:45,704
structures.

114
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,970
And one rational inference from this is
that they're linked through evolutionary

115
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,360
descent.
Um,

116
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,040
finally there's occasional poor design.

117
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,120
So paly rhapsodized about the remarkable
powers of the human body and the

118
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,140
different body parts.

119
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,560
But even paly admitted that there's some
things which just don't work very well.

120
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,590
You're, I contains a blind spot because
of how the nerves are wired up. Um,

121
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,790
the,
in the male urinary system,

122
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,530
the urethra goes through the prostate
gland, um, instead of around it,

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,370
which leads to many physical
problems in men later on in life. Um,

124
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,230
and so you're forced to s to either
argue that these are really good things,

125
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,010
um, or that God has either
malicious, aren't competent,

126
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,560
and those are difficult arguments to make.

127
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,830
So these are problems
with the creationist view,

128
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:40,520
but still for the longest time
in human intellectual history,

129
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,930
there was no alternative. And
in fact, so Richard Dawkins,

130
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,710
the most prominent evolutionary
biology and most prominent evolutionary

131
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,760
biologists alive,

132
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,090
and one of the most staunchest critics
of creationism has rewritten in the blind

133
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,930
watchmaker saying,
look,

134
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,960
anybody a hundred years ago or 150 years
ago who didn't believe that God created

135
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,840
humans and other animals was a moron.

136
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,500
Because the argument from
design is a damn good argument.

137
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,620
And in the absence of some other argument,
um,

138
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,230
you should go defer to that
and you should say, well,

139
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,370
there are all these problems,

140
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,440
but humans and other biological horns
must have divine creation because of their

141
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,620
incredible rich and intricate structure.

142
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,730
Um, what changed all that
of course was Darwin. Um,

143
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,200
and Darwin, um, is Darwin's
profound accomplishment.

144
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,090
We're showing how you get
these complicated biological
structures like the eye

145
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,780
emerging through a purely
non-intentional non created process.

146
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,550
I'm a purely physical process and this
could be seen as equal in importance to

147
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:58,020
the claim that the earth
revolves around the sun,

148
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,240
um, and that we're not the
center of the universe. So,

149
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,510
in fact, some scholars have,
have made, made a suggestion,

150
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:10,770
which seems plausible that the idea of
natural selection is the most important

151
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,510
idea in the sciences period.

152
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,980
So this is not a course on evolution and
expect people to have some background.

153
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:21,190
If you don't have a background in it,
you could get your background from, um,

154
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,340
from external readings,
but also from the grip.

155
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,310
The Gray textbook and the Norton
readings were both perfect.

156
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:29,760
We'll each provide you with enough
background to get up to speed.

157
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,840
But the general idea is that there are
three components to natural selection.

158
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,970
There's variation in this.

159
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:40,971
Variation gives rise to different degrees
of survival and reproduction and gets

160
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:45,630
passed on from generation to generation
and gives rise to adaptations.

161
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,600
What Darwin described as,
um,

162
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,040
that perfection of structure to
justly excites our imagination.

163
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,270
And the biological world
has all sorts of examples.

164
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,840
You look at camouflage prior to Darwin,

165
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:05,010
one might imagine that some intelligent
creator crafted animals to hide from

166
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:07,860
their prey,
but now we have a different alternative,

167
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:12,210
which is that animals that were
better at hidden, um, survive better,

168
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:16,110
reproduce more.
And over the course of thousands,

169
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:20,100
perhaps millions of years,
they develop elaborate camouflage.

170
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,450
There's been a lot of work on
Paley's favorite example, the eye.

171
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,810
So Darwin himself noted that the human
eye did not seem to emerge all at once,

172
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,830
but rather you can look at other animals
and find parallels and other animals.

173
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,790
It seemed to suggest that more
rudimentary forms are possible.

174
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,400
And more recently, um, computer
simulations have developed,

175
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,810
have been developed that
have crafted eyes, uh,

176
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:51,630
under plausible assumptions of
selective pressure. And, uh,

177
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,860
what the starting point is.

178
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,980
So this is the theory
of natural selection.

179
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,480
The good question to ask is why am I
talking about evolution in introduction to

180
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:02,560
psychology class?

181
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,150
And the answer is that there are two
ideas which come together and in fact

182
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:13,990
they're both of the dangerous
ideas. One idea is that that, um,

183
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,830
Darwin's idea that biological forms
evolve from this purely physical process.

184
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,510
The second idea,
um,

185
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,960
the rejection of Descartes is that our
minds are the product of physical things

186
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,160
and physical events.

187
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,700
You bring these together and it forces
you to the perspective that what we are,

188
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:42,571
our mental life is no less than I know
less than camouflage the product of this

189
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:47,770
purely physical process of natural
selection. More to the point,

190
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,380
um, our cognitive mechanisms
were evolved not to please God,

191
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,270
not as random accidents,

192
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,200
but rather for the purpose of
survival and reproduction. Um,

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,910
more contentiously you could argue they've
been shaped by natural selection to

194
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:08,020
solve certain problems.
And so from an evolutionary point of view,

195
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,480
when you look at what the brain
is and what the brain does,

196
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,580
you look at it in terms of these problems.
And this is what,

197
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,073
um,

198
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,580
this is what psychology is for. This
is what our thinking is for. Um,

199
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,280
we have evolved mental capacities
to solve different problems,

200
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:31,630
perception of the world,
communication, uh,

201
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,060
getting nutrition and rest and so on.

202
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Now we're going to talk about how
to apply evolutionary theory to,

203
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,670
um, to psychology. But as we're doing so,

204
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:49,900
we have to keep in mind two misconceptions
are two ways you can go seriously

205
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:54,100
wrong here. The first
is to think that, well,

206
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,990
if we're taking an evolutionary approach,

207
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,340
the natural selection will cause
animals to want to spread their genes.

208
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,370
So if we're being biological about it,

209
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:07,270
that means everybody must run around
thinking, I want to spread my jeans,

210
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,980
I want us, you know, and, and um,
and this is just really, oops,

211
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,050
that shouldn't do that. This is really
wrong. Um, it's, it's even in red.

212
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,123
Uh,

213
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,260
and what this fails to do is make a
distinction between ultimate causation and

214
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,370
proximate causation.

215
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,420
And those are technical terms
referring to ultimate causation. Is,

216
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,900
is the reason why something's
there in the first place.

217
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,840
Over millions of years of history.

218
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,670
Proximate causation is why you're
doing it now. And these are different.

219
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,560
Um,
obviously for instance,

220
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,980
animals do all sorts of things
to help survive and reproduce,

221
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,990
but a cockroach doesn't think,
oh,

222
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:49,810
I'm doing this to help survive
and reproduce and spread my jeans.

223
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,920
A cockroach doesn't know
anything about jeans. Um,

224
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,090
rather the mechanisms
that make it do what it,

225
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,750
what it does are different
from its own mental states.

226
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,690
If it has any why it doesn't.

227
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,280
This is the point nicely made by William
James William James Ass. Why do we eat?

228
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,660
And he writes, not one man and a billion
when taking his dinner, everything.

229
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,470
So utility he eats because the food
tastes good and make someone more.

230
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,860
If you ask them why you should want to
do more of what tastes like that instead

231
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:21,800
of revering you as a philosopher,
he'll probably laugh at you for a fool.

232
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,850
And certainly the common sense answer,
why are you eating?

233
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,530
Nobody's going to answer because I must
sustain my body so as to spread my jeans

234
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:34,190
in the future.
Rather you eat because you're hungry.

235
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,890
Those two theories you eat because
you're hungry and you eat to sustain your

236
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:43,660
body. So you can spread your genes in the
future are not alternative rather than

237
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,970
different levels of explanation.
Um,

238
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
and you can't confuse them.
The ultimate level,

239
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,300
which does appeal to survival and
reproduction, there's not, um, is,

240
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,390
is independent from the
psychological level.

241
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,410
To give another example, um, people
protect their children. So you ask,

242
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,140
why do people protect their children?

243
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,910
Why would somebody
devotes so much effort to,

244
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,220
to protecting and helping and
feeding their children? Well,

245
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,450
the evolutionary explanation is animals
that don't protect their offspring don't

246
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,220
last over evolutionary time.

247
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,430
We protected our offspring because
they contain 50% of our genes,

248
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,680
but there's not the
psychological explanation.

249
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,490
Nobody but a deranged psychologists
would ever answer, Oh,

250
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,370
I love my children because
they contain 50% of my genes.

251
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,570
Rather the psychological
explanation is a deeper is is,

252
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,830
is different and has a different texture
and this will be a lot clearer when we

253
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:46,670
talk about the emotions where you could
really see a distinction between the

254
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:51,671
question of why we feel something from
an evolutionary point of view and why we

255
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,380
feel it from a day to day point of view.

256
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,130
The second misconception is that natural
selection tales that everything is

257
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:05,330
adaptive. That everything we do,
everything we think is it that adaptive,

258
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,000
this is wrong.
Um,

259
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,800
natural selection evolution more generally
distinguished between adaptations and

260
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:16,550
byproducts and accidents.

261
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,380
Many of you are currently
our will as you get older,

262
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,580
suffer back pain.
If I was asking,

263
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,420
so why do you suffer back pain?

264
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:31,400
How does back pain help you survive
and reproduce? Well answers.

265
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,020
It's not an adaptation.

266
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,620
Back pain is an accidental byproduct
of how our backs are shaped.

267
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,030
Don't go looking for an adaptive reason
for hiccups or self pity or bloating

268
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,254
after you eat.

269
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:50,530
There's all sorts of things a body
will do that have no adaptive value,

270
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:54,720
rather just accidents. We have a
body that does all sorts of things.

271
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,230
Some things that we'll do by accident and
this is certainly true for psychology.

272
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,963
Um,

273
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,370
so a lot of the things for
instance that occupy our interests,

274
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:13,371
our fascination in day to day life are
almost certainly evolutionary accidents.

275
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,740
Um,
the number that the three,

276
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,340
three of the main preoccupations
of humans are pornography,

277
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:23,460
television and chocolate.
But,

278
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,020
but if I asked you, you know, why
do you like porn? And you say,

279
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,530
because my ancestors who liked porn and
reproduce more than those who didn't,

280
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:38,370
just not true.
Rather you like porn,

281
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,650
assuming you do, um, as an accident,

282
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,880
you have evolved. For instance,
for instance, should you
be a heterosexual male,

283
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,780
you have evolved to be attracted to in it.

284
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,040
That is most likely to be an evolutionary
adaptation because being attracted to

285
00:18:56,041 --> 00:19:00,810
women and wanting to have sex with women
is one step to the road to having kids,

286
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,150
which is very good from an
evolutionary perspective.

287
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,220
It's so happens though in our
modern environment that um,

288
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,960
that people have created
images that substitute.

289
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,810
So instead of actually going
out and seeking out women,

290
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,900
you can just surf the web for hours and
hours and watch dirty movies and read 30

291
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:25,110
books. Evolutionary adaptive,
dead ends there. Accidents.

292
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,730
Why do you like chocolate bars?

293
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:30,870
Assuming that you do it is not because
your ancestors in the African Savannah

294
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,680
who enjoyed chocolate bars reproduce
more than those who didn't.

295
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,830
Rather it is because we've evolved the
taste for sweet things and we've evolved

296
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:43,290
as taste for sweet things in part
because the sweet things in our natural

297
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:47,670
environment like fruit, we're good
for us in modern, in a modern world,

298
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,850
we have created things like chocolate,
which are not so good for us,

299
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,050
but we eat anyway.
A lot of the debates,

300
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,940
there's a lot of controversy in
psychology over the scope of evolutionary

301
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:04,941
explanations and a lot of the debate
tends to be over what's an adaptation and

302
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:11,970
what isn't. There are some clear
cases. We have color vision.

303
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,820
Why do we have color vision?
Well,

304
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:20,030
I think everybody would agree we have
color vision as an adaptation because of

305
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:24,750
the advantages it gives us for seeing
and making visual distinctions. Um,

306
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,520
we are afraid of snakes. We're going
to talk about that in more detail,

307
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,690
but there was a straightforward
adaptive story about that. Um,

308
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,790
we are afraid of snakes because really
our ancestors who weren't afraid of

309
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,630
snakes didn't reproduce as
much as those that work. Um,

310
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,460
we like chocolate bars
and we enjoy NASCAR.

311
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,670
Those are cannot be adaptations
because chocolate bars in NASCAR,

312
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,260
our recent developments that could not
have been anticipated by evolution.

313
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,070
Those are easy questions. Here
are some hard questions. Music

314
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,420
everywhere in the world,
people like music.

315
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,740
Is this an adaptation for some selective
advantage or is it an accident?

316
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,210
Um, Steven pinker who wrote the language
instinct that you read before, um,

317
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,210
caused a huge amount of controversy
when he argued that music is just an

318
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:19,510
evolutionary accident.
He described it as auditory cheesecake,

319
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,760
something we like to gorgeous selves on
that have no as no adaptive advantage.

320
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,000
Other people argue music does
have an adaptive advantage.

321
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,350
Sometimes males used
violence to coerce sex.

322
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,300
Is Male sexual violence a biological
adaptation or is it an accident?

323
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,640
There's more than one language.

324
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,900
Is that just an accidental byproduct of
the way language works or is there some

325
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:48,850
sort of group or selectionist advantage
sketched out in some way of having

326
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:52,330
multiple languages? What about
visual art? What about fiction?

327
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,710
What about our love for stories?
Those are all matters of heated debate.

328
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,320
And so we have to keep in mind
some things plainly are accidents.

329
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,710
Some things almost certainly aren't
accidents where the action is.

330
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:08,930
And the study of psychology in the
study of evolution of cognition, um,

331
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,320
is trying to figure out which is which.

332
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,110
So those are the misconceptions
we have to avoid. But still,

333
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:21,670
who cares? I mean, again, this is
an introduction to psych course.

334
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:23,110
Why are we talking about evolution?

335
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,630
Why should it matter to a psychologist?
How the mind has evolved?

336
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm going to talk about evolution now,

337
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,200
but for rest of course I'm just
interested in how our minds are period.

338
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,840
So why would evolution matter
how many people think it doesn't?

339
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,940
Um, for instance, um, and they think
it does and for different reasons.

340
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,440
One claim is a metaphysical one.
You might be a dualist,

341
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,860
you might reject the idea. You've mental
life is the product of your brain.

342
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,630
And hence evolution is irrelevant to
psychology because the brain and the mind

343
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,140
cause the brain which may have evolved
has nothing interesting to do with the

344
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:05,770
mind. Lisa Simpson got it wrong. Um,

345
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,930
when she said the pope,

346
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,150
he got it half right when she said the
pope favorite evolution. It is true.

347
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,560
John Paul the second,

348
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:19,561
many years ago made a statement
saying that Darwinian theory,

349
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,490
um,
is not incompatible.

350
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Darwinian theory is a view about the
evolution of species that is not motivated

351
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:34,180
by any animus,
is a genuine scientific theory.

352
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,160
And should it turn out to be
true? Um, it is not incompatible.

353
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,460
The truth about man,

354
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,990
as taught by the church and scientists
were thrilled by this and they were,

355
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,800
they said he's endorsing evolution.

356
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,520
What would a fewer people talk about
is the fact that after he said this,

357
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,690
he drew the line.
He allowed for evolution of the body,

358
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,640
but he would not allow for evolution
of the mind. So it was you wrote,

359
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,210
if the human body takes us origin
from preexisting living matter,

360
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,320
the spiritual soul is immediately
created by God. Consequently,

361
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,280
theories of evolution,

362
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:10,670
which considering the mind is emerging
from the forces of living matter or as a

363
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:14,090
mere epi phenomenon, his matter are
incompatible to truth about men.

364
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,110
So you might not want evolution to be
true about the mind because you might

365
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:25,391
believe that the mind is not subject to
the same physical laws as the rest of

366
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:30,350
the physical world. That's one way you
could reject evolutionary psychology.

367
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,700
Another way to reject evolutionary
psychology is to accept that the mines a

368
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:35,534
physical thing,

369
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,750
but then argue that all of these instincts
and he's hardwired facets of human

370
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:44,600
nature might exist for other animals,
but they don't exist for people.

371
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,680
So to anthropologists,

372
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,360
Ashley Montagu in 73 close
to when the $6 million man,

373
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,800
let me show him by the way,

374
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,820
said with the exception of the reactions
and infants a sudden withdrawals of

375
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:59,330
support and a sudden loud noises.
The human being is entirely instinct.

376
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,560
Less man is man cause he has no instincts
because everything he is and has

377
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:03,921
become,

378
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:07,490
he has learned from his culture for nomad
and made part of the environment from

379
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:11,840
other human beings. Um,
you might say, look,

380
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,730
he couldn't believe that in 74,

381
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:17,810
but of course all of the infant studies
that have come out since then, um,

382
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,230
suggested that's not true and
nobody would believe that nowadays.

383
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,310
But in fact the view was
often hold health. Um,

384
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,000
Louis Banana in a New Yorker article a
few years ago wrote every aspect of life

385
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:31,880
has a biological foundation
in exactly the same sense,

386
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,750
which is that unless it was biologically
possible, it wouldn't exist. After that,

387
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:36,680
it's up for grabs.

388
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,330
And this is in the context of an argument
that evolution can tell us anything

389
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,160
about what's most interesting
about people, man does not,

390
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,560
is an educated intelligent scholar.

391
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,090
He is presumably well aware of the
findings of spell key and by our general

392
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:57,830
about how people are hardwired
to understand objects and
social life and so on.

393
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,820
But his point is just that when it
comes to the more interesting aspects of

394
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:02,654
human nature,

395
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,730
the stuff we're naturally intuitively
interested in that's more cultural and

396
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,300
evolutionary theory and Darwinian theory
was just doesn't have anything much to

397
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,134
say about it.

398
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,530
Not because the mind is separate from the
brain but just because humans are much

399
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,520
more cultural organisms.

400
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,340
And so biology has little to say about it.
Um,

401
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,340
there's a third objection
which is you might think, okay,

402
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,210
the human mind actually
does contain instincts. We,

403
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,600
there is a human nature but we should
just study it by studying people.

404
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,070
How good evolution,

405
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,820
the study of evolution to consideration
revolution tell us anything interesting.

406
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,603
Um,

407
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I actually in my own work think evolution
can tell us some interesting things

408
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,930
and I want to try to make a case for
ways in which evolution can inform and

409
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,540
enlighten us about the mind as it is.

410
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,630
First I want to make a point which is,
um,

411
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,930
although this course is intro psych and
it is about the mind as it is still,

412
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,830
I think by any account, the evolution
of consciousness, morality and so on,

413
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,920
just as is intuitively interesting.
Um,

414
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,400
it's the sort of thing that people are
just fascinated by and I think it's a

415
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:20,280
question of interest in
and of its own right.

416
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,260
But here's how it could tell us
about psychology. For one thing,

417
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,760
it can tell us what,
what can be innate and what cannot.

418
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,150
So some problems,

419
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,200
some evolutionary problems have been
around for a long time and could lead to

420
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,060
special biological adaptations.

421
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,210
If I told you there was a biological
adaptation for talking made selection,

422
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,080
childcare, maybe it's true, maybe
it isn't, but it's not crazy.

423
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,330
From an evolutionary point of view,
it's a reasonable possibility that it is.

424
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,070
Other problems are recent and our brains
could not be specialized to deal with

425
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:04,830
them. Um, written
communication, interacting with
strangers, driving your car,

426
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,700
playing chess.

427
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,490
If you were to argue that there's a part
of the brain devoted to playing chess,

428
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,860
I would say you're utterly wrong.

429
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,860
You can not be right because from
an evolutionary point of view,

430
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,250
there could be no such part of the
brain evolve because playing chess as a

431
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:25,251
recent innovation as a result of focus
on evolution could help discipline us to

432
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:29,670
make coherent claims about what is
built in and what isn't built in.

433
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,430
Third, we're going to talk about
human differences. In this course,

434
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,140
we're going to devote a class to human
differences of a sort of what makes you

435
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:41,820
different from her,
different from her.

436
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,710
Why do we have different intelligences in
his class? Why are some of US arrogant?

437
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:50,850
And some of us humble,
some of us like attracted to men,

438
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:52,560
others attracted to women and so on.

439
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:58,130
But there's also questions
of group differences and
evolutionary theory can help

440
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:02,130
us say intelligent things about what sort
of group differences you should expect.

441
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,810
Because evolutionary theory predicts
that some population should evolve in

442
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,040
different ways than others.

443
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,300
The most obvious example is that,
um,

444
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,470
children should it be
different from adults.

445
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,480
The evolutionary problems faced by
a child are very different from an

446
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,490
evolutionary problems faced by an adult.

447
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,270
And you can make specific and rather
interesting predictions about how

448
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:30,540
children's brains should different
differ from adults brains.

449
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,250
Evolutionary theory predicts,
um,

450
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,600
does not make any predictions about
racial differences or ethnic differences.

451
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,980
Some might exist,

452
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,490
but there's no adaptive reason why humans
who have evolved in different parts of

453
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:48,700
the world should have profound
differences, inner mental capacities.

454
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,930
What does evolutionary theory
say about sex differences? Well,

455
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,000
it says some interesting things and we're
going to devote a class to discussing

456
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,150
them.
But what I think is going to be true,

457
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,630
proved to be important is that we'll be
able to use evolutionary biology to talk

458
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:12,580
sensibly about what sort of
distinctions between the sexes,

459
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,760
between males and females one would
expect to find and what sort one wouldn't

460
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:21,670
expect to find. We can make educated
predictions. I'm going to have,

461
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,930
I want to put here a clip of a man.
This is a scene from a movie,

462
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,990
the movie Roger Dodger that begins of
a man making quasi evolutionary claims,

463
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:32,770
but the difference you men and women.

464
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,300
And I want to put this as an example
of where you could call bar room

465
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:39,820
evolutionary psychology.
And,

466
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:43,720
and I want to us to hold us in our minds
because it's going to return to these

467
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:45,760
claims and disgust or validity.

468
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,840
I like this for a few reasons.
First,

469
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:54,700
I liked that the backward reference to
William James and utility. Um, second,

470
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:58,740
it is a gorgeous combination of some
things that are actually reasonably

471
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:02,440
rational and total bull crap. Um, and,

472
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:07,540
and but what evolutionary biology will
give us is the tools to distinguish

473
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:11,740
between the two, like on the face of it
immediately, the ability to read maps,

474
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,390
to claim it as a biological,

475
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,830
that differences not ability
have a biological roots is crazy.

476
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,780
And the other hand, the claim that one
that that males may develop a trait,

477
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,650
not because it's advantageous,
but to attract females is less crazy.

478
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,230
The telepathic stuff is really crazy,

479
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:34,650
but so I'm not at this point
when a devoted lecture to sex,

480
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:37,660
I'm not at this point want to make
any claims one way or another.

481
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,500
But what I want to suggest is that
from a biological point of view,

482
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,850
we could say sensible and an intelligent
things about what differences should

483
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:48,760
exist and what shouldn't.
Finally, and most of all,

484
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,680
looking at something from the perspective
of design directive of what's it for

485
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,400
can often give you interesting
insights as to its current nature.

486
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,180
And I'll give you two quick examples.
One that's not from psychology,

487
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:04,750
one that is um,
women suffer.

488
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,250
Often women who are pregnant early
in her pregnancy suffer from morning

489
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:12,640
sickness, nausea, throwing up and so on.

490
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,900
This is traditionally been viewed as
of just a breakdown in the system.

491
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,650
Too much hormones, everything's
a skew. Women get nauseous.

492
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,720
Margie profit,
um,

493
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,640
suggested an alternative and this one her
to MacArthur genius award and this was

494
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:31,840
the claim that maybe pregnancy
sickness is not an accident. Rather,

495
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,011
it's designed,

496
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:38,011
it has a biological purpose in particular
as the baby develops in the uterus,

497
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,380
it is vulnerable to various
sorts of poisons are to ratigans.

498
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,630
Um,

499
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,630
profit suggested that pregnancy sickness
is a hyper sensitive period where women

500
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,650
are extremely sensitive,

501
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:59,651
get extremely nauseous towards the sorts
of foods that could damage their baby.

502
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,310
Now if it's,
you just ended there to story,

503
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,930
how do we know it's true?

504
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,060
But then she went on to examine it the
same way that any scientist examines any

505
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:13,460
claim by making predictions
and testing them.

506
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,560
And this makes them
interesting predictions.

507
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,520
It suggests the timing of
onset and offset of pregnancy,

508
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:20,990
sickness of morning sickness.

509
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,760
It should correspond to the period of
maximum vulnerability on the part of the

510
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:30,761
developing embryo or fetus suggested a
types of foods avoided should correspond

511
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:38,501
to those sorts of foods that were most
deadly for the fetus and that were deadly

512
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:41,480
for the fetus during the
periods where humans evolve.

513
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,700
This last qualification
is an important one.

514
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,590
Women do not develop an aversion
to alcohol during pregnancy.

515
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,720
Even though alcohol is extremely
dangerous to the developing child,

516
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,270
the answer is an easy one. Alcohol wasn't
around during our evolutionary history.

517
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,310
And we can not have evolved a system to
protect ourselves from it. And finally,

518
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,310
there should be a relationship
between miscarriage and birth,

519
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,290
birth defects in a surprising direction
for profit.

520
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,610
And she has evidence to back this up.
Um,

521
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,000
pregnancy sickness is not
a glitch in the system.

522
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:21,800
Rather it's the sign of a healthy,
active protective mechanism going on.

523
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,110
And in fact,
the more prep morning sickness,

524
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:25,790
the more the baby should be protected.

525
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,250
Something which by and
large appears to be true.

526
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,410
That's an example of how the question
when dealing with, they say, Hey, women,

527
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:36,620
throw up when they get
pregnant and then say, look,

528
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,230
maybe that's not just a glitch.
What's it for?

529
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,440
You could then learn
some interesting things.

530
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,890
Here's a different example
based on the last lecture,

531
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,920
this wonderful lecture by Peter Salivate
on sex and love where he talked about

532
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:53,420
the big three.

533
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,760
These are the big three to remind you
of what attracts us to somebody else.

534
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,740
Um, you're very attracted to the person
next to you or a person that because

535
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,470
proximity, similarity, familiarity,

536
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,000
and there is abundant evidence
supporting the truth of this.

537
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,190
It's almost always true,

538
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,840
but in evolutionary psychologist looks
at this and says there's something

539
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:19,700
seriously wrong here.

540
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,460
There's some cases where that has
to be totally, absolutely mistaken

541
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,900
to, to realize what does
is think for a moment,

542
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,040
what humans are you most close to,

543
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,220
most similar to and familiar with.

544
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,300
What humans did you spend over 10 years
of your life with who are genetically

545
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,680
and environmentally as close
to you as if they were related,

546
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,800
who you are intimately familiar with.

547
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,250
Are those the humans that
you find the hottest?

548
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,030
Now they're your siblings
and they are not hot.

549
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,810
Why was I was on Google
images this morning.

550
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,800
I put it up some hot siblings.
Um,

551
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,120
and but,
but although we may find them hot,

552
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,480
they do not typically with some
rare and bizarre exceptions,

553
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,250
find one another hot.
Why not?

554
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,343
Well,

555
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,090
this is not a huge puzzle from the
standpoint of evolutionary biology.

556
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,160
Evolutionary biology posits that humans
as well as other animals should have

557
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:42,930
incest avoidance. We should
like, we should be attracted
to those familiar to us,

558
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,030
similar to us,
close to us,

559
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,010
but not kin kin are off limits.
There's a good reason why,

560
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,640
um,
because if you intermate with your kin,

561
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,400
you have bad offspring

562
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,700
and so animal should be wired
up not to meet with their kin.

563
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,210
And in fact, this is,
this is what happens. Um,

564
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,480
there are parents of teenagers have
all sorts of concerns and a lot of the

565
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:14,430
concerns are in fact sexual.
Um,

566
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,090
how do you keep your son
and or your daughter from
going out and having sex with

567
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,030
too many people are the wrong
people or unprotected sex,

568
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,020
but there are no parenting guides in
the world and say, how do you keep your,

569
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,300
your,
your children having sex with one another?

570
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,210
You typically do not need to because
they do not want to have sex with one

571
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,400
another.
Um,

572
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,250
now this is actually also illustrates
differently in proximate and ultimate

573
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:45,210
causation. So you think for yourself,
Ooh, do I want to have sex with my sister?

574
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,680
You don't think to yourself,

575
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,040
I would prefer not to confer for the
offspring that we will create or be

576
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:54,630
non-viable and it'll be a waste of my
reproductive efforts. Rather you think,

577
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,520
Ooh, because at a gut
level you respond. Um,

578
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,590
and this sort of instinctive response
is what you get from an evolutionary

579
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:05,760
analysis of sex.

580
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,970
But this story is deeply
incomplete because the question
that gets raised is how

581
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:15,930
do you tell,
you don't want to have sex with your kin,

582
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:21,300
but how do you tell your kid people
don't carry their DNA markers,

583
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,350
uh, on strips that you could see.
How do you tell who your Kinnar,

584
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,980
and this actually turns out to
be a really interesting question.

585
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,790
It used and some research suggests
that the answer is simple.

586
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,900
You will avoid sex with
people you grew up with.

587
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,700
And these studies actually
come from Kibbutz Studies, um,

588
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,730
studies where people are raised
communally on an Israeli kibbutz.

589
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,650
They know they're not related,

590
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,240
but it's still a fact that they
were raised together as kids. Um,

591
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,240
suggests that is a queue at a gut level,

592
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,400
not to be attracted to one another.

593
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,980
It turns out for some reason now to
believe this story is incomplete. Um,

594
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,160
a paper that came out in nature five
days ago reported a series of extremely

595
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:13,231
interesting studies and they found that
the cue of being raised together as a

596
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:18,100
child with somebody, yes, that
does diminish sexual desire,

597
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,110
but an even bigger Q was did
you observe your parents?

598
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,170
And in particular your mother taking
care of that person if you did that

599
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:32,620
seriously diminished in sexual desire and
brings it down to the level of disgust.

600
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,923
And again,

601
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
these are the sorts of questions and
issues you begin to ask when you approach

602
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,510
things from an evolutionary

603
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,240
perspective.
Okay.

604
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,293
Um,

605
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,060
for this lecture,
the rest of this lecture,

606
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:55,350
and then the next couple of lectures
I'll be discussing some basic aspects of

607
00:39:55,351 --> 00:40:00,240
human nature that are to some extent or
another informed by evolutionary theory.

608
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,010
And what I want to start for the remainder
of this lecture is a discussion of

609
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:09,350
rationality.
Now,

610
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,260
some of you maybe not want
to go into evolution, not,

611
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,510
not wanting to go into psychology because
there's no Nobel prize for psychology.

612
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,060
You might all think, hey, if I'm
going to go into the sciences,

613
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,290
I won a Nobel prize.
Think how proud bubby and 80 would be.

614
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,440
If I want to Nobel prize. Well
then that'd be the best. Um,

615
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,920
you can get one.
Um,

616
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,750
psychologists have won the Nobel prize.
Most recently,

617
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:40,610
Danny Kahneman won a Nobel prize. You
win an economics, sometimes medicine,

618
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,740
not a big deal.
Um,

619
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:48,550
he wanted for his work done over
the course of many decades on human

620
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:49,634
rationality.

621
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,110
And this work was done in collaboration
with Amos Tversky who, uh,

622
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,170
who passed away several years ago.
Um,

623
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:02,350
and this work entirely transformed the
way we think about human decision making

624
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:10,190
and rationality. Condiment and first
ski caused a revolution in economics,

625
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:10,771
psychology,

626
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:15,230
and the social sciences more generally
by causing us to shift from the idea that

627
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:20,231
we're logical thinkers who think in
accord with the axioms of logic and

628
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:22,610
mathematics and rationality.

629
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,880
More towards the idea that we actually
have sort of rough and ready heuristics.

630
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,840
These horistic served as well during
the time during our evolutionary,

631
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,170
but sometimes they can lead us astray.

632
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,430
And I want to give some examples of
these Horace sticks and I'll give four

633
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:45,431
examples of heuristics that are
argued to permeate our reasoning.

634
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,620
The first is framing effects. This was
a classic study by Kahneman and Tversky.

635
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,690
Um,
involving this sort of question

636
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,450
us is preparing for the outbreak of a
disease is going to kill 600 people.

637
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,870
There are two programs,
program a,

638
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,710
if you follow a 200 people will be saved.
Program B,

639
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,490
there's a one third chance everybody
won't be saved and a two third chance

640
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:14,660
nobody will be saved.
Who would choose program be?

641
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,910
Okay,

642
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,050
who would choose program?
Hey,

643
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:23,640
hi and that fits the responses.

644
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,050
Most people choose program a.
That's could go either way.

645
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:33,350
What's interesting is if you frame
the question differently like this,

646
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,550
you get very different responses.

647
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,890
Instead of focusing on the
people who will be saved,

648
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,240
you focused on the people who will die
and instead of focusing on the chance

649
00:42:42,241 --> 00:42:44,790
that nobody will die and she
has every all I flip it around,

650
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,540
you get a corresponding flip and
this is known as a framing effect.

651
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,970
The idea of a framing effect is that you
can respond differently to a situation

652
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,430
depending on how the options are framed.
And in particular,

653
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,710
this combines with loss aversion.

654
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,770
People hate a certain loss.

655
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,430
4,000 of these people will die,
is extremely aversive.

656
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,300
And so the framing can influence your
decisions and clever advertisers and

657
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:22,730
clever decision makers will frame
things in different ways. Um,

658
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,230
to give you,
give rise to different intuitions.

659
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,230
Sometimes it could be
fairly simple. So, um,

660
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,530
so you have this ad have a hamburger,

661
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,140
it's 80% fat free versus 20% fat.

662
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:40,470
You don't have to be a
brilliant ad executive to
figure out which one to go for.

663
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,550
Um, it turns out that this sort of, um,

664
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,280
fundamental act,

665
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:53,160
the fundamental role of framing
effects is not limited to humans.

666
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:58,260
So I want to take a second and tell you
some work done by my colleague Laurie

667
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,060
Santos with capuchin monkeys.

668
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,310
And what she does is she takes these
capuchin monkeys and she teaches them to

669
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:06,144
use money.

670
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,840
She teaches them to use little discs to
by themselves either pieces of banana or

671
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:17,010
pieces of apple and they like to eat
this and they very quickly learn.

672
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,850
You can hand over a desk to
get some banana or some apple.

673
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,240
Now Dr. Santos and her colleagues have
done many studies using this method for

674
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,620
the study I'm interested in
illustrating here shows framing effects.

675
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,360
It needs nonhuman primates,

676
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,250
so what she does is there's
two options and one option.

677
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,610
The experiment or shows,

678
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:03,670
one object to the capuchin and low and
then either gives one or two half the

679
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,560
time,
gives one half the time,

680
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:09,860
give us two for an
average of one and a half.

681
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,780
The other experimenter does
exactly the same thing,

682
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,940
gives one or two for an
average of one and a half.

683
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,290
What starts off displaying
too now if you were a human,

684
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:23,330
how would you feel about
these two experimenters?

685
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,890
They both give you the same amount and
capuchins are extremely sensitive to how

686
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,830
much they get,
but it turns out as predicted.

687
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:35,450
They don't like the pink
experiment because the big
experimenter is it gives you

688
00:45:35,451 --> 00:45:38,780
two shows you two and half
the time he gives you one.

689
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,660
This guy shows you one,

690
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:46,690
half the time gives you two and over
time they develop a preference for the

691
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:53,060
experiment or it shows them one initially
suggesting that they are being subject

692
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,780
to framing effects or choices
relative to reference point.

693
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,580
A different sort of demonstration
is the endowment effect.

694
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,430
This is a robust and
very interesting effect.

695
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,063
Here's the idea.

696
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:12,380
I show you something like a cup
or a chocolate bar and I say,

697
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,640
how much will you give me for this
chocolate bar? What was your pretty hard,

698
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:18,210
how much are you give me for
this chocolate bar? You say, Oh,

699
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,600
I'll give you $2 for the chocolate bar.

700
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,330
Both people on average give
to the big chocolate bar,

701
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,070
give us $2 per chocolate bar.

702
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,440
The other conditions exactly the same
except I hand you a chocolate bar and say,

703
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,210
how much money will you sell me? That
chocolate bar for their people say, ah,

704
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,000
two 50 and in fact,

705
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:40,880
what happens is once you own something,

706
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:47,350
it's value shoots up and this is
mystified economists and psychologists,

707
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,050
it makes no sense.
The chocolate bar does even have to move.

708
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,650
I just leave it on the table and
say either how much will you spend?

709
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,650
How much will you give me for
this? Or okay, it's yours.

710
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:02,570
How much you want me to take it back?
The answer is it's framing.

711
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,160
If you're asking how much you
want for it, it's a game. It just,

712
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:11,750
how much will you pay to get something?
But if he, if you're being asked,

713
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,110
how much do you want for
me to take it from you?

714
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,490
You treat it as a loss and as a
loss it becomes more valuable.

715
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,010
Those are framing effects.
The second example is base rates.

716
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,120
70 lawyers, uh, sorry,

717
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:34,480
70 engineers and 30 lawyers
and John's chosen at random.

718
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,220
Let me tell you about John. 40 years old,
married three children, conservative,

719
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:42,940
cautious, no interest in
politics, awkward around people.

720
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,310
His hobbies include carpentry,
sailing,

721
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:50,190
and solving mathematical
puzzles like online dating. Um,

722
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,980
what do you think John is a lawyer or
an engineer who thinks he's a lawyer?

723
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,380
Good. Who thinks he's an engineer? Okay.

724
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:07,210
Most people think he's an engineer. But
here's the thing. You switch it, right?

725
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:11,440
30 engineers, 70 lawyers.
It doesn't change people.

726
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,200
No matter what this number is,
these numbers,

727
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:17,830
it doesn't seem to change who you
think he is or how confident you are.

728
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,100
People look at John as an individual
and they ignore the background status of

729
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,530
where he came from.
They ignore base rates.

730
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,970
Base rates are very
difficult to think about.

731
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,180
And I want to give you an example of this.
Um,

732
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:39,910
and the, the example will be on the
slides for when you print them out,

733
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:42,550
print it out because you might
want to work through it yourself.

734
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,760
But I'll give this to you quickly.
Um,

735
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,130
there's a disease that hits one in a
thousand people, pretty common disease.

736
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,970
There's a test for the
disease and if you have it,

737
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,080
it's going to tell you you have it.

738
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,010
It tests for a certain thing
in your blood and boom,

739
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,400
if the thing is in your blood to
test, we'll go boom. If you have it,

740
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:05,350
it will tell you you have it doesn't
miss. On the other hand, it's not perfect.

741
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,970
It as a false positive rate of 5% so
if you don't have the disease 5% of the

742
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:14,020
time, the task will say
you have it. So you know,

743
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,990
if the test says you, you
don't have it, you're fine.

744
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,130
But it's that says you have
it, maybe have it, but maybe,

745
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:22,390
maybe it's a false positive.

746
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,900
You take the test says you have to
detect the disease without pen and paper.

747
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,920
How likely do you think dogs are?
Do you have a disease

748
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,790
who says over 50%
okay,

749
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:45,200
before people sinisterly shouted the
right answer. Um, people will tend,

750
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:49,370
medical students were given us
medical students less savvy than you,

751
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,240
and the average is between 50% and 95%.

752
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:58,520
The answer is that some people quickly
noted 2% and here's how it works.

753
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,840
One person out of a thousand,
we'll have the disease.

754
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:07,830
That person will test positive
tests never misses. That leaves 909,

755
00:50:07,831 --> 00:50:09,330
nine people who don't have the disease.

756
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:12,780
And we'll say about 50% of these
people have it. So for every 51,

757
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:13,860
people who test positive,

758
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,750
only one will happen to cease
giving an average of about 2%.

759
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,510
This sort of thing is very difficult.

760
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,970
Our minds are not evolved to do base
rate computation. And so any problems,

761
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,370
base rate competition,

762
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,720
including real world problems like what
to do when you come back with a positive

763
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:34,050
test,
um,

764
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,300
we screw up and often we screw
up into direction of panic.

765
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,540
The third bias is the availability bias.

766
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,800
And this is simply that if you want
to know how frequent something is,

767
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,640
how available it is to come
to mind is an excellent queue.

768
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:51,910
Okay?

769
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,230
But this could lead to mistakes.

770
00:50:53,231 --> 00:50:58,231
A classic example by condom a is you
ask people one group of people how many

771
00:50:58,631 --> 00:51:00,790
English words and with n,
g

772
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,530
or what proportion of English words,
another group of people,

773
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,620
what proportion and with ing

774
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,320
turns out you get much bigger numbers
for ing than ng though of course.

775
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:20,000
AndG has to g sorry,
ng would include everything with ing.

776
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,940
It's just a lot easier to
think about these things.

777
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,580
Okay.

778
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:29,270
This can show up in real world.
What are your risk of getting killed?

779
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,620
What's your risk of getting
killed by a shark? Well,

780
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,240
if you ask people what their risk
of getting killed by a shark is,

781
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,120
they characteristically overestimated,

782
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:45,470
I will give you the news of what the
risk is for getting killed by a shark

783
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,500
injured.
Um,

784
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,920
in any given year one and 6
million killed one in 500 million.

785
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:56,630
If you live in Florida,
which apparently is shark central,

786
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,750
your chance of getting injured is
it about one and a half million

787
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:06,170
people will overestimate the risks
because shark attacks are very salient.

788
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,660
There always reported in the
news and are very interesting.

789
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,360
What is the chance of getting
killed by potato salad?

790
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:18,410
Well, food poisoning, death by food
poisoning, injury by food poisoning,

791
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:23,650
runs to about one in 55 one in 800 for
some sort of injury and one in 55,000

792
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:31,090
killed potato salad is one
1000 more times dangerous,

793
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,410
more dangerous than shark attacks.

794
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,070
But you get it wrong because you don't
think, oh my God, big news story.

795
00:52:41,071 --> 00:52:42,590
Somebody dies by potato salad.

796
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:48,910
And so we tend to over estimate the
chance of being killed by dramatic facts.

797
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,030
How many Jews United States,
what proportion?

798
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:59,340
Who thinks it's over three quarters?
The United States is Jewish.

799
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,900
I'm kind of anchoring here.
Okay, okay. Who thinks over half?

800
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,030
Yeah.

801
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:11,030
Who thinks over 40% who
thinks over 20% okay,

802
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,700
who thinks over 15%

803
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,240
okay,

804
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,770
who thinks over 10% who thinks
over seven and a half percent?

805
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,790
Who thinks over 5% hey,

806
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,810
who thinks overall there's more than
5% of the United States is Jewish?

807
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:30,883
Okay.

808
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,350
Who thinks over 3%

809
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:38,510
dancer is somewhere between 1.9 and 2.1%.

810
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:45,700
Most people think the average
American thinks is 20% service.

811
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:50,800
Um, if you're curious about
demographics and, and this map is,

812
00:53:50,801 --> 00:53:55,130
and to be entirely trusted cause
I got it from Wikipedia. Um, um,

813
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,090
this is the district,

814
00:53:56,091 --> 00:54:00,620
this is the distribution of the Jewish
population self identified as Jewish and

815
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:02,210
different parts of United States.
Um,

816
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,680
New York City is of course the
most dense population with 9%.

817
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,980
Um,
new haven

818
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,330
has 3.5%.

819
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:22,850
Now why do people get it wrong?
Well,

820
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:26,090
there's all sorts of reasons and this
is going to come out in the context of

821
00:54:26,091 --> 00:54:30,260
social psychology when we talk about how
people think about human groups. But,

822
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,320
but one quick answer is people who
are plainly Jewish are prominent in,

823
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,010
in positions where people notice them,

824
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,060
like entertainment or in the
case of have you guys academia?

825
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:49,740
And this could lead to our
dis availability. Can I
think of a Jew? Yeah. Um,

826
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,490
this availability

827
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,320
causes us to over estimate the proportion
to which Jews are represented in the

828
00:54:59,661 --> 00:55:04,400
population. Final example.
Confirmation bias.

829
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:09,110
This is a very nice study.
Um, it's very simple. It's a,

830
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:12,620
you're the jury of a custody case.
You have to,

831
00:55:12,621 --> 00:55:16,700
you have to give a child custody's a
either a mother or father sole custody.

832
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,110
One parent has average income,
average health, average working hours,

833
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,320
reasonable report for a child and a
relatively stable Saltzer chosen life.

834
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:29,030
Second parent has an above average income,
minor health problems,

835
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,530
lots of work related travel,

836
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:32,750
a very close relationship with
the travel with the child,

837
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,110
and an extremely active social life.
Think for a moment.

838
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,060
Who would you award custody with?
There's no,

839
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,360
obviously there's no right answer here.
Just just think for a moment.

840
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,270
Who would award custody to a parent?
A.

841
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,080
Okay.

842
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,730
Who would award custody to parent B?

843
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:49,803
Okay.

844
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:54,260
As I think there is in this room,
um, when this study is done,

845
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,800
there's a slight advantage to parent B.

846
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,950
Here's what's interesting. You give
another group of people this question,

847
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,860
which parent would you deny custody to?

848
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:11,240
You get a slight advantage for parent B.
Now,

849
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,970
this is to some extent an
illustration of framing problems,

850
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:18,020
but it's also more general
illustration of the confirmation bias.

851
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:22,310
So when you're asked to award custody to
use instant ask, well, where's a good,

852
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,370
where's the sign that
someone is a good parent?

853
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,080
And the good parent aspects of
be jump out when asking what?

854
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:32,560
Deny custody. You ask where's acute
at somebody, he's a bad parent.

855
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,920
And the bad parent
aspects, uh, be jump out.

856
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,960
In general, when we have a
hypothesis, we look for confirmations.

857
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,990
This makes some things
which are logically easy,

858
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:48,640
extremely difficult problems when
you face them in the real world.

859
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:53,530
And I'll end with my final example
that of the waste in selection task.

860
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:58,450
Here's the game and people, I don't want
people to shout it out just yet. Um,

861
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,580
there's four cards.

862
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:05,860
Each card has a letter on one side
and a number on the other side.

863
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,470
You have to judge whether
this claim is true or false.

864
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,590
Um,
if a card has a d on one side,

865
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,900
it has a three on the other side.

866
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:21,960
How many cards you have to turn over
to test whether that rule is right.

867
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,610
Okay. Somebody shout out what one
card is. You have to turn it over.

868
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,830
D everybody gets that right?

869
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,990
What else do you need to do?
Any other cards?

870
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,170
How do people think it's, it's D in
three. I'm raising my hand to foil.

871
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,410
People answer either d or d and three,

872
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,000
but think about it.
What would make this rule wrong?

873
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:58,080
It's wrong of as d on one side
and not three another, right?

874
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,250
That's what it would be to be wrong.

875
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,750
You then look after to check d to see
if there's a three and others hide.

876
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,100
You will write about that.

877
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:09,390
Did need to check eight to see
if there's a d on the other side.

878
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,950
Three is not that tell you anything
that's hard.

879
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,550
People find this very
hard. Okay, big deal.

880
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,680
But what's interesting is you can modify
it in certain ways to make it a lot

881
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:26,130
easier. And this is the work of leader
caused meetings in her colleague,

882
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,920
an evolutionary psychologist
as Santa Barbara,

883
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:33,000
who has argued that if you frame these
questions in ways that makes ecological

884
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:34,950
sense,
people are much better at them.

885
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:40,190
And basically she does studies where she
has people who are evaluating a social

886
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:41,064
rule.

887
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:46,490
Imagine these cards on one side of
the card is an alcohol is a drink.

888
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,980
Uh,
on the other side is the person's age.

889
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,860
You are a bartender and you want to
make sure nobody under 21 drinks beer,

890
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:57,880
which cards you turn over.

891
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,163
Okay,

892
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,750
well now it's easier,
but the logic is the same.

893
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,460
It's a violation that was under 21 on
one side or another side. So you need to,

894
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,340
to check the under 21 here.

895
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,500
I need to check the beer here.

896
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,880
And when you make these logical
problems more ecologically valid,

897
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,400
they turned out to be much easier.

898
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,170
Okay.
Um,

899
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,200
there's a little bit more,

900
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:35,201
but I'll hold it off till next class
and I'll end with the reading response,

901
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:43,090
which used to do your own bit of
reverse engineering and evolutionary

902
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,030
psychology.
And I'll see you all on Wednesday.
