1
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,270
I am extremely pleased to introduce
the fourth and final lecture of the

2
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:21,480
semester. Uh, uh,

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,540
uh,
the director,

4
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,860
he is well known or worked in medical
psychology and especially to research

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,663
depression,

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,080
the major and complete
with a special focus on,

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,840
uh, uh, can do

8
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,480
[inaudible]

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
and it has author what in my mind is
the very best textbook in her area.

10
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,890
And um,
and she's a,

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
she's a popular writer or an acceptable
books reading the message and ideas and

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,700
go.

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,330
The other thing I'll mention before we
welcome her if that he's going to teach

14
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,790
next year record [inaudible] they call it.
We've had it for reputation.

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,430
If you are and what you hear today,
you want to learn more about it. Um,

16
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,650
that's the question. It please
welcome Dr. Norman. Huh?

17
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,490
Thank you Paul. Can
everybody hear me okay? Okay.

18
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,520
So what I want to do today is to give
you a very brief overview of how modern

19
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:49,010
clinical psychology looks
at mental disorders.

20
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,990
Some of the ways we think about
what constitutes a mental disorder,

21
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,990
some of the characteristics that
kind of cut across mental disorders.

22
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,000
And then I'm going to use the case of
mood disorders that is depression and what

23
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:05,960
is now called bipolar disorder or what
you may know more popularly as manic

24
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:06,794
depression,

25
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,070
as sort of examples of how we think
about a particular set of disorders.

26
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,850
And some of the ways we go about
researching the theories, uh,

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,220
different theories for the disorders
and some of the prominent treatments for

28
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:26,990
disorders these days. Okay. So I'm
going to do both, um, a fair amount of,

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,970
of uh, lecturing. And then I've got lots
of video clips, uh, to show you as well.

30
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,630
So I'm going to be roaming
around and changing venues
here apparent fairly often.

31
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,730
So the first and most fundamental
question in clinical psychology is what is

32
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:47,690
abnormality? Where do we draw
the line between normal, healthy,

33
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:51,950
typical behavior and what we
might want to call abnormal,

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,610
a typical deviant,
unhealthy,

35
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,340
maladaptive mental problems.

36
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,380
We tend to have an intuitive sense
of what we mean by abnormality.

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,650
And we'd like to believe a lot of
people who come into my course. I will,

38
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,250
of course, you know, you guys have figured
it out. You know where to draw the line,

39
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,740
you have criteria, you
have blood tests, right?

40
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,700
That tells me whether I have depression
or schizophrenia or one of the things

41
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,440
I've read about, well the reality
is that that we don't, um,

42
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,540
first of all there is no biological test
for any of the known mental disorders

43
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,150
right now.
Um,

44
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,230
and instead what we have are a set of
behavioral criteria for how to diagnose

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,780
different mental disorders.

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,030
And what I mean by behavioral criteria
is a set of symptoms that the person

47
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,840
reports to you about how they feel,
how they think,

48
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,230
and a set of observations about their
behavior and how typical or atypical it

49
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,150
is.
And you take the sort of set of symptoms,

50
00:03:55,151 --> 00:04:00,151
the person shows her reports and you match
them up against the existing criteria

51
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,410
for different mental disorders.

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,740
And then it comes down to a fairly
subjective judgment call about whether the

53
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:13,060
person meets the criteria or not.
Unfortunately,

54
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,640
these judgment calls because
they are so subjective,

55
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,770
can be influenced by a lot of factors.

56
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,190
And we won't have a chance to go
into these, uh, too much today.

57
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,810
But just to highlight a few of
them. Um, the first is social norms.

58
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,150
Whether you get labeled as having a
mental disorder or a problem depends very

59
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,200
heavily on what your, um,
social or cultural norms are.

60
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,610
So,
uh,

61
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,620
a woman wearing a veil in a Muslim
community or culture would be seen as

62
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:45,670
typical,
even prescribed behavior,

63
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,870
whereas a woman wearing a veil in a
non Muslim culture and especially until

64
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,550
fairly recently was,

65
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,720
was often looked upon as very
atypical or abnormal behavior.

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,120
The second kind of thing that gets a,

67
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,570
that influences whether
something is called normal,

68
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,580
abnormal are certain characteristics
of the target person in particular I've

69
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,610
highlighted here gender,
um,

70
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,620
whether you're a man or you're a woman
really influences how unusual a certain

71
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:22,300
behavior is. So crying
is a good example. Uh,

72
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,080
a man crying in our culture
is seen as fairly unusual,

73
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,760
whereas a woman crying as seeing as
much less unusual. On the other hand,

74
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:35,761
a woman beating up someone is taken as
quite unusual behavior where it's less

75
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,110
unusual for a man. So we have gender
stereotypes, gender roles, um,

76
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,480
for what is acceptable behavior and our
judgements as to whether something is

77
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:50,290
normal or abnormal, um, get
influenced by those gender roles.

78
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,430
And the third thing that can influence
whether something is labeled abnormal or

79
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,640
not is the context.

80
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,880
And here I'm giving you
the example of paranoia.

81
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,300
If you're paranoid and hyper vigilant
looking for threat in downtown Baghdad,

82
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,470
that's considered very adaptive behavior
these days because it could prevent you

83
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:14,930
from getting hurt or killed.

84
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,600
Whereas if you're in a
quiet little farm town,

85
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,490
I'm in central Connecticut being extremely
paranoid and, and believing there's,

86
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,530
um, someone who's going to
shoot you around the corner,
uh, is not considered, um,

87
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,980
as, as normal or as acceptable
or adaptive behavior.

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,310
So the context in which you exhibit
a particular behavior also can,

89
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,410
can heavily influence whether it gets
labeled by others as normal or abnormal.

90
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,780
In the field of clinical psychology,
um,

91
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,650
we have a number of different ways,

92
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:52,720
kind of heuristics that we use to,
uh,

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,590
label things as,
as abnormal or unhealthy or troubling.

94
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,050
And,
um,

95
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,070
three of these characteristics are
that what we often call the three D's

96
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,630
distress,
dysfunction and deviance.

97
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,200
So behaviors that caused the individual,
um,

98
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,310
or others significant
distress are often getting,

99
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,680
often get labeled as
abnormal or unhealthy.

100
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,980
Depression is a prime example as
we'll see when we talk about the

101
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,120
characteristics of it.

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,280
It's a miserable state of being
your urine happy. You're sad,

103
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,510
you may even feel so badly you want
to kill yourself. And that very,

104
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,030
very high level of distress,
um,

105
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,180
is part of the reason why it's
labeled as a mental disorder.

106
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,620
Other mental disorders don't call the
cause of the individual and distress,

107
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,220
but they may cause other
people distress. So, um,

108
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:47,450
one example of this is something called
antisocial personality disorder where

109
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:52,210
the individual has no regard for
the rights of other people. Um,

110
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,230
has,
uh,

111
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,440
no hesitation to steal or,

112
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,230
or steal from or hurt other people.
Um,

113
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,260
has no empathy or sympathy for other
people's feelings and so can inflict a lot

114
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:11,150
of harm on other people and has absolutely
no distress over this whatsoever.

115
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,920
But his behavior causes
other people distress.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that's one of the reasons why
that's labeled an abnormal behavior or a

117
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,750
mental health problem.

118
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,890
The second general criterion
is dysfunction. If, um,

119
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,980
a set of behaviors prevents the
person from functioning in daily life,

120
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,370
then uh,
it might be labeled as,

121
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:38,960
as abnormal or might end up being
labeled as a mental health problem.

122
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,270
Again,
depression is a good example.

123
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,180
People who are depressed often
become completely nonfunctional. Um,

124
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,430
they can't get up and go to class.
They can't go to work,

125
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,410
they can't interact with their friends.

126
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,770
They withdraw and become
totally isolated socially. Uh,

127
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,160
so they might lose their job,

128
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,660
they might flunk out of school
and there's complete, um,

129
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,650
a decline in functioning is one of the
major reasons that we consider depression,

130
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,410
one of the most debilitating disorders.

131
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,410
And then finally, deviants. Um,

132
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,160
the behaviors or feelings
are highly unusual.

133
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,240
This is probably the most controversial
of the three because it weighs a, uh,

134
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,870
it is so heavily influenced
by the social norms.

135
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,130
What's deviant in one culture is
not deviant, um, in another culture.

136
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,700
But if a set of behaviors are
completely unacceptable to a culture,

137
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,780
highly unusual, they're more likely
to end up getting labeled as abnormal.

138
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,130
Okay. So how do we pull this
all together? Well, these days,

139
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,880
um,

140
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,880
the manual for making diagnoses in
clinical psychology and psychiatry in the

141
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:55,050
United States is called the diagnostic
and statistical manual or the DSM.

142
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,810
Um, and it's in its fourth revision.
It's been around since the,

143
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,160
I believe that fifties.

144
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,630
And the early additions in the fifties
and sixties were highly subjective and

145
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,300
based on 40 and theory.
But since 1980,

146
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:17,301
there's been a real effort to make the
criteria much more objective to make the

147
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:22,821
set of behaviors or observations that
are required to diagnose someone being

148
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,220
things that,
that are observable,

149
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:31,140
that you can see in other people that
they can report on reliably and that, um,

150
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,640
one clinician, uh, and another
clinician will agree upon.

151
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,810
So the DSM gives lists of symptoms with
the required symptoms for a diagnosis,

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,400
the number of symptoms they have to be
present and the notions of deviation,

153
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:50,430
dysfunction and distress are
built into these criteria.

154
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,700
And we're going to give you a couple of
examples of these criteria when we talk

155
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:57,210
about this specific
types of mood disorder.

156
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,531
So there's a,

157
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm going to use mood disorders as a
kind of a case example here of how we go

158
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:07,980
about diagnosing and
understanding psychopathology. Um,

159
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,510
but I also just want to impart some
information because mood disorders are one

160
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,900
of the most common
problems that people face.

161
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:20,901
As many as a one in four women will have
an episode of a serious depression at

162
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:25,590
some time in her life and about 13%
of men will have an episode of serious

163
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:29,370
depression in their lives. So
these are extremely common. Um,

164
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,500
kinds of problems that people experience,
uh, particularly at your age. Um,

165
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,820
the college years are one
of the peak times of onset,

166
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,940
first onset of,
of depression in particular,

167
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,350
and also for bipolar disorder
or manic depression. Um,

168
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,640
the late adolescent,

169
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:52,641
early twenties are the peak onset
time for these disorders as well.

170
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,150
So the mood disorders divided into
what's called unipolar depression or

171
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,160
disorders,
which is depression only.

172
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,970
And then bipolar disorders where the
person's cycles between depression and

173
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:04,804
mania.

174
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,270
And here are the DSM criteria
for major depression. Um,

175
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,420
one of the most severe forms
of depression. And as I said,

176
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:18,421
the DSM sets up these
relatively observable criteria
and how many have to have

177
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,060
and what absolutely has to be present
in order to get the diagnosis.

178
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,000
So the first criteria in the DSM,
uh,

179
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:33,001
for major depression is that the
individual has to either show sadness or a

180
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:36,700
diminished interest or pleasure
in their usual activities,

181
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,520
which is referred to as Anhedonia.

182
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,390
So you have to have one or the other
of these two sort of past the first

183
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,860
criterion. So you might say
that you feel sad and blue and,

184
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,200
um, just, uh, or, or actually say you
feel depressed. Some people feel those,

185
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,390
those feelings very strongly. Other
people don't really feel so sad or blue,

186
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,600
but what they'll say is that
nothing interest them anymore.

187
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,130
It's like the emotion has been sucked
out of their life all together. Um,

188
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,850
they don't have any fun doing the
activities they used to do before.

189
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,880
They don't want to hang with
their friends. Um, they just,

190
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,020
they don't care about eating.
Uh, just nothing feels right,

191
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:18,250
feels good anymore,

192
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,210
and then the individual
has to have four of the,

193
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:26,950
at least four of the following symptoms
in addition to sadness or hand Hedonia

194
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,810
first they can show significant
weight or appetite change.

195
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,561
Um,

196
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,790
so you may completely lose your interest
in eating and lose a lot of weight or

197
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,620
some people go on eating binges.

198
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:42,490
I had a very good friend who was depressed
for about a year and she gained 50

199
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:46,360
pounds because she would just eat. Um,
she would binge eat, especially at night.

200
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,010
There are sleep
disturbances, um, insomnia,

201
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:55,960
which is having trouble
sleeping or hypersomnia, which
is sleeping all the time.

202
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,420
There's a particular form of insomnia
that's especially likely and depression

203
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,160
where you can go to sleep at night when
you wake up at about three or four in

204
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:09,520
the morning every night and you
can't go back to sleep at all.

205
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:10,930
You're just up for the rest of the night.

206
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,400
But other people want
to sleep all day long.

207
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,290
And in the clip I'm going to
show you in just a minute,

208
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,820
the woman talks about sleeping
20, 22 hours a day. Getting up,

209
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,510
eating a little bit, and then going back
to bed because she was exhausted still.

210
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,810
Um, the third criterion is
psychomotor retardation or agitation.

211
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,690
The retardation is much more common.

212
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,560
And what this means is that sort of
everything about the person's movement has

213
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:41,950
slowed down.
They'll walk more slowly,

214
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,690
their reaction times will be slowed down.
Um,

215
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,450
and because they're so
much more slow moving,

216
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,000
a depressed people are often
more prone to accidents.

217
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,230
They just can't react as quickly as they
need to when they're driving or when

218
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,070
they're crossing the road and a car is
coming at them suddenly. Um, so that,

219
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,710
so they get into more accidents.
Um,

220
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,640
and their speech may be slowed down.
They may talk very,

221
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,320
very slowly.

222
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,740
And it's as though it just takes a
tremendous amount of energy to get even a

223
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:20,040
common sentence out, uh, much more,

224
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,660
uh, much smaller number of people get
agitated instead of slow down. Um,

225
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:28,710
they may be hyper and, and just feel
like they can't sit still and such.

226
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:32,340
But the agitation is a much
more rare than the retardation.

227
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,910
Um,
people feel really tired,

228
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:39,300
fatigued and like they
have absolutely no energy.

229
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,780
They can't get up and can't
get moving. Um, as I said,

230
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,820
they may want to just
sleep all of the time.

231
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,920
A number five is feelings of
worthlessness or excessive guilt.

232
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,420
They may feel as though everything
is their fault. Um, and the guilt,

233
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,170
feelings or sense of worthlessness
can even get psychotic.

234
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,730
They can lose touch with reality.
When a person loses touch with reality,

235
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:05,880
when they're depressed,
it typically has really depressing themes.

236
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,030
They may believe that they are,
um,

237
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:14,031
Satan and that they have to commit suicide
because they're in flipping evil on

238
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:17,040
the world.
Um,

239
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,020
they may believe is a though random
events or their fault, you know,

240
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:26,430
that that a flood that just happens
somehow they caused. Um, so the,

241
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:30,510
the feelings of worthlessness and guilt
can get out of completely out of touch

242
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:34,740
with reality psychotic more commonly.
They are just unrealistic.

243
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,890
Um,
they're negative self esteem,

244
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,890
just being down on yourself,
um,

245
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,070
feeling stupid and
worthless and ugly and bad.

246
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,063
Okay.

247
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,270
Number six, a diminished ability to
concentrate or in decisiveness. Um,

248
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,920
when you are depressed,
it's really hard to pay attention.

249
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,050
You'll read a passage over and over again
and it just can't process it at all.

250
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,180
Um, you can't concentrate on a lecture,
so going to class is just useless.

251
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,010
You have to make a decision about what
a paper topic is and it just seems like

252
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:14,630
the most monumental thing on earth.
Um, you just can't decide anything.

253
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:19,160
You can't think anything. Your thoughts
are completely clouded and overwhelmed.

254
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,843
Yeah.

255
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,140
And then suicidal ideation or behavior,

256
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,260
it means you think about
committing suicide.

257
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,280
You think about dying and a subset of
people actually take action to try to hurt

258
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:32,470
themselves or kill themselves.

259
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,660
Now it should be said that suicidal
thoughts and behavior don't only happen in

260
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:42,460
depression, they actually happen,
um, in all types of psychopathology,

261
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,580
but there are particularly
common in depression.

262
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,950
So you have to have at least one at,
uh,

263
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:52,500
four of those plus sadness or
Anhedonia and the symptoms.

264
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,470
It can't just be a bad
day that you're having.

265
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,660
These symptoms have to be
present persistently for at
least two weeks to get the

266
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:03,060
diagnosis. Now, truth be told,

267
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,900
most episodes of major depression actually
lasts a lot longer than two weeks.

268
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,340
In fact, the average length of
an episode, if it's not treated,

269
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,380
it's at least six months. So, um,

270
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,660
people stay this miserable for
a very long period of time. Uh,

271
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:22,620
but the minimum criterion in
the DSM is at least two weeks.

272
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,880
So why don't want to do is to just show
you a short clip of a woman who has had

273
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,530
a lot of episodes of depression.

274
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,860
Fortunately at the moment
she's not in an episode, um,

275
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,630
but she can speak very articulately about
what it's like to be in the midst of

276
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,990
an episode and some of the
significant symptoms that she had.

277
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,361
Okay.

278
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,000
There are a couple of things she talks
about that I just want to comment on.

279
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,770
One is this,

280
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:54,660
this differentiation between every day
sad mood and the kind of depressions we

281
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,870
all experience and the
kind of debilitating,

282
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,080
overwhelming depression
that she experiences.

283
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,670
And it is true that there
is this continuum from um,

284
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,240
getting bummed out because you didn't do
well on a test or because you broke up

285
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:13,800
with him boyfriend or girlfriend or
something like this and being completely

286
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:16,860
nonfunctional vegetative,
um, the way that this,

287
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,340
this woman becomes whenever
she gets depressed. Um,

288
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:25,430
and it would be nice if we were really
sure where the cutoff was between those

289
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:29,520
normal everyday depressions
and what's really a disorder.

290
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,650
But the reality is we don't,

291
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,950
we don't really have real
clear demarcation lines.

292
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,280
There are a lot of people who have more
moderate forms of depression then Tara

293
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:41,880
here talks about,

294
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,120
but who still would qualify
for a diagnosis and are
still suffering and impaired

295
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,080
by their symptoms.

296
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,190
So I don't want you to get the sense
that that if you don't have the kind of

297
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,480
horrible version,

298
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,560
I'm on the extreme end of the
continuum of depression that Tara has,

299
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,840
then there's nothing wrong with you
because that's not the case. Um,

300
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,210
people who are, are really slowed
down who their functioning is,

301
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:13,050
is interfered with. They're just
really unhappy with life. Um, uh,

302
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,430
have problems that can be,
can be helped and do need attention.

303
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,470
And it is the case that much more moderate
forms of depression can morph into

304
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,460
more serious forms if they're left and
treat it. So there is this continuum.

305
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,480
The other thing I wanted to comment on
that she talks about it early on in this

306
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,070
piece is,
um,

307
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:36,420
the fact that she hauls herself up and
goes through her day even when she's

308
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,860
feeling really,
really depressed.

309
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,960
And there is this characteristic
of a lot of depressed people, um,

310
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,680
that I call the walking wounded. Uh, they,

311
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,880
they just haul themselves
through the trying to act normal,

312
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:52,690
trying not to let anybody know that
there's anything wrong with them.

313
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm trying to keep up with
their schoolwork or their
work, um, their employment,

314
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,810
but, but they're miserable and they're
not functioning at the level that they're

315
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:04,600
capable of and such.
And that's something that's very,

316
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,650
very common and it's in part because,
um,

317
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,750
people don't feel as though they should
have to get treatment or they're ashamed

318
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:15,790
of getting treatment or
seeking help for depression.

319
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,720
And so they just keep going on
and going on. Sometimes for years,

320
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,010
I'm in a very sorry state, uh,
before sometimes they just,

321
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:27,790
they end up actually falling apart to
the point where they have to get help.

322
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,840
Okay.
Um,

323
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,790
the other category of mood disorders
that I mentioned are bipolar disorders.

324
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,500
And as I said, bipolar
disorder involves symptoms, uh,

325
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,270
or periods of depression,

326
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,140
but then also distinct periods
of the opposite of depression,

327
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,340
which we call mania.

328
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,580
So the person's cycles back and forth
between debilitating depressions and manic

329
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,640
episodes. So let me describe
manic episodes to you now.

330
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,920
So the first criterion is that instead
of feeling down blue or depressed,

331
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,700
the person has an abnormally
and persistently elevated,

332
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:10,300
expansive or irritable mood
that isn't just, again,

333
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:13,780
a good day because you
won a prize or got an a,

334
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,190
but rather it's this unusually positive,

335
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:23,260
expansive mood for at least
one week persistently.

336
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,730
And then the person has to have three
or more of the following symptoms.

337
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,820
First inflated self esteem or grandiosity.

338
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,830
The individual may feel as though they
are the smartest, the most, um, uh,

339
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,120
created insightful,
powerful person on earth.

340
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,910
And they are perfectly
happy to tell you this. Um,

341
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,060
so there is no problem with self esteem.
Thank you very much.

342
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:50,010
If you can't keep up with me,
it's your fault. Okay. Um,

343
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,670
there's a decreased need for sleep.

344
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,290
They may only sleep a couple of hours
a night and get up raring to go. Um,

345
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,280
they tend to be more talkative than usual
and there's a real pressure to their

346
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:03,580
talk. They'll talk really pressured
and they'll talk really, really fast.

347
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,440
And they're one of the
reasons we're talking really,

348
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:07,390
really fast as they have
this flight of ideas.

349
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:10,540
The thoughts are just racing through
their mind and they can't talk bathroom,

350
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,790
I have to get them out.
And if you can't follow them that well,

351
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,350
that's because you're not
smart enough to follow them,

352
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:19,030
but they've just got too many good ideas
and they got to get 'em out, you know,

353
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,370
highly distractible. And then, um,

354
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,370
there is this increase in this
weather what the DSM causes,

355
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,410
goal directed activity out
of the grandiosity will
come these grand schemes for

356
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,650
often for making a lot of money.
Um,

357
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:40,000
and they'll pursue these with great vigor
no matter how totally irrational they

358
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,540
are.

359
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,140
So it's not at all uncommon for them to
cash out all the family bank accounts to

360
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,760
sell the house,
to sell the car,

361
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:51,761
to sell the kids so that they can finance
this great scheme for making a zillion

362
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,630
dollars on the Internet
tomorrow. Right. Okay. So,

363
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:59,000
and they'll pursue this with tremendous,
bigger,

364
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,120
they'll also get involved in all kinds of,

365
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,460
with the DSM discretely calls pleasurable,
but the dangerous activities. Um,

366
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,190
there's a lot of sexual promiscuity,
a lot of drug abuse, a lot of, um,

367
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,160
um, uh, as I think getting,
uh, going and gambling,

368
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:20,090
believing that you're on a hot streak,
there's nothing can stop you. You know,

369
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,030
you're just, you're just so brilliant.
He got the scheme, you got to plan,

370
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:24,950
you're going to, you're
going to make it. Okay.

371
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,680
So the individual has three or more
of these kinds of symptoms, uh,

372
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,460
plus this elevated, expansive,
and often quite irritable mood.

373
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,790
It's not just they're happy,
you know, and sort of upbeat.

374
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,970
It's just that they're just impatient
and irritable and trigger fire.

375
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:46,370
And sometimes they can become
violent because they, they're just,

376
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,920
they're so incredibly
agitated and irritable.

377
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,900
So let me show you a couple of clips.
I have one really short one.

378
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:56,480
It's not a real high quality clip,
but it's a very,

379
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:01,481
very nice example of an older woman who
was in the midst of a manic episode and

380
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:06,760
it shows how, what this kind of
agitation and flight of ideas and,

381
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,300
and racing thoughts, um, can look
like. And then the other one is,

382
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,750
is all introduced whenever we do.

383
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,190
So, um, while she was at the
hairdresser, it was, it's,

384
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,110
it's a nice example of how
she just pressured to speak.

385
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,840
Nobody was telling her that she
had to say all of these things.

386
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,140
They were just standing there with the
camera and she was going on and on and on

387
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,330
about these things.
Um, and as you can see,

388
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:35,550
she was getting more and more agitated
and more and more irritated, um,

389
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,360
as she was retelling our story.
And then, um, what, uh, uh,

390
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,690
in the last little bit there,

391
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,760
you saw her flip from Romania
into a more depressed state. And,

392
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,120
um, this, this poor
lady unfortunately, uh,

393
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:52,340
is having a hard time
finding a stable point.

394
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:55,580
He talked about lithium there and I'll
talk about it in a little bit about the

395
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:59,460
use of lithium as a drug to try to
stabilize these mood swings. Um,

396
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,760
but at this point in this video,

397
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:06,650
it's not working for this lady and so
she's, she's flipping back and forth.

398
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,500
Um, but they're having a hard
time finding that middle ground.

399
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,990
So I want to show you another clip.

400
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:16,880
It's a little bit longer of a man who
has bipolar disorder and he is not

401
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:21,500
currently in an episode of either
depression or mania. Um, but again,

402
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:26,501
he can talk about some of the things he
got himself into and how it manifested

403
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:32,180
in his behavior.
Okay.

404
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,500
Uh, just a couple of things that Bernie
talks about that I want to comment on.

405
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,020
One is that just as in
depression, mania has, uh,

406
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,870
runs along a continuum,
so it can be relatively mild,

407
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,550
um, all the way to extremely
severe and even psychotic.

408
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,950
So when a person with mania loses
touch with reality, instead of having,

409
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,790
um, uh, beliefs that they
are Satan or some whore,

410
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,290
they've done some horrible thing,

411
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,450
they'll believe that they are
some supernatural being. Um,

412
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:11,250
they may believe that they are the
Messiah or that they are Albert Einstein,

413
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,551
you know,

414
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:16,170
come back to live or that they have
supernatural powers or something of this

415
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:19,470
sort so that there,
there are false beliefs,

416
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,610
their delusions and their hallucinations
and things that they see in here that

417
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:28,560
aren't really, there tend to be
a very grandiose in their themes.

418
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,540
Bernie's MMA mania is not on the far
end of the continuum by any stretch,

419
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:36,720
but you can see it still
gets him into trouble. Now,

420
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,210
there are people who have,

421
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,980
who cycled between fairly low levels
of mania and fairly low levels of

422
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:48,660
depression back and forth.
And there's been some argument that,

423
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,500
um, people who are kind of
chronically mildly manic,

424
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,680
especially if they're really smart
or they have a special talent,

425
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,790
can make it work for
them. Um, and there, uh,

426
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,660
is a wonderful book by Kay Jamison,
who's a professor at Johns Hopkins,

427
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,040
um, where she chronicle. She
does sort of historical, um,

428
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,910
die biographies on a number
of a well known, um, uh,

429
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,430
authors and poets and musicians,

430
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,260
Robert Schumann, um, uh, and
a number of politicians, uh,

431
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:27,261
Winston Churchill and such arguing that
they actually had mild forms of bipolar

432
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:29,060
disorder and,
uh,

433
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,100
that they were able to sort of channel
the manic episodes through extraordinary

434
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:38,970
talent or intelligence, um, in
ways that made it work for them.

435
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,210
They're also the number of
arguments that, that, um, very,

436
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:47,211
very successful CEOs sometimes are people
who are chronically slightly manic.

437
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,540
Um, they can go on to a couple
of hours a night to sleep.

438
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:56,541
They're obviously really quite grandiose
and self confident and that they can

439
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:59,290
maintain this kind of
moderate level of mania.

440
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:03,930
I keep it under control and channel
it in ways that works for them. Uh,

441
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:05,650
so if you're interested in that book,
uh,

442
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,300
send me an email and I'm happy
to send you the citation for it.

443
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,800
But for the most part,
um,

444
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,870
mania can get people into
tremendous trouble. Um, they,

445
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:18,390
they can,
as I said,

446
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:22,650
get involved in sexual promiscuity
that puts them at risk for sexually

447
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:26,470
transmitted diseases. They can
get involved in drug activity. Um,

448
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,960
they get themselves arrested.

449
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:31,870
They can certainly send themselves
and their family into bankruptcy. Um,

450
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:36,840
and these kinds of negative consequences
of the mania often are what motivates

451
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:41,230
the person to get help because the media
itself can be rather pleasurable to

452
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:42,550
have.
Um,

453
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:47,100
also what motivates them to get help
is the plunge into depression. Uh,

454
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,110
the knowledge that they will at some
point come out of the mania and go into a

455
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:53,410
debilitating depression.

456
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,670
Bipolar disorder is much
less common than depression.

457
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:02,671
I said that about 22% of women in about
13% of men will have an episode of

458
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:07,020
serious depression at sometime
in their lives. Um, uh,

459
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,860
bipolar disorder occurs and only about
1% of the population and it's equally

460
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,300
prevalent in women and men.

461
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,440
So it's a really quite different
disorder in many ways. Um,

462
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,570
from a depression alone.

463
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,640
I'm gonna give you some other statistics
about depression per se. And this is,

464
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,410
this only applies to depression.

465
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,980
There are quite large age differences
in the prevalence of of depression.

466
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,580
These are data from a nationwide study
of people between the ages of 15 and 55

467
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,480
and these are the percentage of
people in the, in this study.

468
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,940
And there were several
thousand people in this study.

469
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,540
These are not people who have
sought treatment for depression,

470
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,560
but just a random community sample.
And this is the percentage.

471
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:58,030
You've had an episode of major depression
in the past month. And as you can see,

472
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,600
um,
the 15 to 24 age range is,

473
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,900
has the highest rates and
then they go down some white.

474
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:09,700
All of the 35 to 44 is
fairly high as well with age.

475
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,860
Um, you might be surprised to learn that
the rates of major depression in the

476
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:19,750
elderly are actually quite low
by most national statistics. Um,

477
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,070
and uh,
that's true up to about age 80 or 85.

478
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,850
But, um, and,

479
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:29,830
and the arguments for why this
is the case are very interesting.

480
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,570
There are some people who argue that
as you get older, you get wiser.

481
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,490
And so that's, that's why we see a
lower rates of depression in older age.

482
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,030
There are other people who
argue that current generation,

483
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,910
younger generations now
your generation and,

484
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,860
and the one above you are more prone to
depression and will be for the rest of

485
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:55,861
your life compared to your grandparents
because of historical changes in the

486
00:31:56,141 --> 00:32:00,480
kinds of social support and family
networks available. Um, and,

487
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:03,190
and a number of other
historical cultural changes.

488
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,240
The other sort of side of the argument
is that because depression is known to

489
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,170
um, uh, impact negatively,
your physical health,

490
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,550
depression is associated with higher
rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke,

491
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,170
immune system diseases, a whole host
of diseases that people die from,

492
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,650
that people who have a lifelong history
of depression are actually more likely

493
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,120
to die at an earlier age.

494
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,600
And that's why we see relatively
low rates in older age people.

495
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,330
We don't know yet which of
these explanations is true.

496
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,250
It may be that they're
all true to some extent.

497
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,800
There are gender difference
and in depression, um,

498
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,570
these are data from a compilation of,

499
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,590
of hundreds of studies of children
and adolescence looking at a,

500
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,030
not full blown depression,

501
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:56,150
but levels of depression on
self report questionnaires.

502
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,390
Probably most of you have filled out
these questionnaires like the Beck

503
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:04,250
depression inventory that ask you how,
how you've been feeling in the last month.

504
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:09,020
And there's a kitty version of this and
these are data from that from several

505
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,910
thousand children.
And as you can see here,

506
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:15,911
prior to the age of about 13 boys and
girls have relatively similar or levels of

507
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:21,230
depression.
But beginning around the pubertal years,

508
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,180
girls rates and depression go up quite
dramatically and boys rates stayed the

509
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:29,810
same or go down.
And by the time they're 18 or 20,

510
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,990
you get almost a two to one ratio of
depress girls to depress boys. And,

511
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:38,420
and this is true for the rest
of the adult age span. Uh,

512
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:41,690
there are lots of hypotheses
about this, uh, why it's true.

513
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:45,770
There are biological hypotheses
that have to do with hormones.

514
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,040
There are sociological hypotheses that
have to do with the kinds of stress and

515
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:55,130
particularly abuse in girls'
lives relative to boys.

516
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,080
We don't know exactly why.

517
00:33:57,081 --> 00:34:01,850
It's probably a lot of these things
coming together that make this huge two to

518
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:03,170
one ratio.
True.

519
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,320
So let's talk a little bit about the
major theories and treatments for the mood

520
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:11,810
disorders. There are biological
theories and treatments,

521
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,310
what are known as cognitive behavioral
theories and treatments and an

522
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:17,840
interpersonal theories and treatments.

523
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:20,990
And I'll walk you through
examples of each of these.

524
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,290
So first genetics,

525
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,370
it's pretty clear that genetics
are involved in the mood disorders,

526
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,980
especially bipolar disorder.
There is,

527
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:35,900
there's very strong evidence in bipolar
disorder and there's a number of ways.

528
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:40,800
Um, have you talked about
how you do genetic studies?
Okay, so you guys know, uh,

529
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:45,230
about twin studies, for example,
um, and family history studies.

530
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:49,700
So this is actually a compilation
of a group of studies.

531
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,380
Um, and here you've got some of
them, twins studies compared.

532
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:58,340
So in monozygotic twins,
if you're identical,

533
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:00,380
twin has bipolar disorder,

534
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:05,270
you have over a 60% chance of having
the disorder yourself. In contrast,

535
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:05,931
if it's your,

536
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:10,460
if you're just a fraternal twin
of a person with bipolar disorder,

537
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:13,940
you only have about a 12%
chance of having the disorder.

538
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,830
So that Nath of difference,

539
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:19,460
there is very strong evidence that
there's a genetic component to the

540
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:23,150
transmission of the disorder.
Similarly,

541
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,900
the more distance you get in terms of,
um,

542
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,430
your biological relation to a
person with bipolar disorder,

543
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,990
the lower your rate or your
risk of the disorder is. So,

544
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,120
um, the second degree relatives, uh,

545
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,890
the person with bipolar disorder only
have about a 2% chance of getting the

546
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:48,720
disorder and that's barely above
what's in the general population,

547
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:52,670
which is about a 1% chance of
getting the disorders. So, um,

548
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,270
it's very clear that bipolar disorder
has a genetic component to it with

549
00:35:57,271 --> 00:36:00,930
depression alone, a major depression. Uh,

550
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,960
there are probably versions of the
disorder that have a stronger genetic

551
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,320
component to it than others.
And in particular, um,

552
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,380
folks who have what's called early onset
depression where their first episodes

553
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:20,150
come on in childhood or
very early adolescence, um,

554
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,050
seem to have a form of depression that
has a stronger genetic component to it.

555
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,610
Whereas people who have depression that
is clearly triggered by a major life

556
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:32,430
event,
like a trauma or a loss,

557
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,760
those types of depression or less clearly
linked strongly to to genetic factors.

558
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,513
Okay.

559
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,620
There are also a number
of neurotransmitters that
have been implicated in the

560
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:48,880
mood disorders and the
class of neurotransmitters
that's been researched most

561
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,700
often are what's called the Mano lambings.

562
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:56,800
I'm sure you've heard about the link
between Serotonin and depression,

563
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,940
but there are two other monoamines a
norepinephrine and dopamine that have also

564
00:37:00,941 --> 00:37:04,660
been linked to, um, to that
both of the mood disorders,

565
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:08,680
both bipolar disorder
and um, uh, depression.

566
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,550
And it used to be thought that it was
just that in people with depression,

567
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:14,620
they didn't have enough of these,

568
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,350
a neurotransmitter's enough
serotonin in particular, um,

569
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,830
in the system in the
brain, um, in order to, uh,

570
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,790
function normally.
Uh,

571
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,320
but now the theories on what the
role of neurotransmitters are,

572
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,560
have a lot more to do with the receptors
for these neurotransmitters and their

573
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:36,724
functioning.

574
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,800
And the notion is that the receptors for
neurotransmitters like Serotonin don't

575
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,930
function efficience.
So even if there's enough of the,

576
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,490
the chemical in the synapsis in the brain,

577
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:54,420
the neurons can't make use of them
because the receptors aren't functioning

578
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,930
appropriately.

579
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,880
And so what the drugs that help relieve
depression too is to improve the

580
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,890
functioning of these neurotransmitters.

581
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,080
There's a very interesting line of work
that's going on right now looking at the

582
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,630
intersection of genetic predisposition,

583
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,830
neurotransmitter functioning and stress.
Um,

584
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,210
and we have one of the world's experts
on this kind of work now here at Yale,

585
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:25,230
Julia Kim calling, uh, who just
joined us in the last year.

586
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,230
But there are several recent studies.
There's another person in psychiatry,

587
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:31,110
Jon Kaufman, um, who's
done some of this work.

588
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,140
But there are several recent studies
that find that certain variations or

589
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:40,141
polymorphisms on the serotonin
transporter gene predict who will become

590
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:43,450
depressed,
depressed in the face of stress.

591
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,660
So the classic study was done by Avshalom
Caspi and colleagues and they found

592
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,080
that people who have a one or two of
what's called the short ilial on the

593
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:59,440
serotonin transporter gene.
So this is a particular,

594
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,020
a variation on the
serotonin transporter gene.

595
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,970
If they had one or two
of these short illegals,

596
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,820
um,
and they were confronted with stress,

597
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,840
they were more likely to develop,
I'm sorry,

598
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:18,440
these are these to develop depression.
But um,

599
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,070
it's important to sort of dissect this.

600
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:26,050
So people who had it didn't really
matter which of these genes you had.

601
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,570
Um, if you were never
confronted with major kinds of,

602
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,530
of stress like maltreatment, um, if
you weren't confronted with stress,

603
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:39,280
the you were no more likely
to have depression, uh,

604
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,120
regardless of what kind of of
a Serotonin Jeanne you had.

605
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,630
But if you had either a one shorter
lel or too short illegals and you were

606
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:52,180
confronted with maltreatment as a child,

607
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,660
you had a much greater probability of
becoming at some time in your life.

608
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,170
And this has been replicated
with other samples,

609
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,420
with other forms of major trauma.

610
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,660
And basically the story is it takes the
intersection of a genetic predisposition

611
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,480
and major stress to create full
blown depression in some people.

612
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,830
Now that may not be true for all
genetic predispositions are all forms of

613
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:20,030
depression.
Uh,

614
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:24,770
but this serotonin finding is actually
been replicated now in at least four

615
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:27,660
different studies.
So it seems to be a,

616
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,430
a pretty reliable effect.
So it again,

617
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,640
genes do not determine, um, the disorder,

618
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,660
but the intersection of genes and stress,
um,

619
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,480
seem to be a major risk
factor for the disorder.

620
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,020
There are a number of brain areas that
seem to be involved in the mood disorders

621
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:51,500
where there's just
dysregulation or dysfunction.

622
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,910
The prefrontal Cortex, as you probably
have studied, is an area of the brain.

623
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:00,710
It's very involved in,
in higher order,

624
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:05,711
complex thinking and problem solving
and in goal directed behavior in people

625
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:07,400
with depression.

626
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,380
There's lowered activity in the
prefrontal cortex suggesting that,

627
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,470
uh, at which may play a
role in the, in the, uh,

628
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:20,620
difficulties in concentration and a
goal directed behavior in planning and

629
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:24,530
problem solving.
And in regulating emotion,

630
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,960
the Amygdala is an area of the brain
that is involved in the processing of

631
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:33,320
emotional information and
people with mood disorders,

632
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,680
overactive Amygdala Amygdala
responses to emotional information.

633
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,520
Um, this is true in both bipolar
and in, um, in, uh, depression.

634
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,660
The hippocampus is an area of the brain
that's very involved in memory and in

635
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:55,970
concentration.
And in people with chronic depression,

636
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,470
you often see shrinkage
in the hippocampus, uh,

637
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,530
and this may be related to their
problems in concentration and attention.

638
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,361
And then finally,

639
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:08,750
the anterior singular is an area of
the brain that's involved in a lot of

640
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:12,740
different activities, but, uh,
pertinent to the mood disorders,

641
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:17,741
particularly in responses to distress
or to stress and in a sort of the choice

642
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:21,400
of behaviors. And it may be that, um,

643
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,740
a dysregulation of anterior singlet
maybe involved in the person's difficulty

644
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:32,111
and responding appropriately to stress
in choosing good coping behaviors in

645
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:36,320
changing their behaviors whenever
their behaviors aren't working well.

646
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,210
So from the biological theories come a
number of different drugs to treat the

647
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,950
mood disorders.
Um,

648
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,670
two of the older classes are called
the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

649
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:53,690
And the try [inaudible] Canada precedence
and it twice actually because is still

650
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:56,930
use these days to some extent
they're relatively effective.

651
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,680
The about 60% of people respond
well to the tricyclics, um,

652
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,750
but they have a lot of side effects and
they can be fatal and overdose. And so,

653
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,500
um, there was uh, uh,

654
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,210
has been always a search for
other alternatives to them.

655
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,470
The drugs that have really taken over
the market are this selective serotonin

656
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:20,180
reuptake inhibitors or Sris.
This is Paxil PROZAC and the like.

657
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,520
They were introduced in 1987.

658
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,350
PROZAC was in the u s market and truly
took over the market and the treatment of

659
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:31,040
depression and anxiety in a
number of other disorders.

660
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,880
Now they're not that much more
effective than this sort of old style

661
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,960
antidepressants,

662
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:38,960
but they have fewer side effects and
they tend to be easier for people to

663
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:40,630
tolerate.
Um,

664
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,740
more recently there are a selective
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake

665
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:48,050
inhibitors. These drugs, by the way,

666
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,080
what these drugs supposedly do is to
prevent the re uptake of Serotonin or

667
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:58,490
Serotonin and norepinephrine
norepinephrine back
into the sending neuron.

668
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,640
So it creates more of the neurotransmitter
there in the synapse and these are

669
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,160
reasonably effective drugs,
although again,

670
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,520
there's a substantial number of people
who don't respond to them especially

671
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,570
immediately and they'll often have to
cycle through a number of drugs before

672
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,950
they find one that works.

673
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:22,030
Lithium as the drug of choice for the
treatment of bipolar disorder, um,

674
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,040
it seems to stabilize the mood swings,
um,

675
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,030
by stabilizing a number of different
neurotransmitter systems. Um, and,

676
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,610
but, uh, lithium is problematic because
there are tremendous side effects.

677
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,720
It's also dangerous for women to take
while they're pregnant in terms of fetal

678
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:43,980
development. Um, so it's, it's
a very tough drug to stay on.

679
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,580
There are lots of gastrointestinal
side effects and such,

680
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:53,430
and people are often on lithium and the
antidepressants because lithium often

681
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:57,510
only affects the manic episodes, but it
doesn't really relieve the depression.

682
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,040
Um, and then finally,
antipsychotic medications, that is,

683
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:06,480
those that help people who've lost
touch with reality are sometimes used to

684
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:11,460
treat the mood disorders whenever the
person has lost touch with reality.

685
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,440
I'm going to go through and talk about
some of the psychosocial treatments,

686
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,750
uh,
because I want to get to them as well.

687
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,250
The cognitive behavioral
therapies are based on, uh, uh,

688
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,290
Aaron backs negative cognitive
theory of depression. Um,

689
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,900
Aaron Beck is a psychiatrist at the
University of Pennsylvania who really

690
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,150
founded this whole line of work.
Um, and according to Beck, this,

691
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,900
now this applies to depression alone.

692
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:44,880
It doesn't really apply
to bipolar disorder.

693
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,640
People who are depressed have
a negative view of the self,

694
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,360
of the future and of the world. And he
calls us the negative cognitive triad.

695
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,900
And this negative cognitive triad is
fed by specific cognitive deficits or

696
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:02,010
biases. So depressed people show
a lot of distortions and thinking,

697
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,330
I'm all or nothing,

698
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:07,200
thinking is thinking that I'm being
are either all good or all bad.

699
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:10,260
They can't sort of see
the gray areas in between.

700
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,050
There's emotional reasoning.
Um,

701
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:18,090
and an example of that is just if I
feel like a loser, I must be a loser.

702
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,720
Or if I feel stupid, I must be stupid. Um,

703
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,220
and then personalization that is the self
blame that you often see in depressed

704
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:30,600
people and these kinds of distortions
and thinking these distorted ways of

705
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,890
interpreting situations,
um,

706
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,990
feed it kind of general negative view
of the self and a hopelessness about the

707
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:38,520
future.
Um,

708
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,960
people who are depressed also make
attributions for negative events that are

709
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:46,350
internal, that is, they blame
themselves, uh, that are stable.

710
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:51,090
They see things bad things as lasting
forever and that are global. They see bad,

711
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,300
uh, bad events as affecting
many areas of their life,

712
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,010
which again feeds their depression and
their general assumption that that life

713
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:02,920
is terrible and evidence that these,
um,

714
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,630
for these cognitive theories that these
cognitive negative cognitive styles

715
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,660
predict depression. One of the best
studies, uh, predicting this was studied.

716
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,490
It was jointly done at Temple University
and University of Wisconsin where they

717
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:18,690
identified first year of college
students with a negative cognitive or

718
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:20,010
attributional style.

719
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,490
But these were people who had never
experienced an episode of depression yet

720
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,270
they then track them for the
next two years. And the is here.

721
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:28,870
The red bars are the,
uh,

722
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,990
percent of those with a negative cognitive
style who developed an episode of

723
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,840
major depression in that two and a
half years versus the percent of those

724
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:40,570
without a negative cognitive style.
And as you can see,

725
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:44,710
there's quite a substantial difference
between the two. So prospectively,

726
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,720
these cognitive characteristics seem
to predict your risk for depression.

727
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,460
In turn, there's a cognitive behavioral
therapy that's based on beccs, um,

728
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:00,510
theory and the major steps in this
involved in identifying the themes in a

729
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:03,760
person's negative thoughts
and triggers for them.

730
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,450
And then helping the person
challenged those thoughts by, uh,

731
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,650
asking them what the evidence
is for their interpretations,

732
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,480
whether there are other ways
of looking at this situation,

733
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,770
how they can cope with the situation
if the bad thing really did happen.

734
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:23,370
So the therapist helps the
client recognized negative
beliefs or assumptions, um,

735
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,400
and in challenged these a challenge,
the truth value of these and,

736
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:31,480
and change aspects of the environment
that are related to depressive symptoms.

737
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:33,820
So they challenge your rational thinking,

738
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,540
but they also recognize that there are
really bad things that sometimes they're

739
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:41,620
going on in the life of a person who's
depressed and they helped them engage in

740
00:48:41,621 --> 00:48:45,740
more active problem solving to
change those environments. Um,

741
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,600
they also teach the person
ways to manage their mood, um,

742
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:52,330
so that they don't tumble
down into depression.

743
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:58,330
And these cognitive behavioral therapies
have been shown to be extremely

744
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:02,800
effective, um, and as effective
in some ways as the, uh,

745
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,020
uh,
the drug treatments.

746
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,230
So this is a reason study in which they
had 240 patients with major depressive

747
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,900
disorder.
Um,

748
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:15,460
they gave them four months of acute
treatment with either cognitive behavioral

749
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:18,430
therapy or Paxil,
which is an Ssri.

750
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,530
And in eight weeks here,

751
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,350
they also had a placebo control
group where they just got a pill,

752
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:28,120
but it was a sugar pill at eight weeks.
The Paxil group,

753
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:31,750
which is in red, and the CVP group,
which is in yellow. We're relatively,

754
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,350
even all of the Paxil group had a little
bit of an edge over the CBT group,

755
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,910
but by 16 weeks,

756
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:41,200
the Paxil and the CBT group were
absolutely even in terms of the percent of

757
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:44,710
people who were no
longer, um, uh, depressed.

758
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:50,110
So both of them resulted in about 60%
of people not being depressed. And then,

759
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,320
um, one of the things that's been found
over and over again with cognitive

760
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:57,580
behavioral therapy is that it not only
helps people get out of a current episode

761
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,414
of depression,

762
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,830
it helps to prevent future episodes of
depression because it teaches the person

763
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:07,270
new coping skills for dealing
with new stressors that arise.

764
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,680
So in this same study,

765
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:12,970
they followed the patients for
an additional 12 months and, um,

766
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,290
other Paxil group,

767
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:18,490
half were left on full dose medications
to see if you could prevent depression

768
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:20,140
by just keeping people on the meds.

769
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:25,400
And half of the pack full group were
withdrawn to a placebo. And, um,

770
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,200
let's look at the Placebo
Group first here. Um,

771
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,410
this is the sad news about depression.

772
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:34,340
If you just take drugs to get out of a
current episode and you go off of the

773
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:37,520
drugs without having any
kind of psychotherapy,

774
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,500
your rate of relapse tends to be
very high. So in this group of 240,

775
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:46,590
almost 80% relapsed in
the first year after, um,

776
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:49,640
going off of the active medication.
Again,

777
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:53,570
these were people who did not get
any cognitive behavioral therapy. Um,

778
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:56,480
of those people who stayed on Paxil alone,

779
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:01,520
about 50% relapsed. But of those people
who got cognitive behavioral therapy,

780
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:04,580
only about 35% relapsed.
So,

781
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:09,050
and this kind of a I'm finding has
been replicated over and over again,

782
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:14,051
namely that CVT can reduce the rate of
relapse in depression quite dramatically.

783
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:20,120
I give you a flavor for what
CBT looks like. Um, and uh,

784
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,950
cause I've got a short clip of a
therapist who's actually interestingly the

785
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:28,880
daughter of Aaron Beck and
his air in terms of the, uh,

786
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,830
um, the practice and, and development
of cognitive behavioral therapy.

787
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,600
And she's, um, demonstrating CBT.
This is actually a role play,

788
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:43,190
but it's a pretty realistic role play
of how she goes after and helps to

789
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:47,720
challenge. I'm a gentleman's, uh,
negative cognitions about himself.

790
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,110
This is the guy in the roleplay who's,
uh,

791
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,620
recently lost his job and he's
really depressed over his job loss.

792
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,270
Okay. I'm going to stop there
cause we're running out of time,

793
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:01,820
but I just want to comment on a
couple of things that she's doing.

794
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,040
So you see that she's,
um,

795
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:08,990
she's having him generate
his own challenges to his
negative thoughts and write

796
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:12,150
them down. And the whole,
one of the major premises in,

797
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,180
in CBT is it's not just what goes on in
the therapy session that is effective.

798
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:19,730
In fact,
that's a minor part of it.

799
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,940
But what the person practices in the
time between therapy sessions and so what

800
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:29,450
she's doing is helping him come up
with a series of phrases he can say to

801
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:33,510
himself when he feels discouraged
and plunging down. Um,

802
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,560
she's also helping him do what's
called anticipatory coping,

803
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,970
anticipating those situations that are
going to trigger negative feelings and

804
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:45,080
negative thoughts and coming up with
ways of combating them in the moment that

805
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:49,190
he can enact at the time. Cognitive
behavioral therapy is very structured.

806
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:52,400
It's very focused and it's designed
to be relatively short term.

807
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:57,710
The one other major kind of psychotherapy
for depression is interpersonal

808
00:52:57,711 --> 00:52:58,131
therapy.

809
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:02,990
It's based on the theory that negative
views of yourself and expectations about

810
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:07,991
the self and relationships are based on
upbringings that really fostered these

811
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:10,280
kind of negative self views.

812
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:15,830
And so what you need to do is to help
clients understand their negative self

813
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:19,340
views and how they're rooted
in their past relationships.

814
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,140
Interpersonal therapy is less structured
then cognitive behavioral therapy and

815
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:26,820
it's more focused on the past.

816
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:31,200
CBT is very focused on the present and
dealing with the current situation that

817
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:35,460
you're facing and combating that and
developing coping styles for that.

818
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,130
Um, there are a few studies comparing
interpersonal therapy with CBT.

819
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:45,980
Um, but much less research has been
done on IPT and CBT, but it is, uh,

820
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,030
a positive alternative for some people,

821
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:53,330
particularly those who find that their
depression is very tied up in recurrent

822
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:57,630
themes in the relationships that that
seemed to happen over and over and over

823
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,340
again.
But to end the,

824
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,030
the good news about depression is that
there are these alternative therapies,

825
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,950
there are a number of drug therapies,

826
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,940
and there are at least two psychotherapies
that good controlled research had

827
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,770
been shown,
can be very helpful.

828
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:15,950
So people have a choice and there is
absolutely no need for people to stay in

829
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:20,580
depression, but rather, uh, to
seek out the kind of therapy that,

830
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,110
that applies to an appeals to them
the most. Good. Thanks very much.
