1
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,880
This lecture will be,

2
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:15,450
uh,

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,830
some slightly shorter lecture.

4
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:17,664
Unusual.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,270
What I first want to do is finish off the
discussion of clinical psychology from

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,890
last lecture and then have a little brief
discussion about some very interesting

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,180
research on happiness.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,423
Um,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,491
we talked,

10
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,300
we ended last lecture with
a discussion of some early,

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,770
some of the history of treating mental
illness and we saw that it was rather

12
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,281
gruesome,

13
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:41,400
unsuccessful and arbitrary
for the most part.

14
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,300
We do better now.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,031
And Dr. Nolan,

16
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,420
Hawk cinema reviewed some of the
therapies but focus on therapies for

17
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,254
depression.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,290
The textbook talks in
detail about therapies for
different disorders including

19
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,350
schizophrenia,

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,750
anxiety disorders and so on.

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,740
Um,

22
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,970
the question which everyone is
interested in is does therapy work?

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,770
And this proves to be
surprisingly difficult to tell.

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,550
Um,

25
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,410
part of the problem is if you
ask people who go into therapy,

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,600
did you get better after therapy?

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,620
For the most part,

28
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,180
they'll tell you that they did.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
But the problem is this could be a
statistical byproduct of what's called

30
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:26,220
regression to the mean.

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,350
So the idea looks like this,

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,050
this line plots how you
feel from great through OK,

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,690
two awful and it goes up and down.

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,260
And in fact,

35
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,970
in everyday life you're going to,

36
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,290
some days are going to be average.

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,820
Some days will be better than average.

38
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,350
Some days worse than average.

39
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,150
You can plot your semester,

40
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:46,230
you could do a plot every morning,

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,090
wake up or every night
before you go to bed,

42
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,040
you can put yourself on a graph and oh,

43
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,470
come out to some sort of wiggly thing.

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,970
Um,

45
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,560
statistically if something is
above average or below average,

46
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,360
it's going to trend towards average
just because that's a statistical

47
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,194
inevitability.

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,390
When do people go to therapy?

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:06,931
Well,

50
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:09,420
they go to therapy when
they're feeling really crappy.

51
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,990
They go to therapy when feeling unusually
that even if therapy then has no

52
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,340
effect at all.

53
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,720
If it's true that people's moods tend
to go up and down after you feel really

54
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,440
bad,

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,020
you'll probably improve
rather than get worse.

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,550
And so this could happen in a normal flow
could happen just even if there'll be

57
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,070
has no effect at all.

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,440
And so simply getting
better after therapy.

59
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,770
Doesn't tell you anything on
the worst day of your life.

60
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,900
You could do naked jumping jacks on a
roof of your college for 10 minutes.

61
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,020
I guarantee you your next
day would probably be better.

62
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,000
That doesn't mean naked jut jumping jacks
or helping you rather just means that

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,270
the day after the worst day of your life
usually is not as bad as the worst day

64
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,104
of your life.

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,040
It can get worse,

66
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,350
but it's usually just trends to average.

67
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,700
Where you got to do then is you have to
take people at the same point who would

68
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:08,701
get treatment and compare them to people
who do not get treatment or what we

69
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,810
call a control group.

70
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,560
And this is an example of this.

71
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,650
So this is for people who are depressed.

72
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,360
This is statistically equal.

73
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,680
It started off pre therapy.

74
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,180
They,

75
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,450
they all go,

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,830
they all go for therapy.

77
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,320
But because in this example,

78
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,150
there's a limited number of therapists.

79
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,120
Some of them are put on a waiting
list and others get a therapist.

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
It's arbitrary,

81
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,641
it's random,

82
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,070
which is which making it
a very good experiment.

83
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,270
And in this example,

84
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,090
you can see those who
receive cognitive training,

85
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,190
we're better off,

86
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:47,191
they have lower depression scores than
those that received no therapy at all in

87
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,551
general.

88
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,384
In fact,

89
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,660
we can make some general conclusions
about therapy therapy by and large works.

90
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,740
People in treatment do better than
those who are not in treatment.

91
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,361
And that's not,

92
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:04,570
that's not merely because they
choose to go into treatment.

93
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,190
Rather it's um,

94
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,960
it's people who are in desperate
straits who seek our help.

95
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,820
Those who get help are likely to be
better off than those that don't get help.

96
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,130
Therapy for the most part works.

97
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,230
We can't cure a lot of things,

98
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,603
um,

99
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,290
but we can often make them better.

100
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,450
Different sorts of therapy works
best for different problems.

101
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,321
And again,

102
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:32,710
depression proves to be
an illustrative example.

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,920
If you have every day
uni polar depression,

104
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,200
that is you feel very sad and you show
other symptoms associated depression,

105
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,610
an excellent treatment for you is some
combination of cognitive behavioral

106
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,340
therapy and possibly a antidepressant.

107
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,350
Medications like Ssrs,

108
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,320
if you have bipolar depression,

109
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,990
the cognitive behavioral
therapies useless,

110
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,410
but medication is your best bet.

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,851
And so on.

112
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:01,280
Fraud,

113
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,051
other disorders,

114
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,750
each disorder has some sort of optimal,

115
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,500
uh,

116
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,550
mode of treatment.

117
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,190
If you suffer from an anxiety disorder,

118
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,530
cognitive behavioral
therapy can be of help.

119
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,800
If you're a schizophrenia it prime,

120
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,280
you're not going to be a much help at all.

121
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,630
And so different disorders go best
with different sorts of therapies.

122
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,143
Um,

123
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:22,890
finally,

124
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,160
uh,

125
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,910
some therapists do better than others,

126
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,130
so for reasons that nobody
fully understands or a good
therapist and they're a

127
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:33,910
better therapist and her a bad
therapist and there is great individual

128
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:37,600
differences in the efficacy
of an individual therapist.

129
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,293
Finally

130
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,330
putting aside then the
difference in therapies and
the difference in therapists,

131
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,070
does it make sense to say
that therapy in general works?

132
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,990
And the answer is yes.

133
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,410
And this is in large part because of
what clinical described as nonspecific

134
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,834
factors.

135
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,140
And what does this just,

136
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:01,410
is,

137
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,200
is a term meaning properties that all
therapies are virtually all therapies

138
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,063
share.

139
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,260
And I've listed two of them here.

140
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,880
One of them is support.

141
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,450
No matter what sort of therapy
you're getting involved in,

142
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,780
be it a psychoanalyst or a behavior
therapist or a cognitive therapist or a

143
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:25,901
psychiatrist who prescribed you medication
or someone who makes you go through

144
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,070
different exercises or it keeps a journal.

145
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,680
You have some sense of support,

146
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,940
some acceptance,

147
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,110
empathy and encouragement,

148
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:33,944
guidance.

149
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,731
You have.

150
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,270
Um,

151
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,380
you have a human touch,

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,560
you have somebody who for at least some
of the day really cares about you and

153
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,630
wants you to be better and that
can make a huge difference.

154
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,033
Um,

155
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,410
also you have hope.

156
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,933
Um,

157
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,510
typically there's an
enthusiasm behind therapy.

158
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,860
There's a sense that this might really
make me get better and that hope could be

159
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,694
powerful.

160
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,970
Sometimes this is viewed under
the rubric of a placebo effect,

161
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,300
which is that maybe the benefits you get
from therapy aren't due to anything in

162
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,140
particular to therapist does to you,

163
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,620
but rather to the belief that
things are going to get better,

164
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:15,380
something is being done
that will help you.

165
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,110
And this belief can be a
self fulfilling prophecy.

166
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,640
Placebo effect is often used sort of in a,

167
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,474
in a,

168
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,010
in a a dismissive way.

169
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,161
Oh,

170
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,240
it's just the placebo.

171
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,630
But will the CBOS can be powerful and
even if it's useless from a real point of,

172
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,360
from a psychological theory point of view,

173
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,450
even if the therapist runs around in
dances while you have dancing on my mind

174
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:44,180
now while you sit in a
chair and watch him dance,

175
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,760
if you believe the dancing
is going to make you better,

176
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,870
it may well help.

177
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,603
Okay.

178
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,410
That's all I'm going to say about therapy.

179
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,420
Any questions about about therapy?

180
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,823
Yes.

181
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,671
Fair enough.

182
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:28,570
The question is,

183
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,390
the assumption of regression to the mean,

184
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,150
um,

185
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,610
seems sort of arbitrary because it
depends what the mean is always after the

186
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:37,031
fact.

187
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:38,860
You can apply an average to it and say,

188
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:39,071
look,

189
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:39,910
this is the average.

190
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,440
But how do you know beforehand?

191
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,693
Um,

192
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,020
it's a good point.

193
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,030
When you talk about
regression to the mean,

194
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,330
it has it adopt certain assumptions.

195
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,320
The assumption is there really is an
average throughout much of your life.

196
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,803
Um,

197
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
and things go up and down
wolf in that average.

198
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,930
And for the most part that's
true for things like mood.

199
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,640
For most of us,

200
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,240
we have an average mood and we have
bad days and we have good days.

201
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,733
Um,

202
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,970
it's always possible that you have a bad
day and then from there on in it's just

203
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,260
going to go down and down and down.

204
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,950
But statistically the best
bet is if you have a bad day,

205
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,120
you're going to go back up.

206
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,430
Does it mean it's,

207
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,273
it's

208
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,593
okay

209
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,201
in some way.

210
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:27,600
You don't even have to see it
from a clinical point of view.

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,381
You could,

212
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:29,890
you could map it out yourself,

213
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,720
map out your moods and the days
where you're most depressed,

214
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,420
sooner or later you're likely to go up.

215
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,310
Similarly on the happiest
day of your life,

216
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,820
odds are the next day
you're going to go down.

217
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,450
And there's nothing magical about this.

218
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,710
This is just because under the assumption
that it really is an average in built

219
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,060
into one of each of us.

220
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,100
If human behavior was arbitrary,

221
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:57,510
it would be like a random walk,

222
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,553
but it's not.

223
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
We seem to have sort of set points and,

224
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:00,811
and,

225
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:00,991
and,

226
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,500
and,

227
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,430
and aspects of us that we fall back
to that make the idea of a mean a

228
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,900
psychologically plausible claim.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,833
Yes.

230
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,073
That same study,

231
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,980
how do we know that therapy
that helps in a waiting list?

232
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,480
That's a good question.

233
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,110
Um,

234
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,710
yes,

235
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,790
in that study,

236
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,140
it's a perfectly good hypothesis that
this sort of anxiety of being told,

237
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,090
I see you've come here for help,

238
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,680
we can't give it to you.

239
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,061
Congratulations.

240
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,930
You're a control group.

241
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,180
Causes Anxiety.

242
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,580
In other studies,

243
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,700
the control group doesn't know
they're the control group.

244
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,280
So sometimes you can do an intervention
where you say congratulations everybody

245
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:51,240
in intro psych who did very low
on the depression inventory,

246
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,800
which many of you filled out,

247
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,270
we're going to do something to you.

248
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,930
And then the rest of the people don't
even know that they haven't been chosen.

249
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,333
So you're right.

250
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,870
It's a perfectly good,

251
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:01,590
good point.

252
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,590
Knowing you're not chosen could have a
deleterious effect and the way to respond

253
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:07,980
to that as you have other studies that,

254
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:08,221
that,

255
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,420
that don't use that same method.

256
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,493
Okay.

257
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,433
Um,

258
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,410
I want to end with happiness.

259
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,010
And it's a strange thing to
talk about in psychology.

260
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,083
Um,

261
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,560
most of psychology
focuses on human misery.

262
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,270
Most of clinical psychology,

263
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,220
there's this psychology we spoke about
through most of the semester on vision

264
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:41,140
and language and social behavior.

265
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,080
But typically when people
think about interventions,

266
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,620
what they think about is people having
problems and then we figure out how to

267
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:50,494
make them better.

268
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,570
Their schizophrenia,

269
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,810
they're depressed or anxious,

270
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,200
they're,

271
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,090
they're just not making it in life.

272
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,140
And psychologists try to figure
out how to make things improve.

273
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,760
And in fact,

274
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,340
a lot of information I gave you at the
beginning of lecture last class where I

275
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,840
reviewed all of the disorders,

276
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,600
isn't this wonderful book called Dsm,

277
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,070
the diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders.

278
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,110
If you ever really want to get,

279
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,490
if you really want to diagnose people
and come to have a belief in your own

280
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,780
mental instability,

281
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,000
rousing through that book as a treat,

282
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,600
everything that can go wrong in mental
life from Asperger's syndrome to

283
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,680
fetishize to paranoid schizophrenia
is all in that wonderful book.

284
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,843
Um,

285
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,110
and,

286
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,110
but a lot of psychologists have been
disturbed by the focus of our field on

287
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,550
taking bad people,

288
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,750
people who are broken,

289
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,750
people who are sad and
bringing them up to normal.

290
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,160
And they've started to ask,

291
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,170
can psychology give us any
insight into human flourishing,

292
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,940
how to take people who are,

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,260
who had a study,

294
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,510
people who are psychological successes,

295
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,950
how to take people who are
psychologically okay and make them better.

296
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,260
And this is the movement,

297
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,860
uh,

298
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,750
known as positive psychology and it has
its own handbook now the handbook of

299
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,980
positive psychology,

300
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,830
listing psychological strengths,

301
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,900
listing virtues,

302
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,600
uh,

303
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,433
ways,

304
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,120
what psychology tells us about
how we can be at our best.

305
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,080
Um,

306
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,080
some of this work in positive
psychology is in my mind real crap.

307
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,160
Um,

308
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,030
a lot of it is,

309
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:37,680
is some combination of
new age banalities um,

310
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,130
by people who are striving to get more
grant funds and ended up on Time magazine

311
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,170
on the other hand.

312
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,880
And so some of it is really bad.

313
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:49,990
You could imagine this attracts every
self help huckster you could imagine.

314
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,030
On the other hand,

315
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,490
a lot of this work is quite neat,

316
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,660
quite interesting.

317
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:56,590
And quite promising.

318
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,970
And what I want to do is tell you what
I think is the most interesting research

319
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,520
from this movement concerning happiness.

320
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,450
Now,

321
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,970
there are a lot of good
books on this and I'm gonna,

322
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,230
I'm gonna recommend books,

323
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,880
which I haven't been
doing much in this class.

324
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:10,690
Um,

325
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,520
Marty Seligman is the pioneer of
positive psychology and he's written an

326
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,730
excellent book called authentic happiness.

327
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,740
I'm Jonathan Height is a brilliant young
scholar who's done also done a lot of

328
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,450
work on disgust and morality.

329
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,740
He did the sex with dead chicken
study we discussed earlier.

330
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,963
Um,

331
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,740
this is one of my favorite books by
happiness by nettle because it's smart,

332
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,020
it's beautifully written
and it's extremely short.

333
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,670
And Dan Gilbert's book stumbling
on happiness is a very,

334
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:46,660
very funny book and Very Smart Book and
is now in a New York Times bestseller

335
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:47,350
list.

336
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,030
So there's no shortage of books on,

337
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,230
on happiness.

338
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,323
Um,

339
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,720
so the starting point is,

340
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,480
and a lot of research on happiness
starts with a basic question.

341
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,740
How happy are you

342
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,130
and where psychologists.

343
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,160
So tell us on a scale of one to 10 where
five is average tennis super duper the

344
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:09,800
most common answers.

345
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,940
Interestingly enough,

346
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,803
our high,

347
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,040
there's seven or eight.

348
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,610
How many people in this room would
give themselves a seven or an eight.

349
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,470
Okay.

350
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,801
How many?

351
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:19,730
A nine or a 10.

352
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,130
All right.

353
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,963
How many attend

354
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,190
good,

355
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,670
good Max stone on happiness?

356
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,653
Um,

357
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,370
it turns out that most people
think that they're pretty happy.

358
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,650
There was a lake woebegone
effect with happiness.

359
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:35,000
Most people think they're very happy.

360
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,880
If I had most people think
they're happier than most people,

361
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,010
which shouldn't really happen.

362
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,233
Um,

363
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,910
this question,

364
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,680
how happy are you from one to 10
has been asked all over the world?

365
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,053
So,

366
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,690
um,

367
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,590
and it turns out there are slight
differences depending on how old you are.

368
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,330
There are slight differences depending
on your place within a country.

369
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,370
Um,

370
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,510
California versus New York.

371
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,800
There are slight subtle differences
between men and women at different points.

372
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,760
Um,

373
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,200
somewhat paradoxically,

374
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,250
although women are more
vulnerable to depression than men,

375
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,890
still on average,

376
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,990
women are slightly happier than men.

377
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,310
Uh,

378
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,860
the country by country
data is quite interesting.

379
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:22,694
In one study,

380
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,230
they looked at 42 countries.

381
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,280
The happiest,

382
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:25,611
well,

383
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,260
let me see.

384
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,093
Um,

385
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,670
the happiest people on Earth.

386
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,533
Well first,

387
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,970
no country believed they were unhappy.

388
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,730
They people in no country
of these 42 countries.

389
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,880
I mean you're thinking there's some really
bad countries to live in and I don't

390
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:38,780
know if they were tested,

391
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,250
but of these 42,

392
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,190
everybody seemed said
they were above average.

393
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,900
The happiest people on Earth.

394
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,753
The Swiss,

395
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,890
they think they're just like,

396
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:49,610
they're just,

397
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,600
they're just so happy.

398
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,650
Um,

399
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,680
I was talking to people about this last
night and they suggested chocolate.

400
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,893
Um,

401
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,910
the saddest people on is on the sample.

402
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,730
The Sad Bulgarians.

403
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,290
You are wondering what about Americans.

404
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,770
Americans are actually pretty happy.

405
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,360
7.7 when we are a happy
country full of happy people.

406
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,130
Um,

407
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,660
now I'm gonna talk about a lot of research
says based on the data you get when

408
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:23,630
you ask people how happy they
are from a scale of one to 10,

409
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,980
but I want to,

410
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,780
I'm going to be honest and tell
you there are reasons to um,

411
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,910
to be cautious about these numbers
and the reasons come from a couple of

412
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,320
experiments.

413
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,960
In one experiment they asked people inside
a psychology department where it was

414
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,920
a photocopy machine.

415
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,700
They went up to people that people were
going up to the photocopy machine to

416
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,860
make copies and when they
were done making copies,

417
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,650
they ask him,

418
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,020
how happy are you with your entire life?

419
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,820
There were two groups,

420
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,900
Group A,

421
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,630
they put a dime on top
of the photocopy machine.

422
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,641
So people walking around,

423
00:17:58,641 --> 00:17:59,580
I'm going to have to move here.

424
00:17:59,670 --> 00:17:59,851
Oh,

425
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:00,480
a dime.

426
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,760
No other group,

427
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,243
no dime.

428
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,420
It turned out that when asked
how good is your whole life,

429
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,140
Kroo Bay reported greater
life satisfaction overall
in their entire lives.

430
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,423
Um,

431
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,330
another study,

432
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,060
ask people how happy you are if your
whole life on sunny days like today.

433
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,440
And people said they were happier
on sunny days and rainy days.

434
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,480
What's interesting is you can make this
effect go away if you ask immediately

435
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:34,314
before,

436
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,370
how's the weather?

437
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,850
These were done by phone interviews and
logically what seems to go on is that if

438
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:44,971
you're asked,

439
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:45,690
how's the weather you,

440
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:45,811
oh,

441
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:47,070
it's really sunny outside,

442
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,640
and then when people are asked how
happy are you with your whole life,

443
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,660
people then say,

444
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,051
oh,

445
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:52,261
okay,

446
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:55,410
I'm going to take into account the
Sunniness when I give my answer.

447
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,773
Um,

448
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,023
okay,

449
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,290
so what is happiness?

450
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,660
What do people rating when they're,

451
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,690
when they're answering
these sorts of questions?

452
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,960
And this is an extraordinarily difficult
question and one could devote a seminar

453
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:13,110
to discussing it,

454
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,060
but one simple answer from an evolutionary
point of view is that happiness,

455
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,790
forget about what is happening
and that's what's happiness for.

456
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,350
Just like we've asked what language is
for or what laughter's for what hunger or

457
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:27,690
lost is for what's having as four.

458
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,190
And one answer is happiness is a goal
state that we've evolved to pursue.

459
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,740
It's a signal that our
needs have been satisfied.

460
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,170
Happiness is the carrot we're running
towards that makes us take care of our

461
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:40,471
lives.

462
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,430
We want to be happy.

463
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,840
Um,

464
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,760
an example of this is food.

465
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,580
You're not very happy if you're starving.

466
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,860
You want to be satiated,

467
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:51,060
you want to be satisfied.

468
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,100
So you seek out food to fill your belly.

469
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,150
Once you've done it,

470
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,013
you're happy.

471
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,743
Um,

472
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Steven pinker summarizes the keys to
happiness in a nicely evocative path.

473
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,013
Passage.

474
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,300
We are happier when we are healthy,

475
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,020
well fed,

476
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,561
comfortable,

477
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:08,071
safe,

478
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:08,850
prosperous,

479
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,541
knowledgeable,

480
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,171
respected,

481
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:10,951
non celibate,

482
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:11,784
and loved.

483
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,300
How many people here got
all of those right now?

484
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,741
Oh,

485
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:17,574
come on.

486
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,253
Some people,

487
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,131
oddly enough,

488
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,110
the person who said he was a 10 didn't,

489
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,160
is not raised his hand.

490
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:23,994
Okay.

491
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,403
Um,

492
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,423
so,

493
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,211
so this is,

494
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:27,930
and it makes it,

495
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,640
you get all your needs satisfied.

496
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,630
You know,

497
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,020
your,

498
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,321
your,

499
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:32,640
your belly is full.

500
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,810
People love you.

501
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,231
You're,

502
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:34,561
you're,

503
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,480
you're getting sex regularly,

504
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
you're smart,

505
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,000
you're rich,

506
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,163
you're happy.

507
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,080
But as pinker points out,

508
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,640
it's not that simple.

509
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,660
Um,

510
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,680
here's the problem.

511
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,243
You,

512
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,930
Americans in this century,

513
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,730
you are now healthier,

514
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:55,720
better fed,

515
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,600
and so on than just
about anyone in history.

516
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,473
Okay?

517
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,800
But you're not happier.

518
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,020
That's the puzzle.

519
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,340
Um,

520
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,020
in particular these studies asking you
about happiness have been around for a

521
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:11,854
long time.

522
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,073
Um,

523
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,070
people in 1950s did
not make as much money,

524
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,540
did not eat as well,

525
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,890
did not live as long,

526
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,170
suffered for more diseases,

527
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,840
were more vulnerable in
a hundred different ways.

528
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,850
You're there where are as happy as you
are now you are as happy as your parents

529
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,820
were and they were as
happy as your grandparents.

530
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,250
Moreover,

531
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,380
in poor countries,

532
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,120
people don't have the shelter,

533
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,170
the knowledge,

534
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,071
the protection,

535
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:45,904
the safety.

536
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,290
Yet for the most part,

537
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:52,291
there's not a huge effect on how rich the
country is and on how happy the people

538
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,314
are.

539
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,780
Furthermore,

540
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,570
there are great individual
differences in happiness.

541
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,680
Um,

542
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,350
among people whose basic needs are met.

543
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,550
For the most part,

544
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:08,230
everybody in this room is
fed and sheltered and safe.

545
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:09,550
Some of you are prosperous,

546
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:10,840
some of you are knowledgeable,

547
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,210
a couple non celibate and,

548
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,450
and put even among that group,

549
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,080
um,

550
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,640
you very and your happiness.

551
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,620
And that's kind of a puzzle.

552
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,080
And to explain the puzzle.

553
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,273
Um,

554
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,140
we need to talk about a few surprising
facts about happiness and our present

555
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:29,974
three of them.

556
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,900
The first is happiness doesn't change
as much as you think in particular.

557
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,350
Happiness is not as
sensitive to what happens.

558
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:41,490
Your,

559
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,490
your happiness is not as sensitive to
what happens in your environment as you

560
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,300
might think it is.

561
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,873
Um,

562
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,040
part of the reason for this is that there
appears to be a strong heritable basis

563
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:00,370
for happiness.

564
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,690
So just as we talked to the domains
of personality and intelligence,

565
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,910
there's some genetic determination,

566
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,110
not entirely,

567
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,210
but some in how happy you are.

568
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,160
And some people talk in terms of a
genetically determined set point.

569
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,840
So you have a sort of
natural happiness level,

570
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,710
maybe a range to put
it in an extreme form.

571
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,980
Some people are genetically
predisposed to be pretty sour,

572
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,420
others,

573
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,631
uh,

574
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:29,770
to be pretty cheerful.

575
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,780
Well that can't be it.

576
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,510
Identical twins are very
similar in their happiness.

577
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:39,850
But as with everything
else we've discussed,

578
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,080
they're not identical.

579
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,090
What about life events?

580
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,680
Wouldn't life events change your,

581
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,370
and here we're entering one of the
great discoveries of happiness research.

582
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,530
Think for a moment,

583
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,960
what's the worst thing
that could happen to you?

584
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,140
And then ask how much would
it change your happiness?

585
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,060
Okay,

586
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,200
now think for a moment,

587
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,510
what's the best thing
that could happen to you?

588
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,670
And ask how much would
it change your happiness?

589
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,173
And

590
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,090
the research in happiness suggest that
your gut feelings are probably wrong.

591
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,860
And here's a couple of case studies.

592
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,650
For many people,

593
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:31,390
a very bad thing that could happen to
you is to be paralyzed from the neck down

594
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,673
in an accident.

595
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,710
It turns out,

596
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,890
obviously common sense
that when this happens,

597
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:40,480
it makes people very unhappy.

598
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,010
It makes them depressed.

599
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,720
They think their life is over.

600
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,231
They are.

601
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:45,820
They feel terribly sad,

602
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,490
but not for that long.

603
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:54,040
After about a year after being
paralyzed from the neck down,

604
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,340
people's happiness comes back up
pretty much to where it was before,

605
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,010
suggesting that there's
a temporary effect,

606
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,390
but not a permanent one.

607
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,020
Many people believe that winning many,

608
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:12,500
many millions of dollars in the
lottery will make you happier.

609
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,180
And it does.

610
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,360
When you open up that
winning ticket and you say,

611
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,860
I want $100 million,

612
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:19,101
you say,

613
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:19,610
Woo Hoo,

614
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,810
you are honest to God,

615
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,471
very happy.

616
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:21,801
You'd say,

617
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:22,041
hell,

618
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,950
I'm at 10.5 I am very happy.

619
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,300
A year later you are not as happy.

620
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,931
In fact,

621
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:32,360
lottery winning may be a
terrible case where people,

622
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:32,990
where it goes,

623
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,640
the reverse of what you expect.

624
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,420
What happens when you win a lot of money
is it often wrenches you away from your

625
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:42,620
family or work in your friends and
leads you to depression and sadness,

626
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,620
but even mundane events
that would make you happy,

627
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,330
that you think would make you happy.

628
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,810
Don't seem to last in some
research by Dan Gilbert and others,

629
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,000
they've asked young,

630
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,020
young assistant professors who are
coming up for tenure and tenure in a

631
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:04,130
university system is a good thing to
get because it gives you lifetime job

632
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:04,964
security.

633
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,923
Um,

634
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,300
how happy you would you
feel if you got tenure?

635
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,310
How happy would you feel if you didn't
get tenure prior to the last election?

636
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,043
Um,

637
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,550
they ask people,

638
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,460
how happy would you be
if it was President Bush?

639
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,800
How happy would you be
if it was precedent,

640
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:22,634
Carey?

641
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:28,030
And it turns out people radically
overestimated the effects of these things.

642
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,170
Having your favorite candidate
win is not such a big deal.

643
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,380
Having your favorite candidate
lose is not such a big deal either.

644
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,311
Getting tenure,

645
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:38,031
not getting tenure,

646
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:38,751
a really big one,

647
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:43,040
it happens six months later and
a year later your happiness,

648
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,600
it doesn't seem to be effected.

649
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,480
Um,

650
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,370
the purchase of consumer goods,

651
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:47,911
uh,

652
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:49,280
an Xbox three 60,

653
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,940
a nice flat screen TV,

654
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,690
those sorts of things make you very happy
when you open up the package and set

655
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:55,524
it up.

656
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,720
But this happiness fades
almost immediately.

657
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,390
The moral of a lot of people
are shaking their heads.

658
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:01,160
It's true.

659
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,993
Um,

660
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:02,941
I mean,

661
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:03,151
not,

662
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:03,984
not for me,

663
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:04,441
but,

664
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:05,274
um,

665
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,610
the moral of a lot of this work is we,

666
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,390
we,

667
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,730
we think the things will have big,

668
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,590
permanent and profound effects,

669
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,960
but they need not and they often don't.

670
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,663
Why not?

671
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,640
Why don't we overestimate their happiness?

672
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,170
And the technical term for this,

673
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:23,004
by the way,

674
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,350
is effective forecasting.

675
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:25,801
Again,

676
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:30,801
this is Dan Gilbert's work and the idea
is we are bad at effective forecasting.

677
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,320
That is we are bad at predicting how happy
or sad we will be in the future based

678
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:38,880
on what's happening to us.

679
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,620
Um,

680
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,453
why?

681
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,210
Well,

682
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:42,871
couple of reasons.

683
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:47,250
One thing is there's often a failure to
appreciate the day to day irrelevance of

684
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,090
certain events.

685
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,520
So prior to the election,

686
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,140
you know,

687
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,000
elections happening tomorrow
and I asked somebody who's,

688
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:54,834
uh,

689
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,030
who's a a die hard democrat,

690
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,160
how would you feel if Bush won?

691
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,050
And the person that I'll be miserable,

692
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,690
it'd be a miserable four years afterwards.

693
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,370
But what,

694
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,390
what often isn't appreciated here is that
whether or not Bush wins will make you

695
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,910
sad or happy after it happens.

696
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,860
But for the most of your day to day life,

697
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,840
you weren't thinking about
who the president is.

698
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,490
I'd be very happy if I want
a huge price and ivy what?

699
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:24,871
Whoa.

700
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,830
Huge prize.

701
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,060
The Nobel Prize,

702
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,420
a Guggenheim and MacArthur genius
where I get them all at the same day.

703
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,400
What a day.

704
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,300
I am really happy.

705
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,213
But then,

706
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,491
you know,

707
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:39,720
a month later I'm there and I still got
my regular insomnia and there's nothing

708
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:41,520
on on TV and you know,

709
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,870
and the plumber is not coming.

710
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:43,380
And I mean,

711
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,950
you know,

712
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,700
my kids don't respect me and
I can't say and the fact that,

713
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:47,971
yeah,

714
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:49,160
but it wouldn't the prize,

715
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,610
it doesn't matter a lot of the things
in life that will make you really,

716
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:53,881
that,

717
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:54,270
that,

718
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,610
that you think will make you really happy,

719
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,290
don't have this day to day effect.

720
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,773
Also,

721
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,430
there's the logic of the set point
and this comes to a terrible word.

722
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,480
We adapt.

723
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,173
Um,

724
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,550
right now I'm a guy without a Nobel prize.

725
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,720
I'm kind of used to it.

726
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,970
If I got a Nobel prize,

727
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,340
I'd be a guy if a Nobel prize be happy,

728
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,400
but then I kind of get used to that too.

729
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,780
If I've got a second one who oh,

730
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:22,614
too.

731
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,080
But then I just get used to that too.

732
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,790
You get used to things.

733
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,630
Um,

734
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,010
you get used to bad things.

735
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,370
Now I don't want to overstate this.

736
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,500
There are some very
interesting exceptions.

737
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,693
Um,

738
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,570
so for instance,

739
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,583
um,

740
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,670
we don't get used to noise.

741
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,870
A lot of research suggests that
if your environment is noisy,

742
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,000
like they're doing
construction around you,

743
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,980
you can't get used to it.

744
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,400
Your happiness drops and
it doesn't come back up.

745
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,540
Your system cannot habituate
to continued noise.

746
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,353
MMM.

747
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,930
We adapt to good things.

748
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,820
Okay.

749
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,170
A winning lottery,

750
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,220
winning a prize,

751
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,471
getting an a.

752
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:09,320
And of course we have that.

753
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:10,154
We get used to it

754
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,890
also with some surprising exceptions.

755
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,861
One of the big,

756
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:15,630
except [inaudible].

757
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,560
One of the other surprises from happiness
research is the effects of cosmetic

758
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:20,394
surgery,

759
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,400
like a breast enhancement
and breast reduction.

760
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,360
Um,

761
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,360
one of the big surprises is it makes
people happier and then they stay happier.

762
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,710
And one explanation for this is
how we look is very important.

763
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,100
It's very important for how other
people see us and how we see ourselves.

764
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,440
And you never get used to
looking in a certain way.

765
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,270
So if you look better,

766
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:44,010
it just makes you happier all the time.

767
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,320
So there are these exceptions,

768
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,040
but putting aside the exceptions,

769
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,153
mmm.

770
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,980
The problem of adaptation is sometimes
called the hedonic treadmill.

771
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,380
And the idea is he Dominic for happy.

772
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,700
You keep on running.

773
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,860
But no matter how fast you run,

774
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,283
um,

775
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,680
you stay where you are,

776
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,970
you get used to it.

777
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,910
Habituation is like you,

778
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,491
you put,

779
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:13,220
you step into very hot bath
but you get used to it.

780
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:14,010
It's a cold bath.

781
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,843
You get used to it.

782
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,620
Um,

783
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,780
a difficult environment
and easy environment.

784
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,770
You get used to it.

785
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,900
The story is often illustrated
is often an illustrative,

786
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:24,860
a story from the Bible,

787
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:25,560
uh,

788
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,270
in Ecclesiastes,

789
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:27,680
these,

790
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:27,781
uh,

791
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:31,100
of a king and his king had it all.

792
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,200
You had gardens,

793
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,363
parks,

794
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,360
vineyards,

795
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,380
castles,

796
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,950
slaves and concubines and they
were both male and female.

797
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:40,784
Concubines.

798
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,300
We had everything right,

799
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,850
but it didn't make him happy.

800
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:47,870
And here's what he says,

801
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,160
I hated life.

802
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,120
All is vanity and a chasing after wind.

803
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,460
And there is nothing to
be gained under the sun.

804
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,870
Now in these books I've
talked about at the beginning,

805
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:04,330
these authors give advice on how
to deal with the nonaccredited.

806
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,970
How do you deal with the fact that
everything that you aspire to,

807
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,260
once you get it,

808
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,590
you'll be used to it and,

809
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,061
and,

810
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,580
and it will lose its value?

811
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,593
Well,

812
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,210
one answer is that possessions
are not the key to happiness.

813
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,370
Okay?

814
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:22,911
Possessions,

815
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:24,370
you very quickly get used to

816
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,081
from there.

817
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:28,340
There are two alternatives.

818
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,530
One is endless novelty.

819
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,431
So one guy,

820
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:32,330
I forget his name,

821
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,410
wrote a book and he says,

822
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:33,710
look,

823
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,880
there's a Donna treadmill.

824
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,550
The trick is always do
something different.

825
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,073
Next week,

826
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,940
have sex with someone
you've never had sex before.

827
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,010
Then climb Mount Everest.

828
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,570
You get bored with that.

829
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,440
Become an accountant.

830
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,260
Borning scuba diving boring.

831
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,640
You had endless ideas and,

832
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:52,610
and that's the possibility.

833
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,600
You never,

834
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,910
if you keep changing what you're doing,

835
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:57,500
you'll never get used to anything.

836
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,280
Um,

837
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,540
and you'll always be happy.

838
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,640
At least he says that.

839
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,350
Then there's the old guy alternative.

840
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,690
Step off the treadmill,

841
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,340
give up,

842
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,080
give up chasing the whole happiness
thing and then seek out more substantial

843
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:17,081
goods that might actually not make you
happy in a simple sense of a quick fix of

844
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:18,734
delight.

845
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,110
But substantial goods like friends
and family and longterm projects.

846
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,410
So the first moral of the
science of happiness is,

847
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,060
is,

848
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,893
um,

849
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,340
that your happiness is
actually rather fixed.

850
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,260
It's fixed and parked genetically.

851
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,620
And it's fixed in part because
what happens in your life,

852
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,490
you'll get used to,

853
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,360
to a large extent,

854
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,583
you raised your hands.

855
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,050
That was,

856
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:43,790
sorry.

857
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,623
Um,

858
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,910
the second one is

859
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,670
happiness is relative.

860
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,060
So there's a lot of research on money,

861
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,520
power and happiness.

862
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,530
And remember I did say before that it
doesn't matter whether you come from a

863
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:08,170
rich country are a poor country
as long as your country,

864
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,670
as long as you're not starving to death,

865
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,110
it kind of doesn't matter how rich
your country is for how happy you are.

866
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,820
But that's not the same as saying it
doesn't matter how much money you make.

867
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,163
In fact,

868
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,030
um,

869
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,841
there's a set point,

870
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:23,620
our range,

871
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,340
but there was some effect on
your salary and on your job,

872
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,060
um,

873
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,290
on your happiness.

874
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,590
And if you're desperately poor,

875
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,910
no matter where you are,

876
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,380
no matter who's around you,

877
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,490
you're not going to be happy.

878
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,950
But beyond that,

879
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,760
your happiness depends on
your relative circumstance.

880
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:43,930
Um,

881
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,190
and this is an old insight,

882
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,040
a HL Mencken wrote,

883
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,230
a wealthy man is one who earns $100
more than his wife's sister's husband.

884
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,710
The idea is what matters
isn't how much you make.

885
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:00,190
What matters is how much you make
relative to the people around you.

886
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:00,760
Um,

887
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,900
and they've asked people this,

888
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,150
what would you rather you want to make?

889
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,200
$70,000.

890
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:10,201
If everybody else in your office
is making 65,000 or $75,000,

891
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,100
everybody else's making 80,000,

892
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,680
does it matter how much money you bring
home or does it matter how much money

893
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,540
you get make relative to other people?

894
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,740
Well,

895
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,510
they're both factors
but relative it salary.

896
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,570
And in this example people prefer,

897
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,910
prefer this.

898
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,410
Um,

899
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,670
they prefer to be making less if they're
making more than the people around

900
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:37,320
them.

901
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,050
It turns out that there's research,

902
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,020
um,

903
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,720
on British social servants and,

904
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,750
and their happiness and their health and
the quality of their relationships and

905
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:53,310
how they loved their lives isn't
depend on how much money they make.

906
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,460
It depends on where they are
relative to everybody else.

907
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,550
We are very status conscious primates.

908
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,360
And your,

909
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,631
and your,

910
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:00,871
your,

911
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:02,540
your role in a hierarchy,

912
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:07,541
your level in the hierarchy plays a sig
as a significant effect on your level of

913
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:08,970
happiness.

914
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,803
Um,

915
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,060
this is not really a secret.

916
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:12,930
Uh,

917
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,100
the opera star,

918
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,250
Maria callous and the English professors,

919
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:19,680
Stanley fish had the
same negotiating strategy

920
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,060
when fish got hired into his department.

921
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,710
According to urban legend,

922
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:27,510
at least he said,

923
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,710
I don't want to talk salary.

924
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,300
I don't have a particular number in mind.

925
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,980
I just want to get paid $100 more than
whoever's the top person is department.

926
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,160
And that,

927
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,050
that's a guy who knows about happiness.

928
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,940
He walks in each day saying,

929
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,710
I pay more than everybody else.

930
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,750
I don't care how much it is,

931
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,830
it's just more,

932
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,550
and that's relevant to happiness.

933
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,570
We're now in a position to
give some advice to the king.

934
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,240
Summing up first,

935
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,150
going back again to Dr
Knowlton Huxson was lecture,

936
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,260
I think the king as suffering
from mild unipolar depression.

937
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,640
So we usually,

938
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,710
he usually got some SSR,

939
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:09,450
i's and cognitive behavior therapy.

940
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,863
Um,

941
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,060
I think he needs to move his
castle to quiet part of kingdom.

942
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,640
The noise of a dizzy castle is,

943
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:18,474
is um,

944
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,850
stressful and

945
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,170
he needs to give up on the compromise.

946
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,340
Um,

947
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,570
he needs to find the queen.

948
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,490
He used to develop social relationships,

949
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:30,420
join a club,

950
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,260
um,

951
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,640
get involved in charities.

952
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,533
Maybe a hobby.

953
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,240
The final finding is a bit of
a jump to a different topic.

954
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,720
But sorry,

955
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,330
you raised yes.

956
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,950
The question is did you become used
to changes in social interaction?

957
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:58,580
Um,

958
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,980
an example is solitary
confinement or prison.

959
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,030
Um,

960
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,560
people get used to a lot of things.

961
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:04,820
It could be that,

962
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:09,050
that in those examples there was a
shift in status as well and social

963
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:12,020
relationships and how you think
of yourself relative to others.

964
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,970
So that may be difficult to recover from.

965
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,530
If you're a popular at
Yale and you go to prison,

966
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,090
you're not going to be very happy at
first few days in prison probably.

967
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,550
But then suppose you
get popular in prison.

968
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,331
People like you,

969
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:26,660
you're,

970
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,170
you're,

971
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,710
you're the head of the book
club and everything and,

972
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,540
and,

973
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,373
and everything.

974
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,283
Um,

975
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,163
my dad has,

976
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,190
you know,

977
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,820
you'd rather not be in
prison then in prison,

978
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,020
but you probably be a pretty,

979
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:38,980
if you're a cheerful guy here,

980
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:40,450
you'd be cheerful guy in prison.

981
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,823
MMM.

982
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:48,370
The final case is involves judgments of
the pleasure and pain of past events.

983
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,140
And like I mentioned a Nobel prize
a little while ago as an example.

984
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,640
But the work I want to talk about is
actually from the one psychologist who's

985
00:38:58,641 --> 00:38:59,001
alive,

986
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:00,320
who's won the Nobel prize.

987
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,100
Sorry,

988
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,170
one of the ones who's won the Nobel prize.

989
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,830
Uh,

990
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,170
Daniel Conoman and um,

991
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,330
and he became interested in happiness.

992
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,810
And you remember him from
his rationality research.

993
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:13,250
And this is some work on happiness.

994
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,210
Uh,

995
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,440
here's an example.

996
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,970
When you see the movie marathon,

997
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:17,804
man,

998
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,360
Rob's a dental torture scene.

999
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,613
MMM.

1000
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,900
Imagine you're going to the
dentist and he's torturing you,

1001
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,123
or it's like a,

1002
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,060
it's like a cleaning,

1003
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,780
but it's really painful and it's terrible.

1004
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,290
You're,

1005
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,123
you're sweaty,

1006
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,941
you're squeezing it,

1007
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,920
and then you sweat and
it lasts for an hour.

1008
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,140
And then when it's done,

1009
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,450
the dentist leans over and says,

1010
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,150
we're done now if you want,

1011
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:46,320
we could stop.

1012
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,740
But if you want as a favor to you,

1013
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:50,640
I have five minutes,

1014
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,770
I could top you off with some mild pain.

1015
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,780
This may seem like a
very odd thing to ask.

1016
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,830
Here's the alternatives.

1017
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,250
What do you want a dental procedure that's
very painful for an hour or a dental

1018
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:07,801
procedure.

1019
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,180
It's very painful for an hour.

1020
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,650
Sorry about the s there and
then some additional mild pain.

1021
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,130
Who votes for a,

1022
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,000
you got to choose one.

1023
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,110
Who Votes for Aa?

1024
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,373
Alright,

1025
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,460
who votes for B?

1026
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,433
Okay.

1027
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,283
Um,

1028
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,560
here's the big finding.

1029
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,050
The big finding is yes,

1030
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,910
be involves more pink.

1031
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,193
It's true.

1032
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,990
A is an hour of pain.

1033
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,640
B is a,

1034
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:40,520
is an hour of pain plus a
few minutes of more pain.

1035
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,740
Seems like a no brainer,

1036
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,020
but when you have a or B and you
have to remember it later on,

1037
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,920
you'll have a much nicer memory of B.

1038
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Then a condom in his insight is
when you think back on events,

1039
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,840
you don't just add up the amount
of pleasure or pain you experience.

1040
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,050
Rather your memory is highly skewed
to peaks and then to endings.

1041
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,380
And you could imagine
this in the first case,

1042
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,420
a you lean and say,

1043
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,081
Oh God,

1044
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,160
that was terrible.

1045
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,083
Oh,

1046
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,661
be you.

1047
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:18,290
Leave as it.

1048
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:18,441
Oh,

1049
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:19,730
that was mildly painful.

1050
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,440
There was any caramel in the middle there,

1051
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,281
but it ended.

1052
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:22,910
Okay.

1053
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,743
Mild pain,

1054
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,940
it turns out in general,

1055
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,740
endings matter a lot.

1056
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,310
Um,

1057
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:32,840
condom and did his research with both
in a laboratory where you could make,

1058
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:37,280
give mild pain by getting them to stick
their hand in freezing cold water and

1059
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,630
with people under growing extremely
painful colonoscopy procedures.

1060
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,260
And it turns out that if you want to
give people a good memory or a less bad

1061
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:48,620
memory of it,

1062
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:50,510
horrible events,

1063
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,170
topping them off of some
mild pain will do the trick.

1064
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,800
Um,

1065
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,633
in the end,

1066
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,320
well ending's matter
both of these examples.

1067
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,220
Um,

1068
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,920
a party that's hugely fun for 90%.

1069
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,570
Then the last 10%,

1070
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,590
somebody slaps you in the face
and pores dip on you or something.

1071
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,873
Um,

1072
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,710
so 90% of good stuff,

1073
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,300
10% bad stuff versus 90% people are,

1074
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:17,810
are,

1075
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,670
are slapping you in pouring dip on yet,

1076
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,323
but,

1077
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,460
but then 10%,

1078
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:22,821
whoa.

1079
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:23,930
That was a really good,

1080
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,670
when you think back on it,

1081
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,390
if you just added it up
a would be much better.

1082
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,261
But,

1083
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:33,530
but B has this huge Paul,

1084
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,760
um,

1085
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,470
because of the power of,

1086
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,550
of how things end.

1087
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,750
Um,

1088
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,800
so ending's matter.

1089
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,250
So I'm going to end things now.

1090
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,060
I'm first going to do a few things
before saying anything more.

1091
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,720
I want to thank the teaching
fellows that are Sunnybank,

1092
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,900
Eric Sheree's,

1093
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,734
Jane Erickson,

1094
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,151
Isaac,

1095
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:52,880
Your Rudy,

1096
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,380
Greg loud and Coleen McCrank.

1097
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,610
I think they did a superb

1098
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,660
[inaudible].

1099
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,263
MMM.

1100
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,410
We basically reviewed all the psychology.

1101
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:10,981
Here's a promise.

1102
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:15,060
Every note we started with at
the beginning of the semester.

1103
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,633
Um,

1104
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,680
I think you're now in a position to
answer or at least consider answers about

1105
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,100
these topics,

1106
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,320
about topics such as dreams,

1107
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:27,140
testimony discussed,

1108
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:27,571
memory,

1109
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,201
depression,

1110
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:29,520
language humor,

1111
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,100
and even a little bit about good and evil.

1112
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:33,683
Um,

1113
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,230
this is an in abroad intro survey class
and the field of psychology is broad and

1114
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:41,280
we've just gotten started.

1115
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,663
Um,

1116
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,670
if you're interested,

1117
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,960
this is a great department.

1118
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:49,290
There's some amazing scholars
here and some amazing teachers.

1119
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:49,921
And,

1120
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:50,250
um,

1121
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,720
there are courses that go into detail
about just about every topic I talked

1122
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:55,380
about.

1123
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,330
If you're interested in memory or,

1124
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:58,164
or,

1125
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,620
or social interaction or mental illness,

1126
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,420
I can point you to some great courses.

1127
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,990
I'm not taking any sophomore advisees
next year because I'm on leave in the

1128
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:07,170
fall,

1129
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,003
but um,

1130
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:12,270
but you should feel free to come talk
to me if you want any specific advice or

1131
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:13,110
suggestions.

1132
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:18,470
Now I know not all of you are going
to end up majoring in psychology.

1133
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,620
Um,

1134
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,110
some of you will choose
cognitive science instead.

1135
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,273
Um,

1136
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:24,840
but in,

1137
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,800
and a more serious note,

1138
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:28,970
I know for some of you this is
the last maybe the first bit,

1139
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,250
but the last psychology you'll ever take.

1140
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,260
And so I want to close this course,

1141
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:34,741
um,

1142
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,420
by emphasizing to themes.

1143
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:38,600
Okay.

1144
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,340
The first one is a bit of humility.

1145
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,210
Okay.

1146
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,810
There are some very basic questions about
the mind and I've tried to be honest

1147
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:47,100
about this throughout the course.

1148
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,330
There are some very basic questions about
the mind that nobody knows the answer

1149
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:52,164
to yet.

1150
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,600
We know the brain is a
source of mental life,

1151
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,250
but we don't have any understanding
at all about exactly how this happens.

1152
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,100
But how a physical object,

1153
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:04,890
a lump of meat can give rise
to conscious experience.

1154
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,830
We know that about half of
the variants in personality,

1155
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:12,330
but half the differences between
people are due to genetic factors,

1156
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,600
but we don't know how to explain
where the other half happens.

1157
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,090
It has to be experienced,

1158
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:22,500
but we have no real good theories of
the sort of experience that makes one

1159
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,830
person adventurous and
another one timid one,

1160
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:26,370
you know,

1161
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,110
one bidder in one satisfied.

1162
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,030
We know a lot about the social influences
that can drive people to do terrible

1163
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,050
things to one another.

1164
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,390
But we don't know the answer to that.

1165
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,060
Maybe harder question of why some of us,

1166
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,970
some people are immune
to these influences,

1167
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,280
why some people do good things,

1168
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,900
perhaps even heroic things regardless
of the circumstances that they find

1169
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:49,734
themselves in.

1170
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,780
So there's an enormous
amount left to do it.

1171
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,011
It's,

1172
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:57,150
it's an exciting field just because
there's just so much more we need to,

1173
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:58,350
we need to understand.

1174
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,430
Um,

1175
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:04,040
the second theme is more optimistic and
this is the idea that we're going to

1176
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:08,340
eventually come to answer these questions
and many more questions through the

1177
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:12,930
sorts of methods we've been discussing
this semester through constructing

1178
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:14,100
scientific theories,

1179
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,300
evolution,

1180
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,280
evolutionary neurological,

1181
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:17,971
developmental,

1182
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:18,930
computational,

1183
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,100
and testing them through experimental
and observational methods.

1184
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,060
Um,

1185
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,100
this is the idea that in the end,

1186
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,390
the most important and intimate aspects
of ourselves and our beliefs and

1187
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:30,931
emotions,

1188
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:32,520
our capacities to make decisions,

1189
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,600
even our sense of right and wrong can
be explained through constructing and

1190
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:38,460
testing scientific hypotheses.

1191
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,390
Now,

1192
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:43,800
the reason why I'm optimistic is I think
there's been some success stories where

1193
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,040
we really have learned some surprising
and important things about the mind.

1194
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,270
And there's no reason to expect this way
of proceeding to fail us in the future.

1195
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,283
Um,

1196
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,603
in my very,

1197
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,200
very first class on the brain,

1198
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,840
I ended by talking about
people's worries here.

1199
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,850
And I'll be honest that some
people find it a scary prospect.

1200
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,080
Some people believe that a scientific
approach that our mind takes a special

1201
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:11,520
nurse away from people that
it diminishes us somehow.

1202
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:12,221
And,

1203
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:12,780
um,

1204
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,613
I don't agree.

1205
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,513
Um,

1206
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,910
if there's anything I've tried to persuade
you through the course is that the

1207
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:22,140
more you look at the mind and how it
works from a serious scientific point of

1208
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:22,890
view,

1209
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,840
the more you come to
appreciate its complexity,

1210
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,674
its uniqueness,

1211
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,281
uniqueness,

1212
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:27,114
and its beauty.

1213
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,063
Um,

1214
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,340
this has been a great course to teach.

1215
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:31,020
Thank you for coming and
good luck on the final

1216
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,740
[inaudible].
