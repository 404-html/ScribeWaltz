1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,960
The final topic of the course
is clinical psychology,

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,160
also known as a normal
psychology or psychopathology.

3
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,120
And this for many of us is what
psychology is really about.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,410
It's about mental illness.

5
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,420
It's about clinical psychologists.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,790
Um,

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,500
and um,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,500
we started talking about this when a
Dr. Nolan Huxson mark gave her guests

9
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,680
lecture last week and I'm going
to continue through this today.

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,250
Uh,

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,250
it is a topic of tremendous scientific
importance but also a topic of great

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,510
personal importance for many of us.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,810
Many of the people in this
room have been mentally ill,

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,480
strictly speaking at some
point in their lives.

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,410
Um,

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,410
some of you are under some sort of therapy
or treatment or medical intervention

17
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,010
right now.

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,010
Some of you are on Prozac or Zoloft or
Ambien or Wellbutrin or any of those

19
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,770
other medications to a,

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,080
to deal with psychological
problems you're facing.

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,920
Others are also talking to psychiatrists,

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,820
psychologists,

23
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:21,660
social workers,

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,950
and other people.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,963
Um,

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,770
many of you who are not at this point
mentally ill will become mentally ill,

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,160
uh,

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,510
during your stay at Yale.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,793
Um,

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,080
and um,

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,430
it,

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,280
this is a difficult period
in many people's lives.

33
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,940
And as the period of people's lives
where mental illness emerges in a,

34
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,900
in many of us,

35
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,640
by one estimate,

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,320
one half of all college graduates in the
United States and a number is very high

37
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:50,400
with college graduates,

38
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,660
highly educated people.

39
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,870
One half of you will have some sort
of mental illness in your life,

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,020
um,

41
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,470
serious enough to require
some sort of treatment.

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,780
Those of you not directly
affected with mental illness,

43
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,040
um,

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,060
yourselves,

45
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,960
we'll no doubt experienced
your loved ones,

46
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,741
your family,

47
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:14,430
your friends,

48
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,720
getting some sort of illness,

49
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,530
um,

50
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,530
be it Alzheimer's or schizophrenia
or depression or some sort of anxiety

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,143
disorder.

52
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,350
So the personal importance of,

53
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:30,351
of clinical psychology
to personal importance of
understanding what can go wrong

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,110
and how best to treat it
simply can't be underestimated.

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,130
Now,

56
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,840
when we target about mental disorders,

57
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,660
the scope of this is very broad.

58
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,690
It includes the prototypical
schizophrenia would,

59
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:46,410
you could see on the streets of new haven,

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,290
somebody walking and gesturing
and talking to themselves.

61
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:49,411
It's,

62
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,370
and I'm screaming.

63
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,180
Um,

64
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,180
it includes alcohol addiction and
cocaine addiction and other addictions.

65
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,190
It includes somebody with
down syndrome or autism.

66
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,430
I'm an old person losing his memory,

67
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,280
a teenager falling into a deep depression,

68
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,930
somebody with a severe social phobia to
the extent that he or she can't leave

69
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:11,764
the house,

70
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,890
then there are also very hard cases
where it's difficult to say one way or

71
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,204
another.

72
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,210
That guy's photographing
me as I'm talking to.

73
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:22,044
It's freaking me out.

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,153
Um,

75
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,880
and kind of a social phobia way.

76
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,983
Um,

77
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,150
it was difficult cases where it's just
hard to tell mental illness from just

78
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,250
from just bad behavior,

79
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:33,821
um,

80
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,720
in general.

81
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,733
Um,

82
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,503
so,

83
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,510
so consider a killer without a conscience
or a mobster like John Gotti is he

84
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,820
mentally ill?

85
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,441
Um,

86
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:50,230
and this is a question which is a deep
one and we'll wrestle with it a little

87
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,910
bit actually towards
the end of this lecture.

88
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,770
What about somebody who acts in
a kind of unusual or Zany way?

89
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,520
Um,

90
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,860
this is originally supposed
to be a picture of a,

91
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:02,080
of the character Kramer on Seinfeld,

92
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,840
but given his unusual antics
in the last few months,

93
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,900
it could be a picture of
the actor who plays him.

94
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,340
We've gone to all sorts of trouble.

95
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,420
What about someone who is just kind of
wacky at what point his wackiness move

96
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,670
into the domain of mental illness.

97
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,380
Um,

98
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,590
what about the unusual lifestyles
such as extreme altruism?

99
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,510
Batman devotes most of his
life to helping others.

100
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,870
He sleeps one hour a night and this hour
is fraught with nightmares and then he

101
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,350
fights crime.

102
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,330
What about somebody?

103
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,240
And this was a case report in
the New Yorker a few months ago,

104
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,140
who has lots of money and a loving family
and has his kidney removed to help a

105
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:45,304
stranger.

106
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,140
And he says,

107
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,040
I have two kidneys.

108
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:48,910
That's minor pain,

109
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,690
minor operation.

110
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,160
I could save someone's life.

111
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,420
His wife says,

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,770
you're mentally ill.

113
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,440
That's just crazy to do that.

114
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,270
Where do we draw the line?

115
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,950
And so there are these great
philosophical and moral questions over the

116
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:05,320
boundaries and how to
think about mental illness.

117
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,160
So how should we think about
mental illness as well?

118
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,740
There's some answers we
could quickly dispense with.

119
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,540
It used to be thought that severe
mental Ellis was a result of demonic

120
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,374
possession.

121
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,250
Um,

122
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,690
if you read the Gospels,

123
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,760
Jesus Christ wandered around a lot,

124
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:22,840
met crazy people,

125
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,510
and exercise the demons from their bodies.

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,060
It was a common way of
thinking about craziness.

127
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,550
We now believe that this is not true.

128
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,510
What about yes,

129
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,383
it's not true.

130
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,210
What about social social deviants?

131
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,270
Some people including the psychiatrist,

132
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,163
um,

133
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,410
Tom has us claim that when we
label somebody as mentally ill,

134
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,850
this is not a medical decision.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,830
It's rather a social decision,

136
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,700
um,

137
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,700
designed to ostracize people who deviate
from society's norms to ostracize them

138
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,860
and rid them of moral agency.

139
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,930
It's not that we disagree with them.

140
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,970
It's not even that we see them as evil.

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,580
Rather we see them as sick.

142
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,081
And as such,

143
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:13,760
we don't even have to core to them the
respect that we accord to criminals.

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,050
Now,

145
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,050
this is not entirely unreasonable view
in many countries around the world.

146
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,153
Um,

147
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,720
desistance people who,

148
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:25,070
who,

149
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,070
who argue against the state are often
determined to be mentally ill and thrown

150
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,640
in asylums.

151
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,500
Uh,

152
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,500
blacks in the United States who tried
to escape from slavery were described as

153
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,400
having a mental illness.

154
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,230
Why would they want to do so unless
they were mentally ill up until,

155
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:45,064
um,

156
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,320
1973 to be a homosexual to be gay would
count in the official records of how we

157
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:57,620
classify illness as being mentally ill.

158
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,550
And many people saw this and we see this
now not so much as reflecting a sort of

159
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,640
unbiased medical analysis,

160
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,560
but rather as reflecting biases
that people have against gay people.

161
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,460
And these are political and
social and moral biases.

162
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,830
They're not objective medical judgments.

163
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,240
Uh,

164
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,190
even now I've been,

165
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,600
I've been recording every president that
has been the president of United States

166
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:26,811
in,

167
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:27,644
in my memory,

168
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,250
including Bush and the particularly
Clinton has been described it by,

169
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,620
by his opponents,

170
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,320
not merely as awful evil,

171
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,670
terrible hate his policies,

172
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,910
but as mentally ill every part,

173
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,770
every president at some point or another,

174
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,660
some bright intelligent person figures
to call a psychopath and put that in Time

175
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:48,494
magazine.

176
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,550
Um,

177
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,610
now put aside whether the extent
to which the things are accurate.

178
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,750
Point being that we
often use medical labels,

179
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,270
particularly labels like psychopath,

180
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,133
schizophrenia,

181
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,790
delusional to,

182
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,850
to ostracize and pick out
people we disagree with.

183
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,070
At the same time though,

184
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,400
this is not entirely right.

185
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:17,030
People go too far when they say there's
no such thing as mental illness.

186
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,750
Um,

187
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,600
some people are mentally ill in
a very real sense of illness.

188
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,480
In the same sense,

189
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:27,200
we would describe somebody as physically
ill if they were to have cancer.

190
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,580
Um,

191
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,570
this illness,

192
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,050
um,

193
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,610
damages their functioning.

194
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,680
They cannot function well.

195
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,450
They do not tend to be more creative or
more productive or more vivacious rather

196
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,160
for them.

197
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,760
With very few exceptions,

198
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,790
possibly some exceptions
revolving around mania.

199
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,220
As Dr. Nolan Huxson my discuss with
very few exceptions being mentally ill,

200
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,500
it's just very bad for
you in every possible way.

201
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,203
Um,

202
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,651
moreover,

203
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,010
when people treated,

204
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,840
when people get better,

205
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,360
they become more competent,

206
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,343
happier,

207
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,940
better able to participate in the work,

208
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,120
and they do not choose to go back to
their mental illness suggesting that it

209
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,190
really is illness in a serious sense.

210
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,550
And so the modern treatment
of psychological disorders
treats them as disorders

211
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,160
like medical disorders.

212
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,730
Schizophrenia is as much a disease as
cancer and should be thought of in the

213
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:26,694
same way.

214
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,930
Um,

215
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,930
there's a whole field of abnormal
psychology of tremendous scope.

216
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,350
We've already discussed many mental
illnesses in the context of um,

217
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
other things.

218
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,521
So for instance,

219
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,420
we talked about Amnesia in the
context of memory and how it works.

220
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,660
We talked about autism in the
context of social reasoning.

221
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,890
There are many more and I'm
not going to read through them.

222
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,500
These are the major categories
just for people's interests,

223
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,340
um,

224
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,620
from the diagnostic and standard manual.

225
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,270
Okay.

226
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,103
You don't have to,

227
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,970
you're not responsible for all of these.

228
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,073
Um,

229
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,680
and this is an illustration which
people might find interesting of sex

230
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:09,670
differences in these,

231
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:10,930
in the major disorders.

232
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,830
Um,

233
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,650
and the patterns as you
could see are kind of neat.

234
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,490
Um,

235
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,020
women are more prone to have anxiety
disorders and mood disorders.

236
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,273
Um,

237
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,550
men are much more likely to
suffer from substance disorders,

238
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:25,780
particularly alcoholism.

239
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,710
Um,

240
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,650
schizophrenia,

241
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:29,380
it sort of evenly matched,

242
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,690
but antisocial personality disorder,

243
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:36,160
sometimes known as sociopathy or
psychopathy is predominantly male.

244
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,350
And we'll turn to that a bit later.

245
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,030
Here are the major ones
which I want to review today.

246
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,521
Um,

247
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:46,860
I'm not going to talk about mood disorders
at all because this was the topic of

248
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:49,030
the suburb lecture we heard last week,

249
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,970
but I want to quickly
review schizophrenia.

250
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,050
The class of disorders
known as anxiety disorders,

251
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,370
the class of disorders known as
dissociative disorders and the class of

252
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,770
disorders known as personality disorders.

253
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,610
And these are the main
psychological problems.

254
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:06,811
If,

255
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:11,230
if when a psychologist or a
psychiatrist does his or her work,

256
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,370
they're predominantly focused on
somebody who has one of these problems.

257
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,330
Um,

258
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,800
some of them are rare,

259
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,000
but some of them such as anxiety
disorders and mood disorders are,

260
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,350
our strikes are very common.

261
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,623
Okay.

262
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,843
Um,

263
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,150
about 1% of the world's population
suffers from schizophrenia.

264
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,813
And

265
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,970
this is the most common reason
for being in a mental hospital.

266
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,300
And the reason for that is because of
its severity because of how terrible an

267
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:49,930
illness it is.

268
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:50,950
Um,

269
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,340
schizophrenia next had been
described as the of the 20th century,

270
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,890
but people pointed out in
the last hundred years,

271
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,300
people who are schizophrenia or just
there was no place for them in society.

272
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,250
They're shunned or rejected.

273
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,890
We have no idea how to treat
them or how to help them.

274
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,320
The roots of schizophrenia,

275
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,661
um,

276
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,330
come from the term split,

277
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,693
uh,

278
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,173
and mine.

279
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,230
But the idea is there
was a split from reality.

280
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,430
It's important to stress the sort of Edom,

281
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:25,390
a logical point because sometimes people
confuse schizophrenia with something

282
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:30,160
we'll split personality and they somehow
think schizophrenia refers to having

283
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,540
multiple personalities.

284
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,400
This is incorrect.

285
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,640
Multiple personality disorder is
an entirely different disorder.

286
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,860
Is this sort of dissociative disorder.

287
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,510
Um,

288
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,650
split personality that people with
schizophrenia do not have multiple

289
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:45,550
personalities.

290
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,690
What they have is a problem
with re relating to reality.

291
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,151
Um,

292
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:57,151
it's roughly equally split between
the genders but it strikes men um,

293
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,340
earlier and uh,

294
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,930
it happens between,

295
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,550
around these ages and as you can
see roughly and as you can see,

296
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,640
it is this sort of thing that could make
us first occurrence while you were in

297
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,690
college or university.

298
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,050
Yeah.

299
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,640
There are five symptoms,

300
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,530
main symptoms of schizophrenia.

301
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,650
Four of them are the positive symptoms,

302
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,890
meaning things that you do
that you have that's unusual.

303
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,540
One's a negative symptom.

304
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,440
Um,

305
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,640
something that you don't have.

306
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,560
Something has schizophrenia,

307
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,433
lax.

308
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,030
So just to walk through them.

309
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,090
A hallucination is an experience,

310
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,270
a sensory experience that isn't real.

311
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,130
So the most typical hallucinations
are auditory schizophrenia.

312
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,010
Hearing voices they hear sounds,

313
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,180
particularly people telling them
to do things that aren't real.

314
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,140
Sometimes there auditory
or visual hallucinations or
hallucinations of smell and

315
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:54,820
taste.

316
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,830
But a typical hallucination is,

317
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:57,310
um,

318
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,143
is auditory.

319
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,830
Um,

320
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,420
sometimes the voices are seen
from coming from oneself.

321
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,010
And so you could sometimes
stop the hallucinations by
doing things like humming

322
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,440
or counting or holding your mouth.

323
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,790
Ah,

324
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,140
and some schizophrenia,

325
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,330
we'll do this in an attempt to block,

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,380
um,

327
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,820
auditory hallucinations.

328
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,710
There are delusions.

329
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,820
The difference between a hallucination
and delusion is a hallucination is a

330
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,740
sensory experience at that's wrong.

331
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,390
That just didn't really happen.

332
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,310
A delusion is a belief that isn't right.

333
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,091
It's a,

334
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:34,330
it's,

335
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,410
it's a belief that,

336
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:35,831
that,

337
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:36,850
that you shouldn't be having.

338
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,710
Now again,

339
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,580
the question of what counts as of
illusion and what counts is as accuracy.

340
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,140
It can be a controversial one.

341
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,531
I,

342
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:45,790
Richard Dawkins title,

343
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,690
his recent book,

344
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,770
the God delusion,

345
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,130
describing this mass delusion
that many people have,

346
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,140
that they believe there's a supernatural
being who created the universe and was

347
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:54,974
watching them.

348
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,900
Some people find that offensive to call
it the delusion and people will have

349
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:00,860
different views.

350
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,371
The delusion,

351
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:03,560
schizophrenia next have,

352
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,394
um,

353
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,660
tend to be pretty clearly weird and wrong.

354
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,583
Um,

355
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,170
they often tend to believe
they're famous people.

356
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,401
Um,

357
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:16,970
many schizophrenia have a religious
bent and believe that they're in Jesus

358
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,270
Christ.

359
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,440
In 1959,

360
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,520
there was a Michigan Hospital.

361
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,090
I had three Jesus Christ in it.

362
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,280
Um,

363
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,540
and they would meet and talk.

364
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,523
Um,

365
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,730
one theme of delusions is what's
called ideas of reference and ideas of

366
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,041
reference.

367
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:38,480
Are you think that there's all sorts
of things happening that revolve around

368
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:39,314
you.

369
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,130
You hear people whispering and you
think they're talking about you.

370
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,420
You pick up the newspaper and you believe
that there was coded messages in it

371
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,980
that are directed towards you.

372
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,030
Um,

373
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,490
you might believe that,

374
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:54,110
that there's some sort of omnipotent,

375
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,111
powerful force conspiring against you
are trying to manipulate you like aliens

376
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:00,890
or the FBI,

377
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:01,581
the CIA,

378
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:02,414
the government.

379
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,290
You might believe that they have some
sort of evil plan in mind for you.

380
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,080
Um,

381
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,920
there is disorganized speech,

382
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,000
some schizophrenia,

383
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,373
Babel,

384
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
they talk and it's nonsense.

385
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,410
Um,

386
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,570
if you listen to a
schizophrenia on the street,

387
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,910
sometimes what they're
saying makes no sense at all.

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,970
Not Merely that they're conveying
ideas that are unreasonable,

389
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,380
but it's just garbled.

390
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,490
It's just a mess.

391
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,340
And sometimes they're
disorganized behavior to,

392
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,240
um,

393
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,890
odd motor movements.

394
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,680
The most extreme case of this,

395
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,330
our motor movements described as
catatonic where the person doesn't move,

396
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,250
often freezes in a position.

397
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,400
Those are all positive symptoms.

398
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,870
I'm major negative symptoms
with schizophrenia is
absence of normal thought or

399
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:49,650
an effect,

400
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,990
an effect meaning emotion.

401
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,840
So some schizophrenia might just not talk.

402
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,930
They might have very
low emotional responses.

403
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,310
They might not care about anything.

404
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,000
The basic psychological misfunction oh,

405
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:05,780
sorry.

406
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,613
Um,

407
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,370
okay.

408
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,710
There are different
subtypes of schizophrenia.

409
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,080
There are five major subtypes,

410
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:18,330
but I'm going to focus
on the three major ones.

411
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:18,691
Um,

412
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:19,830
the three most interesting ones.

413
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,380
The first one is paranoid schizophrenia.

414
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,550
So paranoid schizophrenia,

415
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:25,120
ex,

416
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,953
um,

417
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,810
believe that others are spying and
plotting against them and they often have

418
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:31,980
delusions of grandeur.

419
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,670
They often believe that other
people are jealous of them.

420
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,250
They might believe they
have supernatural powers.

421
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,740
They might believe that their God or,

422
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:41,940
or a Messiah,

423
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,160
the catatonic schizophrenia
are unresponsive to their
surroundings and often no,

424
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,750
just repeat what people say to them.

425
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,220
They won't generate their own speed.

426
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,610
And finally did this organize
schizophrenia acts are
maybe what you most think

427
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,070
of when you think of
somebody who is insane.

428
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,493
Um,

429
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,890
they make no sense.

430
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,230
They have delusions and hallucinations.

431
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,190
They babble.

432
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,080
They that their actions make,

433
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,160
they could be dangerous,

434
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,780
they could be perceived as dangerous.

435
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,550
There are unable to help themselves or
unable to do anything in their lives.

436
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,850
It's hard to pin down exactly what's
at root of all of these problems.

437
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,930
But a very general summary is that there
is a problem and an inability to put

438
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:35,931
together your thoughts and perceptions
to sequence them and coordinate them to,

439
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:36,830
to,

440
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,700
to impose a logical
structure and a reasonable,

441
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,440
realistic temporal sequence
on your experience.

442
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,840
This is the core thing going wrong.

443
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,160
But what happens as a result of this
is you lose contact with others.

444
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,380
You lose social contact.

445
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,940
Losing social contact means you
don't get much reality checking.

446
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,570
If I start acting weird and nobody cares,

447
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,330
I could just get weirder and weirder.

448
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,240
While if I'm in a good social
group of people who care about me,

449
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,970
often the situation could
be brought under control.

450
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,310
So schizophrenia is sort
of a vicious circle.

451
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,930
We had this cognitive problem.

452
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,510
Then you have problems
losing contact with others,

453
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,760
exaggerating the cognitive problem.

454
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,953
And so on

455
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,000
Skit,

456
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,730
a lot of people study the
genetics of schizophrenia.

457
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,121
Um,

458
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:29,780
it's clear enough that there's
a powerful genetic components.

459
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,903
Um,

460
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,890
I could,

461
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,630
you can tell how much at risk somebody
is for becoming schizophrenia.

462
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,530
Um,

463
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,530
based on the schizophrenia and illness
of their family members in particular,

464
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:45,090
if you have an identical twin who,

465
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:45,924
schizophrenia,

466
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,820
your odds are about a half of becoming
schizophrenia herself at the same time.

467
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,230
And we dealt with this as well when
we talked about issues of sexual

468
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:56,064
orientation.

469
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:56,880
Um,

470
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,691
the fact that that,

471
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:57,981
that,

472
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,460
that identical twins,

473
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,520
the odds are only 50% means there has
to be an environmental component to it.

474
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,450
If it was entirely genetic,

475
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:07,560
it would be 100%.

476
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,990
And so one claim,

477
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:14,520
one way of looking at it is your jeans
make you vulnerable to schizophrenia,

478
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,680
but whether or not you
become schizophrenia depends
on what happens in your

479
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,514
environment.

480
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,710
You're sensitive to certain triggers.

481
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,650
Some triggers might have an early,

482
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,800
there are some evidence that schizophrenia
is associated with trauma even at the

483
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:31,860
point of birth.

484
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,690
And there's some other evidence that
schizophrenia is linked to viral

485
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:37,524
infections.

486
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,113
Um,

487
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,260
as a,

488
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,250
as an example,

489
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,821
there are more,

490
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,410
schizophrenia is born in the winter.

491
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,511
Subtle,

492
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,380
a subtle difference,

493
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:46,660
but,

494
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,500
but there seems to be a reliable effect
of more schizophrenia born in the

495
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:50,620
winter.

496
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,030
More people get sick in the winter,

497
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,620
um,

498
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,880
at times when there has been some sort
of epidemic or some sort of plague,

499
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,410
this seems to cause a
jump in the frequency of
schizophrenia was born at that

500
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:02,980
time.

501
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,760
There's some reason research at ties
schizophrenia to the possibility of

502
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,020
toxoplasmosis,

503
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,310
um,

504
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,480
which is a disorder.

505
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:10,780
Uh,

506
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,520
carried by cat feces.

507
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,110
The experiment basically involved asking
the parents of schizophrenia x one

508
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:17,944
question,

509
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,650
did you own a cat when
your child was born?

510
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,900
And if the answer was yes,

511
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:27,280
it seemed to correspond to a bit
higher odds for schizophrenia families.

512
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,110
Then for non schizophrenia families,

513
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,700
a different sort of um,

514
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,070
trigger is stressful family environments.

515
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,050
Schizophrenia seem to really have
more stressful family environments.

516
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,320
They're non schizophrenia six now
we have to be careful about this.

517
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,100
We have to bring,

518
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,990
we have to return to the sort
of methodological cautions
we had in mind when we

519
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,900
talked about individual
difference research in general.

520
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,460
And remember we talk about the worst
study in the world and one of the features

521
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:04,480
of this was it was failing to
pull apart cause and effect.

522
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,810
It might be that having a difficult family
environment ups your odds of becoming

523
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:10,864
schizophrenic.

524
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,591
On the other hand,

525
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:15,700
it might also be that schizophrenia
children are children who will become

526
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:20,260
schizophrenia are difficult to deal
with in certain ways causing a family

527
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:21,094
environment.

528
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,990
So it's not clear whether the effect is
from difficult family environment just

529
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:29,470
to later schizophrenia
or from schizophrenia to
difficult family environment.

530
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,970
There used to be a very popular
theory of schizophrenia,

531
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,540
which is that it was caused
by excess excess dopamine.

532
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,340
Dopamine you'll remember
is a neurotransmitter.

533
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,993
Um,

534
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,070
and there's some reason take
this seriously drugs that
reduced dopamine provide

535
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,810
some help in reducing symptoms.

536
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,020
And if I give you a drug
that bolstered that,

537
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,840
that that shoots up your dopamine,

538
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,040
um,

539
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,210
that will turn you into,

540
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,030
into a temporary schizophrenia.

541
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,170
Uh,

542
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,650
you get what's called amphetamine
psychosis and you give you,

543
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,440
you can give you schizophrenia symptoms,

544
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,730
hallucinations,

545
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:10,540
delusions,

546
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,373
that sort of thing.

547
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,120
This,

548
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,070
there might be something to this theory,

549
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,070
but we know now it can't be
complete for at least two reasons.

550
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,203
First,

551
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,700
it doesn't explain the negative symptoms.

552
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,200
It does,

553
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,670
it explains the hallucinations
and delusions and so on.

554
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,200
But it doesn't explain,

555
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,773
um,

556
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,710
the loss of effect,

557
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,600
the quietness,

558
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,830
this stillness.

559
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,861
Also,

560
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:40,210
there seemed to be some sort of structural
brain differences involving in large

561
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,440
cerebral ventricles,

562
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,413
um,

563
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,740
involving reduced frontal lobe activity.

564
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:50,090
Suggestion that the problem
with schizophrenia is a
lot more complicated than

565
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,370
others might have it then the
dopamine theory would have it.

566
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,030
Okay.

567
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,320
I'll end with a mystery.

568
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,610
And this mystery is discussed
nicely in the grade textbook.

569
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,003
Um,

570
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,440
the,

571
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,830
the,

572
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,750
the symptoms of schizophrenia,

573
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,560
the prevalence of schizophrenia
is similar wherever you go,

574
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
but less industrialized countries
have a better rate of recovery from

575
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:20,080
schizophrenia than industrialized
countries and nobody really knows why.

576
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:21,880
I listed here three possibilities.

577
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,780
Um,

578
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,520
one is that the families that were,

579
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,740
that in a less industrialized country,

580
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,970
there's more latitude.

581
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,580
And so there's less
critical bless criticism,

582
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,190
there's less use of
antipsychotic medications,

583
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,860
antipsychotic medications
help with the symptoms,

584
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,080
but they might also impair recovery.

585
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,281
And finally,

586
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,890
if you think of schizophrenia
as a transient disorder,

587
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,950
maybe that will in some sense in some way,

588
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,440
make that more likely to actually happen.

589
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,990
The second sort of disorder I want to
talk about much more common than the 1% is

590
00:24:57,601 --> 00:25:01,920
schizophrenia is a class of
disorders known as anxiety disorders.

591
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,063
MMM.

592
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,440
The primary disturbance and
anxiety disorders is anxiety.

593
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,030
You have a lot of anxiety.

594
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,230
It's persistent.

595
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,293
Um,

596
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,590
either anxiety or,

597
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:19,424
um,

598
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,170
or maladaptive behaviors
to reduce anxiety.

599
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,520
Now,

600
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,560
everybody experiences anxiety.

601
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,810
If you didn't experience anxiety,

602
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,040
you'd be a very strange person.

603
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,900
He probably wouldn't function
very well in the world,

604
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,110
but you have an anxiety disorder
when you experienced too much of it.

605
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,790
We experienced too much of it.

606
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,320
It's uncontrollable,

607
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,390
it's unreasonable and
it messes up your life.

608
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,120
And there's quite a few anxiety disorders.

609
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,900
The main,

610
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,770
the simplest one is this
generalized anxiety disorders where,

611
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:49,220
um,

612
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,210
and this is about one in 20 people
will get at some point in their lives,

613
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:53,930
um,

614
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,920
and you worry all the time.

615
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,180
You're just very anxious.

616
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,440
You're just worried all the time.

617
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,510
And it could be paralyzing.

618
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,090
It could give you physical
symptoms like headaches,

619
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,320
stomach aches,

620
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,020
muscle tension and irritability.

621
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,983
MMM.

622
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,150
There's some evidence that generalized
anxiety disorder has a genetic component

623
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,940
that is somehow related
to major depression.

624
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,760
And it does seem to have,

625
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,750
it's possible routes in some
sort of childhood trauma.

626
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,220
And so the model,

627
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:27,160
some people give for this
is when you are young,

628
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:29,110
something really bad happens to you.

629
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,750
Um,

630
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,400
this makes you hypervigilant.

631
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,440
You don't trust the world,

632
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,380
bad things could always
happen around the corner.

633
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,000
And because you're hypervigilant,

634
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,983
um,

635
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,600
you are more prone to develop
generalized anxiety disorder after,

636
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,320
um,

637
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,850
after a difficult life event.

638
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,150
A second sort of anxiety disorder,

639
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:56,151
which we already discussed in class
are phobias and phobias or intense

640
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:57,120
irrational fears.

641
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:58,290
They could focus on objects,

642
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,124
events,

643
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,300
and social settings.

644
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,690
Here's a nice diagram of different phobia,

645
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,660
different things and the proportion
of people who are afraid of it.

646
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,560
And the point of this diagram
isn't with the details.

647
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,573
It's really,

648
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,413
um,

649
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,110
it's,

650
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,350
it's rather to give you a feeling for
the fact that some things most everybody

651
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:17,850
is afraid of are a lot
of people are afraid of.

652
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,721
And some things,

653
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,740
not many at all.

654
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,280
Um,

655
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,850
the big phobic object we know
from previous lectures is snakes.

656
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,150
About 40% of the population
say they're afraid of snakes.

657
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,040
How many people here are afraid of snakes?

658
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,023
Okay.

659
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,730
And then there's a
really terrifying thing.

660
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,623
Mice,

661
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,490
how you were afraid of mice.

662
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,220
Mice are the worst things in the world.

663
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,653
Um,

664
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,280
and then cats.

665
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,350
And if you're afraid of cats,

666
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,670
that's really unusual.

667
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,800
Not many people are afraid of cats.

668
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,473
Um,

669
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,850
there's a classical conditioning model
of phobias which we are all familiar

670
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,360
with,

671
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,270
but we are all familiar with why
it is not a very good theory.

672
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,440
A lot of people who are afraid of snakes
have never had had a bad experience

673
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:05,274
with snakes.

674
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,481
Moreover,

675
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:09,960
a lot of people who have
had bad experiences with
things like car crashes and

676
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:12,620
being electrocuted on the socket or,

677
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:12,990
or,

678
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,950
or a shooting,

679
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,310
seeing a gun during a shooting
do not develop phobias.

680
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,380
This lead gives rise to a much more
plausible theory known as the preparedness

681
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,100
theory,

682
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,630
which says that we have evolved to be
sensitive to certain phobic objects,

683
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,160
objects that were dangerous to us in our
evolutionary history and were prone to

684
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,980
develop phobic responses to this.

685
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,510
The final anxiety disorder is
obsessive compulsive disorder.

686
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,493
Um,

687
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,190
obsessions are irrational,

688
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:47,580
disturbing thoughts that
intrude into your consciousness.

689
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,973
Um,

690
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,980
this is a con hits about two to 3%
of the population and it leads to

691
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:59,850
compulsion's repetitive actions
performed to alleviate the obsessions.

692
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,750
Um,

693
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,201
for instance,

694
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,780
you might be obsessed with
the idea of your being dirty.

695
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,880
Your hands are dirty or filthy,

696
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,760
that might lead to compulsive washing.

697
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,900
You might believe that God is angry at
you and that might lead to compulsive

698
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:16,584
prayer.

699
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,400
Uh,

700
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,560
cleanliness and religion
are common themes of um,

701
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,250
obsessive compulsive disorder.

702
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,983
You know,

703
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:30,110
you often know rationally that these are
unreasonable behaviors where you can't

704
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,470
help yourself from doing them.

705
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,820
Um,

706
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,910
sometimes I check it,

707
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,200
sometimes they get the word I left my
door unlocked and I run back and checked

708
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:37,410
it,

709
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,243
check it.

710
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,820
But I feel it's a little bit of OCD
coming on because I know I locked it,

711
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,410
but did I really lock it?

712
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,280
And then you get work.

713
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,690
Now I'm worried if I locked my door.

714
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,773
Um,

715
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,830
checking and washing.

716
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,630
Checking is what I'm talking about here.

717
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:57,930
Most common compulsions and it seems to
have a neuro psychological phenomena,

718
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,860
at least a it related to heightened
neural activity in the caudate nucleus.

719
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,150
What's interesting is you might think
obsessive compulsive disorder is a very

720
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:09,340
sort of Freud,

721
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,770
the end psychoanalytic sort of disorder.

722
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,130
But actually it's treated
quite well with drugs.

723
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,870
Drugs that affect the serotonin level.

724
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:21,760
Serotonin being a neurotransmitter
can often do good work for obsessive

725
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:22,750
compulsive disorders.

726
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,690
So if you develop a
disorder and OCD problem,

727
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,200
you might find yourself being
cured simply with medications.

728
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:33,991
Any,

729
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:34,824
um,

730
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,260
we've talked about schizophrenia
and anxiety disorders.

731
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,180
Any questions or thoughts so far?

732
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,660
Yes.

733
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,330
Um,

734
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,030
what's the difference
between OCD and Tourette's?

735
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,121
It's a good question.

736
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,670
The question was in relation
to being OCD and Tourette's,

737
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,550
Tourette's is,

738
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:53,881
is,

739
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:54,400
is,

740
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,510
I don't know much about it as a
very specific neurophysiological,

741
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,523
uh,

742
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,810
syndrome that doesn't have it.

743
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:03,520
You don't have obsessive thoughts.

744
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,680
What it leads to is involuntary tick
ticks and tremors and sometimes sort have

745
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,630
shouted obscenities or two words.

746
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,530
And it needs to be very specific to that.

747
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,740
While OCD is much broader and involves
both behaviors but also to behaviors that

748
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,250
are in the service of thoughts.

749
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,020
So that's one way of
thinking about a difference.

750
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,423
Yes.

751
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,250
Can individuals have multiple
disorders like bipolar and skip?

752
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,263
Yes.

753
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,653
Yes.

754
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,141
Yes.

755
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:32,771
The question is,

756
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:34,600
can individuals have multiple disorders?

757
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,703
Absolutely.

758
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:36,851
And in fact,

759
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:41,020
some disorders are Comorbid and that's
just a fancy way of saying they often go

760
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:41,854
together.

761
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,020
So if you have a severe depression,

762
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,531
for instance,

763
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:45,790
which is a mood disorder,

764
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,650
you may also have an anxiety disorder.

765
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,000
So yeah,

766
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,721
having one,

767
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,560
unfortunately it doesn't immunize
you against having another yes

768
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,733
coming.

769
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,070
The question was about superstitions.

770
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,173
Um,

771
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,270
I think it's an interesting question.

772
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:07,710
Would it have never thought of before?

773
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,680
I think it depends on the
severity of superstitions.

774
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,990
So if he doesn't have
a superstition saying,

775
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,033
um,

776
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:14,820
you know,

777
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,990
step on a crack,

778
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,280
break your mother's back,

779
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,650
which has never been
scientifically proven,

780
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,570
but let's suppose you and,

781
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,380
and then so you just go,

782
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,680
oh,

783
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,170
I kind of,

784
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:23,700
I just kind of,

785
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,250
or it's bad luck to break
a mirror and that's it.

786
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:28,200
You just have it and it
doesn't make a big deal to you.

787
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,370
That's harmless.

788
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,690
On the other hand,

789
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,630
if you're a superstition is such that,

790
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,380
um,

791
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,400
that you develop weird
rituals you might have to do,

792
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:38,810
um,

793
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,100
to carefully walk so you don't step on
any other on any cracks or you might have

794
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:43,934
to do or if you do,

795
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,910
you might have to go back and start
your whole walk to work over again.

796
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,950
When it gets to that level,

797
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,670
it could creep into OCD and often
obsessive compulsive disorders.

798
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,553
Um,

799
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,140
have a religious or a
magical manifestation where
you believe there's certain

800
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:02,120
things you must do or
terrible things will happen.

801
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,330
And then that way you can view them as
extreme and build from superstitions.

802
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,820
But simple superstitions
don't tend to be of that,

803
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:11,654
of that type.

804
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,431
Yes,

805
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:14,264
I'm back.

806
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,951
The question is,

807
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:22,170
are people with schizophrenia dangerous?

808
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,890
Um,

809
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,701
as a rule,

810
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,580
statistically it tends not to be the case.

811
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,330
They tend to be much more likely
victims there then harmful.

812
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,280
They tend to be fairly helpless.

813
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,000
You can have a case where it's
schizophrenia might harm somebody,

814
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,250
a paranoid schizophrenia for instance.

815
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,740
I might develop a delusion
and harm somebody.

816
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,030
Um,

817
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,220
and so there are definitely such cases,

818
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,000
but for the most part
again or more victims,

819
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,881
victims that,

820
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:49,360
that then,

821
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,710
then,

822
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:49,981
then,

823
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:50,081
oh,

824
00:33:50,081 --> 00:33:50,551
pressers,

825
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:51,100
they're more,

826
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,480
they're,

827
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,450
they're very vulnerable because they
aren't capable of dealing with other

828
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:55,050
people.

829
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,060
They often aren't capable
of defending themselves.

830
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,140
Uh,

831
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,973
one more.

832
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,503
Yes.

833
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,420
The question is how permanent is the
fact that the medication you mean for

834
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,254
schizophrenia?

835
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,463
Yes,

836
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,120
in general,

837
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:15,511
I think,

838
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,610
I can't think of any exceptions.

839
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,450
Um,

840
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:18,920
the,

841
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,280
the,

842
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,360
the effects of medication are temporary.

843
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,620
Now that doesn't mean if you
have a belt of OCD or depression,

844
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,390
you have to be a medication
rest of your life.

845
00:34:27,391 --> 00:34:28,440
What could happen is,

846
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,250
um,

847
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,671
for instance,

848
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:31,140
somebody get a mild depression,

849
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,380
go on something like Prozac or Wellbutrin,

850
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,920
use that time to going to get
their lives back together,

851
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:39,000
cheer up a bit.

852
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,740
And then when they go off the medication,

853
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,263
they're fine.

854
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,840
But as Professor Nolan
huck cinema pointed out,

855
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,420
unless they develop coping skills,

856
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,700
they're likely to relapse
and get the problem again.

857
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,951
So the,

858
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:54,600
the physical effects of
medication are always temporary.

859
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,550
We didn't leave anything
that like schizophrenia,

860
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,070
but it can often help
people get out of a problem,

861
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,390
anxiety or depression.

862
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,150
Okay.

863
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,470
Dissociative disorders.

864
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,233
Um,

865
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,740
I'll show you a movie clip and then
we'll go back and talk a little bit about

866
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,574
it.

867
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,510
Let me ask a question
that might seem somewhat

868
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,003
uncaring.

869
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,610
How many of you think he's faking?

870
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,023
How many of you,

871
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,160
how many of you are confident?

872
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,150
There are many people living inside
his head as in a way it's depicted.

873
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,873
Okay.

874
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,170
How many of you were unsure?

875
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,440
How many of you are of two minds?

876
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,850
There's one part of you struggling.

877
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:45,390
Let's,

878
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,050
let's,

879
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,771
let's go.

880
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:47,604
We'll go back to him.

881
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,773
Go back then.

882
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,730
Dissociative disorder are disorders
involving this association.

883
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,120
And what people mean by that is literally
at this Association of memory that is,

884
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,683
um,

885
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,930
you become somehow unaware,

886
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,520
separated from pump part
of your identity or history

887
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,690
and you're unable to recall those parts
of your identity in history except

888
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,890
sometimes under special circumstances.

889
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,420
Now,

890
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,760
some degree of dissociation is normal.

891
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:24,841
There is,

892
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:25,140
um,

893
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,740
I will,

894
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,850
I have here,

895
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,043
um,

896
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,120
Ben,

897
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,430
um,

898
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,360
actually Dr. Nolan Hok has excellent
abnormal psychology textbook,

899
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,660
a checklist of dissociative experiences,

900
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,140
many of which normal people have

901
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,440
not sure whether one has done
something or only thought about it.

902
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,100
Anybody ever had that common.

903
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,563
Um,

904
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,690
so involved in a fantasy
that it seems real

905
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,820
feeling as though one's
body is not one zone.

906
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,040
Um,

907
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,540
I will also add that experience that
experiments with pharmaceuticals can often

908
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,720
lead to dissociative experiences.

909
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,093
Um,

910
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,710
driving a car and realizing that one
doesn't remember part of the trip.

911
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,510
Talking out loud to oneself when alone

912
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,570
not recognizing one's
reflection in the mirror.

913
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,953
Okay.

914
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,320
That's not very common,

915
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,781
but it is,

916
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,910
it's within a normal range
is within normal range.

917
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,513
Um,

918
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,380
but then you get more severe cases.

919
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,473
Um,

920
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,780
and there's three different types.

921
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:50,040
Dissociative Amnesia,

922
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,480
dissociative fugue,

923
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,820
and associative identity disorder.

924
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,270
Dissociative Amnesia
is illustrating a story

925
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,210
of a woman who sees something terrible.

926
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,830
And as a result,

927
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,360
her memory of that experience
was no longer accessible.

928
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,463
MMM.

929
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,060
It's often known as psychogenic amnesia.

930
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:15,961
Uh,

931
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,300
the only thing wrong and
here's your memory loss.

932
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,990
And sometimes it's a
selective memory loss.

933
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,283
Um,

934
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,410
but sometimes it could be global.

935
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,670
It says in these movie cases where
you lose your memory because something

936
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,210
terrible has happened and
he would get it back later.

937
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,530
But you have a temporary loss of identity.

938
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,200
The idea is that something
so terrible has happened.

939
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:42,430
You separate yourself from your
previous identity and your memory.

940
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,270
Um,

941
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,270
over half of people charged with
homicide claimed to have some degree of

942
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:50,860
dissociative amnesia.

943
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,000
The problem here is that many,

944
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:55,421
many,

945
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,360
many of those cases
involve alcohol and drugs,

946
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,420
which can lead to some
sort of alcoholic blackout.

947
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,350
Um,

948
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,350
also people could be lying if you're
charged with murder is often a reasonable

949
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:08,141
thing to say.

950
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:09,460
I don't remember any of this.

951
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,850
It just kind of as a way to
distance yourself from it.

952
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,580
Dissociative fugue is kind
of weird and interesting.

953
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,803
Um,

954
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,150
the guy's wife leaves him for another man.

955
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,800
Six months later he was discovered
tending bar in Miami beach and calling

956
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:31,801
himself Martin and he totally wiped
out his past memory and developed a new

957
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:33,274
identity.

958
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,813
Um,

959
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,510
this is also known as psychogenic.

960
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:38,200
Phew.

961
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,880
So it's global amnesia,

962
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,850
but there's also identity replacement.

963
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,110
Um,

964
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,220
you leave home,

965
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,790
you develop a new identity
and it's called a fugue state.

966
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,291
This is,

967
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:50,740
um,

968
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,510
this is my favorite mental disorder.

969
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,000
If I had to get a serious mental disorder,

970
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,710
I would get this because
I'd get to travel.

971
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,973
Um,

972
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,230
when it wears off,

973
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,840
your old identity comes back
and your new identities,

974
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,723
forgotten

975
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,821
vendors,

976
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,320
dissociative identity disorder.

977
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,263
Um,

978
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,600
and this is a story of this woman who,

979
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,093
um,

980
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:19,190
goes back and forth from
her regular personality to
a personality a of Donna who

981
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:20,460
was only six years old.

982
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,480
This was originally known as multiple
personality disorder and ideas.

983
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,430
You have two or more
distinct people in one head.

984
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,510
It is,

985
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,150
it is a rare and controversial disorder,

986
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,430
but include some very
famous cases and has been,

987
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:41,264
um,

988
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,491
uh,

989
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:44,100
illustrated in many movies and books.

990
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:44,920
Um,

991
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,231
Cleveland,

992
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:46,140
a wonderful movie,

993
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:46,621
primal,

994
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:50,250
fair fear where Ed
Norton's first big movie,

995
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,330
highly recommended and it's been
tried as a criminal defense.

996
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,170
Um,

997
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,920
the hillside strangler
claimed to be two people,

998
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,450
but he was still convicted,

999
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,613
both of them.

1000
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,723
Um,

1001
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,580
it typically starts early.

1002
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,440
The pattern of dissociation.

1003
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,740
Mostly it's women and mostly it involves
some sort of recollection of torture or

1004
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:14,040
sexual abuse.

1005
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,511
Also.

1006
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:16,620
And to get back to your question,

1007
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:18,480
can you have more than one,

1008
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,320
um,

1009
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,041
mental disorder?

1010
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:20,874
At the same time,

1011
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,840
people with dissociative disorder often
show symptoms of post traumatic stress

1012
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:26,580
disorder or PTSD.

1013
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,580
What causes it?

1014
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,523
Well,

1015
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:36,860
it is often to be to cause
caused by severe abuse,

1016
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,630
often sexual or physical abuse.

1017
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,850
The problem is most people who get abused
don't develop dissociative identity

1018
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:44,540
disorder.

1019
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,920
And one idea is that,

1020
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,070
is that if abuse plus some sort of
genetic or biological predisposition to

1021
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:52,454
dissociate,

1022
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,780
um,

1023
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,500
and in fact people with dissociative
identity disorder seems to be very

1024
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:58,370
susceptible.

1025
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,040
They're easier to
hypnotize and other people.

1026
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,070
And so it might begin as sort of a self,

1027
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,050
if not an act of self hypnosis.

1028
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:11,300
You put yourself in a hypnotic trance
to cope with some terrible situation and

1029
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:15,980
you begin to develop new and
separate and distinct personalities.

1030
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,473
Now

1031
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,780
of the many things I want to talk to you,

1032
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,411
I've talked,

1033
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:23,870
spoken about some of
been very controversial.

1034
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,700
One issue of controversy which we talked
about was the existence in nature of

1035
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:30,260
so-called repressed memories.

1036
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,090
This is another very controversial case
related to the repressed memory case.

1037
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,160
Um,

1038
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,910
in a reason,

1039
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,743
Paul,

1040
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,010
less than one quarter of psychiatrists
believe there is such a thing as

1041
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:44,510
associative identity disorder.

1042
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,120
Okay.

1043
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,200
Why would you doubt that?

1044
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:48,351
Well,

1045
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:48,491
there's,

1046
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:49,820
I'm curious statistics

1047
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,470
between 1930 and 1960 there were two
cases in the United States in the 1980s or

1048
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,700
20,000 cases.

1049
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,310
You cannot go elsewhere from the United
States and find people dissociative

1050
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:05,144
identity disorder.

1051
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,860
It seems to be an American phenomenon
and it varies by therapists.

1052
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,440
Some therapists and need some hospitals.

1053
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,620
Some medical units go decades without
ever seeing anybody at our approaches.

1054
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,660
Dissociative identity disorder,

1055
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,830
other therapists,

1056
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,490
virtually every patient they
have has multiple personalities.

1057
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,600
One worry based on these faxes,

1058
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:36,020
dissociative identity disorder isn't
a sense real that Richard really does

1059
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:38,910
believe he's moving from
personality to personality,

1060
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,510
but he didn't come into
therapy with that problem.

1061
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,700
Rather as therapists gave it to them.

1062
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,020
Um,

1063
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,560
the claim is that is the result
of suggestion by the therapist,

1064
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,910
the therapist,

1065
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,700
and they're typically good
people who wish to help.

1066
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,170
But the therapist might be in the grips
of a theory involving repression and

1067
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:03,171
multiple personalities and different
selves and encourage either tacitly or,

1068
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:08,760
or overtly their patients to develop
these separate personalities.

1069
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,371
Related to,

1070
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:16,371
this is not clear to what
extent dissociative identity
disorder is an extreme

1071
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,930
version of normal psychopathology,

1072
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,201
sorry,

1073
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,910
abnormal psychology.

1074
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,930
So people from the philosopher Dan
Dennett to the psychologist Judith Harris

1075
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,540
have pointed out that were
different selves in different,

1076
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,500
we can consciously play
at the different cells,

1077
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:35,850
but we could also,

1078
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:36,240
um,

1079
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,380
just shift personalities depending on
whether we're with our friends or our

1080
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,970
family or with strangers.

1081
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,910
The claim is that dissociative
identity disorder,

1082
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,620
however dramatic it looks,

1083
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:51,890
might merely be an extended version of
this where people as well are to some

1084
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:56,850
extent play acting to make their
therapist and doctors happy.

1085
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,370
Any questions about um,

1086
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,940
dissociative identity disorder?

1087
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,983
Yes.

1088
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:12,871
Yes.

1089
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:13,980
Dissociative amnesia.

1090
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:17,540
The question that involves a relationship
need associated Amnesia and the retro

1091
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:21,720
grade and Anterior Grade Amnesia
discussed before those other amnesia.

1092
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:23,280
Is that a result of brain damage?

1093
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,120
Um,

1094
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,110
they tend to be,

1095
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,490
if not permanent,

1096
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,520
long lasting and severe dissociative
Amnesia is apparently caused by specific

1097
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:36,670
life events and can often
be very short lived there.

1098
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,520
Of course all brain events,

1099
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,660
but in a crude sense of dissociative
amnesia was more of a psychological

1100
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:47,510
happening then the other sorts of
Amnesia that we talked about in bombing

1101
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,001
course,

1102
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,530
the cops syndrome and the
patient of h m and so on.

1103
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,383
Other questions?

1104
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,221
Yes,

1105
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:00,054
and back.

1106
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,123
Yes.

1107
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,740
What happened in 1960,

1108
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,220
there was a very famous case,

1109
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,350
I think the case was a case of civil.

1110
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,633
Does anybody know?

1111
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,650
Teaching fellers are nodding,

1112
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,760
but there was a very famous case which
I think was up Sibyl which was made into

1113
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:25,540
a movie and discussed and
had a huge influence on,

1114
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,583
on people.

1115
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,690
And then they started to
believe that that it was real.

1116
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:32,590
There's a,

1117
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,280
there's a type,

1118
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,520
the fourth and final type of disorder,

1119
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:36,703
um,

1120
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,790
is something which is not actually
discussed in the great textbook,

1121
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,380
but it has to do with personality.

1122
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,970
And this is interesting
because it probably extends
to some extent too many of

1123
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:51,600
this people,

1124
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,260
the people in this room
personality as you remember,

1125
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,220
is your way of dealing with
the world in particular.

1126
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,430
In particular the way you have
of dealing with other people.

1127
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,310
The notion of personality disorders,

1128
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,563
um,

1129
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,020
is that some personalities are so bad
that they veer off into mental illness.

1130
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,180
So,

1131
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,790
um,

1132
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,120
one personality disorder is a
narcissistic personality disorder.

1133
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,290
Everyone likes to talk about
themselves and thinks they're terrific.

1134
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,220
This some extent,

1135
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,100
some people to a little bit too much,

1136
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,380
but if it's really extreme,

1137
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,500
they talk,

1138
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:29,850
they,

1139
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,430
you could get labeled with a
narcissistic personality disorder.

1140
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,360
Um,

1141
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,620
you might have an avoidant
personality disorder dependent,

1142
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,840
um,

1143
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,840
histrionic.

1144
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,960
Borderline borderline is really bad.

1145
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,570
When people describe you as a
borderline personality disorder,

1146
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,110
that just means you're just awful
to be what you're kind of awful.

1147
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:51,323
Um,

1148
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,000
here's the paranoid personality disorder.

1149
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,290
Um,

1150
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,130
which is not that you're paranoid
schizophrenia very clearly.

1151
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:01,480
No signs of schizophrenia,

1152
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,271
no.

1153
00:48:02,271 --> 00:48:02,430
Uh,

1154
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,360
hallucinations,

1155
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,240
nothing like that.

1156
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,770
You just paranoid.

1157
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,980
You're just to a greater
extent than normal.

1158
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,770
You think other people are against
you and plotting against you.

1159
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,760
The most interesting
personality disorders,

1160
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,653
um,

1161
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,230
in my mind have to do
with violence and crime

1162
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,600
and they have to do in particular with
something called antisocial personality

1163
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,434
disorder.

1164
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,483
Now,

1165
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,230
most murderers are not mentally
ill in a medical sense.

1166
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,610
They're not mentally ill according
to how clinicians categorize things.

1167
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,563
Um,

1168
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,440
to some extent,

1169
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:43,441
most people who kill are just normal
people being driven by normal desires,

1170
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:45,760
rage,

1171
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,660
jealousy,

1172
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,523
hate,

1173
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,150
just taken to an extreme,

1174
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:55,110
even mass murderers do
not as a rule appear to be
substantively different from a

1175
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,610
psychological point of view.

1176
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,540
Um,

1177
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,560
in every society.

1178
00:48:59,561 --> 00:48:59,761
And,

1179
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:00,341
and honestly,

1180
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:00,940
I wrote,

1181
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,020
I wrote the lecture,

1182
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,540
the lecture on this quite a while ago,

1183
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,760
but given a reason to events,

1184
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:07,623
um,

1185
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,733
it,

1186
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,410
they sound is a perfectly good
example of what I'm going to say.

1187
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,220
Um,

1188
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:17,050
in every society there's a notion of
somebody who has been deeply humiliated,

1189
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,330
usually male,

1190
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,120
and he's been humiliated
over and over again.

1191
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:24,070
He sees himself as losing status.

1192
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:25,990
And losing status and losing status.

1193
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:31,350
And he tries to get it all back to gain
face with one act of terrible violence

1194
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,240
where he takes his revenge over
everybody and then as known as,

1195
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,160
as an and as a result,

1196
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,340
even though he might die,

1197
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:41,320
he probably will die.

1198
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,450
Makes his way to,

1199
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:43,721
to,

1200
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:44,170
to,

1201
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,760
to a level of social status.

1202
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,600
You would've never,

1203
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,860
never gotten before.

1204
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,933
Um,

1205
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:49,670
the,

1206
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,390
the American term for this
used to be going postal.

1207
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,553
Um,

1208
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,160
and um,

1209
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,431
but,

1210
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,930
but this is an old idea.

1211
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,610
Stone-Age tribes in Papa New
Guinea had a term for this,

1212
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,170
they call it running a muck.

1213
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,750
And this is in every
society has this sort of,

1214
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,210
there's Matt,

1215
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,320
there's normal murders,

1216
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,850
there's mass murderers.

1217
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:13,240
And then there's the interesting
cases like serial killers,

1218
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,460
like a daughter or son of Sam,

1219
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,361
Ted Bundy,

1220
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,530
John Wayne Gacy,

1221
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,050
even imaginary Hannibal Lecter.

1222
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:24,820
Many of these sort of serial killers
do have some sort of mental illness,

1223
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,010
but the mental illnesses are all over the,

1224
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,310
um,

1225
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,031
there was a guy,

1226
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:30,390
I'm Jerome Rudolph,

1227
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:35,480
who had such a severe fetish for women's
feet that he killed young women and

1228
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,470
separate their feet.

1229
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,900
And then kept their feet around his house.

1230
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,770
Um,

1231
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,860
son of Sam was pretty clearly
a paranoid schizophrenic.

1232
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,320
He,

1233
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,420
he did his murders because
a barking dog told him too.

1234
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,023
Um,

1235
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:50,750
I,

1236
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,940
Jeffrey Dahmer is a cannibal killer.

1237
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,340
He killed people so we could eat them.

1238
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,460
And then,

1239
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,830
and I asked one of my colleagues and
clinical colleagues what exactly was wrong

1240
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:01,460
with him.

1241
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,960
And the person immediately responded.

1242
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,520
He has a severe eating disorder.

1243
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,673
It was a joke.

1244
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,481
It was in very,

1245
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,410
very bad tastes.

1246
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,563
Um,

1247
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:11,841
a lot of,

1248
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:12,674
um,

1249
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,920
a lot of murders,

1250
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,020
claimed had dissociative disorders.

1251
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,630
It wasn't me who killed the guy.

1252
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,980
It was my alter ego,

1253
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:22,814
Fred.

1254
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,430
It's not clear how often they're telling
the truth if ever or whether this is a

1255
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:29,990
way of escaping responsibility.

1256
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,230
There's a mental illness.

1257
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,130
Um,

1258
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,720
there's an extreme specific version of
a personality disorder that revolves

1259
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,680
around violence.

1260
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,490
And this is known as
antisocial personality disorder

1261
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,880
is it used to be called moral insanity
now is often called psychopathy.

1262
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:58,880
Some people make a distinction
between psychopaths and sociopaths.

1263
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,930
Um,

1264
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:00,950
for the purposes here,

1265
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,820
others don't.

1266
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,230
And for the purposes here,

1267
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,140
I'm going to blend them
into one category is,

1268
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:07,070
and I'll use the term psychopath.

1269
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:09,920
They're typically male.

1270
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,590
Um,

1271
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,150
they are defined a selfish,

1272
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,013
callous,

1273
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,950
impulsive.

1274
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,780
You're sexually promiscuous.

1275
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,900
They seem to lack love,

1276
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:21,531
loyalty,

1277
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:24,440
normal feelings of
affiliation and compassion

1278
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,550
and again to all sorts of trouble because
they're easily bored and they seek out

1279
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,593
stimulation.

1280
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,090
Now when you hear this,

1281
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:40,540
you got to realize that this sort of
person is not necessarily an unattractive

1282
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:46,070
person to imagine or to think about
or even under some circumstances to

1283
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:46,880
encounter.

1284
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,270
You have to avoid the temptation
when you think about psychopath,

1285
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,680
to think about a guy like this,

1286
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,970
to think of a Hannibal Lecter.

1287
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,433
Um,

1288
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,120
the most famous psychopath
of course is James Bond,

1289
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:05,020
who's a perfect psychopath in every
regard as played by him and also by Sean

1290
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,450
Connery and Roger Moore and
Timothy Dalton characters were not.

1291
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,000
Psychopaths could give
a whole course on that.

1292
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,043
Um,

1293
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,750
is this an illness?

1294
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,191
Well,

1295
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:16,731
again,

1296
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:18,350
this is one of the hard cases.

1297
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,860
Psychopaths don't come in for treatment.

1298
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,740
James Bond would never go
to a therapist and say,

1299
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:27,930
have a problem with promiscuity
in my life of adventure.

1300
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:33,270
Why is it that I don't have this need to
settle down and have kids and be a one

1301
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:34,104
woman man?

1302
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,750
They don't have a problem with it.

1303
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:37,830
Um,

1304
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,900
other people often have a problem with it,

1305
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:40,741
but,

1306
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:43,020
but it's not clear that's enough
to make it a mental disorder.

1307
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:43,980
Also,

1308
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,190
a lot of psychopaths are
reasonably successful.

1309
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:51,690
Now this gets complicated because
psychologists study psycho pass,

1310
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:57,230
but the psychopaths that they study are
by definition unsuccessful psychopaths.

1311
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,150
And what some people have
argued is the real psychopaths,

1312
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,450
the successful ones are the
ones that run the world,

1313
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,530
that excel in every field because they
are successful enough that they don't

1314
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:11,700
look like psychopaths.

1315
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,110
They have no conscience,

1316
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:14,010
no compassion,

1317
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,551
love,

1318
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,384
loyalty.

1319
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,790
They're cold blooded and ambitious,

1320
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,380
but they don't go around making it so
obvious that we throw them in prison.

1321
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,320
And so it's an interesting and
subtle and complicated case.

1322
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,143
Um,

1323
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,260
the final section and I'll
start this and then we'll,

1324
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:35,531
we'll,

1325
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:37,930
we'll go five minutes
into this and then move,

1326
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,830
continue at,

1327
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:39,730
uh,

1328
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,940
next week with the final
class concerns therapy.

1329
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,633
Now,

1330
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:53,120
the most interesting thing for us to
deal with is the question of does therapy

1331
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:53,930
work.

1332
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,790
And there's a lot to be said about this.

1333
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:56,683
Um,

1334
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,290
the history of therapy has
been gruesome and unsuccessful.

1335
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,100
Um,

1336
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,933
again,

1337
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,360
to be mad was to be viewed as
to be in league with the devil.

1338
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,360
And so people who have mental
illnesses were tortured to death,

1339
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,781
Burns,

1340
00:55:08,781 --> 00:55:09,830
sent out to sea,

1341
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,873
and so on.

1342
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,020
In the 18th century,

1343
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:14,720
they were thought of as degenerates
and sent away from society.

1344
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,740
In the 19th century there was
a brief blast of compassion,

1345
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,073
um,

1346
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,480
where pinel tried to
have mental hospitals.

1347
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,681
And then,

1348
00:55:24,681 --> 00:55:24,980
um,

1349
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,600
and then there were all sorts of,

1350
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:27,434
since then,

1351
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,680
all sorts of medical treatments
that were considerably less

1352
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,080
successful.

1353
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,820
And this brief video,

1354
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:41,420
we'll summarize some of the
previous medical treatments.

1355
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,460
I often wonder a hundred years from now,

1356
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:48,800
how am I going to look
at our current therapies,

1357
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,340
um,

1358
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,230
and whether it will see them as equally
barbaric and stupid as we look at the

1359
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:55,460
therapies in the past.

1360
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:56,330
Um,

1361
00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:01,330
what I'll begin next lecture with is a
very quick discussion of what therapies

1362
00:56:03,411 --> 00:56:04,244
work,

1363
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,821
uh,

1364
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,290
of the ones currently available.

1365
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,750
And then we'll end the class and
this will be somewhat short class.

1366
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,870
I end the class with a
discussion of happiness.

1367
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,003
Um,

1368
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,890
there was an optional thing I'll add,

1369
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,820
which is,

1370
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,450
um,

1371
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,200
which is you're reading responses are
done and you'll have the opportunity to

1372
00:56:21,201 --> 00:56:24,400
make comments on the class
in anonymous evaluations.

1373
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,540
But what I'm kind of interested in
is if people could send me an email,

1374
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,160
and this is entirely optional,

1375
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,640
but the most interesting thing
that we've covered in this class,

1376
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,950
I'm curious what people think it is.

1377
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,280
And it's something which I could try
to build upon for future classes.

1378
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,151
So again,

1379
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:41,110
this is optional.

1380
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,490
Just give it a subject heading,

1381
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:42,761
intro,

1382
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:44,800
psych and send it to me
if you choose to do it.

1383
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,910
And I'll see you on Wednesday.
