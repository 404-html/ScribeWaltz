Speaker 1:          00:12          The final topic of the course is clinical psychology, also known as a normal psychology or psychopathology. And this for many of us is what psychology is really about. It's about mental illness. It's about clinical psychologists. Um, and um, we started talking about this when a Dr. Nolan Huxson mark gave her guests lecture last week and I'm going to continue through this today. Uh, it is a topic of tremendous scientific importance but also a topic of great personal importance for many of us. Many of the people in this room have been mentally ill, strictly speaking at some point in their lives. Um, some of you are under some sort of therapy or treatment or medical intervention right now. Some of you are on Prozac or Zoloft or Ambien or Wellbutrin or any of those other medications to a, to deal with psychological problems you're facing. Others are also talking to psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other people.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Um, many of you who are not at this point mentally ill will become mentally ill, uh, during your stay at Yale. Um, and um, it, this is a difficult period in many people's lives. And as the period of people's lives where mental illness emerges in a, in many of us, by one estimate, one half of all college graduates in the United States and a number is very high with college graduates, highly educated people. One half of you will have some sort of mental illness in your life, um, serious enough to require some sort of treatment. Those of you not directly affected with mental illness, um, yourselves, we'll no doubt experienced your loved ones, your family, your friends, getting some sort of illness, um, be it Alzheimer's or schizophrenia or depression or some sort of anxiety disorder. So the personal importance of, of clinical psychology to personal importance of understanding what can go wrong and how best to treat it simply can't be underestimated.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Now, when we target about mental disorders, the scope of this is very broad. It includes the prototypical schizophrenia would, you could see on the streets of new haven, somebody walking and gesturing and talking to themselves. It's, and I'm screaming. Um, it includes alcohol addiction and cocaine addiction and other addictions. It includes somebody with down syndrome or autism. I'm an old person losing his memory, a teenager falling into a deep depression, somebody with a severe social phobia to the extent that he or she can't leave the house, then there are also very hard cases where it's difficult to say one way or another. That guy's photographing me as I'm talking to. It's freaking me out. Um, and kind of a social phobia way. Um, it was difficult cases where it's just hard to tell mental illness from just from just bad behavior, um, in general. Um, so, so consider a killer without a conscience or a mobster like John Gotti is he mentally ill?

Speaker 1:          03:46          Um, and this is a question which is a deep one and we'll wrestle with it a little bit actually towards the end of this lecture. What about somebody who acts in a kind of unusual or Zany way? Um, this is originally supposed to be a picture of a, of the character Kramer on Seinfeld, but given his unusual antics in the last few months, it could be a picture of the actor who plays him. We've gone to all sorts of trouble. What about someone who is just kind of wacky at what point his wackiness move into the domain of mental illness. Um, what about the unusual lifestyles such as extreme altruism? Batman devotes most of his life to helping others. He sleeps one hour a night and this hour is fraught with nightmares and then he fights crime. What about somebody? And this was a case report in the New Yorker a few months ago, who has lots of money and a loving family and has his kidney removed to help a stranger.

Speaker 1:          04:46          And he says, I have two kidneys. That's minor pain, minor operation. I could save someone's life. His wife says, you're mentally ill. That's just crazy to do that. Where do we draw the line? And so there are these great philosophical and moral questions over the boundaries and how to think about mental illness. So how should we think about mental illness as well? There's some answers we could quickly dispense with. It used to be thought that severe mental Ellis was a result of demonic possession. Um, if you read the Gospels, Jesus Christ wandered around a lot, met crazy people, and exercise the demons from their bodies. It was a common way of thinking about craziness. We now believe that this is not true. What about yes, it's not true. What about social social deviants? Some people including the psychiatrist, um, Tom has us claim that when we label somebody as mentally ill, this is not a medical decision.

Speaker 1:          05:49          It's rather a social decision, um, designed to ostracize people who deviate from society's norms to ostracize them and rid them of moral agency. It's not that we disagree with them. It's not even that we see them as evil. Rather we see them as sick. And as such, we don't even have to core to them the respect that we accord to criminals. Now, this is not entirely unreasonable view in many countries around the world. Um, desistance people who, who, who argue against the state are often determined to be mentally ill and thrown in asylums. Uh, blacks in the United States who tried to escape from slavery were described as having a mental illness. Why would they want to do so unless they were mentally ill up until, um, 1973 to be a homosexual to be gay would count in the official records of how we classify illness as being mentally ill.

Speaker 1:          06:58          And many people saw this and we see this now not so much as reflecting a sort of unbiased medical analysis, but rather as reflecting biases that people have against gay people. And these are political and social and moral biases. They're not objective medical judgments. Uh, even now I've been, I've been recording every president that has been the president of United States in, in my memory, including Bush and the particularly Clinton has been described it by, by his opponents, not merely as awful evil, terrible hate his policies, but as mentally ill every part, every president at some point or another, some bright intelligent person figures to call a psychopath and put that in Time magazine. Um, now put aside whether the extent to which the things are accurate. Point being that we often use medical labels, particularly labels like psychopath, schizophrenia, delusional to, to ostracize and pick out people we disagree with.

Speaker 1:          08:08          At the same time though, this is not entirely right. People go too far when they say there's no such thing as mental illness. Um, some people are mentally ill in a very real sense of illness. In the same sense, we would describe somebody as physically ill if they were to have cancer. Um, this illness, um, damages their functioning. They cannot function well. They do not tend to be more creative or more productive or more vivacious rather for them. With very few exceptions, possibly some exceptions revolving around mania. As Dr. Nolan Huxson my discuss with very few exceptions being mentally ill, it's just very bad for you in every possible way. Um, moreover, when people treated, when people get better, they become more competent, happier, better able to participate in the work, and they do not choose to go back to their mental illness suggesting that it really is illness in a serious sense. And so the modern treatment of psychological disorders treats them as disorders like medical disorders. Schizophrenia is as much a disease as cancer and should be thought of in the same way. Um, there's a whole field of abnormal psychology of tremendous scope. We've already discussed many mental illnesses in the context of um, other things. So for instance, we talked about Amnesia in the context of memory and how it works. We talked about autism in the context of social reasoning.

Speaker 1:          09:50          There are many more and I'm not going to read through them. These are the major categories just for people's interests, um, from the diagnostic and standard manual.

Speaker 2:          10:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:01          You don't have to, you're not responsible for all of these. Um, and this is an illustration which people might find interesting of sex differences in these, in the major disorders. Um, and the patterns as you could see are kind of neat. Um, women are more prone to have anxiety disorders and mood disorders. Um, men are much more likely to suffer from substance disorders, particularly alcoholism. Um, schizophrenia, it sort of evenly matched, but antisocial personality disorder, sometimes known as sociopathy or psychopathy is predominantly male. And we'll turn to that a bit later. Here are the major ones which I want to review today. Um, I'm not going to talk about mood disorders at all because this was the topic of the suburb lecture we heard last week, but I want to quickly review schizophrenia. The class of disorders known as anxiety disorders, the class of disorders known as dissociative disorders and the class of disorders known as personality disorders. And these are the main psychological problems. If, if when a psychologist or a psychiatrist does his or her work, they're predominantly focused on somebody who has one of these problems. Um, some of them are rare, but some of them such as anxiety disorders and mood disorders are, our strikes are very common.

Speaker 2:          11:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Um, about 1% of the world's population suffers from schizophrenia.

Speaker 2:          11:38          And

Speaker 1:          11:39          this is the most common reason for being in a mental hospital. And the reason for that is because of its severity because of how terrible an illness it is. Um, schizophrenia next had been described as the of the 20th century, but people pointed out in the last hundred years, people who are schizophrenia or just there was no place for them in society. They're shunned or rejected. We have no idea how to treat them or how to help them. The roots of schizophrenia, um, come from the term split, uh, and mine. But the idea is there was a split from reality. It's important to stress the sort of Edom, a logical point because sometimes people confuse schizophrenia with something we'll split personality and they somehow think schizophrenia refers to having multiple personalities. This is incorrect. Multiple personality disorder is an entirely different disorder. Is this sort of dissociative disorder. Um, split personality that people with schizophrenia do not have multiple personalities. What they have is a problem with re relating to reality. Um, it's roughly equally split between the genders but it strikes men um, earlier and uh, it happens between, around these ages and as you can see roughly and as you can see, it is this sort of thing that could make us first occurrence while you were in college or university.

Speaker 3:          13:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:14          There are five symptoms, main symptoms of schizophrenia. Four of them are the positive symptoms, meaning things that you do that you have that's unusual. One's a negative symptom. Um, something that you don't have. Something has schizophrenia, lax. So just to walk through them. A hallucination is an experience, a sensory experience that isn't real. So the most typical hallucinations are auditory schizophrenia. Hearing voices they hear sounds, particularly people telling them to do things that aren't real. Sometimes there auditory or visual hallucinations or hallucinations of smell and taste. But a typical hallucination is, um, is auditory. Um, sometimes the voices are seen from coming from oneself. And so you could sometimes stop the hallucinations by doing things like humming or counting or holding your mouth. Ah, and some schizophrenia, we'll do this in an attempt to block, um, auditory hallucinations. There are delusions. The difference between a hallucination and delusion is a hallucination is a sensory experience at that's wrong.

Speaker 1:          14:26          That just didn't really happen. A delusion is a belief that isn't right. It's a, it's, it's a belief that, that, that you shouldn't be having. Now again, the question of what counts as of illusion and what counts is as accuracy. It can be a controversial one. I, Richard Dawkins title, his recent book, the God delusion, describing this mass delusion that many people have, that they believe there's a supernatural being who created the universe and was watching them. Some people find that offensive to call it the delusion and people will have different views. The delusion, schizophrenia next have, um, tend to be pretty clearly weird and wrong. Um, they often tend to believe they're famous people. Um, many schizophrenia have a religious bent and believe that they're in Jesus Christ. In 1959, there was a Michigan Hospital. I had three Jesus Christ in it. Um, and they would meet and talk.

Speaker 1:          15:23          Um, one theme of delusions is what's called ideas of reference and ideas of reference. Are you think that there's all sorts of things happening that revolve around you. You hear people whispering and you think they're talking about you. You pick up the newspaper and you believe that there was coded messages in it that are directed towards you. Um, you might believe that, that there's some sort of omnipotent, powerful force conspiring against you are trying to manipulate you like aliens or the FBI, the CIA, the government. You might believe that they have some sort of evil plan in mind for you. Um, there is disorganized speech, some schizophrenia, Babel, they talk and it's nonsense. Um, if you listen to a schizophrenia on the street, sometimes what they're saying makes no sense at all. Not Merely that they're conveying ideas that are unreasonable, but it's just garbled. It's just a mess. And sometimes they're disorganized behavior to, um, odd motor movements. The most extreme case of this, our motor movements described as catatonic where the person doesn't move, often freezes in a position. Those are all positive symptoms. I'm major negative symptoms with schizophrenia is absence of normal thought or an effect, an effect meaning emotion. So some schizophrenia might just not talk. They might have very low emotional responses. They might not care about anything.

Speaker 1:          17:01          The basic psychological misfunction oh, sorry. Um,

Speaker 2:          17:10          okay.

Speaker 1:          17:11          There are different subtypes of schizophrenia. There are five major subtypes, but I'm going to focus on the three major ones. Um, the three most interesting ones. The first one is paranoid schizophrenia. So paranoid schizophrenia, ex, um, believe that others are spying and plotting against them and they often have delusions of grandeur. They often believe that other people are jealous of them. They might believe they have supernatural powers. They might believe that their God or, or a Messiah, the catatonic schizophrenia are unresponsive to their surroundings and often no, just repeat what people say to them. They won't generate their own speed. And finally did this organize schizophrenia acts are maybe what you most think of when you think of somebody who is insane. Um, they make no sense. They have delusions and hallucinations. They babble. They that their actions make, they could be dangerous, they could be perceived as dangerous. There are unable to help themselves or unable to do anything in their lives.

Speaker 1:          18:20          It's hard to pin down exactly what's at root of all of these problems. But a very general summary is that there is a problem and an inability to put together your thoughts and perceptions to sequence them and coordinate them to, to, to impose a logical structure and a reasonable, realistic temporal sequence on your experience. This is the core thing going wrong. But what happens as a result of this is you lose contact with others. You lose social contact. Losing social contact means you don't get much reality checking. If I start acting weird and nobody cares, I could just get weirder and weirder. While if I'm in a good social group of people who care about me, often the situation could be brought under control. So schizophrenia is sort of a vicious circle. We had this cognitive problem. Then you have problems losing contact with others, exaggerating the cognitive problem.

Speaker 1:          19:21          And so on Skit, a lot of people study the genetics of schizophrenia. Um, it's clear enough that there's a powerful genetic components. Um, I could, you can tell how much at risk somebody is for becoming schizophrenia. Um, based on the schizophrenia and illness of their family members in particular, if you have an identical twin who, schizophrenia, your odds are about a half of becoming schizophrenia herself at the same time. And we dealt with this as well when we talked about issues of sexual orientation. Um, the fact that that, that, that identical twins, the odds are only 50% means there has to be an environmental component to it. If it was entirely genetic, it would be 100%. And so one claim, one way of looking at it is your jeans make you vulnerable to schizophrenia, but whether or not you become schizophrenia depends on what happens in your environment.

Speaker 1:          20:20          You're sensitive to certain triggers. Some triggers might have an early, there are some evidence that schizophrenia is associated with trauma even at the point of birth. And there's some other evidence that schizophrenia is linked to viral infections. Um, as a, as an example, there are more, schizophrenia is born in the winter. Subtle, a subtle difference, but, but there seems to be a reliable effect of more schizophrenia born in the winter. More people get sick in the winter, um, at times when there has been some sort of epidemic or some sort of plague, this seems to cause a jump in the frequency of schizophrenia was born at that time. There's some reason research at ties schizophrenia to the possibility of toxoplasmosis, um, which is a disorder. Uh, carried by cat feces. The experiment basically involved asking the parents of schizophrenia x one question, did you own a cat when your child was born?

Speaker 1:          21:21          And if the answer was yes, it seemed to correspond to a bit higher odds for schizophrenia families. Then for non schizophrenia families, a different sort of um, trigger is stressful family environments. Schizophrenia seem to really have more stressful family environments. They're non schizophrenia six now we have to be careful about this. We have to bring, we have to return to the sort of methodological cautions we had in mind when we talked about individual difference research in general. And remember we talk about the worst study in the world and one of the features of this was it was failing to pull apart cause and effect. It might be that having a difficult family environment ups your odds of becoming schizophrenic. On the other hand, it might also be that schizophrenia children are children who will become schizophrenia are difficult to deal with in certain ways causing a family environment.

Speaker 1:          22:21          So it's not clear whether the effect is from difficult family environment just to later schizophrenia or from schizophrenia to difficult family environment. There used to be a very popular theory of schizophrenia, which is that it was caused by excess excess dopamine. Dopamine you'll remember is a neurotransmitter. Um, and there's some reason take this seriously drugs that reduced dopamine provide some help in reducing symptoms. And if I give you a drug that bolstered that, that that shoots up your dopamine, um, that will turn you into, into a temporary schizophrenia. Uh, you get what's called amphetamine psychosis and you give you, you can give you schizophrenia symptoms, hallucinations, delusions, that sort of thing. This, there might be something to this theory, but we know now it can't be complete for at least two reasons. First, it doesn't explain the negative symptoms. It does, it explains the hallucinations and delusions and so on. But it doesn't explain, um, the loss of effect, the quietness, this stillness. Also, there seemed to be some sort of structural brain differences involving in large cerebral ventricles, um, involving reduced frontal lobe activity. Suggestion that the problem with schizophrenia is a lot more complicated than others might have it then the dopamine theory would have it.

Speaker 3:          23:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:55          I'll end with a mystery. And this mystery is discussed nicely in the grade textbook. Um, the, the, the symptoms of schizophrenia, the prevalence of schizophrenia is similar wherever you go, but less industrialized countries have a better rate of recovery from schizophrenia than industrialized countries and nobody really knows why. I listed here three possibilities. Um, one is that the families that were, that in a less industrialized country, there's more latitude. And so there's less critical bless criticism, there's less use of antipsychotic medications, antipsychotic medications help with the symptoms, but they might also impair recovery. And finally, if you think of schizophrenia as a transient disorder, maybe that will in some sense in some way, make that more likely to actually happen. The second sort of disorder I want to talk about much more common than the 1% is schizophrenia is a class of disorders known as anxiety disorders.

Speaker 3:          25:07          MMM.

Speaker 1:          25:08          The primary disturbance and anxiety disorders is anxiety. You have a lot of anxiety. It's persistent. Um, either anxiety or, um, or maladaptive behaviors to reduce anxiety. Now, everybody experiences anxiety. If you didn't experience anxiety, you'd be a very strange person. He probably wouldn't function very well in the world, but you have an anxiety disorder when you experienced too much of it. We experienced too much of it. It's uncontrollable, it's unreasonable and it messes up your life. And there's quite a few anxiety disorders. The main, the simplest one is this generalized anxiety disorders where, um, and this is about one in 20 people will get at some point in their lives, um, and you worry all the time. You're just very anxious. You're just worried all the time. And it could be paralyzing. It could give you physical symptoms like headaches, stomach aches, muscle tension and irritability.

Speaker 3:          26:07          MMM.

Speaker 1:          26:08          There's some evidence that generalized anxiety disorder has a genetic component that is somehow related to major depression. And it does seem to have, it's possible routes in some sort of childhood trauma. And so the model, some people give for this is when you are young, something really bad happens to you. Um, this makes you hypervigilant. You don't trust the world, bad things could always happen around the corner. And because you're hypervigilant, um, you are more prone to develop generalized anxiety disorder after, um, after a difficult life event. A second sort of anxiety disorder, which we already discussed in class are phobias and phobias or intense irrational fears. They could focus on objects, events, and social settings. Here's a nice diagram of different phobia, different things and the proportion of people who are afraid of it. And the point of this diagram isn't with the details. It's really, um, it's, it's rather to give you a feeling for the fact that some things most everybody is afraid of are a lot of people are afraid of. And some things, not many at all. Um, the big phobic object we know from previous lectures is snakes. About 40% of the population say they're afraid of snakes. How many people here are afraid of snakes?

Speaker 1:          27:32          Okay. And then there's a really terrifying thing. Mice, how you were afraid of mice. Mice are the worst things in the world. Um, and then cats. And if you're afraid of cats, that's really unusual. Not many people are afraid of cats. Um, there's a classical conditioning model of phobias which we are all familiar with, but we are all familiar with why it is not a very good theory. A lot of people who are afraid of snakes have never had had a bad experience with snakes. Moreover, a lot of people who have had bad experiences with things like car crashes and being electrocuted on the socket or, or, or a shooting, seeing a gun during a shooting do not develop phobias. This lead gives rise to a much more plausible theory known as the preparedness theory, which says that we have evolved to be sensitive to certain phobic objects, objects that were dangerous to us in our evolutionary history and were prone to develop phobic responses to this.

Speaker 1:          28:36          The final anxiety disorder is obsessive compulsive disorder. Um, obsessions are irrational, disturbing thoughts that intrude into your consciousness. Um, this is a con hits about two to 3% of the population and it leads to compulsion's repetitive actions performed to alleviate the obsessions. Um, for instance, you might be obsessed with the idea of your being dirty. Your hands are dirty or filthy, that might lead to compulsive washing. You might believe that God is angry at you and that might lead to compulsive prayer. Uh, cleanliness and religion are common themes of um, obsessive compulsive disorder. You know, you often know rationally that these are unreasonable behaviors where you can't help yourself from doing them. Um, sometimes I check it, sometimes they get the word I left my door unlocked and I run back and checked it, check it. But I feel it's a little bit of OCD coming on because I know I locked it, but did I really lock it?

Speaker 1:          29:44          And then you get work. Now I'm worried if I locked my door. Um, checking and washing. Checking is what I'm talking about here. Most common compulsions and it seems to have a neuro psychological phenomena, at least a it related to heightened neural activity in the caudate nucleus. What's interesting is you might think obsessive compulsive disorder is a very sort of Freud, the end psychoanalytic sort of disorder. But actually it's treated quite well with drugs. Drugs that affect the serotonin level. Serotonin being a neurotransmitter can often do good work for obsessive compulsive disorders. So if you develop a disorder and OCD problem, you might find yourself being cured simply with medications. Any, um, we've talked about schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. Any questions or thoughts so far? Yes.

Speaker 2:          30:43          Um, what's the difference between OCD and Tourette's?

Speaker 1:          30:48          It's a good question. The question was in relation to being OCD and Tourette's, Tourette's is, is, is, I don't know much about it as a very specific neurophysiological, uh, syndrome that doesn't have it. You don't have obsessive thoughts. What it leads to is involuntary tick ticks and tremors and sometimes sort have shouted obscenities or two words. And it needs to be very specific to that. While OCD is much broader and involves both behaviors but also to behaviors that are in the service of thoughts. So that's one way of thinking about a difference. Yes.

Speaker 2:          31:25          Can individuals have multiple disorders like bipolar and skip?

Speaker 1:          31:29          Yes. Yes. Yes. The question is, can individuals have multiple disorders? Absolutely. And in fact, some disorders are Comorbid and that's just a fancy way of saying they often go together. So if you have a severe depression, for instance, which is a mood disorder, you may also have an anxiety disorder. So yeah, having one, unfortunately it doesn't immunize you against having another yes

Speaker 2:          31:56          coming.

Speaker 1:          32:00          The question was about superstitions. Um, I think it's an interesting question. Would it have never thought of before? I think it depends on the severity of superstitions. So if he doesn't have a superstition saying, um, you know, step on a crack, break your mother's back, which has never been scientifically proven, but let's suppose you and, and then so you just go, oh, I kind of, I just kind of, or it's bad luck to break a mirror and that's it. You just have it and it doesn't make a big deal to you. That's harmless. On the other hand, if you're a superstition is such that, um, that you develop weird rituals you might have to do, um, to carefully walk so you don't step on any other on any cracks or you might have to do or if you do, you might have to go back and start your whole walk to work over again. When it gets to that level, it could creep into OCD and often obsessive compulsive disorders. Um, have a religious or a magical manifestation where you believe there's certain things you must do or terrible things will happen. And then that way you can view them as extreme and build from superstitions. But simple superstitions don't tend to be of that, of that type. Yes, I'm back.

Speaker 1:          33:19          The question is, are people with schizophrenia dangerous? Um, as a rule, statistically it tends not to be the case. They tend to be much more likely victims there then harmful. They tend to be fairly helpless. You can have a case where it's schizophrenia might harm somebody, a paranoid schizophrenia for instance. I might develop a delusion and harm somebody. Um, and so there are definitely such cases, but for the most part again or more victims, victims that, that then, then, then, oh, pressers, they're more, they're, they're very vulnerable because they aren't capable of dealing with other people. They often aren't capable of defending themselves.

Speaker 2:          33:58          Uh, one more. Yes.

Speaker 1:          34:05          The question is how permanent is the fact that the medication you mean for schizophrenia?

Speaker 1:          34:12          Yes, in general, I think, I can't think of any exceptions. Um, the, the, the effects of medication are temporary. Now that doesn't mean if you have a belt of OCD or depression, you have to be a medication rest of your life. What could happen is, um, for instance, somebody get a mild depression, go on something like Prozac or Wellbutrin, use that time to going to get their lives back together, cheer up a bit. And then when they go off the medication, they're fine. But as Professor Nolan huck cinema pointed out, unless they develop coping skills, they're likely to relapse and get the problem again. So the, the physical effects of medication are always temporary. We didn't leave anything that like schizophrenia, but it can often help people get out of a problem, anxiety or depression. Okay. Dissociative disorders. Um, I'll show you a movie clip and then we'll go back and talk a little bit about it. Let me ask a question that might seem somewhat uncaring. How many of you think he's faking? How many of you, how many of you are confident? There are many people living inside his head as in a way it's depicted.

Speaker 2:          35:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:35          How many of you were unsure? How many of you are of two minds? There's one part of you struggling. Let's, let's, let's go. We'll go back to him. Go back then. Dissociative disorder are disorders involving this association. And what people mean by that is literally at this Association of memory that is, um, you become somehow unaware, separated from pump part of your identity or history

Speaker 1:          36:12          and you're unable to recall those parts of your identity in history except sometimes under special circumstances. Now, some degree of dissociation is normal. There is, um, I will, I have here, um, Ben, um, actually Dr. Nolan Hok has excellent abnormal psychology textbook, a checklist of dissociative experiences, many of which normal people have not sure whether one has done something or only thought about it. Anybody ever had that common. Um, so involved in a fantasy that it seems real feeling as though one's body is not one zone. Um, I will also add that experience that experiments with pharmaceuticals can often lead to dissociative experiences. Um, driving a car and realizing that one doesn't remember part of the trip. Talking out loud to oneself when alone not recognizing one's reflection in the mirror. Okay. That's not very common, but it is, it's within a normal range is within normal range. Um, but then you get more severe cases. Um, and there's three different types. Dissociative Amnesia, dissociative fugue, and associative identity disorder. Dissociative Amnesia is illustrating a story of a woman who sees something terrible. And as a result, her memory of that experience was no longer accessible.

Speaker 3:          38:10          MMM.

Speaker 1:          38:12          It's often known as psychogenic amnesia. Uh, the only thing wrong and here's your memory loss. And sometimes it's a selective memory loss. Um, but sometimes it could be global. It says in these movie cases where you lose your memory because something terrible has happened and he would get it back later. But you have a temporary loss of identity. The idea is that something so terrible has happened. You separate yourself from your previous identity and your memory. Um, over half of people charged with homicide claimed to have some degree of dissociative amnesia. The problem here is that many, many, many of those cases involve alcohol and drugs, which can lead to some sort of alcoholic blackout. Um, also people could be lying if you're charged with murder is often a reasonable thing to say. I don't remember any of this. It just kind of as a way to distance yourself from it.

Speaker 1:          39:14          Dissociative fugue is kind of weird and interesting. Um, the guy's wife leaves him for another man. Six months later he was discovered tending bar in Miami beach and calling himself Martin and he totally wiped out his past memory and developed a new identity. Um, this is also known as psychogenic. Phew. So it's global amnesia, but there's also identity replacement. Um, you leave home, you develop a new identity and it's called a fugue state. This is, um, this is my favorite mental disorder. If I had to get a serious mental disorder, I would get this because I'd get to travel. Um, when it wears off, your old identity comes back and your new identities, forgotten vendors, dissociative identity disorder. Um, and this is a story of this woman who, um, goes back and forth from her regular personality to a personality a of Donna who was only six years old.

Speaker 1:          40:25          This was originally known as multiple personality disorder and ideas. You have two or more distinct people in one head. It is, it is a rare and controversial disorder, but include some very famous cases and has been, um, uh, illustrated in many movies and books. Um, Cleveland, a wonderful movie, primal, fair fear where Ed Norton's first big movie, highly recommended and it's been tried as a criminal defense. Um, the hillside strangler claimed to be two people, but he was still convicted, both of them. Um, it typically starts early. The pattern of dissociation. Mostly it's women and mostly it involves some sort of recollection of torture or sexual abuse. Also. And to get back to your question, can you have more than one, um, mental disorder? At the same time, people with dissociative disorder often show symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD.

Speaker 1:          41:28          What causes it? Well, it is often to be to cause caused by severe abuse, often sexual or physical abuse. The problem is most people who get abused don't develop dissociative identity disorder. And one idea is that, is that if abuse plus some sort of genetic or biological predisposition to dissociate, um, and in fact people with dissociative identity disorder seems to be very susceptible. They're easier to hypnotize and other people. And so it might begin as sort of a self, if not an act of self hypnosis. You put yourself in a hypnotic trance to cope with some terrible situation and you begin to develop new and separate and distinct personalities. Now of the many things I want to talk to you, I've talked, spoken about some of been very controversial. One issue of controversy which we talked about was the existence in nature of so-called repressed memories. This is another very controversial case related to the repressed memory case. Um, in a reason, Paul, less than one quarter of psychiatrists believe there is such a thing as associative identity disorder.

Speaker 2:          42:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:47          Why would you doubt that? Well, there's, I'm curious statistics between 1930 and 1960 there were two cases in the United States in the 1980s or 20,000 cases. You cannot go elsewhere from the United States and find people dissociative identity disorder. It seems to be an American phenomenon and it varies by therapists. Some therapists and need some hospitals. Some medical units go decades without ever seeing anybody at our approaches. Dissociative identity disorder, other therapists, virtually every patient they have has multiple personalities. One worry based on these faxes, dissociative identity disorder isn't a sense real that Richard really does believe he's moving from personality to personality, but he didn't come into therapy with that problem. Rather as therapists gave it to them. Um, the claim is that is the result of suggestion by the therapist, the therapist, and they're typically good people who wish to help. But the therapist might be in the grips of a theory involving repression and multiple personalities and different selves and encourage either tacitly or, or overtly their patients to develop these separate personalities.

Speaker 1:          44:10          Related to, this is not clear to what extent dissociative identity disorder is an extreme version of normal psychopathology, sorry, abnormal psychology. So people from the philosopher Dan Dennett to the psychologist Judith Harris have pointed out that were different selves in different, we can consciously play at the different cells, but we could also, um, just shift personalities depending on whether we're with our friends or our family or with strangers. The claim is that dissociative identity disorder, however dramatic it looks, might merely be an extended version of this where people as well are to some extent play acting to make their therapist and doctors happy. Any questions about um, dissociative identity disorder?

Speaker 2:          45:06          Yes.

Speaker 1:          45:12          Yes. Dissociative amnesia. The question that involves a relationship need associated Amnesia and the retro grade and Anterior Grade Amnesia discussed before those other amnesia. Is that a result of brain damage? Um, they tend to be, if not permanent, long lasting and severe dissociative Amnesia is apparently caused by specific life events and can often be very short lived there. Of course all brain events, but in a crude sense of dissociative amnesia was more of a psychological happening then the other sorts of Amnesia that we talked about in bombing course, the cops syndrome and the patient of h m and so on.

Speaker 2:          45:56          Other questions? Yes, and back.

Speaker 1:          46:08          Yes. What happened in 1960, there was a very famous case, I think the case was a case of civil. Does anybody know? Teaching fellers are nodding, but there was a very famous case which I think was up Sibyl which was made into a movie and discussed and had a huge influence on, on people. And then they started to believe that that it was real.

Speaker 1:          46:32          There's a, there's a type, the fourth and final type of disorder, um, is something which is not actually discussed in the great textbook, but it has to do with personality. And this is interesting because it probably extends to some extent too many of this people, the people in this room personality as you remember, is your way of dealing with the world in particular. In particular the way you have of dealing with other people. The notion of personality disorders, um, is that some personalities are so bad that they veer off into mental illness. So, um, one personality disorder is a narcissistic personality disorder. Everyone likes to talk about themselves and thinks they're terrific. This some extent, some people to a little bit too much, but if it's really extreme, they talk, they, you could get labeled with a narcissistic personality disorder. Um, you might have an avoidant personality disorder dependent, um, histrionic.

Speaker 1:          47:41          Borderline borderline is really bad. When people describe you as a borderline personality disorder, that just means you're just awful to be what you're kind of awful. Um, here's the paranoid personality disorder. Um, which is not that you're paranoid schizophrenia very clearly. No signs of schizophrenia, no. Uh, hallucinations, nothing like that. You just paranoid. You're just to a greater extent than normal. You think other people are against you and plotting against you. The most interesting personality disorders, um, in my mind have to do with violence and crime and they have to do in particular with something called antisocial personality disorder. Now, most murderers are not mentally ill in a medical sense. They're not mentally ill according to how clinicians categorize things. Um, to some extent, most people who kill are just normal people being driven by normal desires, rage, jealousy, hate, just taken to an extreme, even mass murderers do not as a rule appear to be substantively different from a psychological point of view.

Speaker 1:          48:57          Um, in every society. And, and honestly, I wrote, I wrote the lecture, the lecture on this quite a while ago, but given a reason to events, um, it, they sound is a perfectly good example of what I'm going to say. Um, in every society there's a notion of somebody who has been deeply humiliated, usually male, and he's been humiliated over and over again. He sees himself as losing status. And losing status and losing status. And he tries to get it all back to gain face with one act of terrible violence where he takes his revenge over everybody and then as known as, as an and as a result, even though he might die, he probably will die. Makes his way to, to, to, to a level of social status. You would've never, never gotten before. Um, the, the American term for this used to be going postal.

Speaker 1:          49:52          Um, and um, but, but this is an old idea. Stone-Age tribes in Papa New Guinea had a term for this, they call it running a muck. And this is in every society has this sort of, there's Matt, there's normal murders, there's mass murderers. And then there's the interesting cases like serial killers, like a daughter or son of Sam, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, even imaginary Hannibal Lecter. Many of these sort of serial killers do have some sort of mental illness, but the mental illnesses are all over the, um, there was a guy, I'm Jerome Rudolph, who had such a severe fetish for women's feet that he killed young women and separate their feet. And then kept their feet around his house. Um, son of Sam was pretty clearly a paranoid schizophrenic. He, he did his murders because a barking dog told him too. Um, I, Jeffrey Dahmer is a cannibal killer. He killed people so we could eat them. And then, and I asked one of my colleagues and clinical colleagues what exactly was wrong with him. And the person immediately responded. He has a severe eating disorder.

Speaker 1:          51:06          It was a joke. It was in very, very bad tastes. Um, a lot of, um, a lot of murders, claimed had dissociative disorders. It wasn't me who killed the guy. It was my alter ego, Fred. It's not clear how often they're telling the truth if ever or whether this is a way of escaping responsibility. There's a mental illness. Um, there's an extreme specific version of a personality disorder that revolves around violence. And this is known as antisocial personality disorder is it used to be called moral insanity now is often called psychopathy. Some people make a distinction between psychopaths and sociopaths. Um, for the purposes here, others don't. And for the purposes here, I'm going to blend them into one category is, and I'll use the term psychopath. They're typically male. Um, they are defined a selfish, callous, impulsive. You're sexually promiscuous. They seem to lack love, loyalty, normal feelings of affiliation and compassion and again to all sorts of trouble because they're easily bored and they seek out stimulation.

Speaker 1:          52:33          Now when you hear this, you got to realize that this sort of person is not necessarily an unattractive person to imagine or to think about or even under some circumstances to encounter. You have to avoid the temptation when you think about psychopath, to think about a guy like this, to think of a Hannibal Lecter. Um, the most famous psychopath of course is James Bond, who's a perfect psychopath in every regard as played by him and also by Sean Connery and Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton characters were not. Psychopaths could give a whole course on that. Um, is this an illness? Well, again, this is one of the hard cases. Psychopaths don't come in for treatment. James Bond would never go to a therapist and say, have a problem with promiscuity in my life of adventure. Why is it that I don't have this need to settle down and have kids and be a one woman man?

Speaker 1:          53:35          They don't have a problem with it. Um, other people often have a problem with it, but, but it's not clear that's enough to make it a mental disorder. Also, a lot of psychopaths are reasonably successful. Now this gets complicated because psychologists study psycho pass, but the psychopaths that they study are by definition unsuccessful psychopaths. And what some people have argued is the real psychopaths, the successful ones are the ones that run the world, that excel in every field because they are successful enough that they don't look like psychopaths. They have no conscience, no compassion, love, loyalty. They're cold blooded and ambitious, but they don't go around making it so obvious that we throw them in prison. And so it's an interesting and subtle and complicated case. Um, the final section and I'll start this and then we'll, we'll, we'll go five minutes into this and then move, continue at, uh, next week with the final class concerns therapy.

Speaker 1:          54:48          Now, the most interesting thing for us to deal with is the question of does therapy work. And there's a lot to be said about this. Um, the history of therapy has been gruesome and unsuccessful. Um, again, to be mad was to be viewed as to be in league with the devil. And so people who have mental illnesses were tortured to death, Burns, sent out to sea, and so on. In the 18th century, they were thought of as degenerates and sent away from society. In the 19th century there was a brief blast of compassion, um, where pinel tried to have mental hospitals. And then, um, and then there were all sorts of, since then, all sorts of medical treatments that were considerably less successful. And this brief video, we'll summarize some of the previous medical treatments.

Speaker 1:          55:43          I often wonder a hundred years from now, how am I going to look at our current therapies, um, and whether it will see them as equally barbaric and stupid as we look at the therapies in the past. Um, what I'll begin next lecture with is a very quick discussion of what therapies work, uh, of the ones currently available. And then we'll end the class and this will be somewhat short class. I end the class with a discussion of happiness. Um, there was an optional thing I'll add, which is, um, which is you're reading responses are done and you'll have the opportunity to make comments on the class in anonymous evaluations. But what I'm kind of interested in is if people could send me an email, and this is entirely optional, but the most interesting thing that we've covered in this class, I'm curious what people think it is. And it's something which I could try to build upon for future classes. So again, this is optional. Just give it a subject heading, intro, psych and send it to me if you choose to do it. And I'll see you on Wednesday.
