Speaker 1:          00:13          This class today is about language and language is to a large extent, um, where the action is. The study of human language has been the battleground over different theories of human nature. So every philosopher or a psychologist or humanist or neuroscientists who has ever thought about people has had to make some claim about the nature of language and how it works. I'm including here people like Aristotle and Plato, Hume, lock, Freud and Skinner. I'm also including modern day approaches to computational theory, cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary theory and cultural psychology. Um, if you hope to make it with a theory of what people are and how people work, you have to explain and talk about language. Um, in fact, language is sufficiently interesting that unlike most other things I'll talk about in this class, there is an entire field devoted to it. Study the field of linguistics that is entirely devoted to studying the nuances and structures of different languages.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Now, our first, before getting the details make a definitional point. When I'm talking about language, I meaning a systems like English and Dutch and wall Perri and Italian and Turkish and Urdu. And what we've seen and heard right now in class and a demonstration that proceeded, uh, the formal lecture. Um, now you could use language in a different sense. You could use no term language to describe what dogs do or with chimpanzees do our birds. You could use language to describe music, talk about immune musical language or art or any communicative system. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. There's no rule about how you're supposed to use the word language. But the problem is if you use the word language impossibly incredibly broadly, then from a scientific point of view, it becomes useless to ask interesting questions about it. If language can again refer to just about everything from English to traffic signals, then we're not going to be able to find interesting generalizations or do good science about it.

Speaker 1:          02:25          So what I want to do is I want to discuss a scientific notion of language at first restricting myself to systems like English and Dutch and American sign language and Navajo and so on. Once we've made some generalizations about language in this narrow sense, we could then ask and we will ask to what extent do other systems such as animal communication systems, um, relate to this narrower definition. So we could ask him this narrow sense, what properties do languages have and then go on to ask in a broader sense what other communicative systems also possess those properties. Well, some things are obvious about language. Um, so, um, here's, here are the questions we will ask. This will frame our discussion today. We'll first go over some basic facts about language. We'll talk about what language is share, we'll talk about how language develops and we'll talk about language and communication in nonhumans.

Speaker 1:          03:23          I began this class who have a, a demonstration of that that illustrates two very important facts about language. One is that language is all share some deep and intricate universals in particular. All languages at minimum are powerful enough to convey an abstract notion like this abstract in the sense that it talks about thoughts and it talks about our proposition and and, and, and spatial relations and objects. There is no language in the world that you just cannot talk about abstract things with every language can do this. But the demonstration also illustrated another fact about language, which is how different languages are. They sound different. If you know one language, you don't necessarily know another. It's not merely that you can't understand it. It could sound strange or or or look unusual in the case of a sign language. And so there any adequate theory of language has to allow for both the commonalities and the differences across languages.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And this is the puzzle faced by the psychology and cognitive science of language. Well, let's start with an interesting claim about language made by Charles Darwin. So Darwin rights man has an instinctive tendency to speak as we see in the babble of our young children. While no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew or right. And what Darwin is claiming here, and it's a controversial and interesting claim, is that language is special in that there's some sort of propensity or capacity or instinct for language. Unlike the other examples, he gifts, not everything comes natural to us, but Darwin suggests that language does well. Why should we believe this? Well, there are some basic facts that support Darwin's claim. Um, for one thing, every normal, every human society has language in the course of traveling. Cultures encounter other cultures and they often encounter cultures that are very different from their own.

Speaker 1:          05:36          But through the course of human history, nobody has ever encountered another group of humans that did not have language. Does this show that is built in? Well, not necessarily. It could be a cultural innovation. It could be, for instance, that language is such a good idea that every culture comes across and develops it. Just about every culture uses some sort of utensils to eat food with a knife and a fork, chopsticks a spoon. Um, this probably is not because use of, of eating utensils, it's human nature, but rather it's because it's just a very useful thing that culture is discover over and over again. Well, we know that this probably is not true with regard to language. And one reason we know this is because of the, the demonstrated, um, case studies where a language is created within a single generation. And these case studies have happened over history.

Speaker 1:          06:40          The client that the standard example is, um, people involved in the slave trade. The slave trade revolving around tobacco or cotton or coffee or sugar would tend to mix slaves and labors from different language backgrounds in part deliberately so as to avoid the possibility of revolt. Um, what would happen is these people who were in slave from different cultures would develop a makeshift communication system so they could talk to one another. And this is called a pigeon, Piv Gin, a pigeon. Um, and this pigeon was how they were talk and this pigeon was not a language, it was strings of words borrowed from the different languages around them and put together and sort of haphazard ways. The question is what happens to the children who are raised in this society? And you might expect it that they would come to speak a pigeon, but they don't.

Speaker 1:          07:35          What happens is in the course of a single generation, they develop their own language. They create a language with rich syntax and morphology and more and phonology terms that will understand in a few minutes. Um, and this language that they create is called a cradle and languages that we know now as creoles. Um, the word refers back to their history. That means that they were developed from pigeons. Um, and this is interesting cause this suggest that to some extent the ability to use and understand and learn languages part of human nature. It doesn't require an extensive cultural history rather just about any normal child even when not exposed to a full fledge language can create a language. And more recently there's been case studies of children who acquire sign language. Um, there was a wonderful case of Nicaraguan sign language, um, where they acquire sign language from adults who themselves are not versed in sign language.

Speaker 1:          08:37          They're sort of second language learners struggling along what you might've expected would be the children would then use whatever system they're adults use, but they don't, they creole lies it. They take this makeshift communication system developed by adults and again, they turn it into a full blown language suggesting that to some extent it's part of our human nature to create languages. Um, also every normal human has language. Not everybody in this room can ride a bicycle. Not Everybody in this room can play chess, but everybody possesses at least one language and everybody started to possess at least one language. Um, when they were a child. There are exceptions, but the exceptions come about due to some sort of brain damage. Any neurologically normal human will come to possess a language. What else do we know? Well, the claim that language is part of human nature is supported by neurological studies, some which were referred to in the chapter on the brain that you read earlier that talk about dedicated parts of the brain, um, that work for language.

Speaker 1:          09:52          And if parts of these brains as parts, if these parts of the brain are damaged, you get language deficits or or aphasias where you might lose the ability to understand or create language. Um, more speculatively. There has been some fairly recent work studying the genetic basis of language, looking at the genes that are directly responsible for the capacity to learn and use language. And one bit of evidence that these genes are implicated is that some unfortunate people have point mutations in these genes and such people are unable to learn and use language. So in general there was some support at least at a very broad level for the claim. That language is in some sense part of human nature. Well, what do we mean by language? What are we talking about when we talk about language? We don't want to restrict ourselves. For instance, the English or French.

Speaker 1:          10:50          What do all languages share? Well, all languages are creative and this means a couple of things. One meaning is the meaning, um, emphasized by Rene Descartes when Rene Descartes argued that we are more than merely machines. His best piece of evidence for him was the human capacity for language. No machine could do this because our capacity for language is unbounded and free. We could say anything we choose to say we have free will and in fact language allows us to produce a virtual infinity of sentences. Um, so we could create an understand sentences we never heard before and there are a lot of sentences. So if you want to estimate how many grammatical sentences under 20 words in English to answer is a lot. Um, and what this means is that any theory of language use and language comprehension cannot simply appeal to a list.

Speaker 2:          11:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:00          When you understand the sentence, I said you have to have the capacity to understand the sentence even if you've never heard it before. And this is because we get effortlessly produced and understand sentences that no human has ever said before on earth.

Speaker 2:          12:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:16          Would anybody volunteer to say a sentence non obscene, non derogatory but has never been spoken before on earth ever.

Speaker 2:          12:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:29          Here I'll, I'll start. Um, it's surprisingly easy to get a purple tie on Ebay if you don't care much about quality. I could imagine no one else in the world. He said this before. Um, I am upset that one cannot easily download Buffy the vampire slayer through iTunes. Now. Now there's possible somebody said both those sentences before. Um, but you probably have not heard them, but you understand them immediately. So how do you do it? Well,

Speaker 2:          13:06          okay,

Speaker 1:          13:06          you have rules, you have rules in your head. You've learnt what the words mean, but you have abstract and unconscious rules that take these words, figure out the order and in a fraction of a second give rise to understanding. And that's the sort of thing linguists study. So take some standard examples from the linguistic study of um, of English. And bear in mind, the rules we're talking about here are not rules. You explicitly know. They're automatic rules of the same sort we're going to talk about in the context of visual perception in that they're implicit and unconscious and not accessible to, to explicit understanding. Um, so for instance, um, immediately you read the pig is eager to eat versus the pig is easy to eat and then a fraction of a second, you know, there's an important difference. The pig is eager to eat means, uh, the state of affairs that we're talking about is when to pig does the eating the pig is easy to eat is when the pig is being eaten.

Speaker 1:          14:11          You see a sentence like, Bill knew that John liked him. And you know, without even knowing how, you know, did this can mean that bill knew that John Liked bill? Or it could mean that bill knew that John Liked, uh, Fred. But it can't mean that bill knew that John Liked John. The natural interpretation factors that bill knew that John like bill, the two words co refer. Contrast that with bill knew that John Liked himself, which only has to meaning. Bill knew that John like John, and this is what linguists do for a living. So if you hear me talking with them and say, I want to spend the next 40 years of my life studying that you should become a linguist. Um, but that's the sort of, those are the sort of phenomenon that we're interested in. Now it gets more complicated. Those are examples from syntax, but language has many structures.

Speaker 1:          15:06          Language has structures going from the bottom to the top, all languages, all human languages have phonology, which is the system of sounds or science morphology, which is a system of words or morphemes basic units of meaning and syntax which refer to rules and principles that put together words and phrases into meaningful utterances. And I want to talk briefly about each of these three parts of language before looking at some other issues. Um, I'm indebted here to Steven Pinker's excellent book, the language instinct, which provides I think a superb discussion of these phenomena. And I'm going to steal some of my examples from pinker. So phonology, phonology is the system of sounds that languages have. Um,

Speaker 2:          16:07          okay.

Speaker 1:          16:08          There's a subset, there's a list of finite list of possible sounds that language can use. I'm going to put aside for the moment the question of sign languages and how they work. We'll talk about them in a little bit. Um, the idea is that English has about 40 of these phonemes. So if you're a native monolingual speaker of English, you hear speech and each sound you hear is categorized as falling into one of those 40, um, morphemes sorry, phonemes. Um, so for example, English has a phoneme of Maror l and a phoneme of our, and so an English speaker can hear the difference between lip and rip and that corresponds to two different words in English. Other languages don't have that distinction. And so those, those distinctions are very difficult for non native English speakers to learn. So part of what goes on when you learn is you have to learn the language, um, the phonemes that your language has.

Speaker 1:          17:12          Um, another part of the problem of learning languages, you have to figure out what the boundaries are between the words. You have to use sound signals to figure out the boundaries between the words. Now that if the only language you've ever heard his English, that's going to seem like a really weird example of a problem because you're listening to me speak. And in between each of my words, you're hearing a pause. Don't have to be very smart to figure out where one word begins and one word ends. But the pause is a psychological illusion. If you were to talk into an oscilloscope that measured your sound, there are no pauses between the words. Rather the pauses are inserted by your mind, um, as you already know where one word begins and another one ends, and you insert a pause at that point, um, you could see this.

Speaker 1:          18:05          When you hear a language you don't already know. So for those of you who have never heard French before, when you hear somebody say [inaudible], you could say remarkable French has no pauses between words. Um, and you, and now a French speaker of course, hears Juna set par for Hebrew. I know one sentence in Hebrew, [inaudible] copy, AFO, habitual Mousse, which I think is a request for the bathroom. Um, but if you don't know Hebrew, there's no pauses. And the truth is when you each gave your demonstrations, nobody spoke properly because nobody spoke at, Oh, here's the, here's the sand glory, fennel, smug wiggle. Rather, you all sounded like Boobie, Boobie, Boobie, boobie without any pauses. Because I don't know your languages. Children come into the world without knowing any specific language. And so they have to learn, um, pauses. They have to learn to interpret sounds in context. Um, and sometimes they make mistakes, they get problems of segmentation. And there's some illustrations you could see the mistakes after trying to repeat back something that's already known within a society. So songs are a good example. These are excerpts from children. Um, I'll never be your pizza Vernon. Anybody know, pick her up with that corresponds to beast of burden. Very good. A girl have collitus goes by

Speaker 2:          19:37          somebody.

Speaker 1:          19:40          The answer, my friends that are blowing in the wind

Speaker 2:          19:46          and,

Speaker 1:          19:51          and this is a religious one. Our father was Barton Heaven. Harold be thy name lead us not into Penn station. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:59          Now phonological understanding illustrates all sorts of aspects of language processing and in fact of consciousness. Because remember I said that typically when you, um, when you hear a sentence you make, do you manufacturer in your mind gaps between the words? Um, typically when there's something which is unclear, you'll fill in the gap and figure out what the word is. And you'll hear it that way. So there's a few examples. The best examples again are for when it goes wrong. So classic example is from the Song Super Freak by Rick James. I got a big lecture of a copyright laws and, and this is going to violate most of them. Um, Rick James is going to be sitting on no at steering at the web two years from now saying, Hey, that's my thing. Okay. So I want you to listen to this line. I'm sure. I'm sure most of you have heard this before. Um, but I want you to listen closely. What was that last line? The kind of girl you read about?

Speaker 1:          21:18          Well, it turns out that nobody really knows. Um, and it sounds to many people who do top down interpretation as to meet as well, that she used to kind of go, you read about in Newsweek magazine, but that makes no sense at all given that you don't want to bring home to mamma and she's just not the end. In fact, if you check the notes on a song, she's in fact the kind of girl you read about in new wave magazines. Now when you listen to it, then again knowing that you hear it that way. Now this top down, this is known as top down processing, top down processing is an example of um, when you know what something is, you hear it that way. And this is extremely useful when it comes to filling in gaps, um, in, in, in the sounds, in normal conversation. If I'm just to say, I said endurance.

Speaker 2:          22:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:25          you won't hear that as it cough. Rather you hear a sentence, you fill in the gap. Um, this can lead to problems. The problem is led to in my life revolves around the song get crunk. Um, because because, um, I heard get crunk and, and um, my children asked me if I would buy them, get crunk from iTunes. My children are eight and 10 and now now get crunk. As I was aware from having heard it before, involves a consistent refrain of get crunk extremely bad word, get crunk extremely bad word. And so I said No. And then they said, well, there's a clean version of, so I downloaded the clean version. Um, unfortunately, knowing what the clean version, knowing what the word is means to me. The clean version is not very clean. Now I will add, I will add before people write letters and stuff. This is the clean version. Thank, thank goodness they took away that I've seen work.

Speaker 2:          23:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:40          So top down processing affects how we hear things usually almost always the better. And in fact, this is a theme we're going to return to next class when we talk about vision because the same thing's going to happen there. Um, how we see the world is often confusing and be fuddle. But what we know can clear things up. Same with sound.

Speaker 1:          24:07          Morphology is the next level up. Phonology is sounds morphology as words and human language uses this amazing trick, um, described by Ferdinand de. So sir, the great linguist as the arbitrariness of the sign. And what this means is we can use, take any arbitrary idea in the world, the idea of a chair or a story or a country and make a sound or assigned to connect to it. And the link is arbitrary. I mean you might choose to use the word for dog as wolf wolf cause it sounds like a dog, but you can't use a word for country that sounds like a country. You could use a sign language thing for um, for drink that looks sort of like the act of drinking, but you can't use a sign language word for country that looks like a country or for idea that looks like an idea. So way language has work is it allows for arbitrary naming. It allows for this map between a symbol, say a spoken word and uh, any sort of thought we want to use. And those arbitrary mappings as we come to learn them make up the vocabulary of a language.

Speaker 2:          25:24          MMM.

Speaker 1:          25:27          I'm talking about words, but the more technical term is morphine. And what a morpheme is, is the smallest meaningful unit in a language. Now often this is the same thing as a word. So dog is a word and dog is also a morphine, but not always because there a single morphemes. And then there are words that are composed of many more themes. So dogs and complained our one word, but to morphemes. And what this means is that you make the word by putting together two morphemes to put it differently. In order to know what dogs means, you never had to learn the word dogs. All you had to know is the word dog and the plural morpheme s and you could put them together to create a word. How many morphemes does the average speaker? Now, um, the answer is fairly startling. The average speaker knows as a low ball estimate about 60,000 words. I think the proper estimate is closer to 80,000 or 100,000. What this means, if you average it out, is that since children start learning their first words that about their first year of life, um, they about nine new words a day. And it's not a continuous, uh, nine words every day. It goes up and down depending on the age. But still the amount of words we know is staggering. How many of you know more than one language pretty fluidly?

Speaker 3:          27:02          Okay?

Speaker 1:          27:02          Those of you who know other languages might have in your heads 200,000 words or 300,000 words, and you're accessing them in a fraction of a second, it, it is legitimate, could legitimately be seen as one of the most astonishing, um, things that people do. Finally, Syntax. So we have the sound system of language, the phonology, we have the words of a language, their morphology, but all of that gives you his dog cup chair, House story, idea that won't allow us to communicate complicated ideas. So the final step in the story is syntax. And Syntax refers to those rules and principles that allow us to combine words into phrases and phrases and descendants and syntax uses another neat trick. And this is defined by Belheim von Humbolt as the infinite use of finite media. So here's the question. Your vocabulary is finite. There are just so many words. You have to learn them one by one,

Speaker 3:          28:12          okay?

Speaker 1:          28:12          But you could produce a virtual infinity of sentences. How can you do that? How can you go from a finite list of symbols to an infinite number of sentences? And the answer is you have a common editorial system. Now, language is not the only thing in culture or nature that has a sort of combination tutorial system. Um, music also has a common tutorial system. There's a finite number of notes, but a limitless number of musical compositions. DNA also has this sort of common tutorial system where you have a finite number of, I guess bases are amino acids that could combine to a possible infinity of strings, uh, of, of DNA strings.

Speaker 1:          29:04          So how does this happen? Well, infinity mechanism, and many of you will be familiar with this from mathematics or computer science is recursion. And there's a lot to be said about this, but it can be pretty simply illustrated in language. So here's an example of a simple language. It's not, it's actually close to how linguist described normal languages, but it's very simple. It has three nouns. Fred Barney and woman and two verbs thinks and likes the very simple language. And one rule. And the way to this rule is you make a sentence by taking a noun, any noun, putting a verb after it. And then following that verb with a noun. Now when you do this, how many? And then, so for instance, you get the sentence, Fred likes Wilma. When you do this, how many possible sentences are there? Can we just take a second?

Speaker 3:          30:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:07          Okay. Any guesses?

Speaker 3:          30:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:12          18. Um, the sentences are Fred likes Fred. Fred likes Marnie. Fred likes Wilma. Fred thinks red. Fred thinks Barney, Fred thinks woman. And so on the three nouns followed by any of the two verbs followed by any of the three nouns. That is not a very interesting language, but now take a more complicated language. Same vocabulary, the same three nouns, the same two verbs, the same sentence. But now one other sentence. This sentence expands to a noun followed by a verb, followed by a sentence. And there you get recursion. You have one rule invoking another rule, and then you can get a sentence like Fred thinks,

Speaker 3:          31:01          okay,

Speaker 1:          31:01          Barney likes woman,

Speaker 3:          31:04          okay.

Speaker 1:          31:04          And here you get a potential infinity of sentences.

Speaker 1:          31:09          And this is obviously a toy example, but you could see their use of recursion in everyday life in everyday use of language. You could say John hates cheese. My roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese. It disturbed Mary when I told her that my roommate, her roommate at John hates cheese. I was amazed at the disturbed Mary when I told her that. My roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese professor voluma devoted way too much of his lecture. Talking about how he was amazed at Mister mayor when I told her that, my roommate heard a rumor that John H, Jeez, it really bothered me that, and, and there's no limit. There's no longest sentence. You could keep producing a sentence deeper and deeper in bed until you die. Um, and this is part of the power of language. Now the syntactic rules are complicated and one of the puzzles of syntactic rules are, one of the issues of them is that different rules can conspire to create the same sentence. So you take a sentence like this is a classic line from Groucho Marx. I wanted to shot an elephant in my pajamas, Howard gone into my pajamas, I'll never know. And the humor such that it is, revolves around the ambiguity of rules that generate it like this versus like this often to illustrate issues of ambiguity, people have collected poorly thought out headlines in newspaper reports, um, that play on that, that, that inadvertently, uh, have ambiguity complaints of an NBA referees growing ugly. He says you really have that structure. Kids make nutritious snacks.

Speaker 1:          32:52          No one was injured in a blast, which was attributed to the bill of gas by one town official. Um, last, last summer I was in Seoul, uh, visiting the visiting Korea University and the big headline, their front page was general arrested for fondling privates. Um, now there actually is, there ambiguity is that is actually quite difficult to avoid in the construction and understanding of sentences. It's one of the, it's one of the ways in which is often difficult to write clearly. And in fact, there's a whole subfield of the law involving the use of linguistic theory to disambiguate sentences both in, um, in the constitution, in a, in, in, in legislation, in legislation as well as in some criminal cases. And there was several years ago a very serious criminal case that rested on a sentence. And here's what happened. There were two brothers, one of them retarded and they get into a robbery and a police officer sees them and points the gun at them.

Speaker 1:          34:08          And uh, one of the brothers points a gun at a police officer. The police officer shouts for the brother, the non retarded brother to drop the gun as she said, give me the gun. The retarded brother shouted, let him have it were upon to brother shot and killed a police officer. Now the brother had did the shooting was plainly a murder. What about that brother who showed it to let them have it? Well, it depends on what on, on how you interpret that sentence. Because this sentence is beautifully ambiguous. It could mean shoot him, let him have it or it could mean give him the gun. Let him have it. And in fact the trial, which I think somebody could, if people have the know about this, please send me an email. My understanding was he was found guilty. Um, but a lot to turn on the ambiguity of a sentence. I want to shift now and talk about where does all this knowledge come from, but I'll stop and answer any questions about material so far. What are your questions? Yes. Syntax. And the question is how is syntax different from grammar? They're exactly the same. Uh, syntax is a more technical term, but typically, but it means the same thing as grammar. Yes.

Speaker 3:          35:41          Every normal like normal human being is born. Others, that kind of language. How about, are there cases where people were born when they had the culture? Never really spoke life into them physically?

Speaker 1:          35:58          Yes. I'm glad. I'm glad you actually asked me about that because as I said it, I realized it wasn't quite right. The point that was just raised here is I had said before to everybody who's neurologically normal comes to acquire and learn a language. But what about people who are neurologically normal but they don't have language around them? And in fact, there's been historically some cases of this, um, there's been probably apocryphal stories about children who are raised by wolves or by dogs. There are stories, horrible stories summon that summon a 20th century about children who are locked away by insane or evil parents and who never learned to speak. There are stories of deaf people who are within certain societies where nobody signs to them. And so they're what's known as linguistic isolates and they themselves never learned to speak. Um, and those cases are the dramatic exception.

Speaker 1:          36:55          And they do tell you something. They tell you that it's not enough to have a brain for language. Somebody does have to use it with you. Interestingly, um, it doesn't have to be that many people. So as Susan Golden Meadow has studied deaf children that nobody signed to, but what she studies is deaf children with deaf siblings. And these children don't just sit there. They create their own language. It's not a full blown language like American sign language are long, the scene Quebecois. But it's a language. Nonetheless with words and syntax and phonology. It's an interesting question. Um, any other

Speaker 3:          37:35          questions? Yes,

Speaker 1:          37:56          it's a good question. The question is, are there inherent limits in our abilities to come up with grammars? And most linguists would argue yes, that languages are highly constrained in how they do things. So for instance, one example is, um, there's no language in the world that ever constructs a question by switching the order of words around in a sentence. Um, there's no language in the world that has a rule that says the fifth word has to be a verb. And linguists have all these conditions. They no language in the world works this way. Now this is, so these are on grammar and they're really interesting cause they tell us what's the human not humanly natural language versus what's not a humanly natural language. But notice even after it was incredible constraints on grammars still we could still produce an infinite number of sentences. It's just like if you restrict me to only a subset of numbers, only the odd numbers, um, still there's an infinity of odd numbers. So grammar can be restricted but still give rise to an infinity of possible sentences.

Speaker 1:          39:10          Well, there's a radical claim about the origin of language, um, associated with the guy who we met when we talked about behaviorism, who, um, who wrote the review of verbal behavior, the linguist, Noam Chomsky and Chomsky makes us radical claim. And this is that we shouldn't view language learning as learning at all. Instead we should view it as something similar to growth. So he says no one would take seriously to proposal. The human organism learns through experience to have arms rather than wings or did the basic structure particular Oregon's results from accidental experience. Language proves to be no less marvelous, an intricate and east physical structures. Why then should we not stay the acquisition of a cognitive structure like language, more or less as we study some complex bodily organ. So you might learn to play baseball, you might learn about the American civil war, but if Chomsky is right, you didn't learn to speak English. Rather, what happened is you hurting leash and and but the capacity grew in your head and something a lot more similar to the development of arms or legs or a visual system. Well, should we believe this?

Speaker 1:          40:24          We know there has to be some effect of the environment shaping language obviously because in order to know English you have to have heard English. In order to know Dutch, you have had to herd to add, to have learned and heard Dutch. And in fact languages differ in all the ways that we were talking about. Um, some languages like English has it have a distinction mean Ellen are other languages do not. Um, for language like English, that creature there is referred to with the morphine dog. That's a historical accident of English. In French it's shit. And then, and in Greek it's something else. And each of those 6,000 languages and people in a room who know other languages, they, yeah. In Vietnamese is this inner do, what is this in check? It's that.

Speaker 2:          41:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:15          Finally there's syntax. So English is what's known as a subject verb, object language. That means if you want to convey the idea that bill hit John, you would say bill hit John. But not all languages work that way. In fact, a majority of language is more languages, uh, are actually subject, object, verb languages. So you would say if you wanted to convey that bill was to hit her and John was hit bill John hit. All of this has to be learned and all of this has to be learned through exposure to language users. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the development of these language skills, um, in some way is similar to growth in a way that Chompsky suggests. So here's some basic facts about language development. One is something which I had mentioned before. Um, all normal children learn language.

Speaker 1:          42:21          There can be specific impairments of language. Now again, we spoke about them before when talking about the brain. Some of these impairments could be due to trauma. Um, the phase aphasias trauma, a bloated ahead, a stroke can read, you have your language, but also there are genetic disorders. Um, some falling under the rubric of what's known as specific language impairment, where children are born without the same ability as the rest of us to learn to speak. And these are interesting in many ways. One reason that they're interesting is that he illustrates something about human language. It is not, it would not be unreasonable for you to think before listening to his lecture. Look, all you need to, to have to learn a language is to be smart or all you need to have to learn a language is to want to communicate or all you need to have to learn a language is to be a social person wanting to, having the ability to understand others and deal with others.

Speaker 1:          43:28          But the cases, specific language impairments suggest that all of that is wrong because there are children in this world right now who are plenty smart who really want to communicate and who are entirely social creatures but they can't learn language. And this suggests that the ability to learn language and understand language is to some extent separate from these other aspects of mental life. Um, continuing on this theme, we also know that language is learned without any sort of feedback or training. Um, there are many Americans who believe that they need to teach your children language and there's a huge industry with DVDs and flashcards and all sorts of things, um, designed to teach your children language. And I think many parents believe that they didn't persist in using these things. Their children would never learn to speak. Um, but we know that that's not true.

Speaker 1:          44:28          We know this isn't true because there are communities, um, where they, um, they don't speak to their kids. They don't speak to your kids because they don't believe it's important to speak to their kids. Um, some linguists it would interview linguist would interview adults in these communities and say, why don't you speak to your babies? And these adults would respond. It is ridiculous to speak to a baby. The baby has nothing to say. You might as well just speak to your dog. And then the American linguist would say, yeah, we speak to our dogs. Um, Americans and Europeans speak to everything and everybody, um, other cultures are more picky and they don't talk to children until their children and themselves are talking. Um, this doesn't seem to make much of a difference in language learning. Some studies have motivated by Chomsky's work, um, in uh, in, in express, sorry, motivated by Chomsky's critique of Skinner's verbal behavior have asked even in what if we just looked at children within the United States?

Speaker 1:          45:36          Don't these, these children get feedback? And answer is yes and no. So your average highly educated Western parent does give their children feedback, do give their children feedback, um, based on what they say, but they don't typically give feedback based on the syntax or grammatical quality of what they say. Um, the example given by Brown and handling and the classic study in the 1970s, is they did all these studies looking at what children say and how parents responded. And it turns out parents respond not to the grammatical correctness, but to the effect or acuteness our associate ability of the utterance. So, for instance, um, if a child says to his mother, I loves you mummy, it's a very unusual parent who say, oh no, the verb agreement is mistaken. You've, you've added a redundant s uh, it is not appropriate. Um, similarly, if a child has to say, you know, I hate your guts, mother, it's an unusual mother.

Speaker 1:          46:44          That's wonderful. And subject, verb, object, the whole thing structurally fine. You know, we respond to our kids like we respond to each other based on a message that's conveyed not to grammatic Cali to utterances. Children make grammatical mistakes all the time, but then they go away and they go away without correction. So those are some basic facts. Um, what do we know about the time course of language? Well, early on, children's start off and they prefer the melody of their own language. Um, these studies were done in a, in France, um, we're four day old babies and what they did was they used a sucking method. Remember, there's a limited number of things babies can do it. One of the things they can do is suck and these babies would suck on a pacifier to hear French. Um, and they would prefer to hear French than to hear Russian.

Speaker 1:          47:40          And these investigators claim this is because they had been exposed to, um, to French in the first four days of their lives. Reviewers mostly from France objected and said, no, maybe French sounds better. Everybody kind of like French. Somebody redid this study in Russia. Russian kids sucked harder to hear Russian than he did to French. And what they're listening to isn't the words, they don't know words yet. They don't know how to syntax yet. It's the rhythm of the language. Um, for you. French and Russian sound different. Even if you're like me, you don't know word of either language. They still sound different. They sound different to babies too. And a baby being raised in France or a baby being raised in Russia knows enough to um, to tell what's his language and what isn't. Um, early on, children are sensitive to every phoneme there is. Um, so English speaking children for instance, can English speaking babies, babies who are born in the United States can distinguish between English phonemes like lip and rip, but it can also distinguish between phonemic contrasts, um, that are not exemplified in English such as phonemic contrasts and check or Hindi. Yes.

Speaker 1:          49:29          Gaggle and Kubek had a baby.

Speaker 3:          49:38          No, I mean it doesn't matter what you say.

Speaker 1:          49:49          There's, there's a lot going on in your question. There's a lot going on. Your question. Um, the question, the question was, um, your baby's going to crew and gag at Google. Doesn't matter if you coop and gag. I go back. No, it doesn't make a difference. Your hatred towards them was, was unmotivated. Um, you can be relieved of that debt. And I know you feel bad now I guess. Um, if you, if you speak to your children and perfect English, it's very strange. You know, nobody speaks to their babies and you know, no. Hello. Because I understand going. Okay. What changed your diaper right now since he's still, that's bad parenting sounds kind of silly. More than what most people do. Oh, you're such a cute little baby. Um, and it probably one, there's, there's evolutionary psychologists debate the function of why we talk funny to babies and some people have argued it does help their language learning.

Speaker 1:          50:51          Um, and some people have argued instead that what it does is it calms them. They like to hear the music of, of a smooth voice and so on. But whether or not you do so it doesn't need to make a big difference. It is very difficult to find any effects of how parents talk to their kids on how their kids learn language, particularly when it comes to babies. So early on, babies can are sensitive to old phonemes. Um, and then that goes away, uh, around 12 months of age. It goes away. This is one thing. You were much better that when you were a baby then you are now, when you were a baby, you were a multilingual for, you could understand the sound differences of every language on earth. Now if you're like me, you could barely understand English. You've, you, you narrow down to your sensitive just to the language you hear. And this narrowing down is largely in place by about 12 months of age. Around seven months is babbling and I want to stop at this point. To go back to the issue I promised you, I would turn a bit to sign language and I want to describe now a very elegant, I want to show a little film now, have a very elegant series of experiments looking at the question of whether babies who are exposed with sign language

Speaker 2:          52:20          babble.

Speaker 1:          52:24          One of the real surprising findings in my field over the last 10 20 years has been that the acquisition of sign languages as turned out to be,

Speaker 2:          52:36          yeah,

Speaker 1:          52:36          almost exactly the same. In fact, as far as we know exactly the same as acquisition of spoken languages, it didn't have to be that way. I mean, it could have been just as reasonable to expect that there'd be an advantage for speech over sign that sign languages may be full blown languages, but you know, they just take heart. They're just harder to learn because the brain and the body have adapted for speech. It turns out that this just isn't the case. It turns out that sign and at the developmental milestones of sign languages and the development milestones or spoken languages are precisely the same. They start babbling at the same point. They start using first words, first sentences, first complicated constructions. Um, there seems to be no interesting difference between how the brain comes to acquire and use spoken language versus a sign language. Around 12 months of age, children, um, started using their first words. These are words for, um, objects and actions like dog and op and milk. Um, they start showing some sensitivity to the order of words so they know that, you know, dog bites cat is different from cat bites. Dog Ran 18 months of age. They start learning words faster. They start producing little miniature sentences, um, like, you know, want cookie or milk spill. Um, and a function morphine's a little words in of the and so on. Start to gradually up here.

Speaker 3:          54:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          54:15          Then the, then there's the bad news. Um, around seven years of age, I'm going up through puberty. The ability to learn language starts to go away. Um, the best work on this has been done by Alyssa Newport and Samsung Holla, um, who have studied people who have been in the United States for many, many years, like 30, 40 years and seeing how well they have come to speak English. And it turns out the big determinant of how well you speak English as an immigrant isn't how smart you are. It's not how many family members you have when you're here. It's not your motivation is how old you were when you started. It turns out that if you start learning a language, a second language is where most of the work's been done within the first few years of life. You're fine, you'll speak like a native, but then it starts getting worse and worse.

Speaker 1:          55:13          And once you hit puberty, suddenly there's huge variation in the abilities you have to learn language. It is very rare. For instance, for somebody who has learned English passed puberty to speak without an accent, an accent is very hard to shake and it's not just an accent is also funnel is also other aspects of phonology, syntax and morphology. It's like the part of the brain that's responsible for language learning is only around early in development. Um, and if you don't get your language by then, um, it'll just run out. I want us to begin next class with this question.

Speaker 3:          55:55          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          55:56          The question of animals and that will shut down the language learning part. But one thing

Speaker 3:          56:01          put up here is your second reading response.

Speaker 1:          56:10          I'll also put this up on Wednesday and by Wednesday you might have a bit of a better cause it be in a better position to answer this question, but I'll continue with language on Wednesday and then we'll also talk about vision, attention and memory. I'll see you then.
