Speaker 1:          00:12          I am extremely pleased to introduce the fourth and final lecture of the semester. Uh, uh, uh, the director, he is well known or worked in medical psychology and especially to research depression, the major and complete with a special focus on, uh, uh, can do [inaudible] and it has author what in my mind is the very best textbook in her area. And um, and she's a, she's a popular writer or an acceptable books reading the message and ideas and go. The other thing I'll mention before we welcome her if that he's going to teach next year record [inaudible] they call it. We've had it for reputation. If you are and what you hear today, you want to learn more about it. Um, that's the question. It please welcome Dr. Norman. Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:37          Thank you Paul. Can everybody hear me okay? Okay. So what I want to do today is to give you a very brief overview of how modern clinical psychology looks at mental disorders. Some of the ways we think about what constitutes a mental disorder, some of the characteristics that kind of cut across mental disorders. And then I'm going to use the case of mood disorders that is depression and what is now called bipolar disorder or what you may know more popularly as manic depression, as sort of examples of how we think about a particular set of disorders. And some of the ways we go about researching the theories, uh, different theories for the disorders and some of the prominent treatments for disorders these days. Okay. So I'm going to do both, um, a fair amount of, of uh, lecturing. And then I've got lots of video clips, uh, to show you as well. So I'm going to be roaming around and changing venues here apparent fairly often.

Speaker 2:          02:37          So the first and most fundamental question in clinical psychology is what is abnormality? Where do we draw the line between normal, healthy, typical behavior and what we might want to call abnormal, a typical deviant, unhealthy, maladaptive mental problems. We tend to have an intuitive sense of what we mean by abnormality. And we'd like to believe a lot of people who come into my course. I will, of course, you know, you guys have figured it out. You know where to draw the line, you have criteria, you have blood tests, right? That tells me whether I have depression or schizophrenia or one of the things I've read about, well the reality is that that we don't, um, first of all there is no biological test for any of the known mental disorders right now. Um, and instead what we have are a set of behavioral criteria for how to diagnose different mental disorders.

Speaker 2:          03:38          And what I mean by behavioral criteria is a set of symptoms that the person reports to you about how they feel, how they think, and a set of observations about their behavior and how typical or atypical it is. And you take the sort of set of symptoms, the person shows her reports and you match them up against the existing criteria for different mental disorders. And then it comes down to a fairly subjective judgment call about whether the person meets the criteria or not. Unfortunately, these judgment calls because they are so subjective, can be influenced by a lot of factors. And we won't have a chance to go into these, uh, too much today. But just to highlight a few of them. Um, the first is social norms. Whether you get labeled as having a mental disorder or a problem depends very heavily on what your, um, social or cultural norms are.

Speaker 2:          04:35          So, uh, a woman wearing a veil in a Muslim community or culture would be seen as typical, even prescribed behavior, whereas a woman wearing a veil in a non Muslim culture and especially until fairly recently was, was often looked upon as very atypical or abnormal behavior. The second kind of thing that gets a, that influences whether something is called normal, abnormal are certain characteristics of the target person in particular I've highlighted here gender, um, whether you're a man or you're a woman really influences how unusual a certain behavior is. So crying is a good example. Uh, a man crying in our culture is seen as fairly unusual, whereas a woman crying as seeing as much less unusual. On the other hand, a woman beating up someone is taken as quite unusual behavior where it's less unusual for a man. So we have gender stereotypes, gender roles, um, for what is acceptable behavior and our judgements as to whether something is normal or abnormal, um, get influenced by those gender roles.

Speaker 2:          05:51          And the third thing that can influence whether something is labeled abnormal or not is the context. And here I'm giving you the example of paranoia. If you're paranoid and hyper vigilant looking for threat in downtown Baghdad, that's considered very adaptive behavior these days because it could prevent you from getting hurt or killed. Whereas if you're in a quiet little farm town, I'm in central Connecticut being extremely paranoid and, and believing there's, um, someone who's going to shoot you around the corner, uh, is not considered, um, as, as normal or as acceptable or adaptive behavior. So the context in which you exhibit a particular behavior also can, can heavily influence whether it gets labeled by others as normal or abnormal.

Speaker 2:          06:42          In the field of clinical psychology, um, we have a number of different ways, kind of heuristics that we use to, uh, label things as, as abnormal or unhealthy or troubling. And, um, three of these characteristics are that what we often call the three D's distress, dysfunction and deviance. So behaviors that caused the individual, um, or others significant distress are often getting, often get labeled as abnormal or unhealthy. Depression is a prime example as we'll see when we talk about the characteristics of it. It's a miserable state of being your urine happy. You're sad, you may even feel so badly you want to kill yourself. And that very, very high level of distress, um, is part of the reason why it's labeled as a mental disorder. Other mental disorders don't call the cause of the individual and distress, but they may cause other people distress. So, um, one example of this is something called antisocial personality disorder where the individual has no regard for the rights of other people.

Speaker 2:          07:51          Um, has, uh, no hesitation to steal or, or steal from or hurt other people. Um, has no empathy or sympathy for other people's feelings and so can inflict a lot of harm on other people and has absolutely no distress over this whatsoever. But his behavior causes other people distress. And that's one of the reasons why that's labeled an abnormal behavior or a mental health problem. The second general criterion is dysfunction. If, um, a set of behaviors prevents the person from functioning in daily life, then uh, it might be labeled as, as abnormal or might end up being labeled as a mental health problem. Again, depression is a good example. People who are depressed often become completely nonfunctional. Um, they can't get up and go to class. They can't go to work, they can't interact with their friends. They withdraw and become totally isolated socially. Uh, so they might lose their job, they might flunk out of school and there's complete, um, a decline in functioning is one of the major reasons that we consider depression, one of the most debilitating disorders. And then finally, deviants. Um, the behaviors or feelings are highly unusual. This is probably the most controversial of the three because it weighs a, uh, it is so heavily influenced by the social norms. What's deviant in one culture is not deviant, um, in another culture. But if a set of behaviors are completely unacceptable to a culture, highly unusual, they're more likely to end up getting labeled as abnormal.

Speaker 2:          09:39          Okay. So how do we pull this all together? Well, these days, um, the manual for making diagnoses in clinical psychology and psychiatry in the United States is called the diagnostic and statistical manual or the DSM. Um, and it's in its fourth revision. It's been around since the, I believe that fifties. And the early additions in the fifties and sixties were highly subjective and based on 40 and theory. But since 1980, there's been a real effort to make the criteria much more objective to make the set of behaviors or observations that are required to diagnose someone being things that, that are observable, that you can see in other people that they can report on reliably and that, um, one clinician, uh, and another clinician will agree upon. So the DSM gives lists of symptoms with the required symptoms for a diagnosis, the number of symptoms they have to be present and the notions of deviation, dysfunction and distress are built into these criteria.

Speaker 2:          10:50          And we're going to give you a couple of examples of these criteria when we talk about this specific types of mood disorder. So there's a, I'm going to use mood disorders as a kind of a case example here of how we go about diagnosing and understanding psychopathology. Um, but I also just want to impart some information because mood disorders are one of the most common problems that people face. As many as a one in four women will have an episode of a serious depression at some time in her life and about 13% of men will have an episode of serious depression in their lives. So these are extremely common. Um, kinds of problems that people experience, uh, particularly at your age. Um, the college years are one of the peak times of onset, first onset of, of depression in particular, and also for bipolar disorder or manic depression.

Speaker 2:          11:45          Um, the late adolescent, early twenties are the peak onset time for these disorders as well. So the mood disorders divided into what's called unipolar depression or disorders, which is depression only. And then bipolar disorders where the person's cycles between depression and mania. And here are the DSM criteria for major depression. Um, one of the most severe forms of depression. And as I said, the DSM sets up these relatively observable criteria and how many have to have and what absolutely has to be present in order to get the diagnosis. So the first criteria in the DSM, uh, for major depression is that the individual has to either show sadness or a diminished interest or pleasure in their usual activities, which is referred to as Anhedonia. So you have to have one or the other of these two sort of past the first criterion. So you might say that you feel sad and blue and, um, just, uh, or, or actually say you feel depressed.

Speaker 2:          12:51          Some people feel those, those feelings very strongly. Other people don't really feel so sad or blue, but what they'll say is that nothing interest them anymore. It's like the emotion has been sucked out of their life all together. Um, they don't have any fun doing the activities they used to do before. They don't want to hang with their friends. Um, they just, they don't care about eating. Uh, just nothing feels right, feels good anymore, and then the individual has to have four of the, at least four of the following symptoms in addition to sadness or hand Hedonia first they can show significant weight or appetite change. Um, so you may completely lose your interest in eating and lose a lot of weight or some people go on eating binges. I had a very good friend who was depressed for about a year and she gained 50 pounds because she would just eat. Um, she would binge eat, especially at night. There are sleep disturbances, um, insomnia, which is having trouble sleeping or hypersomnia, which is sleeping all the time. There's a particular form of insomnia that's especially likely and depression where you can go to sleep at night when you wake up at about three or four in the morning every night and you can't go back to sleep at all. You're just up for the rest of the night.

Speaker 2:          14:13          But other people want to sleep all day long. And in the clip I'm going to show you in just a minute, the woman talks about sleeping 20, 22 hours a day. Getting up, eating a little bit, and then going back to bed because she was exhausted still. Um, the third criterion is psychomotor retardation or agitation. The retardation is much more common. And what this means is that sort of everything about the person's movement has slowed down. They'll walk more slowly, their reaction times will be slowed down. Um, and because they're so much more slow moving, a depressed people are often more prone to accidents. They just can't react as quickly as they need to when they're driving or when they're crossing the road and a car is coming at them suddenly. Um, so that, so they get into more accidents. Um, and their speech may be slowed down. They may talk very, very slowly. And it's as though it just takes a tremendous amount of energy to get even a common sentence out,

Speaker 2:          15:19          uh, much more, uh, much smaller number of people get agitated instead of slow down. Um, they may be hyper and, and just feel like they can't sit still and such. But the agitation is a much more rare than the retardation. Um, people feel really tired, fatigued and like they have absolutely no energy. They can't get up and can't get moving. Um, as I said, they may want to just sleep all of the time. A number five is feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt. They may feel as though everything is their fault. Um, and the guilt, feelings or sense of worthlessness can even get psychotic. They can lose touch with reality. When a person loses touch with reality, when they're depressed, it typically has really depressing themes. They may believe that they are, um, Satan and that they have to commit suicide because they're in flipping evil on the world. Um, they may believe is a though random events or their fault, you know, that that a flood that just happens somehow they caused. Um, so the, the feelings of worthlessness and guilt can get out of completely out of touch with reality psychotic more commonly. They are just unrealistic. Um, they're negative self esteem, just being down on yourself, um, feeling stupid and worthless and ugly and bad.

Speaker 3:          16:45          Okay.

Speaker 2:          16:46          Number six, a diminished ability to concentrate or in decisiveness. Um, when you are depressed, it's really hard to pay attention. You'll read a passage over and over again and it just can't process it at all. Um, you can't concentrate on a lecture, so going to class is just useless. You have to make a decision about what a paper topic is and it just seems like the most monumental thing on earth. Um, you just can't decide anything. You can't think anything. Your thoughts are completely clouded and overwhelmed.

Speaker 3:          17:20          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          17:20          And then suicidal ideation or behavior, it means you think about committing suicide. You think about dying and a subset of people actually take action to try to hurt themselves or kill themselves. Now it should be said that suicidal thoughts and behavior don't only happen in depression, they actually happen, um, in all types of psychopathology, but there are particularly common in depression. So you have to have at least one at, uh, four of those plus sadness or Anhedonia and the symptoms. It can't just be a bad day that you're having. These symptoms have to be present persistently for at least two weeks to get the diagnosis. Now, truth be told, most episodes of major depression actually lasts a lot longer than two weeks. In fact, the average length of an episode, if it's not treated, it's at least six months. So, um, people stay this miserable for a very long period of time. Uh, but the minimum criterion in the DSM is at least two weeks. So why don't want to do is to just show you a short clip of a woman who has had a lot of episodes of depression. Fortunately at the moment she's not in an episode, um, but she can speak very articulately about what it's like to be in the midst of an episode and some of the significant symptoms that she had.

Speaker 2:          18:45          Okay. There are a couple of things she talks about that I just want to comment on. One is this, this differentiation between every day sad mood and the kind of depressions we all experience and the kind of debilitating, overwhelming depression that she experiences. And it is true that there is this continuum from um, getting bummed out because you didn't do well on a test or because you broke up with him boyfriend or girlfriend or something like this and being completely nonfunctional vegetative, um, the way that this, this woman becomes whenever she gets depressed. Um, and it would be nice if we were really sure where the cutoff was between those normal everyday depressions and what's really a disorder. But the reality is we don't, we don't really have real clear demarcation lines. There are a lot of people who have more moderate forms of depression then Tara here talks about, but who still would qualify for a diagnosis and are still suffering and impaired by their symptoms.

Speaker 2:          19:49          So I don't want you to get the sense that that if you don't have the kind of horrible version, I'm on the extreme end of the continuum of depression that Tara has, then there's nothing wrong with you because that's not the case. Um, people who are, are really slowed down who their functioning is, is interfered with. They're just really unhappy with life. Um, uh, have problems that can be, can be helped and do need attention. And it is the case that much more moderate forms of depression can morph into more serious forms if they're left and treat it. So there is this continuum. The other thing I wanted to comment on that she talks about it early on in this piece is, um, the fact that she hauls herself up and goes through her day even when she's feeling really, really depressed. And there is this characteristic of a lot of depressed people, um, that I call the walking wounded.

Speaker 2:          20:43          Uh, they, they just haul themselves through the trying to act normal, trying not to let anybody know that there's anything wrong with them. I'm trying to keep up with their schoolwork or their work, um, their employment, but, but they're miserable and they're not functioning at the level that they're capable of and such. And that's something that's very, very common and it's in part because, um, people don't feel as though they should have to get treatment or they're ashamed of getting treatment or seeking help for depression. And so they just keep going on and going on. Sometimes for years, I'm in a very sorry state, uh, before sometimes they just, they end up actually falling apart to the point where they have to get help.

Speaker 2:          21:30          Okay. Um, the other category of mood disorders that I mentioned are bipolar disorders. And as I said, bipolar disorder involves symptoms, uh, or periods of depression, but then also distinct periods of the opposite of depression, which we call mania. So the person's cycles back and forth between debilitating depressions and manic episodes. So let me describe manic episodes to you now. So the first criterion is that instead of feeling down blue or depressed, the person has an abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood that isn't just, again, a good day because you won a prize or got an a, but rather it's this unusually positive, expansive mood for at least one week persistently. And then the person has to have three or more of the following symptoms. First inflated self esteem or grandiosity. The individual may feel as though they are the smartest, the most, um, uh, created insightful, powerful person on earth.

Speaker 2:          22:40          And they are perfectly happy to tell you this. Um, so there is no problem with self esteem. Thank you very much. If you can't keep up with me, it's your fault. Okay. Um, there's a decreased need for sleep. They may only sleep a couple of hours a night and get up raring to go. Um, they tend to be more talkative than usual and there's a real pressure to their talk. They'll talk really pressured and they'll talk really, really fast. And they're one of the reasons we're talking really, really fast as they have this flight of ideas. The thoughts are just racing through their mind and they can't talk bathroom, I have to get them out. And if you can't follow them that well, that's because you're not smart enough to follow them, but they've just got too many good ideas and they got to get 'em out, you know, highly distractible.

Speaker 2:          23:21          And then, um, there is this increase in this weather what the DSM causes, goal directed activity out of the grandiosity will come these grand schemes for often for making a lot of money. Um, and they'll pursue these with great vigor no matter how totally irrational they are. So it's not at all uncommon for them to cash out all the family bank accounts to sell the house, to sell the car, to sell the kids so that they can finance this great scheme for making a zillion dollars on the Internet tomorrow. Right. Okay. So, and they'll pursue this with tremendous, bigger, they'll also get involved in all kinds of, with the DSM discretely calls pleasurable, but the dangerous activities. Um, there's a lot of sexual promiscuity, a lot of drug abuse, a lot of, um, um, uh, as I think getting, uh, going and gambling, believing that you're on a hot streak, there's nothing can stop you.

Speaker 2:          24:19          You know, you're just, you're just so brilliant. He got the scheme, you got to plan, you're going to, you're going to make it. Okay. So the individual has three or more of these kinds of symptoms, uh, plus this elevated, expansive, and often quite irritable mood. It's not just they're happy, you know, and sort of upbeat. It's just that they're just impatient and irritable and trigger fire. And sometimes they can become violent because they, they're just, they're so incredibly agitated and irritable. So let me show you a couple of clips. I have one really short one. It's not a real high quality clip, but it's a very, very nice example of an older woman who was in the midst of a manic episode and it shows how, what this kind of agitation and flight of ideas and, and racing thoughts, um, can look like. And then the other one is, is all introduced whenever we do.

Speaker 2:          25:16          So, um, while she was at the hairdresser, it was, it's, it's a nice example of how she just pressured to speak. Nobody was telling her that she had to say all of these things. They were just standing there with the camera and she was going on and on and on about these things. Um, and as you can see, she was getting more and more agitated and more and more irritated, um, as she was retelling our story. And then, um, what, uh, uh, in the last little bit there, you saw her flip from Romania into a more depressed state. And, um, this, this poor lady unfortunately, uh, is having a hard time finding a stable point. He talked about lithium there and I'll talk about it in a little bit about the use of lithium as a drug to try to stabilize these mood swings. Um, but at this point in this video, it's not working for this lady and so she's, she's flipping back and forth. Um, but they're having a hard time finding that middle ground. So I want to show you another clip. It's a little bit longer of a man who has bipolar disorder and he is not currently in an episode of either depression or mania. Um, but again, he can talk about some of the things he got himself into and how it manifested in his behavior.

Speaker 2:          26:31          Okay. Uh, just a couple of things that Bernie talks about that I want to comment on. One is that just as in depression, mania has, uh, runs along a continuum, so it can be relatively mild, um, all the way to extremely severe and even psychotic. So when a person with mania loses touch with reality, instead of having, um, uh, beliefs that they are Satan or some whore, they've done some horrible thing, they'll believe that they are some supernatural being. Um, they may believe that they are the Messiah or that they are Albert Einstein, you know, come back to live or that they have supernatural powers or something of this sort so that there, there are false beliefs, their delusions and their hallucinations and things that they see in here that aren't really, there tend to be a very grandiose in their themes. Bernie's MMA mania is not on the far end of the continuum by any stretch, but you can see it still gets him into trouble.

Speaker 2:          27:36          Now, there are people who have, who cycled between fairly low levels of mania and fairly low levels of depression back and forth. And there's been some argument that, um, people who are kind of chronically mildly manic, especially if they're really smart or they have a special talent, can make it work for them. Um, and there, uh, is a wonderful book by Kay Jamison, who's a professor at Johns Hopkins, um, where she chronicle. She does sort of historical, um, die biographies on a number of a well known, um, uh, authors and poets and musicians, Robert Schumann, um, uh, and a number of politicians, uh, Winston Churchill and such arguing that they actually had mild forms of bipolar disorder and, uh, that they were able to sort of channel the manic episodes through extraordinary talent or intelligence, um, in ways that made it work for them. They're also the number of arguments that, that, um, very, very successful CEOs sometimes are people who are chronically slightly manic.

Speaker 2:          28:48          Um, they can go on to a couple of hours a night to sleep. They're obviously really quite grandiose and self confident and that they can maintain this kind of moderate level of mania. I keep it under control and channel it in ways that works for them. Uh, so if you're interested in that book, uh, send me an email and I'm happy to send you the citation for it. But for the most part, um, mania can get people into tremendous trouble. Um, they, they can, as I said, get involved in sexual promiscuity that puts them at risk for sexually transmitted diseases. They can get involved in drug activity. Um, they get themselves arrested. They can certainly send themselves and their family into bankruptcy. Um, and these kinds of negative consequences of the mania often are what motivates the person to get help because the media itself can be rather pleasurable to have.

Speaker 2:          29:42          Um, also what motivates them to get help is the plunge into depression. Uh, the knowledge that they will at some point come out of the mania and go into a debilitating depression. Bipolar disorder is much less common than depression. I said that about 22% of women in about 13% of men will have an episode of serious depression at sometime in their lives. Um, uh, bipolar disorder occurs and only about 1% of the population and it's equally prevalent in women and men. So it's a really quite different disorder in many ways. Um, from a depression alone. I'm gonna give you some other statistics about depression per se. And this is, this only applies to depression. There are quite large age differences in the prevalence of of depression. These are data from a nationwide study of people between the ages of 15 and 55 and these are the percentage of people in the, in this study.

Speaker 2:          30:43          And there were several thousand people in this study. These are not people who have sought treatment for depression, but just a random community sample. And this is the percentage. You've had an episode of major depression in the past month. And as you can see, um, the 15 to 24 age range is, has the highest rates and then they go down some white. All of the 35 to 44 is fairly high as well with age. Um, you might be surprised to learn that the rates of major depression in the elderly are actually quite low by most national statistics. Um, and uh, that's true up to about age 80 or 85. But, um, and, and the arguments for why this is the case are very interesting. There are some people who argue that as you get older, you get wiser. And so that's, that's why we see a lower rates of depression in older age.

Speaker 2:          31:39          There are other people who argue that current generation, younger generations now your generation and, and the one above you are more prone to depression and will be for the rest of your life compared to your grandparents because of historical changes in the kinds of social support and family networks available. Um, and, and a number of other historical cultural changes. The other sort of side of the argument is that because depression is known to um, uh, impact negatively, your physical health, depression is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, immune system diseases, a whole host of diseases that people die from, that people who have a lifelong history of depression are actually more likely to die at an earlier age. And that's why we see relatively low rates in older age people. We don't know yet which of these explanations is true. It may be that they're all true to some extent.

Speaker 2:          32:38          There are gender difference and in depression, um, these are data from a compilation of, of hundreds of studies of children and adolescence looking at a, not full blown depression, but levels of depression on self report questionnaires. Probably most of you have filled out these questionnaires like the Beck depression inventory that ask you how, how you've been feeling in the last month. And there's a kitty version of this and these are data from that from several thousand children. And as you can see here, prior to the age of about 13 boys and girls have relatively similar or levels of depression. But beginning around the pubertal years, girls rates and depression go up quite dramatically and boys rates stayed the same or go down. And by the time they're 18 or 20, you get almost a two to one ratio of depress girls to depress boys. And, and this is true for the rest of the adult age span.

Speaker 2:          33:38          Uh, there are lots of hypotheses about this, uh, why it's true. There are biological hypotheses that have to do with hormones. There are sociological hypotheses that have to do with the kinds of stress and particularly abuse in girls' lives relative to boys. We don't know exactly why. It's probably a lot of these things coming together that make this huge two to one ratio. True. So let's talk a little bit about the major theories and treatments for the mood disorders. There are biological theories and treatments, what are known as cognitive behavioral theories and treatments and an interpersonal theories and treatments. And I'll walk you through examples of each of these. So first genetics, it's pretty clear that genetics are involved in the mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder. There is, there's very strong evidence in bipolar disorder and there's a number of ways. Um, have you talked about how you do genetic studies?

Speaker 2:          34:39          Okay, so you guys know, uh, about twin studies, for example, um, and family history studies. So this is actually a compilation of a group of studies. Um, and here you've got some of them, twins studies compared. So in monozygotic twins, if you're identical, twin has bipolar disorder, you have over a 60% chance of having the disorder yourself. In contrast, if it's your, if you're just a fraternal twin of a person with bipolar disorder, you only have about a 12% chance of having the disorder. So that Nath of difference, there is very strong evidence that there's a genetic component to the transmission of the disorder. Similarly, the more distance you get in terms of, um, your biological relation to a person with bipolar disorder, the lower your rate or your risk of the disorder is. So, um, the second degree relatives, uh, the person with bipolar disorder only have about a 2% chance of getting the disorder and that's barely above what's in the general population, which is about a 1% chance of getting the disorders.

Speaker 2:          35:51          So, um, it's very clear that bipolar disorder has a genetic component to it with depression alone, a major depression. Uh, there are probably versions of the disorder that have a stronger genetic component to it than others. And in particular, um, folks who have what's called early onset depression where their first episodes come on in childhood or very early adolescence, um, seem to have a form of depression that has a stronger genetic component to it. Whereas people who have depression that is clearly triggered by a major life event, like a trauma or a loss, those types of depression or less clearly linked strongly to to genetic factors.

Speaker 3:          36:39          Okay.

Speaker 2:          36:40          There are also a number of neurotransmitters that have been implicated in the mood disorders and the class of neurotransmitters that's been researched most often are what's called the Mano lambings. I'm sure you've heard about the link between Serotonin and depression, but there are two other monoamines a norepinephrine and dopamine that have also been linked to, um, to that both of the mood disorders, both bipolar disorder and um, uh, depression. And it used to be thought that it was just that in people with depression, they didn't have enough of these, a neurotransmitter's enough serotonin in particular, um, in the system in the brain, um, in order to, uh, function normally. Uh, but now the theories on what the role of neurotransmitters are, have a lot more to do with the receptors for these neurotransmitters and their functioning. And the notion is that the receptors for neurotransmitters like Serotonin don't function efficience. So even if there's enough of the, the chemical in the synapsis in the brain, the neurons can't make use of them because the receptors aren't functioning appropriately. And so what the drugs that help relieve depression too is to improve the functioning of these neurotransmitters.

Speaker 2:          38:05          There's a very interesting line of work that's going on right now looking at the intersection of genetic predisposition, neurotransmitter functioning and stress. Um, and we have one of the world's experts on this kind of work now here at Yale, Julia Kim calling, uh, who just joined us in the last year. But there are several recent studies. There's another person in psychiatry, Jon Kaufman, um, who's done some of this work. But there are several recent studies that find that certain variations or polymorphisms on the serotonin transporter gene predict who will become depressed, depressed in the face of stress. So the classic study was done by Avshalom Caspi and colleagues and they found that people who have a one or two of what's called the short ilial on the serotonin transporter gene. So this is a particular, a variation on the serotonin transporter gene. If they had one or two of these short illegals, um, and they were confronted with stress, they were more likely to develop, I'm sorry, these are these to develop depression.

Speaker 2:          39:16          But um, it's important to sort of dissect this. So people who had it didn't really matter which of these genes you had. Um, if you were never confronted with major kinds of, of stress like maltreatment, um, if you weren't confronted with stress, the you were no more likely to have depression, uh, regardless of what kind of of a Serotonin Jeanne you had. But if you had either a one shorter lel or too short illegals and you were confronted with maltreatment as a child, you had a much greater probability of becoming at some time in your life. And this has been replicated with other samples, with other forms of major trauma. And basically the story is it takes the intersection of a genetic predisposition and major stress to create full blown depression in some people. Now that may not be true for all genetic predispositions are all forms of depression. Uh, but this serotonin finding is actually been replicated now in at least four different studies. So it seems to be a, a pretty reliable effect. So it again, genes do not determine, um, the disorder, but the intersection of genes and stress, um, seem to be a major risk factor for the disorder.

Speaker 2:          40:43          There are a number of brain areas that seem to be involved in the mood disorders where there's just dysregulation or dysfunction. The prefrontal Cortex, as you probably have studied, is an area of the brain. It's very involved in, in higher order, complex thinking and problem solving and in goal directed behavior in people with depression. There's lowered activity in the prefrontal cortex suggesting that, uh, at which may play a role in the, in the, uh, difficulties in concentration and a goal directed behavior in planning and problem solving. And in regulating emotion, the Amygdala is an area of the brain that is involved in the processing of emotional information and people with mood disorders, overactive Amygdala Amygdala responses to emotional information. Um, this is true in both bipolar and in, um, in, uh, depression. The hippocampus is an area of the brain that's very involved in memory and in concentration.

Speaker 2:          41:53          And in people with chronic depression, you often see shrinkage in the hippocampus, uh, and this may be related to their problems in concentration and attention. And then finally, the anterior singular is an area of the brain that's involved in a lot of different activities, but, uh, pertinent to the mood disorders, particularly in responses to distress or to stress and in a sort of the choice of behaviors. And it may be that, um, a dysregulation of anterior singlet maybe involved in the person's difficulty and responding appropriately to stress in choosing good coping behaviors in changing their behaviors whenever their behaviors aren't working well.

Speaker 2:          42:39          So from the biological theories come a number of different drugs to treat the mood disorders. Um, two of the older classes are called the monoamine oxidase inhibitors. And the try [inaudible] Canada precedence and it twice actually because is still use these days to some extent they're relatively effective. The about 60% of people respond well to the tricyclics, um, but they have a lot of side effects and they can be fatal and overdose. And so, um, there was uh, uh, has been always a search for other alternatives to them. The drugs that have really taken over the market are this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or Sris. This is Paxil PROZAC and the like. They were introduced in 1987. PROZAC was in the u s market and truly took over the market and the treatment of depression and anxiety in a number of other disorders. Now they're not that much more effective than this sort of old style antidepressants, but they have fewer side effects and they tend to be easier for people to tolerate.

Speaker 2:          43:40          Um, more recently there are a selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. These drugs, by the way, what these drugs supposedly do is to prevent the re uptake of Serotonin or Serotonin and norepinephrine norepinephrine back into the sending neuron. So it creates more of the neurotransmitter there in the synapse and these are reasonably effective drugs, although again, there's a substantial number of people who don't respond to them especially immediately and they'll often have to cycle through a number of drugs before they find one that works. Lithium as the drug of choice for the treatment of bipolar disorder, um, it seems to stabilize the mood swings, um, by stabilizing a number of different neurotransmitter systems. Um, and, but, uh, lithium is problematic because there are tremendous side effects. It's also dangerous for women to take while they're pregnant in terms of fetal development. Um, so it's, it's a very tough drug to stay on.

Speaker 2:          44:43          There are lots of gastrointestinal side effects and such, and people are often on lithium and the antidepressants because lithium often only affects the manic episodes, but it doesn't really relieve the depression. Um, and then finally, antipsychotic medications, that is, those that help people who've lost touch with reality are sometimes used to treat the mood disorders whenever the person has lost touch with reality. I'm going to go through and talk about some of the psychosocial treatments, uh, because I want to get to them as well. The cognitive behavioral therapies are based on, uh, uh, Aaron backs negative cognitive theory of depression. Um, Aaron Beck is a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania who really founded this whole line of work. Um, and according to Beck, this, now this applies to depression alone. It doesn't really apply to bipolar disorder. People who are depressed have a negative view of the self, of the future and of the world.

Speaker 2:          45:49          And he calls us the negative cognitive triad. And this negative cognitive triad is fed by specific cognitive deficits or biases. So depressed people show a lot of distortions and thinking, I'm all or nothing, thinking is thinking that I'm being are either all good or all bad. They can't sort of see the gray areas in between. There's emotional reasoning. Um, and an example of that is just if I feel like a loser, I must be a loser. Or if I feel stupid, I must be stupid. Um, and then personalization that is the self blame that you often see in depressed people and these kinds of distortions and thinking these distorted ways of interpreting situations, um, feed it kind of general negative view of the self and a hopelessness about the future. Um, people who are depressed also make attributions for negative events that are internal, that is, they blame themselves, uh, that are stable.

Speaker 2:          46:46          They see things bad things as lasting forever and that are global. They see bad, uh, bad events as affecting many areas of their life, which again feeds their depression and their general assumption that that life is terrible and evidence that these, um, for these cognitive theories that these cognitive negative cognitive styles predict depression. One of the best studies, uh, predicting this was studied. It was jointly done at Temple University and University of Wisconsin where they identified first year of college students with a negative cognitive or attributional style. But these were people who had never experienced an episode of depression yet they then track them for the next two years. And the is here. The red bars are the, uh, percent of those with a negative cognitive style who developed an episode of major depression in that two and a half years versus the percent of those without a negative cognitive style.

Speaker 2:          47:39          And as you can see, there's quite a substantial difference between the two. So prospectively, these cognitive characteristics seem to predict your risk for depression. In turn, there's a cognitive behavioral therapy that's based on beccs, um, theory and the major steps in this involved in identifying the themes in a person's negative thoughts and triggers for them. And then helping the person challenged those thoughts by, uh, asking them what the evidence is for their interpretations, whether there are other ways of looking at this situation, how they can cope with the situation if the bad thing really did happen. So the therapist helps the client recognized negative beliefs or assumptions, um, and in challenged these a challenge, the truth value of these and, and change aspects of the environment that are related to depressive symptoms. So they challenge your rational thinking, but they also recognize that there are really bad things that sometimes they're going on in the life of a person who's depressed and they helped them engage in more active problem solving to change those environments.

Speaker 2:          48:45          Um, they also teach the person ways to manage their mood, um, so that they don't tumble down into depression. And these cognitive behavioral therapies have been shown to be extremely effective, um, and as effective in some ways as the, uh, uh, the drug treatments. So this is a reason study in which they had 240 patients with major depressive disorder. Um, they gave them four months of acute treatment with either cognitive behavioral therapy or Paxil, which is an Ssri. And in eight weeks here, they also had a placebo control group where they just got a pill, but it was a sugar pill at eight weeks. The Paxil group, which is in red, and the CVP group, which is in yellow. We're relatively, even all of the Paxil group had a little bit of an edge over the CBT group, but by 16 weeks, the Paxil and the CBT group were absolutely even in terms of the percent of people who were no longer, um, uh, depressed.

Speaker 2:          49:45          So both of them resulted in about 60% of people not being depressed. And then, um, one of the things that's been found over and over again with cognitive behavioral therapy is that it not only helps people get out of a current episode of depression, it helps to prevent future episodes of depression because it teaches the person new coping skills for dealing with new stressors that arise. So in this same study, they followed the patients for an additional 12 months and, um, other Paxil group, half were left on full dose medications to see if you could prevent depression by just keeping people on the meds. And half of the pack full group were withdrawn to a placebo. And, um, let's look at the Placebo Group first here. Um, this is the sad news about depression. If you just take drugs to get out of a current episode and you go off of the drugs without having any kind of psychotherapy, your rate of relapse tends to be very high.

Speaker 2:          50:40          So in this group of 240, almost 80% relapsed in the first year after, um, going off of the active medication. Again, these were people who did not get any cognitive behavioral therapy. Um, of those people who stayed on Paxil alone, about 50% relapsed. But of those people who got cognitive behavioral therapy, only about 35% relapsed. So, and this kind of a I'm finding has been replicated over and over again, namely that CVT can reduce the rate of relapse in depression quite dramatically. I give you a flavor for what CBT looks like. Um, and uh, cause I've got a short clip of a therapist who's actually interestingly the daughter of Aaron Beck and his air in terms of the, uh, um, the practice and, and development of cognitive behavioral therapy. And she's, um, demonstrating CBT. This is actually a role play, but it's a pretty realistic role play of how she goes after and helps to challenge. I'm a gentleman's, uh, negative cognitions about himself. This is the guy in the roleplay who's, uh, recently lost his job and he's really depressed over his job loss.

Speaker 2:          51:57          Okay. I'm going to stop there cause we're running out of time, but I just want to comment on a couple of things that she's doing. So you see that she's, um, she's having him generate his own challenges to his negative thoughts and write them down. And the whole, one of the major premises in, in CBT is it's not just what goes on in the therapy session that is effective. In fact, that's a minor part of it. But what the person practices in the time between therapy sessions and so what she's doing is helping him come up with a series of phrases he can say to himself when he feels discouraged and plunging down. Um, she's also helping him do what's called anticipatory coping, anticipating those situations that are going to trigger negative feelings and negative thoughts and coming up with ways of combating them in the moment that he can enact at the time.

Speaker 2:          52:47          Cognitive behavioral therapy is very structured. It's very focused and it's designed to be relatively short term. The one other major kind of psychotherapy for depression is interpersonal therapy. It's based on the theory that negative views of yourself and expectations about the self and relationships are based on upbringings that really fostered these kind of negative self views. And so what you need to do is to help clients understand their negative self views and how they're rooted in their past relationships. Interpersonal therapy is less structured then cognitive behavioral therapy and it's more focused on the past. CBT is very focused on the present and dealing with the current situation that you're facing and combating that and developing coping styles for that. Um, there are a few studies comparing interpersonal therapy with CBT. Um, but much less research has been done on IPT and CBT, but it is, uh, a positive alternative for some people, particularly those who find that their depression is very tied up in recurrent themes in the relationships that that seemed to happen over and over and over again. But to end the, the good news about depression is that there are these alternative therapies, there are a number of drug therapies, and there are at least two psychotherapies that good controlled research had been shown, can be very helpful. So people have a choice and there is absolutely no need for people to stay in depression, but rather, uh, to seek out the kind of therapy that, that applies to an appeals to them the most. Good. Thanks very much.
