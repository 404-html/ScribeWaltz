Speaker 1:          00:12          I'll begin the class officially, um, with a different sort of demonstration. I want to just show you one of the change blindness studies that has been done in the real world and these videotapes are not available publicly be get them from the web and see him as as little javascripts. So this is a one of the first studies done by Dan Simons when he was at Cornell and his advisor at the time, um, was uh, our friend Kyle, who's now in our department. So here's the study

Speaker 2:          01:02          and

Speaker 1:          01:07          you don't notice it. Um, changed. Linus is one of the more striking phenomenon discovered by laboratory scientists and by site, by psychologists. But it's important to realize to get away from the sort of surprise of the gorilla and the fact that it's hard to see the flickering, the object that's flickering and appreciate the big moral of this cause. The big moral of this is actually I think striking and quite important. Um, you think right now that you are perceiving the world. I looked down on you and I think I have a whole sense of where everybody is. I can't see everybody perfectly and back, you're going to far away and blurry. But there's a sense in which I, I have a world around me. Um, similarly, if I'm to close my eyes for a second, everything just remains and I can sort of remember some of the things that are there that's really good sound localization by me.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Um, the, so you're looking up and, and you think you have a sense of the world, both in perception and memory, the change blindness experiments suggested this isn't true. The change minus the experiments suggest that if you look at me for a second, and during that second, um, all of your classmates changed positions, including those next to you, you are extremely unlikely to notice the change blindness experiments suggest that if you turn your eyes away from me towards there for a second and turn back and I'm dressed entirely differently, you wouldn't notice. The exceptions would be if you told yourself consciously, remember what this guy's wearing? He's wearing this, that another. But if you don't do it consciously, you'll lose it. Um, and usually this is okay. Usually it's okay because your memory and your visual system exploits the basic fact about the universe, which is that most things stay the same.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Most of the time I don't have to explicitly remember that you're over there when I turned my head for a second because you'll be over there in any case, you don't need to hold precise representations of the world. Um, and so you only notice it in certain clever circumstances. One sort of clever circumstance is when psychologists change reality as in a change blindness studies. A second sort of circumstance is in movies. So one of the big surprises when people started making movies involving cuts was it is extremely difficult to get everything continuously right? And you need to work very hard to notice. So there's all these continuity errors that creep up into movies and you have to be a film buff or writing it down to even notice this. And the overall moral here then is that your perception of reality is a lot more sparse, a lot more limited than you might think it is.

Speaker 1:          04:07          So this is where we were at the end of last class. We were talking about the different sorts of memories, um, sensory memory, which is the sort of fraction of a second of sensory residue, what you're hearing and what you're seeing, working memory, short term memory, and then longterm memory. And we talked last class about how things get into sensory memory, into working memory, the role of attention. And in fact the change blindness studies are actually just studies of how something gets from your senses to your consciousness and what does and what doesn't. Now I want to move to distinction in working memory, short term memory and, and longterm memory. Now the obvious distinction is actually just in fact, um, is storage differences. So longterm memory or Ltm has a huge storage capacity. This is your memory, like the hard drive of your computer. This is the memory you walk around with.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Um, it includes all the words in English, just for example, 60, 80,000 words. It includes everybody you've ever met. Languages, faces, um, stories, locations, nursery rhyme, songs, TV programs. Nobody knows the storage. It is not true that you remember everything that has ever happened to you. That there's no reasonably that this is true. At the same time though, you have a huge amount stored in your brain in longterm storage and nobody actually, it has to be limited because it's a finite limited brain, but nobody knows how big it is. Nobody knows how many terabytes you carry around in your brain. And um, but it's a lot. Compare this to working memory, the short term memory, which is actually very limited. Your memory of what you could store on and where you can hold in consciousness right now is quite limited. Um, here's an exercise. Do not write these, these things down. I want you to remember them. I'm just going to give you a few numbers. 1459, 11 109-4358-NINETY 848720538954. Please write them down. View this as Nike test if that would relax you.

Speaker 2:          07:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:10          Um, how many of you who decided to participate in this experiment got three or less? Good, good. Um, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or more. Anybody get all 11? Um, this is a particularly difficult memory task. The numbers are meaningless and I told him, and I forgot to tell you to get your pen and pencil ready so some of you just glared at me, but um, but under normal circumstances, the cognitive psychologists, George Miller said that the sort of suggested that the standard memory storage of short term memory is seven plus or minus two. And what that means is anywhere from five to nine, roughly, some of you I bet can beat that. Some of you on a not so good day, maybe it won't make it that much. Um, now seven plus or minus two is what year? So that's what you hold in consciousness.

Speaker 1:          08:23          You know, I'm telling you 14, 21 walk around. All right, 1421, you hold that unconscious, no problem. But I throw 11 numbers at you. You can't some dribble out. You can't hold that in your conscious window in your short term memory. Now this raises the question seven plus or minus two. What? And the answer seems to be what George Miller calls chunks and a chunk. Is it basic memory unit? Something you think of as a single individual entity. Um, so suppose you see the string of letters, l a, m, a, I. S. O. N. Um, if you don't know if you can form these into words and you have to remember them, these are eight chunks. You have to just pick them up separately. On the other hand, if you break them up into four words, you could just remember that's four chunks.

Speaker 1:          09:22          And if you break it up into two words in French, uh, Lemay zone, the house, um, it could just be one or two. How much you know, depends on affects how much you memorize, how much, how much you could store in memory, because it affects what counts as a basic unit of memory. And there's all sorts of examples of this. If I tell you one, one zero, one, one zero, zero, one zero, one, one zero, um, those of you who don't know binary numbers might have to remember that as one, one, zero, zero, whatever. I said. Um, those of you who are computer scientists or mathematicians, or for whatever reason, no binary numbers could convert into a single binary number. Anybody know what the number is?

Speaker 1:          10:13          No, I cannot say it again. Um, some number 24, not 24 to 224 and then you remember 24, it's easier. Suppose you see a chessboard and a Chess Board is set up and you don't know how to play chess. It is murderously hard to remember that they've done the experiments. We taking people in the lab who don't know how to play chess. They set up a chess board and then they say, okay, look at this for five minutes. Looks at it. Then they take it away, set it up again and it's it. It's murderously hard. There was a horsey thing on the side there and everything. But if these chess pieces are set up in some way that's logical for a chess player, then a chess master could look at it and remember it in a glance, oh, it's the Fibonacci defense or something like that. Um, and, and then immediately recover it. Similarly, football coaches have been tested on their memories of football diagrams and they have like a photographic memory for football diamonds because it corresponds to the things that makes sense. Arik attacks. Architects could have a photographic memory of perfect memory for four plants because it makes sense to them. They understand it. Um, and so the way you store things in memory, and this is a theme we're going to return to when we get to long term memory, depends in a large extent on how much you understand it

Speaker 1:          11:43          and it shows up and expertise affects. Now this is what's happening so far in short term memory, how much you hold in there. The question is how do you get it into longterm memory? So you have longterm memory, your, your, your major storage system. How does information get from your consciousness to longterm storage? Well, there's one thing, there's one way which sort of works sometimes but not very well and it's called maintenance rehearsal. Suppose I said, you have to remember this number, this string of numbers and if you remember it in 20 minutes you will get $1,000 and a string is the string is my phone number when I was a kid. And include the area code (514) 688-9057. Now if you tell that to it to a four year old, what four year old said, I remember it. And then you asked him what I just say.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Well I don't know if you tell it to an act cause cause you know something, if a lot depended on you would know to do something. What you would do is you'd say there's 500, four (688) 995-7514 (689) 575-1468 you'd rehearse it in your head over and over again. The problem is you could hold it as long as you can do that. Um, it's like these movies, you see this all the time, like an episode of 24, you know, Jack Call Ctu until them agent 11 is trapped in there. And I can't even remember this. But the way to remember that you hold, you just got to repeat it over and over again in your head. But this will not typically get things into longterm memory to get things in the longterm memory. Rehearsal is usually not enough. You need to do other things. Typically what you need is structure and organization.

Speaker 2:          13:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:37          And one way to demonstrate this was in a class at depth of processing experiment, which nicely illustrates the fact that the more you structure something deeper, you think about it,

Speaker 2:          13:48          okay?

Speaker 1:          13:49          The better it gets entrenched in longterm memory. So in this study, what they did was they asked people, they told people that there's going to be words flashed on the screen and all of the subjects are the same strings of words. There were 48 words. They were not told to memorize the words.

Speaker 2:          14:07          Okay?

Speaker 1:          14:08          One third of the subjects was told, look, some of these words are going to come out in capital letters. Some of them not capital letters, press a button for capital's non capitals. Sure. The other group was told, some of these words will rhyme with train. Others won't press a button if it rhymes and train. The third group was told, does it fit into the sentence, the girl placed a blank on the table, press a button. If it does, press a button. If it doesn't,

Speaker 2:          14:36          yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:37          Then they were asked as a surprise. What words did you see? And the findings look like this when they were asked to focus on just what the word look like, memory was very poor. The sound better, the meaning better. If you want to remember something, the best way to remember it is to give it meaning to give it sense. Um, this is illustrated through an a very ancient technique, which is that the way to remember things that are otherwise arbitrary is to give them some organization through memory tricks, through vivid imagery or, or, or, um, songs or poetry. Um, and there's a lot of examples of this. Do you know how to remember that? The hippocampus, there's part of your brain called the hippocampus. This is the worst memory Craig ever, but it will stick with you for 20 years. The HIPPA campus is involved in spatial memory. Um, it's involved in finding your way around.

Speaker 1:          15:42          Think you yourself. The way I find my way around campus is through the hippocampus. That's stupid. But you'll never forget now that the hippocampus is in charge of spatial memory because we all you retained from this course, um, memory, memory books on, on how to, on how to remember people's names. Um, usually try to exploit this sort of thing where you try to get poetry are dramatic images. So that memory books always typically involve somebody. Like you meet somebody very spiky here and they say, my name is Mr Fish. And then you remember, you think of they're a big fish and paygov under here. And then whenever you see them, you remember their name. It only really works for names like fish, but, but the, but the idea is you try to generate vivid imagery when stock, when stuck with a situation where you have to remember 10 letters, turn it into a song where are are, are, are a dirty poem. What each of the letters is. The first words of it when having to remember something that seems totally arbitrary, try to figure out

Speaker 1:          16:51          a grant and obscene image that will come to mind easily. And, and this is how these are one way to get things into memory at a deep level though, the way to get things into memory, and this applies to this course no less than anything else, is by understanding that understanding. Again, I'm going to read you something and I want you to try your best to remember what I tell you. These are not going to be strings of numbers they use are going to be, this is going to be a series of sentences, a newspapers better than a magazine. A sea shore is a better place than the street at first. It is better to run then to walk. You may have to try several times. It takes some skill, but it's easy to learn. Even young children can enjoy it. One successful complications are minimal. Bird seldom get to close reign, however, soaks in very fast. Too many people doing the same things can also cause problems. One needs lots of room. If there are no complications, that can be very peaceful. Finally, a rock will serve as an anchor if things break loose from it. However, you will not have a second chance.

Speaker 1:          18:00          And here's what I said.

Speaker 2:          18:05          Okay,

Speaker 1:          18:05          this is murderously hard to remember. Now try it. Knowing what this is about, being able to put a context to it helps the memory and, and, and, and helps it come to mind.

Speaker 2:          18:28          Okay?

Speaker 1:          18:29          So this is about how to get memory, how to get information into your memory. How did you get information out? So you know, it's an exam period. You got this stuff presumably into your head. You have to get it out. You have to retrieve it. There's a court case, you have to figure out. You have to recount the crime that you witnessed. Um, you see somebody and you want to know his or her name and you heard it. You just have to get it out. Well, how do you do that? Well, here's the retrieval cues. Retrieval cues makes sense. Retrieval cues are just things that, that have been associated with what you, um, what you're trying to remember?

Speaker 2:          19:11          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:14          If I, if I have to remember to replace the windows when I walk into my living room and see that a window is cracked, that will remind me to replace the windows. If, if, um, if I had a lunch date with you and forgot about it when I see you. Oh yeah. We were supposed to get together and have lunch. Um, retrieval cue is bring things back,

Speaker 1:          19:35          but it's a little bit more complicated in that there's a more general relationship between encoding and retrieval call the compatibility principle. And what this means is you're much better to remember something in the context in which you have learnt it. And this is also known as context dependent memory and state dependent memory. It's illustrated by one of the strangest experiments in the history of psychology where they had people on a boat and then they had them scuba dive underwater and they taught them things either on the boat or underwater, like with things that they held up. And then they tested them later and uh, turns out that you'll remember it better if you're tested on it in the context in which you learn it. And it might be because then the retrieval cues help bring it back. Um, but it's more general in that if you have to remember something you learned in this class, you will do better.

Speaker 1:          20:34          If you try to think about the room in which you learned at it, you will do better on your final exam if you were to take it in this room than if you were to take it in another room. Because being in this room, we'll bring back the cues. It's not just the environment. People will learn things when they're stoned. Remember them better keeping stone that is sort of a low level. It doesn't disrupt other mental activities. Remember them better when they're sort of stone again then after non stone. Similarly. So, you know, if you study while you drink, you should typically a little bit before coming into the final exam.

Speaker 1:          21:18          It's sort of like what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, sort of results. Um, and so similarly, it even applies to moods in that if you learn something when depressed used to have a slightly better recovery of it when you're in that same mood of depression than when you're elated. And the idea is that part of what memory is part of recovering memories is getting back your original context in which you've learned it. Um, elaborative rehearsal and retrieval a lot involves the connections between different things. Um, elaborative rehearsal is that the more you think about something, the easier it is to remember. If you have to think about, if you have to remember something, try to connect it to as many things as possible. Think of an image, make a joke out of it. Imagine how you would explain it to somebody else. Um, imagine how the world, what the world will be like if it wasn't.

Speaker 1:          22:21          So, and the idea is that this sort of thinking about it makes connections in your memory from that thing you have to learn to other memories and so it makes it easier to recover. Um, elaborative retrieval refers to a finding that, um, when you want to get something back at a memory, people tend to give up too soon. It turns out that there's a lot of stuff that's in your memory, but it needs work to extract. It needs various sort of searching strategies. Um, one study asks people, um, who were considerably older than you to remember their high school classmates. And in the first pass people are terrible. Maybe they had a couple of friends they kept in touch with otherwise pretty bad. And this is a good experiment because you could use high school yearbooks to judge whether or not they get it right.

Speaker 1:          23:20          But then what you do is you tell the person, look, keep trying. Um, where you, what sort of, who is your teacher? What sort of clubs that you belong to? What sort of sports did you participate in? How did you get to school? How did you get from school? Um, what did you do during lunch? What did you do? Or during break. And You keep asking, you know, have any friends whose letter, whose last name began with B with C, with D, and you keep pushing and pushing and pushing and over the span of time, things come back again. It's not true that you never forget. There is honest to God, forget it. But sometimes you think you forget as, because you haven't looked long enough. There's a real physical notion of searching for the right answer.

Speaker 1:          24:06          We've talked about retrieval. Oh, every class I've given, somebody asks either in class or by email. What about Deja Vu? And Deja Vu is a feeling that an event has happened before. So you're looking at me and I'm lecturing. He said, I've heard this before. No, I know this before you see somebody and say, I've been in a situation before. This is not evidence for psychic powers. Um, which many people say it is, but nobody really knows why this exists. We know, and this is a clue. It's worse with frontal lobe damage. You get damaged as part of the brain. You get a lot more deja Vu experiences. I asked some experts in memory, um, including Marsha Johnson, who's chair of our department, what the best explanation for Deja Vu is. And the answer she gave the one big theory goes like this. Um, Deja Vu is a feeling that has happened before. The answer is it has happened before. It's happened half a second ago. And so what happens is sometimes there's a glitch.

Speaker 2:          25:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          25:20          a disturbance in the force. I don't know if there's a glitch and you were talking and then something happens to you and you put it in your memory. But it's as if you don't put the stamp on it of what time and what date. So you're talking to me and then you store it in memory, but you don't store it in memory as happening right now. Then have a second goes by and you're talking to me. He says, this is strangely familiar and that's one theory of what goes on in Deja Vu. Okay. So far. Does this sort of good news remembering? But then there's bad news. Forgetting how many people can remember without looking down at your notes. At least two of the numbers I gave you earlier.

Speaker 2:          26:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:08          How many people can remember at least four. Oh, impressive. Um, if I asked you in an hour, the number would go down. These are sort of statistics in a similar experiment in this graph illustrates that people forget over time, you'll forget. Why do you forget? Why is there forgetting at all? Well, there's different explanations for this. One explanation is your brain is a physical thing. It's a physical piece of meat and a kind of goes bad physical decay. And so the memory traces that are laid onto your brain will just decay over time. The second answer is interference. So remember those numbers. Here's a few more. Hundred and 1480160640 two. Well, the more information that comes in at similar to stuff you're trying to remember, it blocks your recovery of original information. So your ability to remember something can be impaired by learning more things which are related to it because they get confused in memory. Finally, and maybe this is most interesting, there are changes in retrieval cues. So the more time goes by, the more the world changes. And if your memory is to some extent dependent on qs bringing it back to life, then um, the change in retrieval cues,

Speaker 2:          27:38          okay.

Speaker 1:          27:39          Can make it more difficult to, um, to recall certain things. This leads to a puzzle where there's considerable scientific debate over the case of Childhood Amnesia. And the case of Childhood Amnesia is, um, it doesn't refer to when a child gets brain damage. You Guys Amnesia, whatever refers to is people have a difficult time recovering very early memories. I want people to just take a second and try to think back on what your first memory is and roughly how old you were.

Speaker 2:          28:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:20          How many people don't think you have a first memory until you were about five years old or older.

Speaker 2:          28:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:30          How many people think you have a first memory of around age four or younger? How many people think you have a first memory of around age three or younger? Two or younger?

Speaker 2:          28:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:45          How many of you think you have a first memory when you were about one years old or younger?

Speaker 2:          28:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:50          And I'm not asking about past lives that, that had happened last year. Um, how, how, how old is your roughly your first memory, you think

Speaker 2:          29:01          how old

Speaker 1:          29:04          between one and two. Anybody think they can beat that same guy? Yep.

Speaker 2:          29:12          One.

Speaker 1:          29:15          Anybody else?

Speaker 2:          29:19          MMM.

Speaker 1:          29:21          The literature is unclear on this because it's very difficult to test people's recollections of their first memories. If I'm to ask people about your first memories, they'll often say, oh yeah, I remember I was in this room and there was a crib and I going to gag a Gugu and, um, I was on a potty. I was, I was walking, I was so cute. I remember it. It's very difficult to tell. And as we'll discuss in some detail, there are a lot of reasons to distrust people when they, not that they're lying, but to distress, to accuracy of people's memories. We also know from studies about trauma where people have terrible experiences when there are one or two. Typically this trauma is not men remembered later on. People know of trauma because you're told about it. Um, but they don't typically remember with any accuracy.

Speaker 1:          30:18          Even children, older children don't remember back beyond that age. Nobody knows why Childhood Amnesia occurs. Nobody knows why. It's very difficult to recover memories before about the age of three. One theory is that the retrieval cues change radically. I had a friend of mine who's a clinical psychologist and he suggested a new form of therapy where they make these giant tables and chairs and then they bring you into the office and you're standing at the giant tables and chairs and all these memories of being a baby would come flooding back. And uh, he, he dropped out at the field. And really, um, but it's such a cool idea. Um, some people think language is to blame. So a child, a baby starts out with no spoken or sign language. Language comes to be learned at around one, two and three. And it might be that the learning of a language reformat your memory and once the memory is reformatted, it can't go back to the previous state prior to language.

Speaker 1:          31:24          In the end, it could be neuro maturation. It could be that there's memory, parts of the brains grow around age two or three that just weren't there prior to that and nobody really knows. It's a, it's a fascinating research area. Why about memory changes early on? Another case of memory failure is brain damage and brain damage comes in. A couple of flavors. There is retrograde Amnesia Retro for past Retrograde Amnesia is when you lose some memory of the past. This could be in a case where you get some sort of head trauma and you lose memory of your entire episodic memory, but typically if you have any sort of serious accident involves you losing consciousness, you'll have a blackout of some period prior to that say bloated ahead. And the reason for this is as you're having these experiences now they need to kind of get, get consolidated into your brain.

Speaker 1:          32:29          The brain needs to rewire and catch up to the experiences you're having a sudden bloated ahead, we'll knock you unconscious and then the memories have happened immediately prior. Well not get consolidated and there'll be lost forever. Another sort of memory is anterior grade amnesia. And this was the case of this happens and causes a cough syndrome. It happens to a very famous patient known as h m who actually lives in Hartford, Connecticut. Um, and it happened to Clive wearing the film you saw last class. And this as heard of Amnesia is a sort of Amnesia where you lose the abilities to form new memories. And so you live in a perpetual present, unable to accumulate new memories, but it's actually a little bit more complicated than that. What happens is, and this was an exciting discovery about these patients that led to some real insights about normal memory.

Speaker 1:          33:31          What happens is, and this is the brain damage in these cases, the temporal lobe and the hippocampus, very useful for spatial memory. You'll know when discovery made about people who couldn't form new memories is that they could form new memories. But if certain types, so for example, this is a task care involving, um, filling in a star while looking into a mirror. And if I asked you to do, you'd find it pretty difficult. It's just kind of difficult to do. You'd be clumsy at it. You bring in an amnesic who can't form new memories and you say, Hey, I want you to try something new. I want you to try this star game. Say, okay, I've never seen it before, but I'll do it. Tries it does very badly. You bring him in over and over again. Each time he does it, he starts off by saying, I've never seen this before.

Speaker 1:          34:25          I'll, I'm sure I'll give it a try. But he gets better and better at it. And this is known as implicit memory. The claim is that in these sorts of cases, you lose the abilities to form explicit conscious memories that you're aware of, that you understand, but some sorts of memories persist and you are able to form them. Um, this is actually been illustrated in a couple of dramatic movies. One of them are very bad dramatic movie. Um, where, uh, drew Barrymore loses the ability to form new memories and somehow falls in love with Adam Sandler. Definitely don't watch that, but a very good movie called Memento, which is about a character who loses his ability to form new memories. While trying to track down his wife's killer memento is a movie, which is fascinating because it's told backwards. But through my mentors, it's another story told forwards. And I like this story because it very dramatically illustrates what does and what what is and is not impaired in, um, in, in cases of severe memory damage. So I'm going to show you a couple of clips that illustrate the dissociation from Momento. Those have you seen the movie knows, know that this ends up quite tragically for Sammy. Um, you recommend a movie. We've, we've dealt right now with two sorts of failures of memory. One is every day failure of memory when you forget. How many of you remember three are more of the numbers I originally presented?

Speaker 1:          36:16          Yeah, go ahead. 1459, 11. Is that right? Fine. I'm going to ask you again in a month. Um, well people are supposed to forget. Um, and some things will, you will forget. That's normal. Forgetting a second case is I'm forgetting due to brain damage for getting due to brain damage is exotic and unusual. Um, but it's interesting and that illustrates some of the more general themes about how the mind works. Remember, one theme of this course is we're going to look at exotic cases like the case of Clive wearing, um, not just because they're interesting in their own rights, but sometimes by looking at the extremes, we can learn something about how normal people's normal, intact minds and brains work. The third case of forgetting is more interesting and it actually, well, I want to do a little trial here. What I want to do is I want you to hit listen to three children. Describe an event that happened. I want you to come to some your own gas. Imagine you were a judge, you were a child care worker. You want it to be, I want you to do become to your own guests. But who you believe and what you think happened. You've heard three children. Who Do you believe? Who believes? There's three of them? One, two, three. Who believes the first one?

Speaker 2:          38:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:02          Who believes? The second one? Who believes the third one? Sort of an even split.

Speaker 2:          38:11          MMM.

Speaker 1:          38:18          2100 experts were shown these films and asked, um, about the different actions, whether or not the person ripped the book messed up the bear, tossed the book in the air. Um, and as you can see, the majority thought that they did. Um, this is, uh, work done by a Steve CC who was gracious enough to, um, to lend me the film to use for teaching purposes. It turns out the second girl was right. Absolutely nothing happened. Um, the teacher said there's somebody named Sam Stone. He's going to come in. Guy Walks in, says hi, walks around and leaves the first and third children had their memories implanted. Um, not through any sort of science fiction means they had their memories implanted. Well, they had memories implanted it like this. Some of the children were just ask questions. The interviewer, by the way, was herself unaware of what happened.

Speaker 1:          39:27          So the interview was a perfectly naive interviewer. Um, and it turns out if you just interview children and you ask them questions about whether the book was ripped, did you see him? Did he really do it? They don't say anything. They didn't see anything and he won't say anything. Other children were told about Sam stone. They were told a stereotype about Sam stone, that he's very clumsy and he tends to rip things and he trips and he breaks things and he spills things. And in fact, the third child mentioned that in passing. He said he always does that. Um, just knowing this about Sam stone tends to raise the proportion of kids who say for instance, that he ripped the book. Other children were given suggestions. They were given suggestive questioning. They were, um, a series of leading questions like, oh, Sam stone came in, did he rip a book while he was there?

Speaker 1:          40:26          And still more children got both. And in fact, the children he used saw were from this group. They heard Sam stone being described as a clumsy fellow and they were given a series of suggestive questionings in this condition. They were given several suggestive questionings over a period of several months. These children, like the first child, the third child are not lying. They honestly believe that Sam stone came in and did these things. Also they believe it and they're so convincing in their belief that experts, including police officers and child caseworkers and judges and lawyers find these children to be extremely believable. And I think they probably find them to be extremely believable because the children are not blind. They really believe they saw what they saw. But these memories were an implanted and cc and many other investigators study how memories can be implanted in people's minds through suggestion and through leading questions.

Speaker 1:          41:35          It turns out that the same sort of experiment and same sort of research has been done with considerable success in an planting false memories in adults. Um, there are dramatic cases of people remembering terrible crimes and confessing to them when actually they didn't commit them. And this is not because, um, they are lying is not even because they're in some obvious sense the range or schizophrenia or delusional rather they have persuaded themselves are more often been persuaded by others that these things have actually happened. Psychologists have studied in the laboratory how one could do this, how one can implant memories in other people. Um, and some things are sort of standard. Suppose I was to tell you a story about a trip I took to the dentist or a visit I took to our time when I ate out at a restaurant and I'm to omit certain details like I omit the fact that I paid the bill in a restaurant.

Speaker 1:          42:42          Say, oh, I finished a meal and then I went home. Still you'll tend to fill in the blanks. You'll tend to fill in the blanks with things you know. So you might remember this later saying, Oh yeah, he told me he finished eating, paid the bill and left cause paying the bills. What you do in a restaurant, this is benign and enough if you fill in the blanks, um, you also can integrate suppositions made by others. And the clearest case of this is eye witness testimony. And the best research on this has been done by Elizabeth Loftus who has an a series of studies, some discussed in a textbook showing how people's memories can be swayed by leading questions. And it can be extremely subtle. In one experiment, the person was just asked in the course of a series of questions shown a scene where there's a car accident and as either did you see a broken headlight or did you see the broken headlight?

Speaker 1:          43:48          The, the pre supposes there was a broken headlight and in fact, the people told as did you see the broken headlight later on are more likely to remember? One, it creates an image and they fill it in. Um, in another study, uh, she would show film segments and then ask, did you see the children getting on a school bus? Now there was no school bus, but people who hear that question later on when asked, did you see a school bus in the film are more likely to say yes. In another study, she would show people film segments and asked them either how fast were the cars going when they hit each other, or how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other. A week later, she bring people back into the laboratory and ask, did you see any broken glass? Those who hear smash tend to see the broken glass more than those who hear hit because the question has changed their memory.

Speaker 1:          44:51          Making it more of a dramatic event have knows us as the clearest case. Where, um, where does the sort of reconstructive effort led by, um, led as a result of leading and probing questions? Um, some of you are readily hypnotizable and you can be hypnotized. And what we would learn about a past event, um, from hypnotizing you will not necessarily been be inaccurate. What hypnotizing does is it makes people very willing to cooperate. Um, unfortunately it isn't as if there's a memory storage there where you could just go through and look as in the movies where you just say, what's the license plate? The person is hypnotized. And then the flashback comes in in the zoom in on the license plate. Memory doesn't work that way. What happens is what somebody will do in hypnotizable status that we very eager to please the hypnotist. And so it will make stuff up and people under hypnosis just make stuff up and they do very enthusiastically, um, and very believably make stuff up.

Speaker 1:          45:59          This is particularly the case with hypnotic regression. When we ask you to go back to your sixth birthday party for instance, and what's great as a developmental psychologist is if I ask you to go back to your fourth birthday party and you're hypnotizable, you'll be all just like a four year old, except you won't be like a real four year old. Where you'll be like is an adult's notion of what a four year old is supposed to be. Um, in fact, this has happened in the extreme case with hypnotic regression where people claim to speak a language is like from, from ancient Egypt. And linguists love these studies because then you don't, of course, you don't really sound like you're speaking a language from ancient Egypt where you sound is uh, like a North American who believes he's speaking a language from ancient Egypt over right there. I got her for that.

Speaker 1:          46:52          And so what it makes you is it hidden. It is and brings out the actor in you. It makes you want to give a persuasive account of what happened. And so hypnotism is just an extreme form of what normally happens in eyewitness testimony. Repressed memories. We could devote a class, we could devote a semester to the very heated debate in the United States, mostly about repressed memories. There are many adults who have claimed to have experienced traumatic sexual abuse. Um, in some cases, this is unexceptional from a memory point of view. People know this happened to them. They've always known it happens to them, and then they tell people about it. But there's a subset of cases where people have had no memory up to a point of what happened to them. Then they go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, they undergo questioning, um, often using hypnotic techniques and then they recover a memory of past traumatic sexual abuse.

Speaker 1:          47:59          And what, this is what makes us so debatable and there is a debate about this. I don't want to try to preclude it one way or another. What makes us debatable is some psychologists believe that at least some cases these memories are real and they have been repressed through a Freud he and mechanism that there are two terrible to bring to consciousness and the therapy brings them out into real life. But most psychologists believe that these memories could not be trusted, that these memories are created through the actions of the therapists. Um, and so there's actually a considerable psychological and legal battles over the voracity of the therapist where women who have claimed to have sexual be sexually abused for instance, have press criminal charges against her father's on the basis of false memories. Similarly, people who have been accused of sexual abuse have press criminal charges against psychiatry address claiming that these psychiatrists have implanted the memories into their sons and daughters.

Speaker 1:          49:01          It is controversial whether memories are ever repressed. What isn't controversial is that for at least some cases you can implant false memories in people. Not because you're a sinister evil person, but because you really believe something happened and you talk to them about it and then you cause these memories to come into being a final case is flashbulb memories. I asked us early in the semester, I'll ask it again. How many of you remember where you were in September 11th, 2001 there anybody who doesn't remember where they were in September 11th, 2001 it would be interesting because it's socially relevant event. Um, but here's the problem with these flashbulb memories. Flashbulb memories aren't idea that these memories being so vivid and they are vivid for many of us. Exactly where we stood, what happened. Um, well they can't really be trusted and here's why. Not because they're such important events.

Speaker 1:          50:04          I bet many of you have actually heard the question before, where were you on September 11th and talked about it. What happens in these conversations is stories change. I have my event, I knew where I was on September 11th, my wife knew where she was, but I spent as much time listening to her talk about it as I spent time me talking about it. And now maybe my memory is actually of her experience and not mine. It's not for all of these cases. The temptation you have to resist is saying, yes, I know memories can be swayed. I know they could be distorted everything, but you see, I really am sure that happened. You have to resist that temptation because there are so many cases we know, including the tape of the girls that we just saw where people aren't entirely sure things happen and we know full well that they didn't exist.

Speaker 1:          50:59          Being sure is no guarantee that a memory isn't false reconstructed or even implanted. So this part of memory has three made morals. There are many types of memories. I talked about short term memory, long term memory. I talked about implicit memory and explicit memory. Um, these are sort of separable sort of memories. You could break one while having the other one impaired. Arguably there assist rain systems. Um, dedicated to memory for faces, memory for everyday objects, memory for spatial locations. Um, the key to remembering his organization and understanding introduction, introduction to x courses including introduction to psychology courses are among the hardest courses at Yale. And the reason why is there's just a lot of material, um, that that is diverse and you have to command each aspects separately. The easiest courses at Yale tend to be high Falutin seminars where you kind of have enough of a background that everything is going to be clear and understandable. Um, the more you understand something, the easy or easier you'll remember it. And finally you can't trust some of your memories. Um, your reading response for this week is, um, you have to use your powers for good and not for evil. Um, though, if you managed to succeed at this, I will be very impressed.

Speaker 1:          52:33          But you have to, you have to describe it based on the lecture materials and the readings, how to implant a false memory.

Speaker 2:          52:43          MMM.

Speaker 1:          52:46          We have a few minutes. Any, any questions on memory?

Speaker 2:          52:53          Yes. You play music. Hey, please. Yeah. Is that like

Speaker 1:          53:09          the example is, what sort of memory is it when you know how to play the piano? It's a very good question. It is long term memory because you might know how to do a concerto or a song and if you have it stored in your head, you carry it around with you. You'll remember it a from now two years from now. It is longterm memory, but it is also an excellent example of implicit memory because you know how to do it. But, but you could do it unconsciously. You Vet attendings, it's as it's not century, but it's as if put a crudely that your fingers now and not your mind. We have time for one more question. Yes.

Speaker 1:          53:49          The question is about photographic memory. Um, there are a lot of claims about photographic memory. My understanding is they do not tend to be substantiated. Sometimes photographic memory, and this came up when we talked about autism a few classes ago is linked with savant like skills. People have severe impairments in some ways may have photographic memories in others. I am not convinced that photographic memory in a sense that you see something, you take a picture of it, you hold in memory really exists. Um, I think there may be one or two case studies that suggested might be real, but I think it's controversial. Okay. Um, we have a guest lecture on Wednesday. Uh, Dean Peter Salivate. We'll talk to us about love.
