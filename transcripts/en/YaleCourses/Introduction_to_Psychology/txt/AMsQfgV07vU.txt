Speaker 1:          00:12          We began the course by talking about one of the foundational ideas of modern psychology. This is what a Francis Crick described as the astonishing hypothesis. The idea that our mental life, our consciousness, our morality, our capacity to make decisions and judgments is a product of a material physical brain. What I want to talk about today and introduce it, it's going to be a theme that dough we're going to continue throughout the rest of the course is a second idea, which I think is equally shocking, perhaps more shocking. Um, and this has to do with we're mental life comes from not necessarily its material nature, but rather its origin. And the notion, this other astonishing hypothesis is what the philosopher Daniel Dennett has described as Darwin's dangerous idea. Um, and this is the modern biological account of the origin of biological phenomenon including psychological phenomena. Now people have long been interested in the evolution of complicated things and there is an argument that's been repeated throughout history and many people have found it deeply compelling, including Darwin himself.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Darwin, as he wrote, the origin of species was deeply persuaded and move by this argument from in the form presented by the theologian William Paley. So Paleo has an example here. Paly tells, gives the example of you're walking down the beach and your foot hits a rock and then you wonder where did that rock come from? And you don't really expect an interesting answer to that question. Maybe it was always there, maybe it fell from the sky, who cares? But suppose you found a watch on the ground and then you ask where to watch had come from. Um, Paly points out that it would not be satisfying to simply say it's always been there or it came there as an accident. And he uses this comparison to, to make a point, which is a watch is a very complicated and interesting thing. Um, Paley is, it was a medical doctor and Paly goes on to describe a watch and compare a watch to the eye and noticing that a watch and I contain multitudes, multitudes of parts that interact in complicated ways to do interesting things.

Speaker 1:          02:40          In fact, to change and to update the analogy a little bit. Um, an I is very much like a machine known as a camera. Um, and, and, and they're similar at a deep way. They both have lenses that Ben Light and project an image onto, a light sensitive surface for the eye. Light sensitive surfaces, the retina for the camera to film. Um, they both have a focusing mechanism, um, for the eye. It's muscles that change the shape of the Lens. Um, for, for a camera it's a diaphragm that governs the amount of incoming light. Um, even they're both in Cayston black, the light sensitive, uh, part of the eye and part of the camera are both in case than black, the differences. So, so in fact, the eye and a camera look a lot alike and we know the camera is an artifact. A camera has been constructed by an intelligent, by intelligent beings to fulfill a purpose.

Speaker 1:          03:36          In fact, if there's any difference between things like the eye and things like a camera, um, the difference is that, um, the things like the eye are far more complicated than things like the camera. And I was a kid. I had this incredible TV show called the $6 million man. Anybody here ever seen it or heard of it? Anyway, the idea is there's a test pilot, Steve Austin and his, his rocket jet crashes and he loses his both legs, his arm in his eye, which sounds really bad, but they replaced them with bionic stuff with artificial leg, artificial arm and an artificial eye that are really super powered in any fights crime. It was really the best show on it was really good. Um, but the thing is, this was in 1974. It's now, uh, over 30 years later and it's true then is true now. This is fantasy.

Speaker 1:          04:34          It doesn't make it to the level of science fiction. It's fantasy. We are, are impossibly far away from developing machines that could do this. We are impossibly far away from building a machine that can do what the human eye does. And so suddenly, like Haley points that look, the complexity of the biological world suggests that these things are complicated artifacts created by a designer far smarter than any human engineer. And the designer, of course would be, God, I went to Google images and I don't mean that to be sacra religious in any sense. I, you could try this. I went to Google images and type in God, and this was the showed up right in the middle. Um, so, and this, this paly argued it and it was, it's been convincing throughout. Most of history is, um, is, is a perfectly logical explanation for these complicated things come from.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Um, it also has the advantage of being compatible with scripture and compatible for religious beliefs. But paly made the point is, stands on its own. If you find complicated things, um, that, that, that complicated artifacts, you don't assume they emerge by accident. You assume that they were created by an intelligent, uh, being. Now this view has always had problems. This view, you could, you could call it creationism, which is that biological structures were created by an intelligent being has always had problems. One problem is it pushes back the question. So you asked where did that intelligent being coming from? And this is a particularly serious problem from the standpoint of evolution of psychological structures. So we want to know how is it that creature's came across upon this earth with the ability to reason and plan and do things and then the answer as well, another creature with that ability created us.

Speaker 1:          06:30          That doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong, but it means it's unsatisfying. You immediately want to get an explanation for that other creature comes from. Um, more to the point, there's always been evidence for evolution. And what I mean by evolution here isn't necessarily a specific mechanism, but merely the fact that that body parts like the, I didn't emerge all of a sudden, but rather have parallels both within other existing animals and across a human and biological history. Um, this, this, uh, evidence comes in different forms. There's fossil evidence for different body parts cause suggesting that they have evolved for more rudimentary form. Um, there is Vesta Joel characteristics and what this means is there are characteristics that human bodies have that are somewhat inexplicably will, um, like the human tailbone or goosebumps unless you've used them at the human body. In this current form as modifications from a previous form.

Speaker 1:          07:31          Um, there are parallels with other animals and this is clear in psychology. So human brain is different from the rat cat monkey brain, but at the same time you see them following a sort of common plan and common structures. And one rational inference from this is that they're linked through evolutionary descent. Um, finally there's occasional poor design. So paly rhapsodized about the remarkable powers of the human body and the different body parts. But even paly admitted that there's some things which just don't work very well. You're, I contains a blind spot because of how the nerves are wired up. Um, the, in the male urinary system, the urethra goes through the prostate gland, um, instead of around it, which leads to many physical problems in men later on in life. Um, and so you're forced to s to either argue that these are really good things, um, or that God has either malicious, aren't competent, and those are difficult arguments to make.

Speaker 1:          08:34          So these are problems with the creationist view, but still for the longest time in human intellectual history, there was no alternative. And in fact, so Richard Dawkins, the most prominent evolutionary biology and most prominent evolutionary biologists alive, and one of the most staunchest critics of creationism has rewritten in the blind watchmaker saying, look, anybody a hundred years ago or 150 years ago who didn't believe that God created humans and other animals was a moron. Because the argument from design is a damn good argument. And in the absence of some other argument, um, you should go defer to that and you should say, well, there are all these problems, but humans and other biological horns must have divine creation because of their incredible rich and intricate structure.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Um, what changed all that of course was Darwin. Um, and Darwin, um, is Darwin's profound accomplishment. We're showing how you get these complicated biological structures like the eye emerging through a purely non-intentional non created process. I'm a purely physical process and this could be seen as equal in importance to the claim that the earth revolves around the sun, um, and that we're not the center of the universe. So, in fact, some scholars have, have made, made a suggestion, which seems plausible that the idea of natural selection is the most important idea in the sciences period. So this is not a course on evolution and expect people to have some background. If you don't have a background in it, you could get your background from, um, from external readings, but also from the grip. The Gray textbook and the Norton readings were both perfect. We'll each provide you with enough background to get up to speed.

Speaker 1:          10:29          But the general idea is that there are three components to natural selection. There's variation in this. Variation gives rise to different degrees of survival and reproduction and gets passed on from generation to generation and gives rise to adaptations. What Darwin described as, um, that perfection of structure to justly excites our imagination. And the biological world has all sorts of examples. You look at camouflage prior to Darwin, one might imagine that some intelligent creator crafted animals to hide from their prey, but now we have a different alternative, which is that animals that were better at hidden, um, survive better, reproduce more. And over the course of thousands, perhaps millions of years, they develop elaborate camouflage. There's been a lot of work on Paley's favorite example, the eye. So Darwin himself noted that the human eye did not seem to emerge all at once, but rather you can look at other animals and find parallels and other animals.

Speaker 1:          11:34          It seemed to suggest that more rudimentary forms are possible. And more recently, um, computer simulations have developed, have been developed that have crafted eyes, uh, under plausible assumptions of selective pressure. And, uh, what the starting point is. So this is the theory of natural selection. The good question to ask is why am I talking about evolution in introduction to psychology class? And the answer is that there are two ideas which come together and in fact they're both of the dangerous ideas. One idea is that that, um, Darwin's idea that biological forms evolve from this purely physical process. The second idea, um, the rejection of Descartes is that our minds are the product of physical things and physical events. You bring these together and it forces you to the perspective that what we are, our mental life is no less than I know less than camouflage the product of this purely physical process of natural selection.

Speaker 1:          12:46          More to the point, um, our cognitive mechanisms were evolved not to please God, not as random accidents, but rather for the purpose of survival and reproduction. Um, more contentiously you could argue they've been shaped by natural selection to solve certain problems. And so from an evolutionary point of view, when you look at what the brain is and what the brain does, you look at it in terms of these problems. And this is what, um, this is what psychology is for. This is what our thinking is for. Um, we have evolved mental capacities to solve different problems, perception of the world, communication, uh, getting nutrition and rest and so on. Now we're going to talk about how to apply evolutionary theory to, um, to psychology. But as we're doing so, we have to keep in mind two misconceptions are two ways you can go seriously wrong here.

Speaker 1:          13:51          The first is to think that, well, if we're taking an evolutionary approach, the natural selection will cause animals to want to spread their genes. So if we're being biological about it, that means everybody must run around thinking, I want to spread my jeans, I want us, you know, and, and um, and this is just really, oops, that shouldn't do that. This is really wrong. Um, it's, it's even in red. Uh, and what this fails to do is make a distinction between ultimate causation and proximate causation. And those are technical terms referring to ultimate causation. Is, is the reason why something's there in the first place. Over millions of years of history. Proximate causation is why you're doing it now. And these are different. Um, obviously for instance, animals do all sorts of things to help survive and reproduce, but a cockroach doesn't think, oh, I'm doing this to help survive and reproduce and spread my jeans.

Speaker 1:          14:49          A cockroach doesn't know anything about jeans. Um, rather the mechanisms that make it do what it, what it does are different from its own mental states. If it has any why it doesn't. This is the point nicely made by William James William James Ass. Why do we eat? And he writes, not one man and a billion when taking his dinner, everything. So utility he eats because the food tastes good and make someone more. If you ask them why you should want to do more of what tastes like that instead of revering you as a philosopher, he'll probably laugh at you for a fool. And certainly the common sense answer, why are you eating? Nobody's going to answer because I must sustain my body so as to spread my jeans in the future. Rather you eat because you're hungry. Those two theories you eat because you're hungry and you eat to sustain your body.

Speaker 1:          15:40          So you can spread your genes in the future are not alternative rather than different levels of explanation. Um, and you can't confuse them. The ultimate level, which does appeal to survival and reproduction, there's not, um, is, is independent from the psychological level. To give another example, um, people protect their children. So you ask, why do people protect their children? Why would somebody devotes so much effort to, to protecting and helping and feeding their children? Well, the evolutionary explanation is animals that don't protect their offspring don't last over evolutionary time. We protected our offspring because they contain 50% of our genes, but there's not the psychological explanation. Nobody but a deranged psychologists would ever answer, Oh, I love my children because they contain 50% of my genes. Rather the psychological explanation is a deeper is is, is different and has a different texture and this will be a lot clearer when we talk about the emotions where you could really see a distinction between the question of why we feel something from an evolutionary point of view and why we feel it from a day to day point of view.

Speaker 1:          16:56          The second misconception is that natural selection tales that everything is adaptive. That everything we do, everything we think is it that adaptive, this is wrong. Um, natural selection evolution more generally distinguished between adaptations and byproducts and accidents. Many of you are currently our will as you get older, suffer back pain. If I was asking, so why do you suffer back pain? How does back pain help you survive and reproduce? Well answers. It's not an adaptation. Back pain is an accidental byproduct of how our backs are shaped. Don't go looking for an adaptive reason for hiccups or self pity or bloating after you eat. There's all sorts of things a body will do that have no adaptive value, rather just accidents. We have a body that does all sorts of things. Some things that we'll do by accident and this is certainly true for psychology. Um, so a lot of the things for instance that occupy our interests, our fascination in day to day life are almost certainly evolutionary accidents. Um, the number that the three, three of the main preoccupations of humans are pornography, television and chocolate. But, but if I asked you, you know, why do you like porn? And you say, because my ancestors who liked porn and reproduce more than those who didn't, just not true.

Speaker 1:          18:36          Rather you like porn, assuming you do, um, as an accident, you have evolved. For instance, for instance, should you be a heterosexual male, you have evolved to be attracted to in it. That is most likely to be an evolutionary adaptation because being attracted to women and wanting to have sex with women is one step to the road to having kids, which is very good from an evolutionary perspective. It's so happens though in our modern environment that um, that people have created images that substitute. So instead of actually going out and seeking out women, you can just surf the web for hours and hours and watch dirty movies and read 30 books. Evolutionary adaptive, dead ends there. Accidents. Why do you like chocolate bars? Assuming that you do it is not because your ancestors in the African Savannah who enjoyed chocolate bars reproduce more than those who didn't. Rather it is because we've evolved the taste for sweet things and we've evolved as taste for sweet things in part because the sweet things in our natural environment like fruit, we're good for us in modern, in a modern world, we have created things like chocolate, which are not so good for us, but we eat anyway.

Speaker 1:          19:53          A lot of the debates, there's a lot of controversy in psychology over the scope of evolutionary explanations and a lot of the debate tends to be over what's an adaptation and what isn't. There are some clear cases. We have color vision. Why do we have color vision? Well, I think everybody would agree we have color vision as an adaptation because of the advantages it gives us for seeing and making visual distinctions. Um, we are afraid of snakes. We're going to talk about that in more detail, but there was a straightforward adaptive story about that. Um, we are afraid of snakes because really our ancestors who weren't afraid of snakes didn't reproduce as much as those that work. Um, we like chocolate bars and we enjoy NASCAR. Those are cannot be adaptations because chocolate bars in NASCAR, our recent developments that could not have been anticipated by evolution.

Speaker 1:          20:53          Those are easy questions. Here are some hard questions. Music everywhere in the world, people like music. Is this an adaptation for some selective advantage or is it an accident? Um, Steven pinker who wrote the language instinct that you read before, um, caused a huge amount of controversy when he argued that music is just an evolutionary accident. He described it as auditory cheesecake, something we like to gorgeous selves on that have no as no adaptive advantage. Other people argue music does have an adaptive advantage. Sometimes males used violence to coerce sex. Is Male sexual violence a biological adaptation or is it an accident? There's more than one language. Is that just an accidental byproduct of the way language works or is there some sort of group or selectionist advantage sketched out in some way of having multiple languages? What about visual art? What about fiction? What about our love for stories?

Speaker 1:          21:54          Those are all matters of heated debate. And so we have to keep in mind some things plainly are accidents. Some things almost certainly aren't accidents where the action is. And the study of psychology in the study of evolution of cognition, um, is trying to figure out which is which. So those are the misconceptions we have to avoid. But still, who cares? I mean, again, this is an introduction to psych course. Why are we talking about evolution? Why should it matter to a psychologist? How the mind has evolved? I'm going to talk about evolution now, but for rest of course I'm just interested in how our minds are period. So why would evolution matter how many people think it doesn't? Um, for instance, um, and they think it does and for different reasons. One claim is a metaphysical one. You might be a dualist, you might reject the idea.

Speaker 1:          22:51          You've mental life is the product of your brain. And hence evolution is irrelevant to psychology because the brain and the mind cause the brain which may have evolved has nothing interesting to do with the mind. Lisa Simpson got it wrong. Um, when she said the pope, he got it half right when she said the pope favorite evolution. It is true. John Paul the second, many years ago made a statement saying that Darwinian theory, um, is not incompatible. Darwinian theory is a view about the evolution of species that is not motivated by any animus, is a genuine scientific theory. And should it turn out to be true? Um, it is not incompatible. The truth about man, as taught by the church and scientists were thrilled by this and they were, they said he's endorsing evolution. What would a fewer people talk about is the fact that after he said this, he drew the line.

Speaker 1:          23:51          He allowed for evolution of the body, but he would not allow for evolution of the mind. So it was you wrote, if the human body takes us origin from preexisting living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God. Consequently, theories of evolution, which considering the mind is emerging from the forces of living matter or as a mere epi phenomenon, his matter are incompatible to truth about men. So you might not want evolution to be true about the mind because you might believe that the mind is not subject to the same physical laws as the rest of the physical world. That's one way you could reject evolutionary psychology. Another way to reject evolutionary psychology is to accept that the mines a physical thing, but then argue that all of these instincts and he's hardwired facets of human nature might exist for other animals, but they don't exist for people.

Speaker 1:          24:44          So to anthropologists, Ashley Montagu in 73 close to when the $6 million man, let me show him by the way, said with the exception of the reactions and infants a sudden withdrawals of support and a sudden loud noises. The human being is entirely instinct. Less man is man cause he has no instincts because everything he is and has become, he has learned from his culture for nomad and made part of the environment from other human beings. Um, you might say, look, he couldn't believe that in 74, but of course all of the infant studies that have come out since then, um, suggested that's not true and nobody would believe that nowadays. But in fact the view was often hold health. Um, Louis Banana in a New Yorker article a few years ago wrote every aspect of life has a biological foundation in exactly the same sense, which is that unless it was biologically possible, it wouldn't exist.

Speaker 1:          25:35          After that, it's up for grabs. And this is in the context of an argument that evolution can tell us anything about what's most interesting about people, man does not, is an educated intelligent scholar. He is presumably well aware of the findings of spell key and by our general about how people are hardwired to understand objects and social life and so on. But his point is just that when it comes to the more interesting aspects of human nature, the stuff we're naturally intuitively interested in that's more cultural and evolutionary theory and Darwinian theory was just doesn't have anything much to say about it. Not because the mind is separate from the brain but just because humans are much more cultural organisms. And so biology has little to say about it. Um, there's a third objection which is you might think, okay, the human mind actually does contain instincts.

Speaker 1:          26:31          We, there is a human nature but we should just study it by studying people. How good evolution, the study of evolution to consideration revolution tell us anything interesting. Um, I actually in my own work think evolution can tell us some interesting things and I want to try to make a case for ways in which evolution can inform and enlighten us about the mind as it is. First I want to make a point which is, um, although this course is intro psych and it is about the mind as it is still, I think by any account, the evolution of consciousness, morality and so on, just as is intuitively interesting. Um, it's the sort of thing that people are just fascinated by and I think it's a question of interest in and of its own right. But here's how it could tell us about psychology. For one thing, it can tell us what, what can be innate and what cannot.

Speaker 1:          27:30          So some problems, some evolutionary problems have been around for a long time and could lead to special biological adaptations. If I told you there was a biological adaptation for talking made selection, childcare, maybe it's true, maybe it isn't, but it's not crazy. From an evolutionary point of view, it's a reasonable possibility that it is. Other problems are recent and our brains could not be specialized to deal with them. Um, written communication, interacting with strangers, driving your car, playing chess. If you were to argue that there's a part of the brain devoted to playing chess, I would say you're utterly wrong. You can not be right because from an evolutionary point of view, there could be no such part of the brain evolve because playing chess as a recent innovation as a result of focus on evolution could help discipline us to make coherent claims about what is built in and what isn't built in.

Speaker 1:          28:30          Third, we're going to talk about human differences. In this course, we're going to devote a class to human differences of a sort of what makes you different from her, different from her. Why do we have different intelligences in his class? Why are some of US arrogant? And some of us humble, some of us like attracted to men, others attracted to women and so on. But there's also questions of group differences and evolutionary theory can help us say intelligent things about what sort of group differences you should expect. Because evolutionary theory predicts that some population should evolve in different ways than others. The most obvious example is that, um, children should it be different from adults. The evolutionary problems faced by a child are very different from an evolutionary problems faced by an adult. And you can make specific and rather interesting predictions about how children's brains should different differ from adults brains.

Speaker 1:          29:32          Evolutionary theory predicts, um, does not make any predictions about racial differences or ethnic differences. Some might exist, but there's no adaptive reason why humans who have evolved in different parts of the world should have profound differences, inner mental capacities. What does evolutionary theory say about sex differences? Well, it says some interesting things and we're going to devote a class to discussing them. But what I think is going to be true, proved to be important is that we'll be able to use evolutionary biology to talk sensibly about what sort of distinctions between the sexes, between males and females one would expect to find and what sort one wouldn't expect to find. We can make educated predictions. I'm going to have, I want to put here a clip of a man. This is a scene from a movie, the movie Roger Dodger that begins of a man making quasi evolutionary claims, but the difference you men and women. And I want to put this as an example of where you could call bar room evolutionary psychology. And, and I want to us to hold us in our minds because it's going to return to these claims and disgust or validity.

Speaker 1:          30:48          I like this for a few reasons. First, I liked that the backward reference to William James and utility. Um, second, it is a gorgeous combination of some things that are actually reasonably rational and total bull crap. Um, and, and but what evolutionary biology will give us is the tools to distinguish between the two, like on the face of it immediately, the ability to read maps, to claim it as a biological, that differences not ability have a biological roots is crazy. And the other hand, the claim that one that that males may develop a trait, not because it's advantageous, but to attract females is less crazy. The telepathic stuff is really crazy, but so I'm not at this point when a devoted lecture to sex, I'm not at this point want to make any claims one way or another. But what I want to suggest is that from a biological point of view, we could say sensible and an intelligent things about what differences should exist and what shouldn't.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Finally, and most of all, looking at something from the perspective of design directive of what's it for can often give you interesting insights as to its current nature. And I'll give you two quick examples. One that's not from psychology, one that is um, women suffer. Often women who are pregnant early in her pregnancy suffer from morning sickness, nausea, throwing up and so on. This is traditionally been viewed as of just a breakdown in the system. Too much hormones, everything's a skew. Women get nauseous. Margie profit, um, suggested an alternative and this one her to MacArthur genius award and this was the claim that maybe pregnancy sickness is not an accident. Rather, it's designed, it has a biological purpose in particular as the baby develops in the uterus, it is vulnerable to various sorts of poisons are to ratigans. Um, profit suggested that pregnancy sickness is a hyper sensitive period where women are extremely sensitive, get extremely nauseous towards the sorts of foods that could damage their baby.

Speaker 1:          33:00          Now if it's, you just ended there to story, how do we know it's true? But then she went on to examine it the same way that any scientist examines any claim by making predictions and testing them. And this makes them interesting predictions. It suggests the timing of onset and offset of pregnancy, sickness of morning sickness. It should correspond to the period of maximum vulnerability on the part of the developing embryo or fetus suggested a types of foods avoided should correspond to those sorts of foods that were most deadly for the fetus and that were deadly for the fetus during the periods where humans evolve. This last qualification is an important one. Women do not develop an aversion to alcohol during pregnancy. Even though alcohol is extremely dangerous to the developing child, the answer is an easy one. Alcohol wasn't around during our evolutionary history. And we can not have evolved a system to protect ourselves from it.

Speaker 1:          34:03          And finally, there should be a relationship between miscarriage and birth, birth defects in a surprising direction for profit. And she has evidence to back this up. Um, pregnancy sickness is not a glitch in the system. Rather it's the sign of a healthy, active protective mechanism going on. And in fact, the more prep morning sickness, the more the baby should be protected. Something which by and large appears to be true. That's an example of how the question when dealing with, they say, Hey, women, throw up when they get pregnant and then say, look, maybe that's not just a glitch. What's it for? You could then learn some interesting things. Here's a different example based on the last lecture, this wonderful lecture by Peter Salivate on sex and love where he talked about the big three. These are the big three to remind you of what attracts us to somebody else.

Speaker 1:          34:59          Um, you're very attracted to the person next to you or a person that because proximity, similarity, familiarity, and there is abundant evidence supporting the truth of this. It's almost always true, but in evolutionary psychologist looks at this and says there's something seriously wrong here. There's some cases where that has to be totally, absolutely mistaken to, to realize what does is think for a moment, what humans are you most close to, most similar to and familiar with. What humans did you spend over 10 years of your life with who are genetically and environmentally as close to you as if they were related, who you are intimately familiar with. Are those the humans that you find the hottest? Now they're your siblings and they are not hot.

Speaker 1:          36:07          Why was I was on Google images this morning. I put it up some hot siblings. Um, and but, but although we may find them hot, they do not typically with some rare and bizarre exceptions, find one another hot. Why not? Well, this is not a huge puzzle from the standpoint of evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology posits that humans as well as other animals should have incest avoidance. We should like, we should be attracted to those familiar to us, similar to us, close to us, but not kin kin are off limits. There's a good reason why, um, because if you intermate with your kin, you have bad offspring and so animal should be wired up not to meet with their kin. And in fact, this is, this is what happens. Um, there are parents of teenagers have all sorts of concerns and a lot of the concerns are in fact sexual.

Speaker 1:          37:14          Um, how do you keep your son and or your daughter from going out and having sex with too many people are the wrong people or unprotected sex, but there are no parenting guides in the world and say, how do you keep your, your, your children having sex with one another? You typically do not need to because they do not want to have sex with one another. Um, now this is actually also illustrates differently in proximate and ultimate causation. So you think for yourself, Ooh, do I want to have sex with my sister? You don't think to yourself, I would prefer not to confer for the offspring that we will create or be non-viable and it'll be a waste of my reproductive efforts. Rather you think, Ooh, because at a gut level you respond. Um, and this sort of instinctive response is what you get from an evolutionary analysis of sex.

Speaker 1:          38:05          But this story is deeply incomplete because the question that gets raised is how do you tell, you don't want to have sex with your kin, but how do you tell your kid people don't carry their DNA markers, uh, on strips that you could see. How do you tell who your Kinnar, and this actually turns out to be a really interesting question. It used and some research suggests that the answer is simple. You will avoid sex with people you grew up with. And these studies actually come from Kibbutz Studies, um, studies where people are raised communally on an Israeli kibbutz. They know they're not related, but it's still a fact that they were raised together as kids. Um, suggests that is a queue at a gut level, not to be attracted to one another. It turns out for some reason now to believe this story is incomplete. Um, a paper that came out in nature five days ago reported a series of extremely interesting studies and they found that the cue of being raised together as a child with somebody, yes, that does diminish sexual desire, but an even bigger Q was did you observe your parents? And in particular your mother taking care of that person if you did that seriously diminished in sexual desire and brings it down to the level of disgust. And again, these are the sorts of questions and issues you begin to ask when you approach things from an evolutionary

Speaker 2:          39:41          perspective. Okay. Um,

Speaker 1:          39:48          for this lecture, the rest of this lecture, and then the next couple of lectures I'll be discussing some basic aspects of human nature that are to some extent or another informed by evolutionary theory. And what I want to start for the remainder of this lecture is a discussion of rationality.

Speaker 1:          40:08          Now, some of you maybe not want to go into evolution, not, not wanting to go into psychology because there's no Nobel prize for psychology. You might all think, hey, if I'm going to go into the sciences, I won a Nobel prize. Think how proud bubby and 80 would be. If I want to Nobel prize. Well then that'd be the best. Um, you can get one. Um, psychologists have won the Nobel prize. Most recently, Danny Kahneman won a Nobel prize. You win an economics, sometimes medicine, not a big deal. Um, he wanted for his work done over the course of many decades on human rationality. And this work was done in collaboration with Amos Tversky who, uh, who passed away several years ago. Um, and this work entirely transformed the way we think about human decision making and rationality. Condiment and first ski caused a revolution in economics, psychology, and the social sciences more generally by causing us to shift from the idea that we're logical thinkers who think in accord with the axioms of logic and mathematics and rationality. More towards the idea that we actually have sort of rough and ready heuristics. These horistic served as well during the time during our evolutionary, but sometimes they can lead us astray. And I want to give some examples of these Horace sticks and I'll give four examples of heuristics that are argued to permeate our reasoning. The first is framing effects. This was a classic study by Kahneman and Tversky. Um, involving this sort of question

Speaker 1:          41:56          us is preparing for the outbreak of a disease is going to kill 600 people. There are two programs, program a, if you follow a 200 people will be saved. Program B, there's a one third chance everybody won't be saved and a two third chance nobody will be saved. Who would choose program be?

Speaker 2:          42:17          Okay,

Speaker 1:          42:17          who would choose program? Hey, hi and that fits the responses. Most people choose program a. That's could go either way. What's interesting is if you frame the question differently like this, you get very different responses. Instead of focusing on the people who will be saved, you focused on the people who will die and instead of focusing on the chance that nobody will die and she has every all I flip it around, you get a corresponding flip and this is known as a framing effect. The idea of a framing effect is that you can respond differently to a situation depending on how the options are framed. And in particular, this combines with loss aversion. People hate a certain loss. 4,000 of these people will die, is extremely aversive. And so the framing can influence your decisions and clever advertisers and clever decision makers will frame things in different ways.

Speaker 1:          43:22          Um, to give you, give rise to different intuitions. Sometimes it could be fairly simple. So, um, so you have this ad have a hamburger, it's 80% fat free versus 20% fat. You don't have to be a brilliant ad executive to figure out which one to go for. Um, it turns out that this sort of, um, fundamental act, the fundamental role of framing effects is not limited to humans. So I want to take a second and tell you some work done by my colleague Laurie Santos with capuchin monkeys. And what she does is she takes these capuchin monkeys and she teaches them to use money. She teaches them to use little discs to by themselves either pieces of banana or pieces of apple and they like to eat this and they very quickly learn. You can hand over a desk to get some banana or some apple. Now Dr. Santos and her colleagues have done many studies using this method for the study I'm interested in illustrating here shows framing effects. It needs nonhuman primates, so what she does is there's two options and one option. The experiment or shows, one object to the capuchin and low and then either gives one or two half the time, gives one half the time, give us two for an average of one and a half.

Speaker 1:          45:11          The other experimenter does exactly the same thing, gives one or two for an average of one and a half. What starts off displaying too now if you were a human, how would you feel about these two experimenters? They both give you the same amount and capuchins are extremely sensitive to how much they get, but it turns out as predicted. They don't like the pink experiment because the big experimenter is it gives you two shows you two and half the time he gives you one. This guy shows you one, half the time gives you two and over time they develop a preference for the experiment or it shows them one initially suggesting that they are being subject to framing effects or choices relative to reference point. A different sort of demonstration is the endowment effect. This is a robust and very interesting effect. Here's the idea.

Speaker 1:          46:07          I show you something like a cup or a chocolate bar and I say, how much will you give me for this chocolate bar? What was your pretty hard, how much are you give me for this chocolate bar? You say, Oh, I'll give you $2 for the chocolate bar. Both people on average give to the big chocolate bar, give us $2 per chocolate bar. The other conditions exactly the same except I hand you a chocolate bar and say, how much money will you sell me? That chocolate bar for their people say, ah, two 50 and in fact, what happens is once you own something, it's value shoots up and this is mystified economists and psychologists, it makes no sense. The chocolate bar does even have to move. I just leave it on the table and say either how much will you spend? How much will you give me for this? Or okay, it's yours. How much you want me to take it back? The answer is it's framing. If you're asking how much you want for it, it's a game. It just, how much will you pay to get something? But if he, if you're being asked, how much do you want for me to take it from you? You treat it as a loss and as a loss it becomes more valuable. Those are framing effects. The second example is base rates.

Speaker 1:          47:27          70 lawyers, uh, sorry, 70 engineers and 30 lawyers and John's chosen at random. Let me tell you about John. 40 years old, married three children, conservative, cautious, no interest in politics, awkward around people. His hobbies include carpentry, sailing, and solving mathematical puzzles like online dating. Um, what do you think John is a lawyer or an engineer who thinks he's a lawyer? Good. Who thinks he's an engineer? Okay. Most people think he's an engineer. But here's the thing. You switch it, right? 30 engineers, 70 lawyers. It doesn't change people. No matter what this number is, these numbers, it doesn't seem to change who you think he is or how confident you are. People look at John as an individual and they ignore the background status of where he came from. They ignore base rates. Base rates are very difficult to think about. And I want to give you an example of this.

Speaker 1:          48:33          Um, and the, the example will be on the slides for when you print them out, print it out because you might want to work through it yourself. But I'll give this to you quickly. Um, there's a disease that hits one in a thousand people, pretty common disease. There's a test for the disease and if you have it, it's going to tell you you have it. It tests for a certain thing in your blood and boom, if the thing is in your blood to test, we'll go boom. If you have it, it will tell you you have it doesn't miss. On the other hand, it's not perfect. It as a false positive rate of 5% so if you don't have the disease 5% of the time, the task will say you have it. So you know, if the test says you, you don't have it, you're fine. But it's that says you have it, maybe have it, but maybe, maybe it's a false positive. You take the test says you have to detect the disease without pen and paper. How likely do you think dogs are? Do you have a disease who says over 50% okay, before people sinisterly shouted the right answer. Um, people will tend, medical students were given us medical students less savvy than you, and the average is between 50% and 95%. The answer is that some people quickly noted 2% and here's how it works.

Speaker 1:          50:01          One person out of a thousand, we'll have the disease. That person will test positive tests never misses. That leaves 909, nine people who don't have the disease. And we'll say about 50% of these people have it. So for every 51, people who test positive, only one will happen to cease giving an average of about 2%. This sort of thing is very difficult. Our minds are not evolved to do base rate computation. And so any problems, base rate competition, including real world problems like what to do when you come back with a positive test, um, we screw up and often we screw up into direction of panic. The third bias is the availability bias. And this is simply that if you want to know how frequent something is, how available it is to come to mind is an excellent queue.

Speaker 2:          50:51          Okay?

Speaker 1:          50:51          But this could lead to mistakes. A classic example by condom a is you ask people one group of people how many English words and with n, g or what proportion of English words, another group of people, what proportion and with ing turns out you get much bigger numbers for ing than ng though of course. AndG has to g sorry, ng would include everything with ing. It's just a lot easier to think about these things.

Speaker 2:          51:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          51:25          This can show up in real world. What are your risk of getting killed? What's your risk of getting killed by a shark? Well, if you ask people what their risk of getting killed by a shark is, they characteristically overestimated, I will give you the news of what the risk is for getting killed by a shark injured. Um, in any given year one and 6 million killed one in 500 million. If you live in Florida, which apparently is shark central, your chance of getting injured is it about one and a half million people will overestimate the risks because shark attacks are very salient. There always reported in the news and are very interesting. What is the chance of getting killed by potato salad? Well, food poisoning, death by food poisoning, injury by food poisoning, runs to about one in 55 one in 800 for some sort of injury and one in 55,000 killed potato salad is one 1000 more times dangerous, more dangerous than shark attacks. But you get it wrong because you don't think, oh my God, big news story. Somebody dies by potato salad. And so we tend to over estimate the chance of being killed by dramatic facts.

Speaker 1:          52:51          How many Jews United States, what proportion? Who thinks it's over three quarters? The United States is Jewish. I'm kind of anchoring here. Okay, okay. Who thinks over half?

Speaker 2:          53:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          53:06          Who thinks over 40% who thinks over 20% okay, who thinks over 15%

Speaker 2:          53:14          okay,

Speaker 1:          53:15          who thinks over 10% who thinks over seven and a half percent? Who thinks over 5% hey, who thinks overall there's more than 5% of the United States is Jewish?

Speaker 2:          53:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          53:31          Who thinks over 3%

Speaker 1:          53:34          dancer is somewhere between 1.9 and 2.1%. Most people think the average American thinks is 20% service. Um, if you're curious about demographics and, and this map is, and to be entirely trusted cause I got it from Wikipedia. Um, um, this is the district, this is the distribution of the Jewish population self identified as Jewish and different parts of United States. Um, New York City is of course the most dense population with 9%. Um, new haven has 3.5%. Now why do people get it wrong? Well, there's all sorts of reasons and this is going to come out in the context of social psychology when we talk about how people think about human groups. But, but one quick answer is people who are plainly Jewish are prominent in, in positions where people notice them, like entertainment or in the case of have you guys academia? And this could lead to our dis availability.

Speaker 1:          54:47          Can I think of a Jew? Yeah. Um, this availability causes us to over estimate the proportion to which Jews are represented in the population. Final example. Confirmation bias. This is a very nice study. Um, it's very simple. It's a, you're the jury of a custody case. You have to, you have to give a child custody's a either a mother or father sole custody. One parent has average income, average health, average working hours, reasonable report for a child and a relatively stable Saltzer chosen life. Second parent has an above average income, minor health problems, lots of work related travel, a very close relationship with the travel with the child, and an extremely active social life. Think for a moment. Who would you award custody with? There's no, obviously there's no right answer here. Just just think for a moment. Who would award custody to a parent? A.

Speaker 2:          55:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          55:46          Who would award custody to parent B?

Speaker 2:          55:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          55:50          As I think there is in this room, um, when this study is done, there's a slight advantage to parent B. Here's what's interesting. You give another group of people this question, which parent would you deny custody to? You get a slight advantage for parent B. Now, this is to some extent an illustration of framing problems, but it's also more general illustration of the confirmation bias. So when you're asked to award custody to use instant ask, well, where's a good, where's the sign that someone is a good parent? And the good parent aspects of be jump out when asking what? Deny custody. You ask where's acute at somebody, he's a bad parent. And the bad parent aspects, uh, be jump out. In general, when we have a hypothesis, we look for confirmations. This makes some things which are logically easy, extremely difficult problems when you face them in the real world. And I'll end with my final example that of the waste in selection task. Here's the game and people, I don't want people to shout it out just yet. Um, there's four cards. Each card has a letter on one side and a number on the other side. You have to judge whether this claim is true or false. Um, if a card has a d on one side, it has a three on the other side. How many cards you have to turn over to test whether that rule is right.

Speaker 1:          57:24          Okay. Somebody shout out what one card is. You have to turn it over.

Speaker 2:          57:29          D everybody gets that right?

Speaker 1:          57:33          What else do you need to do? Any other cards?

Speaker 1:          57:39          How do people think it's, it's D in three. I'm raising my hand to foil. People answer either d or d and three, but think about it. What would make this rule wrong? It's wrong of as d on one side and not three another, right? That's what it would be to be wrong. You then look after to check d to see if there's a three and others hide. You will write about that. Did need to check eight to see if there's a d on the other side. Three is not that tell you anything that's hard. People find this very hard. Okay, big deal. But what's interesting is you can modify it in certain ways to make it a lot easier. And this is the work of leader caused meetings in her colleague, an evolutionary psychologist as Santa Barbara, who has argued that if you frame these questions in ways that makes ecological sense, people are much better at them. And basically she does studies where she has people who are evaluating a social rule. Imagine these cards on one side of the card is an alcohol is a drink. Uh, on the other side is the person's age.

Speaker 1:          58:52          You are a bartender and you want to make sure nobody under 21 drinks beer, which cards you turn over.

Speaker 2:          58:59          Okay,

Speaker 1:          59:00          well now it's easier, but the logic is the same. It's a violation that was under 21 on one side or another side. So you need to, to check the under 21 here. I need to check the beer here. And when you make these logical problems more ecologically valid, they turned out to be much easier.

Speaker 2:          59:23          Okay. Um,

Speaker 1:          59:29          there's a little bit more, but I'll hold it off till next class and I'll end with the reading response, which used to do your own bit of reverse engineering and evolutionary psychology. And I'll see you all on Wednesday.
