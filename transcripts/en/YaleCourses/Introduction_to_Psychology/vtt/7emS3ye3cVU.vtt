1
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.700
Last class,
we talked about the brain.

2
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.120
Now want to talk a little bit about some foundations.

3
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.510
So today and Monday we're going to talk about two very big ideas.

4
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.780
And these ideas are associated with Sigmund Freud and BF,

5
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.260
Skinner and our psychoanalysis and behaviorism.

6
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.750
And I want to talk about psycho analysis today and behaviorism next week.

7
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.880
Now,
one of these things,

8
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.710
one of the things that makes these theories so interesting is there scope,

9
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.430
um,
most of the work we're going to talk about in this class,

10
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:52.080
most of the ideas are narrow.

11
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.220
So we're gonna talk about somebody somebodies idea about racial prejudice.

12
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.220
Um,
but that's not a theory of language acquisition.

13
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.810
We'll talk about theories of schizophrenia,
but they're not,
um,

14
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.390
explanations of sexual attractiveness.

15
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.900
Most theories are specialized theories,

16
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.590
but these two views or grand theories,

17
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:17.760
they're theories of everything encompassing just about everything that matters

18
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.500
day to day life,
child development,
mental illness,
religion,
war,
love,

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.980
Freud and Skinner had explanations of all of these.

20
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.590
Now this is not a history course.

21
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.980
I have zero interest in describing historical figures in psychology just for the

22
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.120
sake of telling you about the history of the field.

23
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.550
What I want to tell you about though is I want to talk about these ideas because

24
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:45.850
so much rests on them.
And even more importantly,
um,

25
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.410
a lot of these ideas have critical influence on how we think about the present

26
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.550
and that's there.
Now,
for better or worse,

27
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.380
we live in a world profoundly affected by Sigmund Freud.
If I had to ask you,

28
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560
choose a psycho,
you know,
name a famous psychologist,

29
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.960
the answer most of you be Freud.
Um,

30
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.190
he's the most famous psychologist ever and he's had a profound influence on the

31
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:20.910
20th and 21st century.
Um,
some biographical information.

32
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:25.830
He was born in 1850s.
He spent most of his life in Vienna,

33
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.810
Austria,
and um,

34
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.620
but he died in London and he escaped to London soon after treating there,

35
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.620
um,
at the beginning of World War II as the Nazis began to occupy where he lived.

36
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.430
He's one of the most famous scholars ever,

37
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.210
but he's not known for any single discovery.
Instead,

38
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.790
he's known for the development of an encompassing theory of mind.
Um,

39
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.350
when did he developed over the span of many decades.
Um,

40
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.910
he was in his time,
extremely well known,

41
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.840
a celebrity recognize on the street and throughout his life he was a man of

42
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:04.990
extraordinary energy and productivity.
Um,

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.190
in part because he was a very serious cocaine addict,
but also just in general,

44
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:10.960
he was just a high energy sort of person.

45
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.610
He was up for the Nobel Prize in medicine and in literature.

46
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.530
Didn't get either one of them didn't get the prize in medicine because Albert

47
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.610
Einstein,
everybody loves Albert Einstein.
Well,
Albert Einstein really wrote a,

48
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.520
wrote a letter because they asked for opinions of other Nobel Prize,

49
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.310
wrote a letter saying don't give the price to Freud.

50
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.860
He doesn't deserve a Nobel prize.
He's just a psychologist.
Oh yeah.

51
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.330
S okay.
Um,

52
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.140
while he's almost universally acclaimed as a profoundly important intellectual

53
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.580
figure,
he's also the object of considerable dislike.
Um,

54
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.920
this is in part because of his character.

55
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.440
He was not a very nice man in many ways.

56
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.620
He was deeply ambitious to the cause of promoting psychoanalysis to the cause of

57
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:03.490
presenting his view and defending it.
Um,
and he was,
um,

58
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.690
often dishonest,
extremely brutal to his friends and,
and you know,

59
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.710
terrible to his enemies.
He was an interesting character.

60
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.750
My favorite Freud story was as he was leaving Europe during the rise of the

61
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:20.730
Nazis as he was ready to go to,
to go to England from,
um,

62
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.320
I think either Germany or Austria.
Um,

63
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.710
he had to sign a letter from the Gestapo.
Gestapo agents,
uh,

64
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.710
intercepted him and demanded he signed a letter saying that at no point had he

65
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.120
been threatened or harassed by the Gestapo.

66
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.730
So he signs the letter and any rights underneath it.

67
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.610
The Gestapo is not harm me in any way.
In fact,

68
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:47.110
I highly recommend a gestapo to everybody.
It's,
it's,

69
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.180
he had,
um,
a certain aggression to him.
Um,
he was also,

70
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:56.290
he's also disliked,
often hated because of his views.

71
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.510
He was seen as a sexual renegade out to destroy the conception of,

72
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.480
of people as good and rational and pure beings.
Um,

73
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.660
and when the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s,

74
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.730
he was identified as a Jew who was devoted to destroying the most sacred notions

75
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.880
of Christianity.
And to many extent,
to some extent,
um,

76
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.380
many people see in this way and to some extent,
um,

77
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.660
this accusation has some truth to it.
Um,

78
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.520
Freud made claims about people that many of us,

79
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.470
maybe most of us would rather not know well,
okay,
what did he say?

80
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.270
Well,
if you ask somebody who doesn't like Freud,
what he said,

81
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.260
they'll describe some of the stupider things he said.
And in fact,

82
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.880
Freud said a lot of things,
some of which,
um,
were not very rational.

83
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.520
For instance,
um,
he's well known for his account of Phallic symbols,

84
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:55.620
arguing certain architectural monuments are,
are,
uh,

85
00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.610
sub consciously developed as a penile representations.
Um,

86
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.690
and related to this,
he developed in a Tortilla.

87
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:05.490
It's theory of penis envy and penis envy isn't,

88
00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:10.100
isn't an account of a developmental state that every one of you who is female

89
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.930
has gone through according to Freud and ideas that you discovered at some point

90
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:18.830
in your development that you lack the penis.
Um,
this is not,

91
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.210
this is a catastrophe.

92
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.940
And so each of you inferred at that point that you had been castrated.

93
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.560
You had once had a penis,
but somebody had taken it from you.

94
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.850
Um,

95
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.850
you then turn to your father and love your father because your father has a

96
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.550
penis.
So he's the sort of penis substitute.
Um,

97
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.980
you reject your mother who's equally unworthy due to her,

98
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.330
her penis lack.

99
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.160
And that shapes your psychosexual development.
Now,

100
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.140
if that's the sort of thing you know about Freud,

101
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.160
you're not going to have a very high opinion of him or of his work.

102
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.970
But at the core of Freud's explanation,

103
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.150
the more interesting ideas is this as a set of claims of immense intellectual

104
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:11.630
importance.
And the two main ones are this.
The two main ones involved.

105
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:16.040
The existence of an unconscious unconscious motivation.

106
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.150
And the notion of unconscious dynamics are unconscious conflict,

107
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.190
which lead to mental illnesses,
dreams,
slips of the tongue.
And so on.

108
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.920
The first idea,
the idea of unconscious motivation,
um,

109
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.270
involves rejecting the claim that you know what you're doing.

110
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.950
So suppose you fall in love with somebody and you decide you want to marry them,

111
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.140
and then somebody was asked to ask you why.
And you'd say something like,
well,

112
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.690
I'm ready to get married this stage in my life.

113
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:51.410
I really love the person to person is smart and attractive.
I want to have kids,

114
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.580
whatever.
And maybe this is true,

115
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.470
but a Freudian might say that even if this is your honest answer,

116
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.390
you're not lying to anybody else still.
Um,

117
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:10.190
there are desires and motivations that govern your behavior that you may not be

118
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:14.450
aware of.
Um,
so in fact,

119
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.600
you might want to marry John,
um,

120
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.570
because you remind you of your father or because you want to get back at

121
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:25.070
somebody for betraying you.
Um,
if somebody was to tell you this,

122
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.150
you'd say,
that's total nonsense,
but that wouldn't deter fraud.

123
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.120
And a Floridian would say that these processes are unconscious.

124
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.340
So of course you just don't know what's happening.

125
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.380
So the radical idea here is you might not know what,

126
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:43.430
why you do what you do.
And this is something we,

127
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:46.850
except for things like visual perception,
we accept that.

128
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:49.670
You look around the world and you get sensations and you figure it out.

129
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.280
There's a,
there's a card,
there's a tree there,
a person,

130
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.590
and you're just unconscious of how this happens,

131
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.070
but it's unpleasant and kind of frightening did this could happen.

132
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.960
This could apply to things like why you're now studying at Yale,

133
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.670
why you feel the way you do towards your friends,
towards your family.

134
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.840
Now,
the marriage cases extreme,

135
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.190
but Freud gives a lot of simpler examples where this sort of unconscious

136
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.410
motivation might play a role.

137
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.430
So have you ever liked somebody or dislike them and not not know why?

138
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.570
Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you're,

139
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.560
you're doing something or you're arguing for something or making a decision for

140
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:33.930
reasons that you can't fully articulate?

141
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.620
Have you ever forgotten somebody's name at exactly the wrong time?

142
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.950
Have you ever call it the wrong name in the throes of passion?

143
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.820
This is all the Freudian unconscious.

144
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:46.560
The idea is that we do these things.

145
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:50.730
These things are explained in terms of of cognitive systems that we're not aware

146
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:51.570
of.
Now,

147
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600
all of this would be fine if you're unconscious was a reasonable rational

148
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:01.500
computer if you're unconscious was really smart and looking out for your best

149
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:06.330
interests.
But according to Freud,
that's not the way it works.
According to Freud,

150
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.040
there are three distinct processes going on in your head and these are in

151
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:15.540
violent internal conflict and the way you act in a way you think.

152
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.530
Our products not have a sealer,
rational being,

153
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.930
but have a set of conflicting creatures.

154
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.340
And these three parts are the Ed,
the ego,

155
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.690
and the Super Ego,
and they emerged developmentally.

156
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.190
The ID according to Freud,
is present at birth.

157
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.260
It's the animal part of the self.
It wants to eat,
drink,
pee,

158
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:43.590
poop,
get warm and have sexual satisfaction.

159
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.230
It is outrageously stupid.

160
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.220
It works on what Freud called the pleasure principle,

161
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.630
even wants pleasure and it wants it now.
And that's according to Freud,

162
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.480
how human begins pure Id.

163
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.360
Freud had this wonderful phrase,

164
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.800
polymorphous perversity is pure desire for pleasure.

165
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.370
Now unfortunately,
life doesn't work like that.

166
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.250
What you want isn't always what you get.

167
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.000
And this leads to a set of reactions to cope with.

168
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:20.001
The fact that pleasure isn't always there when you want it either by planning

169
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:24.900
how to satisfy your desires or planning how to suppress them,

170
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.590
and this system is known as the ego or the self and it works on the reality

171
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:35.040
principle and it it,

172
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.120
it works on the principle of trying to figure out how to make your way through

173
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:43.830
the world had a satisfy your pleasures or in some cases how to give up on them

174
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.713
and the ego,

175
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.670
the emergence of the ego for Freud symbolizes the origin of consciousness.

176
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.260
Finally,
if this was all there was,
it might be a simpler world,

177
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.440
but Freud had a third component that of the Super Ego and the Super Ego is the

178
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.390
internalized rules of parents and society.

179
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.380
So what happens in the course of development is you're just trying to make your

180
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:10.570
way through the world and satisfy your desires,

181
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.430
but sometimes you're punished for them some desires or inappropriate,

182
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.670
some actions are wrong and you're punished for it.

183
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.160
The idea is that you come out,
you get in your head a super ego,

184
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:26.170
a conscience in these movies.

185
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:30.490
It'd be like the little angel above your head that tells you when things are

186
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:33.640
wrong and basically yourself.

187
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:38.641
The Ego is in between the ID and the superego.

188
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.980
One thing to realize,
I told you the it is outrageously stupid.
It just says,

189
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.040
Oh,
hungry food,
sex,
oh,
let's get warm.
Oh,

190
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.370
the Super Ego is also stupid.

191
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.530
The Super Ego according to Freud is not some brilliant moral philosopher telling

192
00:12:56.531 --> 00:12:58.690
you about right and wrong.
The Super Egos like you,

193
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.860
you should be ashamed of yourself.
That's disgusting.
Stop doing that.
Oh,

194
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.630
and in between these two screaming creatures,
one of you,

195
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.390
one of them telling you to seek out your desires to other one telling you should

196
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:15.220
be ashamed of yourself is you,
is the ego.
Now,

197
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:18.340
according to Freud,
most of this is unconscious.

198
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.280
So we see bubbling up to the top.

199
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:26.281
We feel we experience ourselves and the driving of the air,

200
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:29.620
the forces of the Ed and the forces of the Super Ego,

201
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.950
our unconscious in that we cannot access them.

202
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.130
We don't know what it's like,
the workings of our,

203
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.920
of our kidneys or our stomachs.

204
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.250
You can't introspect and find them.

205
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.580
Rather they do their work without conscious knowledge.

206
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.620
Now Freud develop this,
this is the Freudian theory.
In,
in,

207
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.790
in broad outline,

208
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.180
he extended it and developed it into a theory of psychosexual development.

209
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.640
And so Freud's theory is,
as I said before,

210
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.730
a theory of everyday life of decisions of errors are falling in love,

211
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.900
but it's also a theory of child development.

212
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:14.610
So Freud believed there were five stages of personality development and each is

213
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:18.730
associated with a particular erogenous zone.

214
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.160
And Freud believed as well that if you have a problem at a certain stage,

215
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:27.100
if something goes wrong,
you'll be stuck there.

216
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.120
So according to Freud or people in this room who are what they are because they

217
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:35.110
got stuck in the oral stage or an anal stage,
and,

218
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:36.820
and that's not good.

219
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.490
So the oral stage is when you start off the mouth is associated with pleasure,

220
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.450
everything is sucking and chewing and so on.
Um,

221
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.660
and the problem for Freud is premature weaning of a child depriving him of the

222
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:54.050
breast,
um,

223
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.980
could lead to serious problems in his personality development.

224
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.950
It could make him as the phrase go,

225
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:06.020
goes into an oral person and there's orality could be described.

226
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.420
Literally it,
Freud uses,

227
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:13.421
has an explanation for why somebody might eat too much or chew gum or smoke.

228
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.560
They're trying to achieve satisfaction through their mouth of a sort.

229
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:21.620
They didn't get in.
It's very early stage of development,

230
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.450
but it can also be more abstract.
Um,

231
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.260
if your roommate is dependent and needy,

232
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.770
you could then go to your roommate and say,
you are an oral person.

233
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.710
The first year of your life did not go well.

234
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.920
A phrase even more popular is the anal stage.

235
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.880
And that happens after the oral stage and problems can emerge.
Um,

236
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.170
if Paula training has not handled correctly,

237
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.050
if you have problems where he knows years of life,

238
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:55.580
you could become an anal personality.
Um,
according to Freud.

239
00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:58.820
And your roommate could say your problem is you're too Amy.

240
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.160
And according to Freud,

241
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:04.970
literally it meant you were unwilling to part with your own feces.

242
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.860
Um,
it's written down here.
I know it's true.
Um,
and,

243
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.950
and the way it manifests itself as,
you know,

244
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:17.510
from just how people talk is your compulsive,
you're clean,
you're stingy.

245
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.670
This is the anal personality.

246
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.690
Then it gets a little bit more complicated.
Um,

247
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.730
the next stage is the phallic stage.
Actually,

248
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:27.170
this isn't that much more complicated.

249
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.960
The focus of pleasure shifts to the genitals.
Um,

250
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.710
and,
um,

251
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.740
fixation can lead to excessive masculinity in females or males or if you're

252
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:45.320
female,
need for attention or domination.
Now at this point,

253
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.210
something really interesting happens call the Oedipus complex.

254
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.460
And this is based on the story,

255
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:57.670
the mythical story of a king who killed his father and married his mother.

256
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.960
And according to Freud,

257
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.550
this happens to all of us in this way.
Well,

258
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:08.700
all of us by all of us,
Freud,
men,
men.
Um,

259
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.160
so here's the idea.
You're three or four years old,

260
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.580
you're in the phallic stage.
So what are you interested in?

261
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.190
What you're interested in your penis.
Um,

262
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.050
and then you seek an external,
our object,
Freud sort of vague about this,

263
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:28.370
but you know,
you seek some sort of satisfaction.
But who's out there,

264
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.340
who'd be sweet and kind and loving and wonderful.

265
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.650
Well mom,

266
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.670
so to trial and four in first mom is nice.

267
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.590
Hello mom.
So far,
so far.
So it's over.

268
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:45.740
This is not crazy little boy falling in love with his mother

269
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.170
problem.
Dad's in the way.
No.

270
00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.810
Now this is going to get progressively weird,

271
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:58.200
but I won't have to say as the father of two of two sons,

272
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.610
both the signs when to a phase where they explicitly said they wanted to marry

273
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:05.460
mommy and me.
If something bad happened to me,

274
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:09.420
that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
So,
so,
so there's this,

275
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.130
but now it gets,
it gets a little bit aggressive.
So,

276
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:17.850
so the idea is that child determines that he's going to kill his father.

277
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.540
Every three and four year old boy thinks this.
Um,

278
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.600
but then because children according to Freud don't have a good sense of the

279
00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:32.380
boundary between their mind in the world,
which is a problem.
The problem is,

280
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.540
is they don't,
they think their father can tell that they're plotting to kill him

281
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.680
and they figured a father is now angry at them.
And then they ask themselves,

282
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.570
what's the worst thing that could do to me?

283
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.580
And the answer is castration.

284
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.220
So they come to the conclusion that their father is going to castrate them

285
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.280
because they're elicit love for their mom.

286
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:04.330
And then they say bad ones and then they don't think about sex for several

287
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.030
years.
And that's the latency stage,
the latency stages.

288
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.130
They've gone through this huge thing of mom and dad fell in love of mom wanted

289
00:19:13.131 --> 00:19:16.280
to kill my father.
Dad was going to castrate me,

290
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.640
fell out of love of mom,
editor x business.

291
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.090
And it's x's repressed until you get to the genital stage.

292
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.460
And the genital stage is the stage.

293
00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:29.270
We are all in the healthy adult stage.

294
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.060
Um,
now,

295
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.260
now that you're adults and you've gone through all the developmental stages were

296
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.113
where do you stand?

297
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:42.130
You're not out of the woods yet because unconscious mechanisms are still,

298
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.820
even if you haven't got fixated or anything,
um,

299
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.650
there's still this dynamic going on all the time with your edge,
your ego,

300
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:55.640
and your Super Ego.
Um,
and the idea is your super ego.

301
00:19:55.641 --> 00:19:57.320
Remember your Super Ego is stupid.

302
00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.920
So your Subaru isn't only telling you not to do bad things.

303
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.270
It's telling you not to think bad things.
So what's happening is you're,

304
00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:12.200
your ed is sending up all of this weird six stuff,

305
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.940
all of these crazy sexual and violent desires.
Oh,
I'll kill him.
I'll,

306
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.230
I'll have sex with that owl.

307
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.340
I'll have extra helpings on my dessert.
And,
and your Subaru,

308
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.020
you're super easy.
No,
no,
no.
And this stuff is repressed.

309
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.120
It doesn't even make it to consciousness.

310
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.360
The problem is Freud at a very sorta hydraulic theory of what goes on.

311
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.720
And some of the stuff slips out and it shows up in dreams and it shows up in

312
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:46.160
slips of the tongue and an exceptional cases.

313
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.730
It shows up in certain clinical symptoms.

314
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080
So what happens is Freud described a lot of normal life as in terms of different

315
00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.751
ways we use to keep that horrible stuff from the ear making its way to

316
00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:04.720
consciousness.
And he called these defense mechanisms.

317
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.800
You're defending yourself against the horrible parts of yourself.

318
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.350
And some of these make a little bit of sense.
I mean,

319
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:18.600
one way to describe this in a non technical non Floridian ways,

320
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.210
there are certain things about ourselves we rather not know there are certain

321
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:27.040
desires we'd rather not know and we have ways to hide them.
So for instance,

322
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:31.750
there's sublimation.
Sublimation is you might have a line of energy,

323
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.300
maybe sexual energy or aggressive energy,

324
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.600
but instead of turning it to a sexual or aggressive target,

325
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.000
what you do is you focus it in some other way.

326
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:45.190
So you could imagine a great artists like Picasso turning the sexual energy into

327
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:47.620
his artwork.
There is,
um,

328
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.460
there's this placement.
This placement is,
um,

329
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:58.090
you have certain shameful thoughts or desires and you refocus the more

330
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:02.750
appropriately.
A boy who was bullied by his father,
um,

331
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.760
may hate his father and want to hurt him.
But since this would,

332
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:09.170
this is very shameful and difficult,
the boy,

333
00:22:09.171 --> 00:22:11.980
you might instead kick the dog and it's,

334
00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:15.330
think he hates the dog because that's a more acceptable target.

335
00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.813
<v 1>MMM.</v>

336
00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.580
<v 0>There's projection projection is I have certain turn in pulses I'm uncomfortable</v>

337
00:22:28.341 --> 00:22:33.200
with.
So rather than own them myself,
I project them to somebody else.

338
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.910
A classic example for Freud,
this homosexual desires.
Um,

339
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.890
the idea is that I feel this tremendous lust towards you,
for instance,
and any,

340
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.280
any of you,
only you,
you three.
Um,
and,
and,

341
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.200
and I'm ashamed of this lust.
So,
right?
So what I say is,
Hey,

342
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:55.160
are you guys looking at me in a sexual manner?
Are you lusting after me?

343
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.203
How disgusting.

344
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.930
Cause what I do is I take my own desire and I projected to others.

345
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.080
And Freud suggested perhaps not implausibly,

346
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:08.120
that man who believe other men who are obsessed with the sexuality of other men

347
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.170
are themselves projecting away their own sexual desires.

348
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.290
There's rationalization,
um,

349
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.310
which is that when you do something or think something bad,

350
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.630
you rationalize it and you give it a more socially acceptable explanation.

351
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.960
A parent who enjoys smacking his child will typically not say,

352
00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.900
I enjoy smacking my child.
Rather we'll say it's for the child's own good.

353
00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.120
I being a good parent by doing it this.
And finally there is regression,

354
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.580
which is returning to an earlier stage of development.

355
00:23:40.581 --> 00:23:45.581
And you actually see this in children in times of stress and trauma.

356
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.610
They'll become younger,
they will act younger,
they might cry,

357
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:52.490
they might suck her thumb seek or blanket or so on.

358
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.410
Now these are all mechanisms that for Freud or not the slightest bit

359
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:59.750
pathological,
they're a part of normal life.

360
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:05.260
Normally we do these things to keep an equilibrium among the different systems

361
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:09.530
of the unconscious,
but sometimes it doesn't work.

362
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.140
Sometimes things go awry.

363
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.090
And what happens is a phrase that's not currently used in psychology.

364
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.070
It was popular during Freud's time.
Um,
hysteria.

365
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.980
Hysteria includes phenomena like hysterical blindness and hysterical deafness,

366
00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:30.140
which is when you cannot see and cannot here,

367
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.760
even though there's nothing physiologically wrong with you.
Um,
paralysis,

368
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:38.600
trembling,
panic attacks,
gaps of memory,
including Amnesia and so on.

369
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.410
And the idea is that these are actually symptoms.

370
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.600
These are symptoms of mechanisms going on to keep things unconscious.

371
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.850
It's a common enough idea and movies often and movies,

372
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:56.150
what happens is somebody goes to an analyst,
they have some horrible problem,

373
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.500
they can't remember something or they have some sort of black outs and so on.

374
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.680
And the analyst tells them something and at one point they get this insight

375
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:12.210
and they realize what,
what,
why they blinded themselves,
why they can't remember.

376
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.580
And for Freud,
this is what happens.

377
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.760
Freud originally attempted to get these memories out through hypnosis,

378
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.460
but then move to the mechanism of free association.
And according to Freud,

379
00:25:26.461 --> 00:25:29.490
the ideas,
patients offer resistance

380
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.450
to this.
And um,

381
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.230
and then the idea of a psycho analyst is to um,

382
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.150
get over the resistance and help patients get insight.
The key notion of,

383
00:25:42.151 --> 00:25:42.501
of,

384
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:47.501
of psychoanalysis is your problems are actually,

385
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.890
um,
reflect deeper phenomena.

386
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.670
You're hiding something from yourself.

387
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.390
And once you know what's going on for deeper phenomena,

388
00:25:57.391 --> 00:25:58.530
your problems will go away.

389
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

390
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.230
<v 0>I'm going to give you an example of a therapy session.
Now,</v>

391
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:07.760
this is not a Freudian analysis we'll discuss later on in the course.

392
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:09.740
What are Freudian analysis is,

393
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.520
but this is not a pure 49th or 40 analysis supports is lying on a couch,

394
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.870
does not see their therapist or therapist is very non directive.

395
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:23.650
But I'm going to present this as an example here because it illustrates so many

396
00:26:23.811 --> 00:26:27.650
of the Freudian themes,
particularly themes about dreams,

397
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.670
the importance of dreams,
about repression and about hidden meaning.

398
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:37.360
So this is from a television episode and the characters,
many,

399
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.600
some of you may have seen this,

400
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:42.920
many of you will not have the character is suffering from panic attacks.

401
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.340
Um,

402
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.110
in particular he has panic attacks when he sees his first panic attack

403
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:53.910
originated when he walked to a swimming pool and he saw a family of ducks fly

404
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:58.080
away and he had a panic attack,
heart high,
heart pounding,

405
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.990
sweating,
flushed and he passed out.

406
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:05.880
And these panic attacks grew worse and worse until he saw a therapist who ended

407
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:09.570
up prescribing a medication.
And this is discussed as one of,

408
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.270
is one of the meetings he had with the therapist.

409
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.750
Freud's contributions extend beyond,
um,

410
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.650
the study of individual psychology and individual pathology.
Um,

411
00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.350
Freud had a lot to say about dreams.
Uh,
as you can see in this illustration,

412
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.850
he believed that dreams had,
um,

413
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:34.480
a manifest content meaning manifest meaning what you experienced in your dream.

414
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.560
But dreams always had a latent content as well,
meaning the hidden,

415
00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.120
the hidden implication of the dream.
He viewed all dreams,

416
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:47.110
his wish fulfillment.
Every dream you have is a certain wish you have,

417
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.140
even though it might be a forbidden wish that you wouldn't wish to have,

418
00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.100
you would want to have.
Um,
and dreams had.
And this is an idea,

419
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.720
a long predated Freud dreams had symbolism things in dreams.

420
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.940
We're often not what they seem to be,
but rather symbols for other things.
Um,

421
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.120
Freud believed that literature and fairy tales and stories to children and,

422
00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.700
and the like,
um,
carried,
um,

423
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.150
certain universal themes,

424
00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.660
certain aspects of unconscious struggles in certain preoccupations of our

425
00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:25.510
unconscious mind.
And Freud had a lot to say about religion.

426
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:31.150
Um,
for instance,
uh,
he viewed a large part of our,

427
00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.770
um,

428
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.770
of the idea of finding a singular all powerful God as seeking out a father

429
00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:39.970
figure that some of us never had during development.

430
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.320
What I want to spend the rest of the class on is the scientific assessment of

431
00:28:46.451 --> 00:28:50.650
Freud.
So what I did was so far as I've told you what Freud had to say in broad

432
00:28:50.651 --> 00:28:51.370
outline,

433
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:56.080
I then want to take the time to consider whether or not we should believe this

434
00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.450
and how well it fits with our modern science.
But before doing so,
um,

435
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.850
I will take questions for a few minutes.
Do people have any questions about,

436
00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.130
about Freud or Freud's theories?

437
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.243
<v 1>Yes,</v>

438
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.010
<v 0>it's an excellent question.</v>

439
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:26.360
The question is that the conflicts and psychosexual development that Freud

440
00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:27.770
described is,

441
00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:31.970
is always assumes that a child has a mother and a father,

442
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.790
one of each in a certain sort of familial structure.

443
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.920
And the question then is,
what if a child was raised by a single parent?

444
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.843
For example,

445
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:45.760
what if a child was never breastfed but fed from the bottle from the start?
And,

446
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:49.330
um,
and Freudians have had problems with this.
Freud.

447
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.890
Freud was very

448
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:52.190
<v 1>okay,</v>

449
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:56.030
<v 0>focused on family life of the people he interacted with,</v>

450
00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:59.010
which is rather upperclass Europeans and,

451
00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.850
and these sorts of questions would have been difficult for Freud to answer.

452
00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.460
I imagine that would afford,

453
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.290
Ian would have to say as you would expect systematic differences.

454
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.760
So you would expect a child who just grew up with a mother just grew up to be a

455
00:30:10.761 --> 00:30:15.460
father with a father to be in some sense psychologically damaged by that failing

456
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.810
to go through the normal psychosexual stages.

457
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.213
<v 1>Yes.</v>

458
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:27.810
<v 0>Um,</v>

459
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:32.790
the issue of the question is do modern psychoanalysts still believed that women

460
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.290
do not have super egos?
Um,
Freud was,
was,
as you're pointing out,

461
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:42.291
Freud was notorious for pointing for suggesting that women were morally immature

462
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.680
relative to men.
I think Freud would say that women had super egos.

463
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.070
They're just not the sort of sturdy ones that men have.
Um,

464
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.990
I think psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic scholars right now,
it would be mixed.

465
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.900
Some would maintain it a really our deep sex differences.

466
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.960
Others would want to jettison that aspect of Freudian theory.

467
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.053
<v 1>Yes.</v>

468
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.440
<v 0>Well,
what's sublimation is a lot of these,
it's a good question.</v>

469
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:19.600
The question is to sort of wet is sublimation,

470
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:24.010
how does it relate to other defense mechanisms?
A lot of defense mechanisms.

471
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.903
Um,

472
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:25.750
<v 1>okay.</v>

473
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.350
<v 0>Involve taking a desire and turning it.</v>

474
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.040
Now what displacement does is it takes it from you to her like I'm angry at you

475
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:40.020
but maybe that's forbidden for some reasons I'll be angry at her.
Um,

476
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:44.860
what projection does is takes a desire for me and then puts it on somebody else

477
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:45.694
heading outwards.

478
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.470
And what sublimation does is it just gives up the details and keeps the energy.

479
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.510
So you stay up,
you know,

480
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.560
your roommates stays up all night working and you say to your roommate for

481
00:31:56.561 --> 00:31:57.394
instance,
um,

482
00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.480
that's just because you haven't had sex in a long time and you want to have sex

483
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.950
to do it all your energy to your math exam and then,
and then you say,

484
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.800
that's sublimation.
I learned that in intro psych

485
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.200
and your room may be very pleased.
Um,
one more,
one more question.

486
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.923
<v 1>Yes.</v>

487
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.871
<v 0>The question is,</v>

488
00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:34.860
which is related to the issue extending the issue of the two parent versus one

489
00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:38.910
fat here and family is to what extent are these notions validated across?

490
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.900
And that's such a good question.
I'm going to defer it.

491
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:43.940
I'm gonna talk about it in a few minutes cause that's actually,

492
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.680
that speaks to the issue of the scientific assessment of fried.

493
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:53.390
So I'm going to try to get to your question in a little bit.
Um,

494
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.930
fry Friday and theory is now at this point,

495
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:03.250
the time extremely controversial.
Um,

496
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.360
and there was a lot of well known criticisms and attacks on Freud.

497
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.540
This is just the actually an excellent book on the memory wars by Frederick

498
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.710
Cruise,
which,
um,

499
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.220
and Frederick Cruz is one of the strongest and most passionate critics of Freud.

500
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.000
And the problems with Freud,
um,

501
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:29.060
go like this.
There are two ways you could reject the theory.

502
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.230
There are two problems with a scientific theory.
Um,

503
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.030
one way you could reject the theory is that it could be wrong.
So,

504
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:41.750
suppose I have a theory that the reason why some children have autism,

505
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.620
a profound developmental disorder is because their mothers don't love them

506
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:49.130
enough.
This is a popular theory for many years.

507
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.600
It's a possible theory.
It just turns out to be wrong.

508
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.660
But another way.
And so one way to attack and address a scientific theory is,

509
00:33:59.661 --> 00:34:03.980
um,
is to view it as,
um,
just to see whether or not it works.

510
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.810
But there's a different problem.
A theory could have a theory,

511
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:13.790
could be so vague and all encompassing that,
um,

512
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.410
that it can't even be tested.

513
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:20.390
And this is one of the main critiques of Freud.
Um,

514
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.780
the idea could be summed up by a quotation from the physicist Wolfgang Pauli and

515
00:34:26.361 --> 00:34:31.361
Polly was asked his opinion about another physicist and Polly said this,

516
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.140
that guy's work is crap.
He's not right.

517
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.150
He's not even wrong.

518
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:43.010
And the criticism about Fridays is that he's not even wrong.

519
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:44.263
Um,

520
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:49.780
the issue of vagueness is summarize in a more technical way by the philosopher

521
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.810
Karl popper who describe who,

522
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.680
who introduced a term of falsifiability.

523
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.330
<v 1>Uh,</v>

524
00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.270
<v 0>the idea falsifiability</v>

525
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:07.250
is that what distinguishes science from non science is that scientific

526
00:35:07.771 --> 00:35:10.980
predictions make strong claims about the world.

527
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:16.220
And these claims are of a sort that they could be proven wrong if they couldn't

528
00:35:16.381 --> 00:35:20.610
be proven wrong.
They're not interesting not to be science.
So for example,

529
00:35:20.611 --> 00:35:21.630
Vince psychology,

530
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.920
the sorta claims will be entertaining throughout the course include claims like

531
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:31.190
damage to the hemp hippocampus causes failures of certain sorts of memory or

532
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.470
everywhere in the world,
man,
on average,

533
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.540
one to have more sexual partners than women or exposure to violent television

534
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.230
tends to make children themselves more violence.
Now,

535
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.410
are they true or are they false?
We'll,
we'll talk about that.

536
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.900
But the point here is they can be false there.

537
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.000
Interesting enough that they can be tested.

538
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.390
And as such,
they go to,
they might be wrong,

539
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.390
but they graduate to the level of a scientific theory.
Um,

540
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.770
this should be contrasted with nonscientific programs.

541
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.790
And the best example of a nonscientific program is astrology.

542
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:14.990
So the problem with a straw with astrological predictions is not that they're

543
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:18.930
wrong,
is that they can't be wrong.
They're not even wrong.
I did my,

544
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.800
I got my horoscope for today on the web.

545
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:24.763
Um,

546
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.010
a couple of negative aspects could make you a little finicky for next few days.

547
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.230
Okay,
I'm going to watch for that.
The presence of both Mars and Venus suggestion.

548
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.060
You want to box everything into a neat ordered stat structured way,

549
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.470
but keeping a piece of jade or chameleon close will help you keep in touch with

550
00:36:40.471 --> 00:36:41.400
your fund side.

551
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.880
And starting this morning I got from my wife a little piece of jade and I had

552
00:36:44.881 --> 00:36:46.500
been sort of in touch with my fun side.

553
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.150
The problem is a few days aren't going to go by and said,
God,
that was wrong.

554
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.420
It can't be wrong.
It's,
it's just so vague.

555
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.210
I got a better horoscope from the onion actually

556
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.190
riding in a golf cart with snow cone in hand.

557
00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:05.160
You'll be tackled by two police officers this region after imagining your

558
00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.620
competence,
that caricature of I've suspected murderer.

559
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.820
<v 1>Now
that's,</v>

560
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.490
that's a good prediction because,

561
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.040
because wow,

562
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.120
<v 0>if it's,
if it turns out to be true,</v>

563
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.780
I'm going to say those guys really know something.
It's falsifiable.

564
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:23.703
Um,

565
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.300
arguably Freud fails the test because Freudian theory is often so vague and

566
00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:36.510
flexible that it can't really be tested in any reliable way.

567
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.770
A big problem of this is a lot of Freudian theory is claimed to be validated in

568
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:43.440
the course of psycho analysis.
So when you ask people,

569
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:46.890
why do you believe in fried,
they won't say,
oh,
because of this experiment,

570
00:37:46.891 --> 00:37:50.730
that experiment,
this Dataset and that Dataset.
What I'll say is it's Freud's,

571
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.180
the Freudian theory proves itself in the course of psycho analysis,

572
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.170
the success of psychoanalysis.
But it's unreliable.

573
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.440
I mean the problem and say,
Freud says to a patient,
you hate,
your mother.

574
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.220
Patient says,
wow,
that makes sense for it says,

575
00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:10.530
I'm re phrase it,
you hate your mother.
I mean there's no,

576
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:11.940
I don't want to stare like that's disgusting.

577
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:16.110
Freud says your anger shows this idea is painful for you.
Who Preston from dying.

578
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.963
I am right.

579
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:21.570
<v 1>And,
and the problem is the</v>

580
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.570
<v 0>same sort of dynamic plays itself out even in the scientific debate back and</v>

581
00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:32.730
forth.
Um,
so Freud,
Freud and psychologist,
I'm putting Floyd here,

582
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:36.370
but what I mean is well known defenders are for,
we'll make some claims like,

583
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.120
you know,

584
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.480
adult personality traits are shaped by the course of psychosexual development.

585
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.550
All dreams or disguise,
wish fulfillment.

586
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:45.070
Psychoanalysis is the best treatment for mental disorders.

587
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.050
Scientists will respond.
I disagree.

588
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:50.350
There's little to no evidence supporting those claims and fraud in responses.

589
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.870
Your rejection of idea shows that he or distressing to you.

590
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:58.030
This is because I am right.
And this is often followed up seriously enough.

591
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.770
You have deep psychological

592
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.560
<v 1>problems
and</v>

593
00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:05.723
now,

594
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.330
<v 0>no,
I don't want to caricature her.</v>

595
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.370
Freudians a lot of Floridians have tried and made a research program of

596
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:17.230
extending their ideas,
scientifically,
bringing them to a robust scientific tests.

597
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.453
<v 1>MMM.</v>

598
00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.560
<v 0>But the problem is when you make specific falsifiable predictions,</v>

599
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.430
they don't always do that well.
Um,
so for instance,

600
00:39:28.431 --> 00:39:31.040
there's no evidence that oral and anal characteristics,

601
00:39:31.041 --> 00:39:33.110
the personality characteristics I talked about,

602
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.930
about being needy versus being stingy,

603
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.440
relate in any interesting way to weaning or toilet training.

604
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.640
And there's been some efforts cross culturally to it.

605
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.670
To go back to the question this young man asked before looking at cross cultural

606
00:39:48.261 --> 00:39:50.150
differences in toilet training and weaning,

607
00:39:50.151 --> 00:39:54.410
which are really big differences to see if they correspond in any interesting

608
00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:56.540
way to personality differences.

609
00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.950
And there's been no good evidence supporting that.
Um,
similarly,
um,

610
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.660
Freud had some strong claims about sexuality for why some people are straight

611
00:40:05.661 --> 00:40:09.950
and others are gay.
Um,
these have met with very little empirical support

612
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:16.690
and the claim that psycho analysis proves itself by being by its tremendous

613
00:40:16.701 --> 00:40:21.701
success in curing mental illness is also almost certainly not true for most,

614
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:22.731
maybe not all,

615
00:40:22.731 --> 00:40:26.450
but for most psychological disorders there are quicker and more reliable

616
00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:28.400
treatments,
then psycho analysis.

617
00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:33.530
And there's considerable controversy as to whether the Tony Soprano method of

618
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.710
insight where you get an insight and there's discovery,
oh,

619
00:40:36.711 --> 00:40:41.711
now I know makes any real difference in alleviating symptoms such as anxiety

620
00:40:42.891 --> 00:40:44.690
disorders or depression.

621
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.850
<v 1>Um,
this is why,</v>

622
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.920
<v 0>who sort of often sort of a sticker shock when people go to a university</v>

623
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:58.060
psychology department where they say,
look,
hey,
where's,
um,
so I mean,

624
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:02.320
it's like how can I take classes on Freud?
Who's your expert on Freud?

625
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.900
And the truth is Freudian psychoanalysis is almost never studied inside

626
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:09.890
psychology departments.
Um,

627
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.350
not the cognitive or developmental side,
not the clinical side.

628
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.170
There are some exceptions,
but for the most part,

629
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.220
even the people who do study for right within psychology departments do so

630
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:22.054
critically.

631
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:27.210
Not Very few of them would see themselves as a psycho analytic practitioner or

632
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:30.000
as a Freudian psychologist.
Um,

633
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.340
Freud lives on both in a clinical setting and in the university.

634
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.620
But Freud at Yale for instance,

635
00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:39.770
as much more likely to be found in the history department or the literature

636
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:43.100
department been in the psychology department.
And is this typical enough?

637
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.283
<v 1>But</v>

638
00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.370
<v 0>despite all of this sort of sour things I just said about Freud,</v>

639
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.410
the big idea,

640
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.540
the importance of the dynamic unconscious remains intact.

641
00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.570
We will go over and over and over again.

642
00:42:01.571 --> 00:42:05.710
Different case studies were some really interesting aspects of mental life.

643
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.310
Prove to be unconscious.

644
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.830
Now there's one question.

645
00:42:11.831 --> 00:42:16.720
I'm actually going to skip over this for reasons of time.
Um,

646
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:22.020
and just go to some examples of the unconscious in modern psychology.

647
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.800
So here's a simple example of the unconscious in modern psychology.

648
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:33.520
Um,
language understanding.

649
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.010
So when you hear a sentence like

650
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:42.130
John thinks that bill likes him in a fraction of a second,

651
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:47.680
you realize that this means that John thinks the bill likes John.

652
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.020
If you were to sentence oops,

653
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:54.460
John thinks that bill likes himself in a fraction of a second,

654
00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.000
you would think that it means John thinks that bill likes bill.

655
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.970
And as we will get to when we get to the lecture on language,

656
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.640
this is not conscious.
You don't know how you do this.

657
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.410
You don't even know that you are doing this,

658
00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.020
but you do it quickly and instinctively.

659
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:13.520
So much of our day to day life can be done unconsciously.
Um,

660
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.860
there are different activities you can do driving,

661
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:21.490
chewing gum,
shoe lace,
tying where if you're good enough at them,

662
00:43:21.491 --> 00:43:24.490
if you're expert enough at them,
you don't know you're doing them.

663
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.470
I was at a party a few years ago for a friend of mine and we ran out of food.

664
00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.960
So he said,
oh,
I'll just go pick up some food.

665
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.750
An hour later he was gone.

666
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.650
Still gone and it was supposed to be around the corner and we call them up on

667
00:43:38.651 --> 00:43:41.350
his cell phone and he said,
oh,

668
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.690
I got on the highway and I drove to work.

669
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.680
He works like an hour away.

670
00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:52.681
We go on the highway and the some version of these things happen all the time.

671
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.793
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

672
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:04.110
<v 0>Maybe more surprising Freud's insight that our likes and dislikes are due to</v>

673
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:11.530
factors that were not necessarily conscious of,

674
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.390
has a lot of empirical support,

675
00:44:13.391 --> 00:44:17.980
a lot of empirical support from research into social psychology,
for example.

676
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.630
Um,
so here's,
here's one finding from social psychology.
Um,

677
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.920
if somebody goes through a terrible initiation to get into a club though,

678
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.100
like the club more,

679
00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.280
you might think they'd like it less because people do terrible things.

680
00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.790
But actually hazing is illegal,

681
00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:44.620
but a remarkably successful tool.
Um,
the more you pay for something,

682
00:44:44.621 --> 00:44:48.880
the more you like it and the more pain you go through to get something,

683
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.860
the more you'd like it.
Um,
from the standpoint of political of politics,

684
00:44:53.861 --> 00:44:58.510
for instance,
um,
if you,
if you want loyal people in a political campaign,

685
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.320
do not pay them.
If you pay them,
they'll like you less.

686
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.950
If they volunteer,
they'll like you more.

687
00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:10.360
And we'll talk about why there's different theories about why.

688
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:15.250
But my point right now is simply that people don't necessarily know this,

689
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.290
but still they're subject to this.

690
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.920
Another example is some weird studies done in a discipline of social psychology

691
00:45:24.431 --> 00:45:26.860
known as terror management,
um,

692
00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:30.220
which involves subliminal death primes.

693
00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.970
The idea of subliminal death primes is this,

694
00:45:33.971 --> 00:45:38.050
you sign up for your human subjects requirement and then you,
um,

695
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.710
they put you in front of a computer screen and then they tell you,
oh,

696
00:45:41.711 --> 00:45:44.260
just sit in front of a computer screen and we'll ask you some questions.

697
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.710
And then the questions come out and her questions like,

698
00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.240
how much do you love your country?
What do you think of Asians?

699
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.350
What do think of Jews?
What do you think of blacks?
I think of vegetarian,

700
00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:01.060
we think people political views different from yours.
Here's the gimmick.

701
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:05.140
What you don't know is on that computer screen,
words are being flashed

702
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.433
<v 1>like that,</v>

703
00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:12.940
<v 0>but there are being flashed so fast it looks like,</v>

704
00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:17.710
like that you don't see anything where it's like corpse dead,

705
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.520
dying.
The flashing of these subliminal word,

706
00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:27.521
subliminal meaning a fancy term meaning below the level of consciousness you

707
00:46:27.731 --> 00:46:32.731
don't know you're seeing them has dramatic effects on how you answer those

708
00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:36.310
questions.
People exposed to death crimes,
um,

709
00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:40.870
become more nationalistic,
more patriotic,

710
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.960
less forgiving of other people,

711
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.130
less liking of other races and people from other countries.

712
00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:49.323
Again,

713
00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.290
the claim back summation for why this is so is something which we'll get to

714
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.163
another class.

715
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:57.880
The point now is simply to illustrate that these sorts of things can have,

716
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.140
that things you aren't aware of can have an effect on how you,

717
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.200
I think the final example I'll give this is a short demonstration.

718
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.490
Um,
to do this,
I'm going to cut the class in half at this point.

719
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:16.270
So you'll be on this side of the class,
the right side,
my right,

720
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.360
and this will be on the left side.
And I simply want,

721
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:21.643
<v 1>okay,</v>

722
00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.540
<v 0>everybody to think about somebody you love.</v>

723
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:34.090
So think about somebody you love,
your girlfriend,
your boyfriend,
your mom,

724
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.120
<v 1>your dad.
Think about somebody you love.
Just,</v>

725
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.320
okay.
Now

726
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.420
<v 0>on this screen is going to be instructions,</v>

727
00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:48.060
but I want to give them instructions to this half of the class.

728
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:50.010
I'm going to ask everybody in this half the class,

729
00:47:50.011 --> 00:47:53.140
please either turn your head or shut your eyes.
Okay?

730
00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:59.570
Teaching fellows to buy and everybody on this half obey.

731
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.010
Okay?
Has Everybody read that?

732
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.633
<v 1>Okay?</v>

733
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.300
<v 0>Okay,
now turn your head this group.</v>

734
00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.150
Now this group,
look at this

735
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.160
can take a moment.
You don't have to do it on paper,

736
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.280
but take a moment to do it in your head.
You,
each group had instructions,

737
00:48:31.281 --> 00:48:32.760
some people might have seen both instructions.

738
00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:34.410
Follow the instructions that you bought for you.

739
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:38.993
<v 1>Okay?</v>

740
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.370
<v 0>Now this was research done</v>

741
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.000
by Norbert Schwarz.

742
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:46.613
<v 1>And</v>

743
00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:52.050
<v 0>here's the question I want you to ask yourself.
How much do you like this person?</v>

744
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.470
<v 1>Okay,</v>

745
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:54.490
<v 0>and here's the effect.</v>

746
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:57.820
Half of you were asked to list three features of the person.

747
00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.360
Half of you were asked to list 10.
The finding,

748
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:06.390
which is not a subtle finding is that liking goes up in the three group and

749
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:10.090
liking goes down in the 10 group.
And here's why.

750
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:15.790
I have to think about um,
three positive features of um,

751
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:21.700
of somebody.
So I don't think my girlfriend,
I have a girlfriend,

752
00:49:21.701 --> 00:49:24.130
I think my daughter,
oh,
she's smart,

753
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:28.350
she's beautiful and she's kind of good.
How much do,
what do,

754
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:32.950
what do I think of her?
Pretty good.
SMART,
beautiful con might be well,
yeah,

755
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:37.180
but the problem now,
Schwartz is clever though.
He says,
listen,

756
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:41.130
the other group gets 10 positive features.
SMART,
beautiful,
kind,

757
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.900
really nice,
good cook,

758
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:51.890
punctual,
smart.

759
00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.360
No,
I mentioned that.

760
00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.950
The problem is nobody has 10 positive features

761
00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.380
<v 1>and,
and</v>

762
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:05.240
<v 0>that they're being asked to do 10 pounds and features is people find this hard</v>

763
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:10.200
and then those people won't ask,
how much do you like this person?
I'm say,

764
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:15.560
couldn't really make it that 10.
I guess.
I don't like them very much.

765
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.070
Not appointed.

766
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:22.070
This illustration again is that it shows that you don't know this subjects who,

767
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:29.180
who are asked to do 10 positive features and then later ranked a person lower

768
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.150
and then ask why did you rank the person lower?

769
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.310
Don't say because you told me to list him.

770
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:40.400
Typically we are oblivious to these factors that change our points,

771
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:42.500
what we like and what we dislike.

772
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.570
And this is in fact a substantial and important part of the study of psychology

773
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:51.710
and particularly for instance the study of racial and sexual prejudice.

774
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:56.180
We're one of the big findings from social psychology and we'll devote almost an

775
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:57.440
entire lecture to this,

776
00:50:57.441 --> 00:51:01.880
is that people have strong views about other races,

777
00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.450
um,
that they don't know about

778
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.740
and that they don't know,
control their actions.

779
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:16.020
So to some extent this rounds out Freud cause it's to some extent,
um,

780
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:21.590
the particulars of Freud are for the most part have been rejected.

781
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:25.190
But the general idea of Freud is actually,

782
00:51:25.191 --> 00:51:30.191
it's been so successful both in the study of scientific psychology and in our

783
00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:34.760
interpretation of everyday life that to some extent Freud's been a victim of his

784
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:35.690
own success.

785
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.960
We tend to to underestimate the importance of Floridian thought in everyday

786
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.350
life.
Um,

787
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:48.430
because he's transformed our worldview to session extent that it's difficult for

788
00:51:48.951 --> 00:51:51.500
us to remember that there's any other way to think about it.

789
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.600
So to some extent he's been a victim of his own success.
We have time for,
um,

790
00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.320
for some further questions about Freud and about scientific implications of

791
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:01.154
fried.

792
00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:06.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

793
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.660
<v 0>I took a class once on how to teach when I was a graduate student and I just</v>

794
00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.430
remember two things from this class.

795
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.900
One thing is never great and red pen posted.
People don't like that.

796
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.790
The second thing is never ask any questions because [inaudible] is very

797
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:26.630
frightening to any questions and people find it's intimidating I suppose to ask.

798
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.940
What are your questions?
So what are your questions?

799
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.183
Yes.
And back.

800
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.093
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

801
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.170
<v 0>Detroit believe in
medication.</v>

802
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:48.160
Fred Headen it's a good question.
Um,

803
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.900
the question was does the Freud believe in medication?

804
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.100
Medication of course being a major theme of how we deal with certain disorders

805
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:58.330
now,
particularly depression and anxiety disorders.
Um,

806
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.060
on the one hand Freud made it start as a neuroscientist.

807
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.540
Freud studied the mind and the brain,

808
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:10.630
and it was intensely interested in the neural basis of thought and behavior.

809
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:14.480
But to answer your question to end is no,

810
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:17.390
although Freud was very sensitive to the brain basis of behavior,

811
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.710
Freud was totally convinced that the method through which to cure disorders like

812
00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:25.070
depression and anxiety would not be medication.
Um,

813
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:29.040
but rather through the sort of talk therapy and insight.
Moreover,

814
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.530
modern psycho and modern therapists,

815
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:37.200
including some people who aren't psychoanalytically,
um,
define,

816
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.500
we'll say,
look,
these drugs are all well and good,

817
00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:45.000
but what they do with they mask the symptoms.
So if you have panic attacks,

818
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:49.560
say it's true that drugs might make the panic attacks go away,

819
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.380
but the panic attacks are actually not your real problem.

820
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:57.840
And by making them go away,
you don't get to the root of your problem.
So dancers,

821
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.590
both Freud and modern day psychoanalysts would think that medications are

822
00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:05.130
substantially overused in the treatment of mental disorders.
Yes.

823
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.823
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

824
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.940
<v 0>The question is what about research on dreams?</v>

825
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:20.060
Dreams is such a fun topic that I want to devote half a class to sleeping and

826
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:25.290
dreams.
So,
for instance,
I will answer the question,
what is the most common dream?

827
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:29.040
I will also answer the question,
who thinks about sex more and greens,

828
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:32.190
men or women?
And what proportion of,
oh,
there's so many great questions.

829
00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:36.760
I won't answer dreams from a [inaudible] standpoint.
Um,

830
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:42.140
there's been some evidence that dreams do in some often do have some

831
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.320
relationship to what you're thinking about and worrying about through the day,

832
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.600
but the strong Freud Ian View.

833
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:52.920
But symbolism and wish fulfillment has not been supported by the study of
dreams.

834
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:55.143
<v 1>Right.</v>

835
00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:00.880
<v 0>What are your other questions?
Yes.</v>

836
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:04.120
Whoever Eric is pointing to.
Purple Shirt.

837
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:05.883
<v 1>Yes.</v>

838
00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:10.570
<v 0>The electro complex.</v>

839
00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:16.000
The Electra Complex is the penis envy story.
Um,

840
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.930
Freud developed business.
This is it.
This is a crude summary,

841
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.760
but Freud developed the oedipal complex.
You know,
mom,
I love mom.
He dead.

842
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:28.930
And then it's as if somebody reminded him sigma.
Then there are also women.

843
00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.173
Oh yeah.

844
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:37.240
And that story I told you with the penises and the penis envy and a replacement

845
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:39.880
is a sort of a very shortened version of electra complex.

846
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.430
I think it's fair to say that Electra Complex was,

847
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:47.260
I sort of add on to the main interest of fraud,
the oedipal complex.

848
00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:49.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

849
00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.160
<v 0>Uh,
one more please.
Yes,</v>

850
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:59.000
<v 1>sorry,
go ahead.</v>

851
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:06.570
<v 0>Uh,
according to Freud,
um,
the,
the,</v>

852
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:11.500
it's not a fixation in the stage in the same sense as an oral or anal stage,

853
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.520
but yes,

854
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:17.230
the claim that Freud would make is that the woman's discovery that she lacks the

855
00:56:17.231 --> 00:56:22.231
penis plays a fundamental role later on determining her allegiances and like,

856
00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.670
and in fact,
her own sexual preferences and interests.

857
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.180
So it was not the sort of thing that affects her just for a short period.
