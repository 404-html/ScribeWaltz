1
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.113
Sex

2
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.660
<v 1>is really strange.</v>

3
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.903
<v 0>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.030
<v 1>You asked people what's your favorite activity?</v>

5
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.430
And if you ask people,

6
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.800
particularly college students,

7
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.130
particularly just fresh from spring break,

8
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.140
I've seen key movies.

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.333
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.300
<v 1>They'll often answer sex or some word that is synonymous with sex,</v>

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.910
but there was a kind of a puzzle

12
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.830
about how much time we spend on sex.

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.200
And it turns out there is data on us.

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.530
So people say sex is your favorite activity,

15
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.690
but it turns out we actually know how much time the average American spends on

16
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.210
sex and the date.

17
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.510
I'm going to follow up more promise summarized by this in his wonderful book by

18
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:10.500
James Gleick.

19
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.673
Um,

20
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.270
Americans tell polars their single favorite activity is sex in terms of

21
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.470
enjoyability.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.540
They rang sex ahead of sports,

23
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.350
fishing,

24
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.280
bar hopping,

25
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.510
hugging and kissing,

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.010
talking with the family,

27
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.820
eating,

28
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.020
watching television,

29
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.980
going on trips,

30
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:29.791
planning trips,

31
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:30.624
gardening,

32
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.771
bathing,

33
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:32.341
shopping,

34
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:32.791
dressing,

35
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:33.331
housework,

36
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:34.440
dishwashing laundry,

37
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.840
visiting the dentist and getting the car repaired.

38
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.730
On the other hand,

39
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.600
these same studies suggested to average time per day devoted to sex is four

40
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.800
minutes and three seconds.

41
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.080
<v 1>As Blake says,</v>

43
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.640
this is not much,

44
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.050
even if the four minutes is excludes time spent,

45
00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:57.890
flirting,

46
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.753
dancing,

47
00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.690
oogling,

48
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.220
cruising the boulevard,

49
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.600
toning up in Jim's,

50
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:03.980
toning up in beauty parlors,

51
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.510
rehearsing pickup lines,

52
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.440
showering,

53
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.610
thinking about sex,

54
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.690
reading about sex,

55
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.291
doodling,

56
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:10.250
pornographic Lee,

57
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.850
looking at erotic magazines,

58
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.350
renting videos,

59
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:17.520
dreaming of sex,

60
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.050
looking at fashion magazines,

61
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.250
cleaning up after sex,

62
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.430
coping with the consequences of sex building towers or otherwise we're pressing

63
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:27.720
transferring and sublimating.

64
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.943
<v 0>And</v>

65
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.550
<v 1>I like this passage because it illustrates two points,</v>

66
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:36.384
two important points.

67
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.180
One is we don't actually spend that much time on sex.

68
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.871
In fact,

69
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.910
a four minutes and three seconds is an interesting number because when you went,

70
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.980
when you do time studies on how much Americans spend filling out tax related

71
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.240
forms for the IRS,

72
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.460
it's four minutes and a few seconds.

73
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.663
Um,

74
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.950
but the passage also points out that regardless of the brut time we spend on it,

75
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.440
it is extraordinarily important.

76
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.070
Um,

77
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.050
everything in life follows from it.

78
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.243
Marriage,

79
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.113
family,

80
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.983
children,

81
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.460
much of aggression,

82
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.960
much of competition,

83
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.260
much of art and music and creative pursuits.

84
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.600
Much of everything follows from it.

85
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.180
If we were a creature without sex,

86
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.500
everything would be different.

87
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.820
And what's interesting is there are creatures without sex.

88
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.580
There are creatures that reproduce by cloning,

89
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.290
and in fact,

90
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
this basic fact about people that we fall roughly into males and females is a

91
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.490
evolutionary mystery.

92
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.600
Um,

93
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600
it's not clear why animals that are somewhat large have to sexist from a

94
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.670
biological Darwinian perspective,

95
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.330
having two sexes is bizarre because each time you have an offspring,

96
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.920
you toss away half your genes.

97
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.690
My children only have,

98
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.060
each of them have half my DNA.

99
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.530
If I was to clone,

100
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.700
they would have all of it,

101
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.290
and so it's a puzzle.

102
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.790
How sex ever evolved.

103
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.710
This is not a course in evolutionary biology and that's not the puzzle we're

104
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.850
going to be looking at today.

105
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.010
When I look at a few questions,

106
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.661
first,

107
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:14.740
we're going to talk from first a theoretical point of view and then an empirical

108
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:18.100
point of view about how males and females are different.

109
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.070
Then we're going to talk about sexual attractiveness,

110
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.790
some research about what people find to be sexually attractive and all talk a

111
00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:29.260
very little bit at the end of the origins of sexual preference.

112
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.520
Why some people are straight,

113
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.031
others,

114
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:31.600
gay,

115
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.931
others,

116
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:34.660
bisexual and others harder to classify.

117
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.913
Um,

118
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.790
now of all the topics I'm presenting,

119
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.710
sex is one of the sort of dicey ones from an emotional point of view.

120
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.130
These are difficult issues because sex is by definition an intimate part of our

121
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.940
lives and it matters a lot.

122
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.110
Moreover is fraught with moral implications.

123
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.430
And since I'm talking about this from at least at the beginning,

124
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.890
from a Darwinian evolutionary perspective,

125
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.993
um,

126
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.170
I'm obliged to start off by dealing with some of the moral consequences and

127
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.340
moral implications.

128
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.720
So for instance,

129
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.960
many biologists,

130
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.100
all biologists,

131
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:20.080
I would say we'll have argued that,

132
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:20.530
um,

133
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.720
that sexual behavior,

134
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:23.630
sexual action,

135
00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:28.330
sexual desire is to some extent a biological adaptation existing to spread our

136
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.130
genes from that perspective.

137
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.790
Then non procreative sex including,

138
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:34.624
um,

139
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.770
gay sex,

140
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.360
sex with birth control,

141
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.830
sex by postmenopausal women,

142
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.960
um,

143
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.830
does not serve this reproductive goal.

144
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.440
And in some sense perhaps is unnatural.

145
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.370
And one might argue then does this mean it's wrong?

146
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.460
We'll also be talking about sex differences,

147
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.010
differences between men and women for instance,

148
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.063
in um,

149
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.460
in how much you want anonymous sexual encounters,

150
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.240
differences between men and women in social intelligence,

151
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.830
in aggression and empathy.

152
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280
And regardless of what you think about these differences,

153
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.130
whether you think they're right or wrong or it doesn't matter,

154
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.010
you'll ask the question to what extent are they immutable?

155
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.670
That is if they exist through Darwinian natural selection,

156
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.930
to what extent

157
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.900
can we ever get rid of them?

158
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.630
And I want to address those two issues,

159
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.240
issues of morality and inevitability,

160
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.230
um,

161
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.490
from the very start.

162
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.080
And I want to start off with,

163
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.920
um,

164
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.281
with,

165
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:41.370
for each of them have a quote by a prominent evolutionary scholars.

166
00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:45.110
So the first one is by Steve Pinker in how the mind works.

167
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.720
And he writes,

168
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.560
nature does not dictate what we should accept or how we should live our lives

169
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.660
well into micro procreating years.

170
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.060
I am so far voluntarily childless,

171
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.640
having squandered my biological resources,

172
00:06:58.641 --> 00:06:59.421
reading and writing,

173
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.254
doing research,

174
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.900
helping out friends and students and jogging and circles,

175
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.700
ignoring the Solomon paired up to spread my genes by Darwinian standards.

176
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:08.960
I am a horrible mistake,

177
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.040
a pathetic loser,

178
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.080
but I am happy to be that way if my jeans don't like it and go jump in the lake.

179
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.760
Pinker's point I think is a reasonable one.

180
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.050
Um,

181
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.050
it is true that certain things we do exist to serve the dictates of natural

182
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:26.750
selection,

183
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.340
but that doesn't make them right.

184
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.180
Um,

185
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.700
if you think that something is only right,

186
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.880
if it leads to the generation of more jeans,

187
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.530
if it leads to reproduction,

188
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.140
then you're not going to think very much about birth control.

189
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.233
Um,

190
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.220
you're not going to think very much about any sort of non procreative sex.

191
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.061
On the other hand,

192
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:45.440
if you're more over,

193
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:46.940
if you think something's wrong,

194
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.560
if it's,

195
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.890
if it's unnatural,

196
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.870
you're not going to think much about flying in a plane or refrigerating food or

197
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:55.520
surviving a severe infection.

198
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.560
More generally,

199
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:01.010
our bodies and brains have evolved for reproductive success,

200
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.070
but we can use these brains to choose our own destinies.

201
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.000
Nothing moral necessarily follows from the facts of biology.

202
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.630
That's all I'm want to say about morality,

203
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.500
but I want you to keep it in mind when we discuss different claims about what's

204
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:17.300
evolved in what hasn't.

205
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.070
What about inevitability?

206
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:19.671
I'm here.

207
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:23.580
I want to turn to Richard Dawkins Dawkins rates.

208
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.880
If a child has had bad teaching in mathematics,

209
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:27.660
it is accepted.

210
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.250
The resulting deficiency can be remedied by extra good teaching in the following

211
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.670
year,

212
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.480
but any suggestion that the child's deficiency might have a genetic origin is

213
00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:38.970
likely to be greeted with something approaching despair.

214
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.170
If it's in the genes,

215
00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:42.960
it is determined and nothing can be done about it.

216
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.850
This is pernicious nonsense on an almost astrological scale.

217
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.940
Genetic causes and environmental causes are in principle,

218
00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:52.500
no difference from each other.

219
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.300
Some may be hard to reverse.

220
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.670
Others may be why did jeans,

221
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.550
what do genes do to deserve their sinister juggernaut?

222
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:00.420
Like reputation?

223
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.380
Why are gene thought to be so much more fixed and inescapable and their effects

224
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.390
than television nuns or books?

225
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.950
I liked the nuns.

226
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.960
And the point here is

227
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.910
what causes something is logically separate from what can reverse it.

228
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.690
And you could think of clear cases where something is plainly Jeanetta but it's

229
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:31.500
fairly easily reversed and where something is cultural and it's very difficult

230
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:32.160
to reverse.

231
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.300
Here's an example.

232
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.220
My eyesight is quite poor.

233
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.410
The reason why my eyesight is quite poor is not due to the patriarchy.

234
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.790
Television culture are the man rather.

235
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.020
My eyesight is quite poor due to the crappy genes mum and dad gave me.

236
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.280
It is genetically determined.

237
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:51.114
If anything is,

238
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.810
it is also fairly easy to fix or these machines,

239
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.530
um,

240
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.090
where they put panes of glass in front of your eyes and help you to see better,

241
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.500
more advanced machines known as contact lenses actually stick the thing into

242
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:05.310
your eyes.

243
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.190
And at the cost of occasional infections you learn to,

244
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.810
you become to see better.

245
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.550
It is biologically caused but fairly easy to fats.

246
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.230
On the other hand,

247
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.530
take an example of society's treatment of the obese.

248
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.510
It turns out when we,

249
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:23.040
and we will get to this a little bit,

250
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:24.660
when you talk about sexual attractiveness,

251
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.830
how thins somebody is or how fat they are,

252
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.460
what you think of that is actually not particularly hardwired.

253
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:34.140
It varies a lot from culture to culture,

254
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.090
but once it's in a culture,

255
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:37.980
it is almost impossible to shake.

256
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.960
So the point there is just that genetic does not mean inevitable and cultural

257
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.860
does not mean easy to fix.

258
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.403
Okay,

259
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.760
that's general background.

260
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.490
Let's start with basic sex ed.

261
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.560
What's the difference between males and females?

262
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.053
Well,

263
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.600
don't even think penis in vagina.

264
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.130
Uh,

265
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.960
there's a lot of animals that have neither one.

266
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.040
And the difference actually runs deeper by definition.

267
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.960
When biologist talk about this,

268
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.980
um,

269
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.250
animals that are males have a little sex cell,

270
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.280
which carries genes and nothing else.

271
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.420
Sperm cells,

272
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.400
animals that are females have a big sex cell,

273
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.790
which has genes,

274
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.450
but also food and a protective cover and all sorts of other stuff.

275
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.970
Typically the little sex cell is much littler than the big sec.

276
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:34.800
So this is the only erotic picture I'm going to show you today.

277
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.800
It's a bunch of the little sperm circling around

278
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.733
<v 0>the egg.</v>

279
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.950
It's romantic.

280
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.023
Um,

281
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.240
<v 1>this raises a puzzle I just described.</v>

282
00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:52.370
Male and female roughly in terms of a size difference,

283
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.540
males to smaller I'd sex cells,

284
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.650
females are the bigger,

285
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.740
why is it then that for so many animals,

286
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.250
males are the bigger ones physically and the more aggressive ones.

287
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.430
This has been a puzzle that is occupied scientists for a long,

288
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:11.890
long time and we're pretty,

289
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.310
there is now a pretty clear answer to it.

290
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.410
And the answer goes like this.

291
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.800
It is based on idea by Robert trevors call parental investment and what parental

292
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.010
investment is.

293
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.220
It's defined here as any investment that's going to increase the offspring's

294
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:37.831
chance of survival at the cost of the parents' ability to invest in other

295
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:39.364
offspring.

296
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.160
So for example,

297
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.880
suppose an animal could create an offspring by blinking an eye and an office

298
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:47.830
from the run off.

299
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.740
That'd be extremely little investment.

300
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.280
Suppose another animal had to work for 10 years and during those 10 years could

301
00:12:57.221 --> 00:13:00.970
not create another offspring that it'd be a huge investment.

302
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.540
Trevor is points out that within a species,

303
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.440
females typically have a much higher parental investment then males,

304
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.720
because females have these big sex health,

305
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.621
they typically,

306
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:19.060
you incubate them internally,

307
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.590
they carry them.

308
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.701
If their eggs,

309
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:22.900
they might have to sit on them.

310
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.280
And hence each potential child is a huge cost for males,

311
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.050
which had the small sex cell.

312
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.990
You don't have the same thing for males.

313
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.710
Um,

314
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.590
it might just be a few moments of,

315
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.360
of copulation and that's it.

316
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.210
If you could ask yourself for humans,

317
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.650
each one of you in the room,

318
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.830
what is the minimum effort you can do to create a child that has half your

319
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:50.974
genes?

320
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.430
And it's apparent that the male investment on average is lower than the female

321
00:13:57.071 --> 00:13:57.610
investment.

322
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.780
Males can choose or might do better off in some circumstances,

323
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.241
right?

324
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:04.210
Putting a lot of investment in their offspring,

325
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.310
but females don't have a choice.

326
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.910
Female's barring technological advance.

327
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:10.780
Um,

328
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.030
have a huge investment into any offspring.

329
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:13.750
Um,

330
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.470
not investment in a sense of hard work and effort though there's that too.

331
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.041
Um,

332
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.630
investment in the sense that when you're,

333
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.030
when you're the jest,

334
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.211
when,

335
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:22.044
when you're having,

336
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.070
when you're pregnant with one offspring,

337
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.660
you can't have another,

338
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.030
what this does is it has ramifications that perculate upwards.

339
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.343
So

340
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.680
it leads to different psychologies.

341
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.840
Males as single male could fertilize several females forcing some males to go

342
00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:44.900
may list and giving rise to competition

343
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.680
to see who could mate with the most females.

344
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.630
For females,

345
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.470
however,

346
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.510
females can always find mates.

347
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.910
So sheer numbers don't count.

348
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.200
But there's competition to me with the right males,

349
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.410
those his offspring have the best chance of surviving.

350
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.133
Um,

351
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.020
the competition now explains the puzzle we started with.

352
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:13.400
It explains why males are typically larger and often why males have evolved

353
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:14.450
special weapons.

354
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.250
These special weapons evolve for fighting other males for reproductive access.

355
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.680
It also explained something else.

356
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.530
Females biologically are choosy.

357
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.610
And so males have to compete not merely with other males to,

358
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:29.444
um,

359
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.341
to,

360
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:31.671
to,

361
00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:33.140
to get reproductive access,

362
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.210
but also to Wu females.

363
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.990
And so often males have evolved special displays like this which exist only to

364
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:44.444
be beautiful,

365
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.300
only to be attractive and to attract mates.

366
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:47.930
Um,

367
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.530
does Cole evolutionary logic was captured in this cartoon,

368
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.070
which really does sum up a hundred years of made selection research.

369
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.140
The logic goes like this.

370
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:10.400
Then difference in the size of sex cells leads to differences in typical

371
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:13.940
parental investment leading to differences in the sorts of psychological and

372
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:15.770
physiological mechanisms that are well,

373
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.580
okay,

374
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.690
that's a good story.

375
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.270
What sort of evidence is therefore it?

376
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.140
Well,

377
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.230
it turns out this could explain some otherwise surprising things.

378
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.520
For instance,

379
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.631
there should be,

380
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:30.110
there are some cases where the parental investment is switched,

381
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.380
some cases where it turns out where the males end up with more investment than

382
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.370
the females and it,

383
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:43.410
and the theory predicts that in these cases you should get an asymmetry.

384
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.390
So in cases like pipe fish for instance,

385
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.660
the mail takes the eggs into a pouch and plugs them into his bloodstream.

386
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.860
The females shoot off.

387
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.900
They have less of an investment than the males.

388
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.560
In this case you would predict as is true,

389
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.690
the females should be larger.

390
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:08.030
The females fight other females more than males fight males and the females try

391
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:10.340
to compete for the attention of the males.

392
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.300
Recall the movie march of the penguins,

393
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.520
we saw a clip from it and this was in the context of discussing the emotions

394
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.860
that have evolved towards our offspring.

395
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.880
But remember the story and how both the male and a female have to go to

396
00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:29.630
tremendous lengths to protect the egg.

397
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.610
And if one of them fails,

398
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.620
the egg dies and neither one has it.

399
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.030
You should then not even have to remember whether male females are much bigger

400
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.080
than female penguins.

401
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.090
You should realize they should not be.

402
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:45.080
And in fact they aren't.

403
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.410
They're about the same size because it,

404
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.440
the parental investment is equal.

405
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.760
You should be able to predict the size differences and aggression differences

406
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.340
based on differing parental investment.

407
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.750
So for instance,

408
00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.490
um,

409
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.950
elephant seals are four times.

410
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.561
The males are,

411
00:18:02.561 --> 00:18:03.510
are enormous.

412
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.730
There are four times bigger than the females.

413
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:11.100
And this is in large part because elephant seals compete for harems of females.

414
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.600
It's a winner take all.

415
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.680
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

416
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.490
<v 1>Gibbons are about the same size and this is because Gibbons are pretty</v>

417
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.121
monogamous.

418
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:19.740
They raised children together.

419
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.650
This illustrates something which is,

420
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:27.540
it's not always the case.

421
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:28.590
Um,

422
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.390
that male parental investment,

423
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.120
<v 0>okay.</v>

424
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.020
<v 1>Is Low.</v>

425
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:37.000
There are some species including Gibbons where it's in a male's reproductive

426
00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:38.650
advantage to care for the offspring.

427
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.210
Imagine a situation,

428
00:18:40.211 --> 00:18:40.571
for instance,

429
00:18:40.571 --> 00:18:45.571
where an offspring would die if both parents didn't watch it for many years.

430
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

431
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.880
<v 1>And where the effort devoted had offspring had to be exclusive.</v>

432
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.380
If you focus on another family or went away,

433
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.460
the offspring would die.

434
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.451
In that case,

435
00:18:57.451 --> 00:18:59.070
you'd have equal investment.

436
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.210
It would matter equally to the male and the female to invest in their offspring.

437
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:05.100
And the cost would be the same.

438
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:06.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

439
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.480
<v 1>There is no species as hard as these species that have that much of an equal</v>

440
00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:12.290
system,

441
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.090
but some primates or close to it.

442
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.890
And this raises the question then.

443
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.270
What about humans?

444
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.290
What about us?

445
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.160
What do we know about the differences between males and females?

446
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.563
<v 0>Well,</v>

447
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.220
<v 1>um,</v>

448
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.550
humans are relatively polygamous species.

449
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.320
Most cultures,

450
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.210
most human cultures are,

451
00:19:33.211 --> 00:19:33.780
um,

452
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.780
are polygamous American culture is what they call serial monogamy.

453
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.760
So we're not like some species of birds.

454
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:42.840
We don't mate for life.

455
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.200
We do a series of peer bondings for some period of time.

456
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:47.190
It could be for life,

457
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.170
but it need not be an usually isn't

458
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.120
males are bigger than females.

459
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

460
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.001
<v 1>Human males,</v>

461
00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:56.580
the size estimates vary so much,

462
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:57.720
but the average human males,

463
00:19:57.721 --> 00:20:00.660
but 15% larger than an average human female.

464
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.760
This suggests that there are some May.

465
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.130
There's been in our evolutionary history,

466
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.140
some male male competition,

467
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.453
um,

468
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.020
for access to females,

469
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.700
which suggest in turn that the parental investment is not quite equal.

470
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:15.660
Um,

471
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.250
males have smaller testicles for their body size than chimpanzees,

472
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.580
but larger testicles than gorillas and givens.

473
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.450
Um,

474
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.620
and this suggests that there was some intermediate amount of competition for the

475
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.540
capacity to create sperm.

476
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.750
And this is relevant for a different sort of competition,

477
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.710
which regards to impregnation of females that have multiple mates

478
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.580
suggests that over evolutionary history,

479
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.190
women were not wantonly promiscuous,

480
00:20:43.191 --> 00:20:45.050
but we're not entirely monogamous either.

481
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.070
So much so that,

482
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:50.830
that it paid from an point of view you to evolve males to evolved the capacity

483
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:53.800
to produce more sperm than other males.

484
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.570
Aggression.

485
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.500
Males are meaner.

486
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.311
I mean,

487
00:20:57.311 --> 00:20:59.860
I'm summarizing here mean there's not a technical term.

488
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:00.281
Yes,

489
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:01.450
females can be meaner,

490
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:04.630
but males are at least more physically violent.

491
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.120
There are more violent in the room.

492
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.140
In utero,

493
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.180
they're more violent as children and there are more violent as adults.

494
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.673
Um,

495
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.663
again,

496
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.670
this is not to say that you can't find violent women or nonviolent men is just

497
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.360
on average.

498
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.470
There is this difference.

499
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.280
Um,

500
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.260
they kicked more males kick more in the uterus as children,

501
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.520
they're more involved in play,

502
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:33.280
fighting and violent combat like sports.

503
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.570
And as adults,

504
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.950
wherever you go,

505
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.400
you will find a prison and wherever you go,

506
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.310
you will find that prison is mostly fill full of men.

507
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.570
Um,

508
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.410
they are far more likely to kill one another and to harm one another.

509
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.190
Um,

510
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.090
male sex hormones tests like testosterone are the sword,

511
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:55.630
not the sort of thing one would want to inject in somebody unless you want them

512
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:57.700
to turn kind of mean it.

513
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.570
They increased aggressiveness both in humans and other primates.

514
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.230
What about sexual choosiness?

515
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:11.130
Do male humans and female humans differ in the extent to which they will favor

516
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.240
anonymous sex?

517
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.030
And this is relevant from an evolutionary perspective because the parental

518
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:25.930
investment theory predicts males should be more receptive to anonymous sex

519
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.920
because,

520
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.753
um,

521
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.000
for males to impregnate somebody else,

522
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.930
my fortuitously lead to another offspring.

523
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:40.350
It might be good for you and doesn't carry the sort of harm that females and

524
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:40.870
another unhappy,

525
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.320
very picky because they have to choose carefully.

526
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.281
Remember,

527
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.200
these systems evolve before birth,

528
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:49.930
birth control and vasectomies and so on.

529
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.290
So what do we know cross culturally and psychologically?

530
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.153
Well,

531
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
prostitution is a universally near our near universally male.

532
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:01.450
Um,

533
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.283
interest.

534
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.660
There are male prostitutes of course,

535
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.650
but contrary to some various fantasies and sitcoms,

536
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.570
they cater to male customers.

537
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.630
Pornography is a human universal.

538
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.240
Every in every society,

539
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.600
uh,

540
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.600
males have done some sort of depictions of naked females for the purpose of

541
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:22.750
arousal.

542
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.770
Often they carved them into trees or do sort of sculptures.

543
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.710
One of the weirdest findings in the last decade or so is that this extends as

544
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.030
well to monkey porn.

545
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:40.050
And so some scientists that Duke set up a situation where monkeys could pay in

546
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:45.130
fruit juice by giving a fruit juice to look at a picture either of a female's

547
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.960
hindquarters or of a celebrity monkey,

548
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.880
a socially dominant monkey,

549
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.600
some sort of combination of people magazine and Penthouse.

550
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.143
And um,

551
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.420
so there have some interest in this even by nonhuman primates.

552
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:02.963
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

553
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.980
<v 1>What about actual preference for sexual variety?</v>

554
00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:07.870
Well,

555
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.670
you couldn't get at this in different ways.

556
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.803
Um,

557
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:16.830
there is what biologists describe as I'm the Coolidge effect have this here and

558
00:24:18.161 --> 00:24:21.070
the Coolidge effect is based on President Calvin Coolidge.

559
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:26.380
And it's a story about Calvin Coolidge and his wife who were being shown around

560
00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:29.650
a farm separately and a person showing around.

561
00:24:29.651 --> 00:24:32.960
His wife pointed out that there was a lot of hands,

562
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:33.590
Gigi,

563
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.370
she noticed that there's a lot of hands but only one rooster.

564
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.150
And she asked the guy showing her around is one rooster enough?

565
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.961
And the guy said,

566
00:24:40.961 --> 00:24:41.201
well,

567
00:24:41.201 --> 00:24:41.800
you know,

568
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.240
the routes to works very hard.

569
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.340
The rooster has sex dozens of times a day.

570
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.481
And she said,

571
00:24:46.481 --> 00:24:46.750
well,

572
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.190
be sure to tell that to the president.

573
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.130
Story goes present.

574
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.250
When around date,

575
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.250
the guy tells the story to the president.

576
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.480
The president asked,

577
00:24:55.481 --> 00:24:58.030
a man has sex dozens of times each day,

578
00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.860
same hand every time.

579
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:00.810
Okay,

580
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.710
says no different hen every time.

581
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:03.700
And he says,

582
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.790
tell out to Mrs Coolidge now.

583
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.360
Now there's two responses to this sort of story.

584
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.550
And they're both kind of negative.

585
00:25:12.551 --> 00:25:12.940
One thing is,

586
00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.500
well everybody knows males prefer anonymous sex with strange women.

587
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.480
The other response is that sexist clap trap.

588
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.100
You might think you might be a male and say,

589
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.120
that's not me.

590
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.670
You might know males and say,

591
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.420
the males I know are not like that.

592
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.250
So how do you find out?

593
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:32.391
Well,

594
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:35.220
there's indirect measures such as who goes to prostitutes,

595
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.860
but it was also fairly direct measures.

596
00:25:37.861 --> 00:25:39.990
One fairly direct measure is,

597
00:25:39.991 --> 00:25:40.500
um,

598
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.410
is you could ask people in anonymous surveys.

599
00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.461
So in fact,

600
00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:46.080
I'll give you some anonymous surveys.

601
00:25:46.081 --> 00:25:47.130
I'm not going to ask people,

602
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.233
and you just asked him.

603
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:48.901
So you,

604
00:25:48.901 --> 00:25:49.530
so,

605
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.820
so for instance,

606
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.440
I want everybody to consider this question.

607
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.890
How many sexual partners you want to have in the next month?

608
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.650
What does it coming up to April?

609
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.690
How many sexual partners you want an April.

610
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.933
Yeah.

611
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:06.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

612
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.850
<v 1>Next two years.</v>

613
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.360
Take many of you through graduation when you leave.

614
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:11.541
Yeah.

615
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:12.260
What do you want to,

616
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.720
I had x sexual partners and that's what I wanted.

617
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.880
Or your lifetime.

618
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.580
We get people to answer these questions.

619
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.300
Um,

620
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.300
professor Chen last year in this course had clickers and it got people to now to

621
00:26:26.121 --> 00:26:26.660
do it.

622
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.010
We are not so high tech,

623
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.510
so we'll just do it in our heads.

624
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.700
But here's the way the answers come out.

625
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

626
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.760
<v 1>Women say less than one in next month.</v>

627
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:36.590
That doesn't mean they want less than one.

628
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:40.040
That means many of them isn't that many of them say zero.

629
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.230
Some say one.

630
00:26:41.231 --> 00:26:46.231
So on one four to five men to eight

631
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:51.583
<v 0>18,</v>

632
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.140
<v 1>you can ask other questions from this population.</v>

633
00:26:57.141 --> 00:26:57.974
So you could ask,

634
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.770
when you have sex with a desirable partner,

635
00:27:00.771 --> 00:27:01.401
you have known,

636
00:27:01.401 --> 00:27:04.130
so it's gonna be really desirable for a year.

637
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.770
And women say yes,

638
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.371
six months,

639
00:27:07.371 --> 00:27:08.150
I'm sure.

640
00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:08.811
Week or less,

641
00:27:08.811 --> 00:27:10.310
no men.

642
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:13.410
<v 0>And</v>

643
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.350
<v 1>well then you could get a majority going down.</v>

644
00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:17.283
Um,

645
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.290
two to five minutes.

646
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:21.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

647
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.370
<v 1>This is all Q and a pen and pencil sort of things.</v>

648
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.970
Some brave scientists have actually done experiments.

649
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:29.990
Um,

650
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:31.310
and in one experiment,

651
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.170
somebody,

652
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:33.740
I don't,

653
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.041
you know,

654
00:27:34.041 --> 00:27:36.140
this is sort of thing which you probably wouldn't do nowadays.

655
00:27:36.141 --> 00:27:39.500
This work has been done 10 years ago where they have an incredibly attractive

656
00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:39.771
man,

657
00:27:39.771 --> 00:27:41.090
incredibly attractive woman,

658
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.670
and they approach people on campus.

659
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.330
They're not from campus there,

660
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.140
they're actors brought in and they go to people,

661
00:27:48.141 --> 00:27:49.550
to strangers and they say,

662
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.410
I've been noticing you around campus.

663
00:27:51.411 --> 00:27:52.910
I find you very attractive.

664
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.160
Would you go out with me tonight?

665
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.020
Would you come over to my apartment tonight?

666
00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.520
Would you go to bed with me tonight?

667
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.720
The experiment you wouldn't think anybody would have done has been done.

668
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.860
And women hate about a true,

669
00:28:05.861 --> 00:28:06.800
very attractive man.

670
00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:09.050
Over half of the women approach say,

671
00:28:09.051 --> 00:28:09.440
yeah,

672
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.440
I will very few agree to this and nobody agrees to this for men.

673
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.360
The data are like this.

674
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.583
They go up to there.

675
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

676
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.500
<v 1>In the study,</v>

677
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.050
the 25% of males,

678
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.500
um,

679
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.840
who said no apologize profusely.

680
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:34.260
And he said,

681
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:34.471
Oh,

682
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:34.800
you know,

683
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.640
my fiance's in town until you guys.

684
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.123
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

685
00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.750
<v 1>What about behavior?</v>

686
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:44.890
Well,

687
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:45.220
you,

688
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.530
if we're interested in sex differences,

689
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:48.543
um,

690
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.760
you can't actually figure out what people want male,

691
00:28:54.521 --> 00:28:59.050
female differences by looking at simply at the average number of times people

692
00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:04.051
have sex because if male and females have different priorities than heterosexual

693
00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:08.620
sex is a compromise between two groups of people with competing interests.

694
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.113
Um,

695
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.120
what's a more clear reflection then is gay sex between women,

696
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.400
between two women are between two men because then you get a pure reflection of

697
00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.773
um,

698
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.460
of sexual desire.

699
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.010
Now the data here tend to be very messy.

700
00:29:27.011 --> 00:29:27.281
Again,

701
00:29:27.281 --> 00:29:28.480
there are surveys studies,

702
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.340
but by and large,

703
00:29:30.341 --> 00:29:33.880
every study done tends to find a difference in the expected direction,

704
00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.980
which is that females tend to be,

705
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:40.870
lesbians tend to be much more monogamous than gay men.

706
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.280
Um,

707
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.500
some studies prior to that,

708
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.780
prior to aids,

709
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.500
and this was many years ago,

710
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.250
found game and to be extremely promiscuous,

711
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.430
often having over a hundred,

712
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:52.750
over a thousand partners,

713
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.950
you wouldn't find this sort of promiscuity in female and females.

714
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.540
And the way to think about this is what these gay men are doing is exactly what

715
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:06.541
your average heterosexual man would do if he had that degree of willing females

716
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:08.680
who were as willing as he was.

717
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.240
And this all suggests that there's some sort of difference along lines expected

718
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.030
in sexual choosiness in humans.

719
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.800
What about sexual attractiveness?

720
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.630
What about made preference?

721
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:23.980
What do we find attractive?

722
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.503
Well,

723
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.570
unlike the choosiness studies here,

724
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:30.760
we actually have some pretty good cross cultural data.

725
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
So one study for instance was done in 10,000 people from 37 countries asking

726
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:38.340
people who you'd want to,

727
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.790
who you want to be with.

728
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.500
And there's different studies.

729
00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:42.334
Some of them ask me,

730
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.540
who do you want to marry?

731
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.041
Other studies?

732
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:46.360
Who Do you want as a maid?

733
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.040
Who Do you want as a sexual partner?

734
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.160
And one main finding is

735
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.040
kind of reassuring.

736
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:58.330
Everybody likes kindness and intelligence or at least everybody says they like

737
00:30:58.331 --> 00:30:59.500
kindness and intelligence.

738
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.330
These are valued pretty highly,

739
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.220
but at the same time,

740
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:04.510
there are sex differences.

741
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.351
Um,

742
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:10.351
females focus more on power and status and more on interest in investing in

743
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:11.680
children.

744
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.840
And think about that from an evolutionary point of view.

745
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:14.674
It makes sense.

746
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.370
It doesn't matter hugely from the standpoint of reproduction,

747
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:20.020
how old the managers,

748
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.920
the difference between 15 and 25 and 35 and 45 may matter a lot for a status in

749
00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:26.861
the community,

750
00:31:26.861 --> 00:31:27.760
his physical strength,

751
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:28.594
his lifespan.

752
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.370
But from the standpoint of his sperm,

753
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:31.570
it doesn't matter hugely.

754
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.530
Later on there's a drop off and it does begin to matter,

755
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.730
but it doesn't matter hugely.

756
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:37.990
Um,

757
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.700
what does matter is this interest in being a good father in protecting you from

758
00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:43.301
predation,

759
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:44.320
from murder,

760
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.980
from assault by other people and in taking care of the kid.

761
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.930
Women's brains are wired up to find males with those properties.

762
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:53.973
Similarly,

763
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.830
males focus a little bit differently.

764
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.560
They're more interested in all of these things,

765
00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:01.120
but also an ability to have children.

766
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.730
So from an evolutionary point of view,

767
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.540
there is actually a very big difference between a 20 year old and a 50 year old

768
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.220
from a male standpoint,

769
00:32:09.221 --> 00:32:13.300
looking at a female because the one can have offspring and other cannot.

770
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.760
So this is a difference.

771
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.710
But what I want to focus more on right now is back to another similarity.

772
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.100
Everybody likes beauty.

773
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.320
And I want to devote a little bit of his lecture to talking about physical

774
00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:30.154
beauty.

775
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:34.900
Physical beauty as these beautiful people say is a curse.

776
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.161
So she,

777
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:36.971
she's a like a,

778
00:32:36.971 --> 00:32:38.080
a big model,

779
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:38.914
a supermodel,

780
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.900
maybe even a super super model.

781
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.690
Um,

782
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:46.160
points out the arbitrariness of finding her devastatingly beautiful,

783
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.880
famous actor pointed how frustrating it is that people only ignore his

784
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:55.070
accomplishments and focus merely on his physical beauty.

785
00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:56.960
It's just very frustrating.

786
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.183
Um,

787
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.233
so,

788
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.320
so what is beauty?

789
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:02.540
What does this mean when we say we find,

790
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.080
wait,

791
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.913
you know,

792
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:05.683
yeah,

793
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.730
they really are very attractive people.

794
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.520
What is it about that that makes you look and say,

795
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.060
yeah,

796
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.020
that makes sense?

797
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.010
Well,

798
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.000
we kind of know the answer.

799
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:19.001
We know some universals beauty seems to signal to things you need seems to

800
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:21.860
signal youth.

801
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.650
I mean not preschool youth but,

802
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:25.340
but,

803
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:25.641
but,

804
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:28.220
but youth like sexually,

805
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.510
sexually mature but young.

806
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.530
Um,

807
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.510
and so the cues we find uniform are cues to that large eyes for lips,

808
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.231
smooth,

809
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:40.064
tight skin,

810
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:41.491
beauty signal,

811
00:33:41.491 --> 00:33:42.410
something else.

812
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.050
Beauty is a marker for health.

813
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:50.540
And so what we find beautiful things like the absence of deformities,

814
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.620
clear eyes,

815
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.330
unblemished skin,

816
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.440
intact teeth,

817
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.040
it's very big and an average face.

818
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.970
And that'll last part might seem a little bit strange.

819
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.610
What would it be so good about an average face?

820
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.710
And there's different answers to that,

821
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.970
but one answer is,

822
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.833
um,

823
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:13.870
an average face on average should be considered attractive because any sorts of

824
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:18.230
deformities are variations from the average.

825
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.980
And if you average every face together,

826
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.361
you get a face.

827
00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.670
That's that we're nothing bad has happened to it.

828
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:27.310
There's no distortions,

829
00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.320
there's no deviations as one gets older to face,

830
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:33.530
gets less symmetrical and so on.

831
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:37.040
Averageness seems to factor at all of that things that can happen.

832
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.460
Good theory.

833
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.870
How do we know it's true?

834
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.883
Well,

835
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.940
there's a photo roster that come,

836
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:48.710
that I have access to for this class,

837
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.240
so I can look at each of your pictures and I will make you a bad about who has

838
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:55.790
the most beautiful face in this course.

839
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:56.690
Um,

840
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.410
the bed is,

841
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.240
it would be all of you.

842
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.513
Ah,

843
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.670
wouldn't it be funny if I shouted out somebody's name

844
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.230
if I d I and,

845
00:35:10.231 --> 00:35:10.850
and you know,

846
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.600
a,

847
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.920
I don't have the energy to do this.

848
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:13.640
And B,

849
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.150
it would probably violate 400 different privacy laws or whatever.

850
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.420
But if I took all those faces and morphed them together,

851
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.970
I would get a very pretty face.

852
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.630
And how do we know this while people have done this,

853
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.560
they've done it with.

854
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:31.400
So look at the faces from here to here.

855
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:35.840
And if you are like most people you see as you're going to the right,

856
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.560
they're looking better and better and better.

857
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.353
It's subtle,

858
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.560
but it's actually not so subtle that babies don't notice it.

859
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.380
The same researchers who constructed this,

860
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.051
these face,

861
00:35:47.051 --> 00:35:49.200
these average Caucasian faces,

862
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.790
male and female,

863
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.510
have shown these faces to babies and find it.

864
00:35:53.511 --> 00:35:57.510
Babies prefer to look at average faces suggested that our,

865
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.900
that our preference we're averaging is not the product of culture,

866
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.120
but rather it's to some extent hardwired.

867
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.120
These two people don't exist.

868
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.400
They're computer composites.

869
00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:14.070
They're a heavily average male face and it heavily average female face,

870
00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:17.310
both from our Caucasian data sample.

871
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.340
They don't look bad right there.

872
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:20.931
Good faces,

873
00:36:20.931 --> 00:36:21.240
they,

874
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:21.841
they don't cheat.

875
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:22.890
So to hear for instance,

876
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:23.250
is,

877
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.120
is identical.

878
00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:24.720
So they don't,

879
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.010
you can't use here cues,

880
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.990
but they're pretty attractive.

881
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.100
But a story of attractiveness does not end there.

882
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.880
How do you get a better than average face?

883
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.450
What can you do to these faces,

884
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:39.840
these average faces and make them look even better?

885
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:40.981
Well,

886
00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:41.910
I'll have a vote.

887
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:43.853
Who's prettier?

888
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.480
Who says the one on the right

889
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:52.010
who says the one on the left left is average face and there might be variation

890
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:54.360
in his class or there definitely variations.

891
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:55.230
And what people favorite,

892
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.040
this is a feminized version of the average face.

893
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:03.180
We're certain protocol and features were made more feminine than average to

894
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:07.200
queue this as more of a sexual object.

895
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.420
This is a more complicated,

896
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.113
<v 0>yeah.</v>

897
00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:21.843
<v 1>Cool.</v>

898
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.190
Who thinks the face,

899
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.590
who thinks face a is more attractive?

900
00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.900
Who the face B is more attractive?

901
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.483
Okay.

902
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.560
Most people like face be.

903
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.750
The exception is,

904
00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.770
and this has been statistically replicated I think now in three labs.

905
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.880
Um,

906
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.250
phase a is preferred by women who are ovulating.

907
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.603
And,

908
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.580
and the story about why is,

909
00:37:54.581 --> 00:37:55.090
um,

910
00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:55.421
is,

911
00:37:55.421 --> 00:37:59.290
is complicated and will take us beyond the scope of this class.

912
00:37:59.440 --> 00:37:59.981
But crudely,

913
00:37:59.981 --> 00:38:02.620
the idea is that is that this is a really handsome guy.

914
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.340
He's young,

915
00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.180
he's healthy,

916
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.170
he looks strong,

917
00:38:05.171 --> 00:38:06.190
good provider.

918
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.010
This guy is really hot and,

919
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.670
and he may not be a good provider and everything,

920
00:38:12.671 --> 00:38:14.410
but I'm sure he has wonderful genes.

921
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.910
So the idea is that one should have sex with him and then have him raise the

922
00:38:18.911 --> 00:38:19.744
kids.

923
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

924
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.940
<v 1>We've talked so far about things about,</v>

925
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:32.090
about sex and sexual attractiveness largely from a biological perspective,

926
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.790
looking at universals and in fact there are some universals in what men and

927
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:41.380
women have in common and what distinguished men and women and um,

928
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.360
and some of the sex differences,

929
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:44.950
particularly related to aggression,

930
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.383
uh,

931
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:49.630
and made preference seem to be universal.

932
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:54.120
They seem to show up to some extent across every culture you look at enhance are

933
00:38:54.121 --> 00:38:56.890
likely candidates for biological adaptations.

934
00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.413
But

935
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.880
there are other sex differences that people are aware of where the origins are

936
00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:05.080
far less clear.

937
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.120
And I think that intelligent,

938
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:09.190
reasonable people could disagree about this,

939
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.300
but I am personally quite skeptical about the extent to which these reflect

940
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:14.134
biology.

941
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.550
I'm gonna I'll mention them to capture the debate,

942
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.650
but the thing to keep in mind here is that is that biology,

943
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.450
natural selection is one reason why the men in his class might differ from the

944
00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:29.500
women in this class.

945
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.020
But of course there were other social factors.

946
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.640
Babies are treated differently.

947
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:39.190
There been many studies where you take a baby and you swaddle it and blue and

948
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:43.000
describe it as a boy versus swaddle it and pink and describe it as a girl.

949
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.880
And people treat it differently when they think it's a boy.

950
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.260
Then when they think it's a girl,

951
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.343
um,

952
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.140
you treated differently too.

953
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:53.200
It matters a lot.

954
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:55.630
And there's study after study suggesting for instance,

955
00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:00.810
that when you send an email or a job application or a paper to a scientific

956
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:02.164
journal,

957
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.380
it matters whether it has the name John Smith on it versus the name Joan Smith.

958
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:14.260
It matters because people have different expectations in different reactions to

959
00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:15.550
males versus females.

960
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.480
Some of you may have a firsthand experience with this.

961
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:23.110
If you're a man with a name that could be taken as a woman's name.

962
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.520
I'm a friend of mine,

963
00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:25.390
his name Lynn,

964
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.210
and often people think he's female.

965
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.430
Or if you're a woman who has a name that could be taken as a man,

966
00:40:31.431 --> 00:40:31.870
his name,

967
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.800
or if you have a name sufficiently foreign to western ears at that people can

968
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:38.440
easily tell you often find people saying,

969
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.370
oh,

970
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.880
people are high fiving each other there.

971
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:41.773
Um,

972
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.813
people

973
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:49.570
you'll often find some degree of surprise and some degree people saying,

974
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:49.931
oh my,

975
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:51.310
I didn't know you were a man.

976
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.690
Now I will treat you differently.

977
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.863
Um,

978
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:59.430
and so these social factors could play a role in explaining some male and female

979
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:00.604
differences.

980
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.670
Also rules of facts of gender,

981
00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:04.720
self segregation.

982
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.810
So here's something very interesting happens developmentally.

983
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.920
Males segregate with other males.

984
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:16.950
Females segregate with other females for a period lasting,

985
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:18.130
it depends on the culture,

986
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.440
but say from age four to age 11,

987
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:26.370
this self segregation might exaggerate and enhance sex differences.

988
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:27.761
It might be,

989
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:28.271
for instance,

990
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:32.530
as Elanor McAbee has proposed that that boys are slightly more aggressive than

991
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:33.364
girls,

992
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:38.590
but then boys go into groups of boys and that enhances and exaggerates their

993
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:39.464
aggression.

994
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.540
Well the girls non aggressive behavior is enhanced and exaggerated in different

995
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:46.790
ways by them falling into girls' groups.

996
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.770
So what sort of differences are we talking about when we say we're not sure of

997
00:41:51.771 --> 00:41:52.520
their costs?

998
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:52.671
Well,

999
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:55.190
one difference is one an empathy.

1000
00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:01.390
So Simon Baron Cohen wrote a wonderful book called the essential difference

1001
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:06.850
where he argues that men are by nature less empathetic.

1002
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.930
Women are by nature more empathetic.

1003
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.173
Um,

1004
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:10.981
and,

1005
00:42:10.981 --> 00:42:13.340
and that this is a core sex difference.

1006
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.500
So what do you know?

1007
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:15.930
Well,

1008
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.330
what's the source for this?

1009
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.280
One thing is men are more violent.

1010
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.760
Simon Baron Cohen describes violence as the ultimate act murder as the ultimate

1011
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.720
act of a lack of empathy.

1012
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.560
Um,

1013
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.730
there's some relationship between how much testosterone you have in your system

1014
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.100
and how social you are.

1015
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:35.930
More testosterone,

1016
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.920
less social

1017
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.170
boys tend to be less empathetic than girls.

1018
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:47.420
And there's some evidence though it's not conclusive that boys do worst and

1019
00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:50.420
girls on social cognition theory of mind tasks.

1020
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.600
That's what I have here though that is quite debated and the biggest effect,

1021
00:42:56.601 --> 00:42:58.100
which isn't debated at all.

1022
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.460
His problems with empathy,

1023
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.470
problems of social cognition,

1024
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:04.873
um,

1025
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.150
are much more frequent in men than women.

1026
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.600
So this orders like autism,

1027
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.890
Asperger's syndrome,

1028
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.940
conduct disorder,

1029
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:17.000
and psychopathy are predominantly male.

1030
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.900
And Simon Baron Cohen suggests that,

1031
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:21.920
um,

1032
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.900
basically he has this slogan where he says to be a man is to suffer from a

1033
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:28.550
particularly mild form of autism,

1034
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.690
that males are just socially clueless relative to women.

1035
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.030
Final bit of Trivia.

1036
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.060
This is Simon Baron Cohen who is a very famous developmental psychologist,

1037
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.960
but his cousin Sasha Baron Cohen is far more famous.

1038
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:45.993
Um,

1039
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:52.870
another debate is a debate concerning sex differences in their capacity for math

1040
00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:54.344
and science.

1041
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:59.420
A few years ago there used to be a president of Harvard known as Larry Summers.

1042
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:03.620
There's so many reasons to his at this point.

1043
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.603
Um,

1044
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.260
but,

1045
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.190
and Larry Summers is no longer president of Harvard for various reasons.

1046
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.770
But one reason was this quote,

1047
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.800
which included in his speculations about sex differences in a special case of

1048
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:19.820
science and engineering,

1049
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:23.840
there are issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly if the variability of

1050
00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:24.500
attitude.

1051
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:29.330
He argued our suggested that the underrepresentation of women in the sciences in

1052
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:34.331
academia is because of an intrinsic aptitude difference.

1053
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.390
Women are on average,

1054
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.250
less biologically predisposed to do this sort of reasoning.

1055
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.470
The variability point is that he wasn't suggesting that if there's just a

1056
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:47.700
difference on average,

1057
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:48.601
in fact,

1058
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:51.900
he agreed at the average skills and men and women are identical.

1059
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.500
The claim is that male show more variation.

1060
00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.750
This means that there's more male retarded people and more males who were just

1061
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:02.010
horribly bad at this,

1062
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.530
but it also means there are more male geniuses.

1063
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.280
And he suggested that this plays a role.

1064
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:07.921
This,

1065
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:09.000
as you can imagine,

1066
00:45:09.001 --> 00:45:14.001
proof to be an extremely controversial claim and rather than go through it

1067
00:45:14.401 --> 00:45:18.030
because it would take me a class to treat the pros and cons of this argument

1068
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.110
responsibly.

1069
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.590
Um,

1070
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:23.970
I'm going to refer you to a wonderful debate between Steve Pinker,

1071
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.380
who was quoted earlier and lists Belky who's one of the big infant,

1072
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:29.070
uh,

1073
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:29.861
cognition people.

1074
00:45:29.861 --> 00:45:30.270
And we,

1075
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.840
we spoke a lot about her work earlier on in the course and they have a wonderful

1076
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:36.150
debate between two of the smartest people I know.

1077
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.070
I'm on the edge,

1078
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.900
which was done at Harvard,

1079
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:40.411
uh,

1080
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:43.440
about a year ago and is on video here.

1081
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.190
So if you're interested in sex differences and different theories about the

1082
00:45:47.191 --> 00:45:48.600
mechanism of sex differences,

1083
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.030
this is where you should go.

1084
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:53.903
Finally,

1085
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.310
and the final topic,

1086
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.750
some of us about 98% and the numbers are very difficult to pin down.

1087
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.190
Maybe it is a 90%,

1088
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:06.210
maybe it's 97,

1089
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.320
maybe it's 99.

1090
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:12.590
Let's say 98% of women are sexually attracted to men.

1091
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.290
About 96% of men are sexually attracted to women.

1092
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:21.300
And the number is very,

1093
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:23.190
and it's very difficult to estimate a properly,

1094
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:23.941
as you could imagine,

1095
00:46:23.941 --> 00:46:26.460
there's all sorts of problems with this sort of research,

1096
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:30.690
but there's some proportion of population that's exclusively homosexual,

1097
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:35.280
some proportion of population of men who are only attracted to other men,

1098
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:39.120
some proportion of population of women who are only attracted to other women.

1099
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.170
When people talk about sexual orientation here,

1100
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:47.130
it's important to realize we are not talking here about behavior.

1101
00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.150
Um,

1102
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:52.410
there's all sorts of reasons why somebody might have sex with somebody of the

1103
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:53.340
same sex.

1104
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.090
You know,

1105
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.230
there might be bored,

1106
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.100
you may,

1107
00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:56.580
you know,

1108
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.660
be experimenting,

1109
00:46:57.661 --> 00:46:59.460
be whatever the question is,

1110
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:00.294
what do you want to do?

1111
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.370
All of these be w what,

1112
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.241
what sort of person,

1113
00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:06.720
if you could be sexually or romantically involved with any person,

1114
00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:08.040
who would it be?

1115
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.680
And most people are heterosexual.

1116
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:14.220
There's a considerable amount at various cross culturally of people who are

1117
00:47:14.221 --> 00:47:15.150
bisexual.

1118
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.510
But the real puzzle is exclusive homosexuality.

1119
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.363
So why?

1120
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.473
Well,

1121
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:22.710
nobody knows.

1122
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:23.251
We know.

1123
00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:24.270
Some reasons,

1124
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.760
some answers are probably not right.

1125
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:27.990
Um,

1126
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.430
it is not the case almost certainly.

1127
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:32.530
Maybe there are some exceptions,

1128
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:35.680
but it is not the case that people choose your sexual orientation.

1129
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:36.820
Um,

1130
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.380
I'm not going to do this in this room,

1131
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:43.530
but if I asked people to raise their hands as to how many people decided who to

1132
00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:45.370
become sexually attracted to,

1133
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.960
very few people would,

1134
00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:48.683
um,

1135
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:54.370
part of the issue rises in fact that that people who are gay are often extremely

1136
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:57.250
discriminated against and they have no wish to be gay.

1137
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.280
They might even think it's morally wrong for them to be that way,

1138
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:05.170
that makes it implausible that their sexual orientation is a conscious choice.

1139
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.490
What about experience after puberty?

1140
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.930
So there is,

1141
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.980
is a view that keeps coming up over and over again and literature that people

1142
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:15.814
who are gay,

1143
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:18.730
I have some sense been seduced by people,

1144
00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:19.690
by other people,

1145
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.490
are something happened to him afterwards.

1146
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:22.510
Um,

1147
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.010
this seems unlikely.

1148
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:24.941
Uh,

1149
00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:25.774
there are,

1150
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.590
um,

1151
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.020
in particular the seeds of,

1152
00:48:28.021 --> 00:48:32.980
of sexual orientation later on in life seem to show up quite early in life.

1153
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.361
Again,

1154
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:35.860
the studies are sort of suspect,

1155
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:39.520
but there's some reason to believe that people who are gay and people who are

1156
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:43.930
straight or different long before they hit puberty with regard to her sexual and

1157
00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:45.460
romantic fantasies,

1158
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.270
you would now expect me to say,

1159
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:50.080
well,

1160
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.400
being gay and being straight,

1161
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:52.090
it is built in.

1162
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.050
It's hardwired.

1163
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.640
None of these stories seem right.

1164
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:59.050
It seems to be built in and answer to that is sort of,

1165
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:04.870
so if you do the standard behavioral genetic tests and,

1166
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:06.940
and you by now know how to do them,

1167
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.200
you look for differences.

1168
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:09.540
We knows I got can dies,

1169
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:09.941
I got it.

1170
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:10.480
Twins,

1171
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.560
you do the adoption,

1172
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:12.340
uh,

1173
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.121
comparison,

1174
00:49:13.121 --> 00:49:13.261
you know,

1175
00:49:13.261 --> 00:49:15.370
adopted siblings and biological siblings.

1176
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.050
The answer is yes.

1177
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.880
You find that there is some sort of genetic predisposition towards

1178
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:22.870
homosexuality,

1179
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.510
but it can't be entirely genetic.

1180
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.250
One reason why we can't,

1181
00:49:30.251 --> 00:49:34.900
it can't be entirely genetic is if I'm gay and I have an identical twin,

1182
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.740
the odds that my identical twin will be gay.

1183
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.920
It's about 50% those are very high odds compare to the average in the

1184
00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:44.794
population.

1185
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.250
But if it was truly genetic,

1186
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.600
entirely genetic,

1187
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:50.950
what should the number be?

1188
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.680
100% he's my clone.

1189
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:57.130
He should be exactly as I am and it's not.

1190
00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.850
So we know then that some sort of experience,

1191
00:50:00.851 --> 00:50:04.360
possibly prenatal experience is what explains it.

1192
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:06.131
Why is it,

1193
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:07.450
so I said before,

1194
00:50:07.451 --> 00:50:08.980
this is a huge puzzle.

1195
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.320
Why is it such a huge puzzle?

1196
00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.510
Well,

1197
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.600
exclusive homosexuality is an evolutionary mystery.

1198
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.813
Again,

1199
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.850
do not think that this carries anymore or way to it.

1200
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.193
Uh,

1201
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.130
what it does mean though is that it doesn't seem to follow as a biological

1202
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.973
adaptation.

1203
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.080
The puzzle is not.

1204
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.590
Why is it that some men have sex with men?

1205
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.121
That's not a big puzzle.

1206
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:37.940
Maybe they have sex with men as some sort of recreational thing,

1207
00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:39.440
our pair bonding or whatever.

1208
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:40.790
That's not the puzzle.

1209
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:46.210
The puzzle is why are there some men who don't want to have sex with women?

1210
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.170
Similarly,

1211
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.370
why are to some men,

1212
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.560
women who don't want to have sex with men?

1213
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.200
From an evolutionary adaptive standpoint,

1214
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.890
you would think that the genes that give rise to such a behavior,

1215
00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.613
um,

1216
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.020
would be weeded out because creatures with that behavior,

1217
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:06.800
typically putting aside modern technology don't have offspring.

1218
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:09.290
And that's what makes it such a puzzle.

1219
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:14.300
So your reading response for this week is solve that puzzle.

1220
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:16.790
I know is that early on in the course,

1221
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:20.450
the reading responses would be really easy and just require you reciting back

1222
00:51:20.451 --> 00:51:20.990
things,

1223
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.610
but that proved to be too boring,

1224
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.660
so,

1225
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.850
so just solve this deepest of all puzzles.

1226
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.000
The thing in brackets at the end is very important.

1227
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.020
Um,

1228
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.040
your account,

1229
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.940
whatever it is,

1230
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:36.620
should bear some relationship to the facts as discussed in lectures and

1231
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:37.330
readings.

1232
00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:37.910
Um,

1233
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:39.500
we have about five more minutes.

1234
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.180
Any questions or thoughts?

1235
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.933
Yes.

1236
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.300
Thank you very much.

1237
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.200
Um,

1238
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.520
she likes my leather jacket.

1239
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:50.503
Yeah.

1240
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.200
Any questions or thoughts?

1241
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.220
Just like that one?

1242
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.240
No.

1243
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.073
Yes.

1244
00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:03.873
<v 0>Right.</v>

1245
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:09.090
<v 1>It's a good group on,</v>

1246
00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:09.540
on a home,

1247
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.890
on sexual preferences.

1248
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:12.360
Um,

1249
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.910
that's a very good question because certainly your answer to the origin gimme

1250
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.860
two more minutes.

1251
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:20.910
Certainly your answer about the origin of sexual preference in humans will be

1252
00:52:20.911 --> 00:52:23.340
informed by the question across species data.

1253
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:27.000
What we do know is that there are many animals that engage in homosexual

1254
00:52:27.001 --> 00:52:27.780
behavior.

1255
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.420
They engage in sex with members of their own sex.

1256
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.980
What I don't know is whether you get exclusive homosexual behavior,

1257
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:38.310
so I don't know what the rate is in nonhuman primates,

1258
00:52:38.311 --> 00:52:38.970
for instance,

1259
00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:39.571
of primates,

1260
00:52:39.571 --> 00:52:42.690
you do not want to have sex with members at opposite sex.

1261
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.573
Okay,

1262
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.290
I'll see you all Wednesday.
