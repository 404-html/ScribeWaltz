1
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.780
Let me begin by just reminding us where we are and this course reminding

2
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:22.320
ourselves of what we've done and what we have yet to do.

3
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.570
We started by talking about the brain,

4
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.910
the physical basis of thought,

5
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.290
and then we moved to some general introductions to some foundational ideas.

6
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.300
In the study of psychology,

7
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:34.230
Freud and Skinner,

8
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.140
we spend a bit of time on more cognitive stuff,

9
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:37.920
development,

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.491
language,

11
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:38.821
vision,

12
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:39.654
memory.

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.080
Then we took a little break and the Dean told us about love.

14
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.590
Then we dealt with the emotions,

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.060
the emotions,

16
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:51.690
rationality in evolution and a lot of that what we learned particularly

17
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.150
regarding the evolution of the mind,

18
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.110
um,

19
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.660
provided supporting material for what follows.

20
00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.730
Uh,

21
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.060
we learned about cognitive neuroscience using,

22
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.253
um,

23
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.370
the study of face recognition as an important case study,

24
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.770
human differences,

25
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.120
behavioral genetics,

26
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:12.511
nature,

27
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:13.344
nurture,

28
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.330
sex and food.

29
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.643
Um,

30
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.270
my electric was on sex.

31
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.270
Dr. Brown Nell came and spoke to us about food today,

32
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:22.104
mortality

33
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.900
next week,

34
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.180
social thought and social behavior

35
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.060
mysteries.

36
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.550
Basically a series of topics that don't fit anywhere in the course and really

37
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:37.640
make psychologist scratched their heads.

38
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.400
Um,

39
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.250
these topics are sleep,

40
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.440
laughter and religion.

41
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.910
Mental illness,

42
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.730
two lectures on madness,

43
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:54.731
what can go wrong in your minds and the last lecture on happiness.

44
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.320
And then you're just,

45
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.183
you're just done.

46
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.940
You know,

47
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.940
you know a lot of psychology and a lot of stuff and you're well prepared for

48
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:06.470
your ultimate major in psychology.

49
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.020
Ultimately graduate training at a good school.

50
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.293
Um,

51
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.770
how many people here are either psych majors or expect to become psych majors?

52
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.620
Cognitive or cognitive science is what you could raise your hand too.

53
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.731
Okay,

54
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:23.564
good.

55
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.300
It's nowhere near enough and so,

56
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.330
and so I'll ask the question again.

57
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.690
When once you deal with happiness and then mysteries,

58
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.430
you're really not going to want to what?

59
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:36.140
What is her chemistry?

60
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:37.010
Anthropology.

61
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.601
Premed.

62
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:39.434
Gimme a break.

63
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.483
Okay.

64
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.933
Um,

65
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.590
we're going to deal with three facets of morality.

66
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:45.741
One,

67
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:47.300
talk about moral feelings,

68
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.130
moral judgments,

69
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.700
and then moral action with particular focus on why good people do bad things.

70
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.700
Um,

71
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.550
which will lead us to review and discuss the Milgram's study,

72
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.260
which was presented in the movie on Monday.

73
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.980
<v 0>Now moral feelings</v>

75
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.100
is what we'll start off with.

76
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.530
And we've already discussed this in a different context.

77
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.860
The question is how could moral feelings evolve?

78
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.300
So moral feelings,

79
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.000
we give you his feelings of um,

80
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.720
condemnation,

81
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.003
shame,

82
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.120
emotions like that.

83
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.511
Shame,

84
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.350
condemnation,

85
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.101
pride,

86
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:28.360
righteous anger,

87
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.490
but also simple affection,

88
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:31.840
caring for other people,

89
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.370
wanting to do well by them being upset if an an injustice has to be done by

90
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:36.850
them.

91
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.930
And you might think,

92
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.810
<v 1>okay,</v>

93
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.300
<v 0>that the existence of these feelings is a mystery from it.</v>

94
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.790
I'm illusionary point of view.

95
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.340
If evolution is survival of the fittest,

96
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.590
nature red in tooth and claw,

97
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.320
how could animals evolve?

98
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.210
Moral feelings.

99
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.950
But in fact we know the answer to this and there are two answers to this.

100
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.870
One answer is kin selection.

101
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.690
So evolution works at a level of the genes and because of that it could give

102
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:11.691
rise to animals that are themselves altruistic and they're altruistic because

103
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.230
they act to preserve other animals that share the same genes.

104
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.520
And so I'm not going to work,

105
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:21.270
I'm not gonna spend any time on this because we've discussed it in detail,

106
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.450
but we know from previous lectures that people will be generous to others.

107
00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:31.410
And there's an evolutionary explanation for your generosity towards kin.

108
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.840
It can be mathematically worked out.

109
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.580
You're carrying your moral feelings towards other creatures to the extent of the

110
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:41.070
proportion of genes that you share with them,

111
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.330
<v 1>okay?</v>

112
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.860
<v 0>The most algorithmic behavior of all giving your life to help.</v>

113
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:51.910
Another can be explained in coldblooded evolutionary terms.

114
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.920
Animals that are altruistic,

115
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.040
even to the point of dying to help another,

116
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.640
those genes will under some circumstances be preserved over the genes of people

117
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.650
who are less caring.

118
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.400
And that is one force towards kindness.

119
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.040
A second force towards kindness is cooperation.

120
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.740
Even if animals are unrelated,

121
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.870
they are nice to one another.

122
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.130
Um,

123
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.720
animals would give warning Christ,

124
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.130
they will groom at one another.

125
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.870
They will exchange food.

126
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.290
<v 1>Okay?</v>

127
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.800
<v 0>And the reason for this is that animals have evolved.</v>

128
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.840
Our minds have evolved to enter into sort of cooperative situations with other

129
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:36.560
people.

130
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.560
And to surmount prisoner's dilemma is to surmount,

131
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.670
um,

132
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.230
deception and cheating.

133
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.930
This gives rise to some emotions including emotions that could be viewed as

134
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.870
moral emotions like guilt and anger.

135
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.690
And again,

136
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.490
grounds altruistic behavior.

137
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.320
In an evolutionary perspective,

138
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.280
this is all by means of review,

139
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.640
but the question you can now ask is fine.

140
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.980
That's why moral feelings might evolve,

141
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.080
but what do we know as psychologists about the emergence and nature of moral

142
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:13.430
feelings in an in,

143
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:14.420
in individuals?

144
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.760
What's the psychology of moral feeling?

145
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.880
And this is an issue I'm going to talk about now,

146
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.570
but I'm going to return to next week when we deal with issues such as liking and

147
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:26.780
disliking racial prejudice and other things.

148
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.400
But I want to deal now of a couple of interesting case studies about moral

149
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:33.770
feelings from a psychological point of view.

150
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.700
The first one I want to deal with is empathy and empathy has different

151
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:41.750
definitions,

152
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.940
but we can simply view it as

153
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.500
the feeling that

154
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.830
your pain matters to me.

155
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.510
If you are hurt,

156
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.420
that is in some sense painful for me.

157
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.660
If you are sad that affects my own mood.

158
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.700
I am not a selfish creature.

159
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.660
I am built,

160
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:06.050
I am hardwired to be attuned to your pain.

161
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.750
This is an old observation.

162
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.930
Adam Smith who was often falsely viewed as a proponent of selfishness and

163
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:16.730
hardheadedness.

164
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.680
What's quite explicit about the poll?

165
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:19.514
This has,

166
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.150
um,

167
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.590
he knows when we see a stroke aimed and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm

168
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:25.424
of another person,

169
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.220
we naturally shrink and drawback our own leg or arm.

170
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.510
And when it does fall,

171
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:33.020
we feel it in some measure and are hurt by it as well as the suffer.

172
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.100
If you see somebody being kicked in the Groin and a movie,

173
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.110
you might yourself tense up.

174
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.220
If you see somebody bang their their thumb with a hammer,

175
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.480
you might cringe.

176
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.710
Here's a good illustration of somebody in anticipatory pain.

177
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.163
<v 1>Now</v>

178
00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.990
<v 0>it's a very British base actually.</v>

179
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:00.963
Um,

180
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.113
now

181
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.690
we know certain things about this empathy,

182
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.400
some which might be surprising.

183
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.370
The pain of others is a versa.

184
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.780
Even for babies,

185
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.060
we know this because if babies hear other babies crying,

186
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.680
they will get upset.

187
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.280
The crying of babies is a verse of two babies.

188
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.630
Now,

189
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.560
some of you may be sufficiently cynical to say that could be explained in other

190
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:28.370
ways.

191
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.203
For one thing,

192
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.240
one theory is that babies hear other babies cry because babies are so stupid.

193
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.640
They think they themselves are crying.

194
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.200
If they're crying,

195
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:41.900
they must be in some sort of pain so they cry some more.

196
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.650
But clever psychologist have ruled this out.

197
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:50.030
What they did was a study where they expose babies to tape recorded sounds of

198
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:54.980
other babies crying and tape recorded sounds of themselves.

199
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.920
Babies crying more to this pain of other babies than they do to their own pain,

200
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.580
suggesting that their response is to some extent a response to the otherness of

201
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:12.681
the characters we know pain is of others is a verse of for Chimpanzees,

202
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.810
and we know this in certain ways,

203
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:19.770
but we know this in particular from a series of studies that would be unethical

204
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.270
if they were to be done today.

205
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.790
In these studies,

206
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:29.570
they put a chimpanzee in a room and there's a lever and when the chimpanzee

207
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:31.530
slaps to lever,

208
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.700
it gets some food.

209
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.691
Trivial,

210
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:35.310
smart animal piece of cake,

211
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
but the room has a window leading to another room and another room.

212
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.340
Another chimpanzee has placed this second chimpanzee is not a relative of the,

213
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.120
of the,

214
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.480
of the first chimpanzee and they've never seen each other before.

215
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.990
Now when the first chimpanzee hits the Lever,

216
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.930
the second chimpanzee gets a painful electric shock.

217
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.570
Putting the first Champan Z in a horrible dilemma in order to feed themselves.

218
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:05.030
He has a torture and other animal.

219
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.220
Chimpanzees do not starve themselves to death.

220
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.920
It's very unlikely any of you would either,

221
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.120
but they go along time without food suggesting that you do not want to cause

222
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:17.010
this other chimpanzee pain.

223
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.660
Um,

224
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.340
it only works within species.

225
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:21.540
So in another experiment,

226
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.800
they put a rabbit in the other room and a chimpanzee would slap the lever

227
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:28.770
repeatedly to make the rabbit scream in pain and jump.

228
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:30.963
Um,

229
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.183
now

230
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.930
we've known for a long time that empathetic feeling is not logically linked to

231
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:40.350
morality.

232
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.270
This is a point made by Aristotle.

233
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.440
I could see you writhing in pain that could cause me pain,

234
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.510
but it doesn't mean I'm going to be nice to you.

235
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.890
I could run away from you,

236
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:54.510
I can turn my head or I can blame you for causing me this misery.

237
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.930
But it does happen that emotional that,

238
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.270
that this sort of empathy does lead to moral concern and action.

239
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.513
Um,

240
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.490
if we do an experiment and we induce you to feel empathetic to somebody,

241
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.350
we get you to feel what they're feeling.

242
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.000
You're more likely to be nice to them.

243
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.020
And people differ in the extent to which they feel empathy.

244
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:16.890
Um,

245
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.890
people defer to the extent it will hurt them to watch me slam my thumb with a,

246
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:22.794
with a hammer.

247
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.050
If you are a high empathy,

248
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.900
you're more likely to be a nice person than if you're low empathy.

249
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.670
Suggesting there's some connection between empathetic feeling and liking.

250
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.080
Now,

251
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.080
empathetic feeling like any other human capacity differs across people.

252
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.720
Some of us have a lot of it.

253
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.100
Some of us don't have much of it there.

254
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.230
Some reason to believe that in a population known as psychopaths,

255
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.010
a population we'll return to later on when we discuss illness.

256
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:54.880
Um,

257
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.880
this sort of instinctive empathy is broken and the pain of others just doesn't

258
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.720
bother them very much.

259
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.500
Um,

260
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.300
I asked him illustrative quotes here.

261
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.353
Um,

262
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.160
the Damon's book a wonderful book on psychopathy.

263
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.200
He talks about a 13 year old McGraw who specialized in mugging blind people.

264
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.060
And when asked about the pain,

265
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:17.020
he caused his victims,

266
00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:17.920
he responded,

267
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.941
what do I care?

268
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.930
I'm not her,

269
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.240
which is logically correct,

270
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.470
but in a sense in human,

271
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:26.380
the fact that it's another person should make you care.

272
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.820
The serial killer,

273
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:32.821
Gary Gilmore basically said the pain of others gratified him and caused him no

274
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:34.600
unhappiness at all.

275
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.540
I was always capable of murder.

276
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.350
I can become totally devoid of feelings of others unemotional.

277
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.700
I know I'm doing something grossly and here it is a very bad word wrong.

278
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.770
I can still go ahead and do it.

279
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.550
And Ted Bundy when interviewed at one point said he was astonished that people

280
00:12:55.871 --> 00:13:00.871
made such a fuss about all of his murders because he said,

281
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.880
I mean there are so many people

282
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.060
and if any of you here are nodding in agreement that these sentiments,

283
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.710
that's not such a good sign.

284
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.910
These are,

285
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.800
these are particularly callous and cold leaded statements suggesting that is

286
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:18.910
instinctive empathy.

287
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.420
This aspect of moral thought is not,

288
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:23.920
um,

289
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.740
is present in most of us but not in all of us.

290
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.340
The second case study of moral feeling,

291
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:32.710
its ingroup and outgroup in our,

292
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.820
in our affections,

293
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:34.091
in our,

294
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:35.890
in our caring who we like,

295
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.060
who we feel close to,

296
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:38.350
who's pain bothers us.

297
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.850
We are not indiscriminate.

298
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.080
I care a lot more about my children than I do about my friends and I care more

299
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:49.630
about my friends and I care about strangers.

300
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.550
We're all like that.

301
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.770
We also favor our group over others in every possible way.

302
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:58.600
You are a member of many groups.

303
00:13:59.170 --> 00:13:59.801
You are men,

304
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:00.634
you are women,

305
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.050
you're Yale students,

306
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.543
you're young,

307
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.990
you're,

308
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.741
you're white,

309
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:06.221
you're black,

310
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:07.054
you're Asian,

311
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.130
you're member of these groups.

312
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.050
And as we will discuss repeatedly,

313
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:11.890
um,

314
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.590
when we talk about social cognition and social behavior,

315
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.570
this membership matters a lot to you.

316
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.090
What's particularly interesting is even groups that are formed that you're not

317
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:22.481
born with,

318
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:27.481
that are formed on the fly exert a huge amount of control over your moral

319
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:29.020
feelings and moral attitudes.

320
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.230
And that the best example of this is discussed in detail in the textbook.

321
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.970
And this is the robber's cave study.

322
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.520
And this robber's cave study serves as a nice illustration of morality in

323
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:43.450
everyday life.

324
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.873
Um,

325
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.790
the study was 11 and 12 year old boys at a camping program.

326
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.950
These were well adjusted pretty kids,

327
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.530
racially homogeneous,

328
00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.510
and they were putting a separate cabins and the cabins were given leaders and

329
00:15:00.511 --> 00:15:03.750
they gave themselves names being unimaginative.

330
00:15:03.751 --> 00:15:04.260
Boys,

331
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.570
they call themselves the eagles and the rattlers.

332
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.620
But the,

333
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.130
as what happened was being separated,

334
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.280
they developed distinctive cultures

335
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.003
<v 1>and</v>

336
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.050
<v 0>when these groups were set in competition against each other,</v>

337
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.060
the eagles versus the rattlers,

338
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.500
the within group intensity grew,

339
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.851
eagles began,

340
00:15:30.851 --> 00:15:34.960
eagles began to care a lot more about other eagles than about anybody else.

341
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.273
Um,

342
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.950
so there's within group solidarity and then there were negative stereotypes.

343
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.270
Um,

344
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.220
so these groups develop different cultures.

345
00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:47.380
It was a randomly cut apart,

346
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.710
kind of like Yale College is actually where you got a random assortment of

347
00:15:50.711 --> 00:15:51.520
people.

348
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.800
But despite the fact that the assortment is random,

349
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.970
the division is random,

350
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.830
cultures begin to emerge.

351
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.660
The eagles prided themselves on being clean,

352
00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:02.494
living,

353
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.310
not using cuss words and treating each other with respect.

354
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.340
They viewed the rattlers as dirty and tough and kind of Slovenly slobs.

355
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.090
Um,

356
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.950
the rattlers viewed the eagles as Goodie,

357
00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:16.330
Goodie kids.

358
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.373
Um,

359
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:18.963
it's cruel.

360
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.793
Finally,

361
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.030
it all devolves into hostilities,

362
00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:26.890
raid rates and violence.

363
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.550
Um,

364
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:32.550
the eagles burnt or rattlers banner cuss words were occasionally used.

365
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.730
And so Sharif the expert,

366
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.340
a psychologist designing all of this when,

367
00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:39.850
you know,

368
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.683
excellent.

369
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.733
And,

370
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.360
and then the problem,

371
00:16:43.361 --> 00:16:43.960
he then says,

372
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.070
now we've created,

373
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.320
we've created two different warning cultures.

374
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.363
That was fun.

375
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.080
What do we do to make them friends again?

376
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.270
And then we figured how to now we've done that.

377
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.100
Then this whole solve all sorts of problems.

378
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.870
So they started off,

379
00:16:58.871 --> 00:16:59.541
they wanted to have a,

380
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:04.541
they said a peace talks were representative of the Eagle and a representative

381
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.653
rattler.

382
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.340
Um,

383
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.630
we're set to meet and plan a ways to,

384
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.040
they get,

385
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:10.400
you know,

386
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.540
disarm and stop using cuss words and everything like that.

387
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.633
Um,

388
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.790
this failed.

389
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.620
The kids who engaged in the peace talks were ostracized by their own groups as,

390
00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:22.060
as treasonous.

391
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:23.883
That failed.

392
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.840
They decided to set up individual competitions like the Olympics where they

393
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:29.051
would,

394
00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:32.170
people wouldn't compete as eagles or rattlers,

395
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.640
but rather,

396
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.090
um,

397
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.680
they would compete as individuals that fail to like the Olympics.

398
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.460
People.

399
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.140
The teams took the readability.

400
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.130
They took their individual accomplishments as reflecting on,

401
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:44.331
on,

402
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.100
on the group,

403
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.100
and it devolved into eagles versus the rattlers.

404
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.450
They shared meals.

405
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.410
They turned it,

406
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.440
which turned into food fights and more cuss words.

407
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.470
They shared movies,

408
00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.761
more fights,

409
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:00.720
more cuss words.

410
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.240
They share fun with firecrackers,

411
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.290
which,

412
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.790
which was a disastrous thing,

413
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:07.560
was nearly brought the experiment to an end.

414
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.260
They brought in a religious figure to give them sermons on brotherly love.

415
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.860
The sermons were entirely unsuccessful.

416
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.753
Um,

417
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.320
what,

418
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.220
what's interesting is they did the Eagle.

419
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.090
They took them to heart.

420
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:24.140
These were good kids.

421
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.210
They were respectful of religious authority,

422
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.140
but the lessons they took from him as I should learn to love my neighbor,

423
00:18:30.141 --> 00:18:30.921
if I'm a rattler,

424
00:18:30.921 --> 00:18:34.190
I should learn to love my fellow rattler and appreciate him as a fellow writer,

425
00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:34.790
as a person.

426
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.623
I love him.

427
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.120
His love nonlegal scummy eagles.

428
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.053
<v 1>Um,</v>

429
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.663
they all failed.

430
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.003
Here's what worked.

431
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.610
<v 0>Sharif told the kids,</v>

432
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.640
all of the kids that the water line to the camp was cut

433
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.310
and they all had to defend the camp.

434
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.240
What does dad did was it established a superordinate goal?

435
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:07.260
That is a goal that everybody shared and perhaps more important,

436
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.730
a common enemy.

437
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.060
This is where the solution,

438
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.250
by the way to bringing together,

439
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:18.090
and you could write this down to bringing together all the warning countries and

440
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:23.091
religions of this planet is an alien attack by the logic of the sheer,

441
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:27.690
even who all bring us all together as a group.

442
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.880
Um,

443
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.130
and different question is there.

444
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:33.360
In that experiment,

445
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.380
the groupiness was established in a very powerful way.

446
00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:38.670
They live separately.

447
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.290
They interacted with each other.

448
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:41.520
They had their own names.

449
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.120
The psychologist Taj fell after World War II was interested in the question of

450
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:51.090
what could make a group.

451
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.470
In other words,

452
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.120
what do we have to do to you to put you in a different group from him?

453
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.190
What do we have to do to this class,

454
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.780
this side of the class,

455
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:03.900
to put you in a different group from this side and different from that site.

456
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.580
And what would it have to do for those groups to matter,

457
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.391
such that,

458
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:10.224
for instance,

459
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:15.150
if I separate you in one group and you are another group and I give you $100,

460
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.930
will you give the money more to him or to him?

461
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.850
Will you give it more to your own group?

462
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:21.690
Our to another group.

463
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.340
And what he found was,

464
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.723
um,

465
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.240
you don't need much.

466
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.780
In one experiment he showed people pictures of modern art and based on their

467
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:38.430
responses he described him as Chloe lovers or Kandinsky lovers.

468
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.200
And this is all made up.

469
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.820
They were just random assignment.

470
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.410
But the Cli lovers viewed themselves as more similar to other key lovers.

471
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.990
They thought the key Lubbers headed to be smarter than to convince the lovers

472
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.230
and the clean levers,

473
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.113
um,

474
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.170
would devote more resources to themselves than to others.

475
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.810
This is why it's called minimal groups.

476
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:01.810
You don't need much to make you into a group.

477
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.560
Um,

478
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.170
and in fact later experiments just flipped the coin.

479
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.280
So the line,

480
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.740
the experiment goes like this.

481
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.570
I ask everybody was glad to take out a coin.

482
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.560
You all flip it.

483
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.000
Everyone who's heads,

484
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.140
you're one group,

485
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.160
everyone who tails,

486
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:16.923
you're neither group.

487
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.000
Then I ask people in the heads group,

488
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.980
which group do you put yourself aside?

489
00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:21.910
Which group on average?

490
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:22.840
You think a smarter.

491
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.531
It was like,

492
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:23.711
well,

493
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:24.544
you know,

494
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.370
kind of works out that the heads group is Kinda really smear to heads,

495
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:27.581
you know,

496
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:28.350
smart.

497
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.183
Um,

498
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.830
which group?

499
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.720
Here's some money you have to distribute it.

500
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.190
You're more likely,

501
00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:33.940
it's a subtle,

502
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.400
it's a subtle effect when you make the groups so minimal,

503
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.130
but you're more likely to give it to your own group then to others.

504
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.300
And this suggests that moral feelings are exquisitely attuned,

505
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:48.690
not necessarily only to individuals but also to the psychology of groups.

506
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

507
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.340
<v 0>Any questions at this point about moral feelings?</v>

508
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.353
<v 1>Yes.</v>

509
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.843
How was that?

510
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.940
<v 0>It's morality and Beers on morality because it bears on.</v>

511
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.070
The question is how does group membership,

512
00:22:22.071 --> 00:22:23.990
how does that relate to the topic of morality?

513
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.240
And the answer is the moral feelings.

514
00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:27.410
We're talking about our feelings,

515
00:22:27.411 --> 00:22:28.550
like empathy and caring.

516
00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.780
For me to have a moral feeling towards you means you matter to me.

517
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.860
If you were to be harmed,

518
00:22:33.861 --> 00:22:35.000
I would do it as wrong.

519
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.930
And the group experiments suggest that the extent to which these moral feelings

520
00:22:38.931 --> 00:22:42.680
operate are partially determined by the groups to which we belong to.

521
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.210
Um,

522
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.240
if I'm American and you are from another country,

523
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.430
I will view myself.

524
00:22:49.431 --> 00:22:53.600
This is a very kind of obvious finding my obligations to you will be seen as

525
00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:55.700
less than if you were another American.

526
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.700
If I'm a clea lover and you're a Kandinsky lover,

527
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.190
I don't think you quite deserve as much as me.

528
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.270
Moral judgment is an area that is tremendously exciting.

529
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:15.760
And there's a lot of recent research on this.

530
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:16.660
Um,

531
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.770
by moral judgment,

532
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.960
I mean not empathetic feelings,

533
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:22.870
not feelings of caring and love our approval and disapproval.

534
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.450
So not feelings of caring and love and empathy,

535
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.470
but notions like something is good or bad,

536
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.430
something like something is fair or unfair.

537
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.730
So there were three hallmarks for moral judgments.

538
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.600
So I suppose I say I don't like strawberry ice cream.

539
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.130
That's an evaluation.

540
00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:46.964
That's a judgment,

541
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.800
but it's not a moral judgment.

542
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:50.503
Why not?

543
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.650
Because I don't think it carries a sense of obligation.

544
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.240
I don't think anybody's obliged to eat or not eat strawberry ice cream and it

545
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:02.270
doesn't carry a notion of sanctions.

546
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.200
Meaning I don't think anybody should be punished for reading strawberry ice

547
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:07.034
cream.

548
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.440
On the other hand,

549
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.370
um,

550
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.830
if I say I don't like baby killers,

551
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.100
that actually is a moral judgment in my case.

552
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:16.880
So it's not me.

553
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.180
I said,

554
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.013
well,

555
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.190
I don't like baby killers.

556
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.300
You'd like to kill babies.

557
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.160
I actually think we are obliged not to kill babies.

558
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.990
If you disagree with me,

559
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:29.720
you're wrong and you should stop killing those babies.

560
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.470
Should you fail to stop killing those babies?

561
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.540
I think you should be punished for killing babies.

562
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.570
And that's what my judgment about.

563
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.390
No killing babies makes it a moral judgment.

564
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.643
Now,

565
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.790
some people are tempted to look at this the wrong way and say,

566
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:47.240
look,

567
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.260
what a weird topic.

568
00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:49.094
Morality.

569
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.900
I don't believe in morality.

570
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.000
I believe in Nietzsche.

571
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.330
I don't believe in where I,

572
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.910
I don't believe in ethics.

573
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.043
Um,

574
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.860
but I don't believe you if you were to say that because morality isn't morality

575
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.340
as we talk about it in this context isn't just regarding your position on big

576
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:13.580
questions like political issues or,

577
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:13.820
um,

578
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.500
or big moral questions like abortion or capital punishment rather.

579
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.290
Some sort of moral judgment happens all the time,

580
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.330
often unconsciously.

581
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:24.200
Um,

582
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.270
so as you live your life,

583
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.190
you have to answer questions like,

584
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.700
what should you eat anymore of vegetarians here

585
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.880
I'm just raising my hand to encourage people.

586
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.873
Okay.

587
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.360
Anybody give to charity?

588
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.980
Anybody not give to charity?

589
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.693
Good.

590
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.050
Different from the moral vegetarians I noticed.

591
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.003
Um,

592
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.900
who do you socialize with?

593
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.050
There's homeless people around Yale and new haven.

594
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:54.884
What do you give to them?

595
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.270
You avoid their eyes.

596
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.531
Do you,

597
00:25:57.531 --> 00:25:58.364
um,

598
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.410
what do you want to do with your life?

599
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.230
Who you have sex with?

600
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.950
Under what context or conditions?

601
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.110
These are moral questions.

602
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:09.740
Um,

603
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.740
I view my favorite moral dilemma is as I'm walking down the street and I see

604
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:15.861
somebody,

605
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:16.760
I sort of know,

606
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.660
do I like avoid eye so I don't have a conversation or do I say,

607
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.131
hey,

608
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:23.000
how are you doing?

609
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.230
Or do I kind of do the nod hoping that there won't be more than this nod?

610
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.750
And then after I leave and I say,

611
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.991
oh,

612
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:31.520
I should have made eye contact that person,

613
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.510
I'm such a jerk.

614
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.580
There's a homeless person.

615
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.103
And,

616
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.090
but these are day to day moral questions we struggle with all the time.

617
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.650
And so,

618
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:47.580
so there's a sense [inaudible] in the study of how we do moral reasoning.

619
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.470
So what do we know about more reasoning?

620
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.543
Well,

621
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.380
we know that there are some universals are some aspects of more reasoning that

622
00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:00.510
show up everywhere on earth.

623
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.580
And there's some evidence though it's not particularly strong at this point,

624
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.740
that the same intuition show up in young children and a nonhuman primates like

625
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:11.521
chimpanzees,

626
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:12.151
capuchins,

627
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:13.170
macaques and so on.

628
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.020
And these are things like anger at cheaters,

629
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.430
gratitude toward sharers,

630
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.000
the sort of things you'd expect to come out in a prisoner's dilemma.

631
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.553
Um,

632
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:27.510
feelings that some things are right and some things are wrong and these are

633
00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:28.344
foundational.

634
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.150
But at the same time the study of more reasoning is a fascinating,

635
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.650
fascinating issue for those of us interested in cross cultural psychology cause

636
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:39.990
there are playing differences across cultures.

637
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:45.290
So the anthropologist Richard Schwayder gives a list here of human differences.

638
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:51.060
People have found it quite natural to be spontaneously appalled.

639
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:51.711
L rage and digging,

640
00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:51.980
indignant,

641
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.590
proud,

642
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.250
disgusted,

643
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.170
guilty and ashamed by all sorts of things.

644
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.670
Then there's a long list.

645
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:57.481
Masturbation,

646
00:27:57.481 --> 00:27:58.440
homosexuality,

647
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.580
sexual abstinence,

648
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:00.121
polygamy,

649
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:00.541
abortion,

650
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:01.171
circumcision,

651
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:01.891
corporal punishment,

652
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:02.670
capital punishment,

653
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.091
Islam,

654
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:03.571
Christianity,

655
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:03.991
Judaism,

656
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:04.800
capitalism,

657
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.371
democracy,

658
00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:06.031
flag burning,

659
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:06.600
mini skirts,

660
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.081
long hair,

661
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:08.250
no her here,

662
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:08.731
blah,

663
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:09.030
blah.

664
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.620
Parents and children sleeping in the same bed.

665
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:12.700
Parents and children not sleeping in the same bed.

666
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.830
Women being allowed to work,

667
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:14.970
women not being allowed to work.

668
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.050
If I put it down in a list and got people to tick it off,

669
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.860
what you all thought there will be some differences.

670
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.380
Some of you think mediating is okay.

671
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.840
Some of you do not.

672
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.943
Some of you,

673
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.500
you might have different views about divorce.

674
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.880
Um,

675
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.250
most of you believe women should be allowed to work.

676
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:36.570
Um,

677
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.580
most of you will be,

678
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:43.610
will be in favor or not morally a scolding of homosexuality.

679
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.470
You'll be lukewarm about polygamy.

680
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.230
Nobody would like abstinence and so on.

681
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.873
But,

682
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.580
but if we gave that same list,

683
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.170
the people in a different culture,

684
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.240
they take off entirely different things.

685
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.310
These are ways in which people vary.

686
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.320
I don't think people vary in their feelings about baby killing.

687
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.180
I don't think he'd people vary.

688
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:08.880
But the feelings of I do something for you and then you don't,

689
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.710
you don't do something for me.

690
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.410
I think that's gut level hardwired,

691
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.720
evolve to solve prisoners dilemmas.

692
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.130
But these are important issues and these vary a lot from culture to culture.

693
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:25.370
And a good theory of psychology has to explain how these differences arise.

694
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.670
And Schwayder has a theory which is quite interesting.

695
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.990
Schwayder argues that there are three styles of thought,

696
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.810
three different,

697
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:37.710
um,

698
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.210
frameworks and moral thought.

699
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:40.230
Three different ethics.

700
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.120
There's an ethics of autonomy.

701
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.190
This is what moral philosophers within our culture of you as morality,

702
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.050
notions of rights,

703
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:50.771
of equality,

704
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:51.604
of freedom,

705
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.300
but many cultures focused on an ethics of community,

706
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.210
bringing together duty status,

707
00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:00.250
hierarchy and interdependence.

708
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:05.530
Other cultures focused more on an ethics of divinity where notions such as

709
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:06.041
purity,

710
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:06.874
sanctity,

711
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.511
pollution,

712
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:09.280
and sin are relevant.

713
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.940
So for example,

714
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.830
um,

715
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.760
when we're talking about the rights of men and women and what they should be

716
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:19.630
allowed to do,

717
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:25.290
many people in our society following an ethics of autonomy will argue that they

718
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:28.350
should have equal rights in all domains of behavior.

719
00:30:28.351 --> 00:30:29.220
Since they're there,

720
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.390
sentient free creatures,

721
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.780
they should have a right to do whatever they want unless there's a compelling

722
00:30:34.781 --> 00:30:35.770
argument against it.

723
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:39.010
And the compelling argument would have to involve some infringement of the

724
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:40.240
freedom of other people.

725
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.040
On the other hand,

726
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.440
if you're in an ethics of community,

727
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.900
you might argue that men and women have different rights and different

728
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:47.950
responsibilities.

729
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.280
They may be born to perform certain things and as such are duty bound to follow

730
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:55.144
them.

731
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.240
If you're from an ethics of divinity,

732
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.140
you may appeal to religious injunctions against certain actions and behaviors.

733
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:05.980
Um,

734
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.910
and these may differentially restrict the behavior of men and women.

735
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:10.841
You might believe,

736
00:31:10.841 --> 00:31:11.500
for instance,

737
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.700
that women should not prepare food when men's grading because it would

738
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:16.960
contaminate the food.

739
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.880
You may believe that there's,

740
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.500
there's severe restrictions about who could have sex with one another that don't

741
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:25.390
have to do with human rights and human freedom.

742
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.550
It has to do with the way things should be.

743
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:28.930
Um,

744
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.090
because of issues of pollution and sin.

745
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.853
Now,

746
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.420
western cultures,

747
00:31:34.421 --> 00:31:35.440
as I said,

748
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.850
are highly invested in an ethics of autonomy.

749
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.630
And so the Bates we have in our culture tend to be framed in terms of an ethics

750
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:47.944
of autonomy.

751
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.550
If we have a debate about abortion in this class,

752
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.440
people what some people might say,

753
00:31:53.441 --> 00:31:54.274
look,

754
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.640
the fetus is ascension being and as such,

755
00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.750
it has a right to um,

756
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.500
to survive and shouldn't be killed by its mother.

757
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.300
Other people would argue,

758
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:04.751
no,

759
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:08.650
a woman has full freedom over her own body and as long as the fetus is within

760
00:32:08.651 --> 00:32:09.910
the body they had,

761
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:11.320
she has a right to control it.

762
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.150
If we're arguing about hate speech,

763
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.410
we could talk about the balance between the rights of freedom of speech versus

764
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.500
the right to a certain quality of education,

765
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.930
free of harassment and humiliation.

766
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.570
Those are the way we frame things.

767
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:31.170
But one of the more interesting discoveries in this field is that although

768
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:35.290
people think that they're governed by the ethics of autonomy,

769
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.510
even people within our culture,

770
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.270
even highly educated people within our culture,

771
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:46.420
even people like you show moral judgments that are not quite as simple.

772
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.290
So this is the work of Jonathan Heit at University of Virginia.

773
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.330
And I'd find if you ask people,

774
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.530
they believe in our culture that it holds to an ethics of autonomy.

775
00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.810
It doesn't harm anyone.

776
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:00.644
It's okay.

777
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.620
So if I was to ask you your attitudes about sex,

778
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.783
most of you,

779
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.440
not all of you come from different cultures.

780
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:07.310
You have different attitudes,

781
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.510
but most of you would say sex between consenting adults is okay.

782
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.310
As long as nobody gets hurt.

783
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.600
Um,

784
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.830
as long as nobody gets hurt,

785
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:17.140
people's rights are,

786
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.140
are respected.

787
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.090
So gay marriage for instance,

788
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.380
or gay sex would be okay with you because,

789
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.113
um,

790
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:27.051
it is,

791
00:33:27.051 --> 00:33:29.660
it is nobody is harmed and these are consenting adults.

792
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.410
Hight points out that there are certain problems.

793
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.131
His argument,

794
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:35.600
and he illustrates this problems,

795
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:38.390
these problems with stories like this.

796
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.291
Julian,

797
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:47.291
mark are brother and sister are traveling together in France on summer vacation

798
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:51.080
from college one night.

799
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:53.540
They are staying alone in a cabin near the beach.

800
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.230
They decided it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love.

801
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.860
At the very least it would be a new experience for each of them.

802
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.340
Julie was already taking birth control pills,

803
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.140
but mark uses a condom too,

804
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.430
just to be safe.

805
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.490
They both enjoy making love,

806
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.410
but they decide not to do it again.

807
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:17.840
They keep that night a special secret which makes them feel even closer to each

808
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:18.674
other.

809
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.270
What do you think about that?

810
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.340
Was it okay for them to make love

811
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:24.930
<v 1>who says yes?</v>

812
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.433
Good.

813
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.281
<v 0>And also be able to say,</v>

814
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:31.411
yeah,

815
00:34:31.411 --> 00:34:33.910
shoot her hands and they look around in astonishment that no one else has

816
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480
<v 1>who says no.</v>

817
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:38.090
Hey,

818
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.140
who's not sure?

819
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.060
You're not sure?

820
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.250
That's the weirdest of all

821
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.460
<v 0>pipelines,</v>

822
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.460
that the distribution,

823
00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:49.330
even among this,

824
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.190
if you look,

825
00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.250
if you go home and you ask and you ask your parents,

826
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:55.180
he said,

827
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.013
Ooh,

828
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.891
what is,

829
00:34:56.891 --> 00:34:58.480
what are you learning at Yale?

830
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.033
<v 1>MMM.</v>

831
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.640
<v 0>This is a very unusual culture.</v>

832
00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:06.470
And where some people will say it's okay,

833
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.490
what height finds is most people say it doesn't.

834
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.400
And then he simply asked them being good psychologist,

835
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.390
okay,

836
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:15.440
what's wrong with it?

837
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.140
And this is the brother,

838
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:18.974
sister case.

839
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:25.270
And the responses are interesting because people view themselves as committed to

840
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:26.600
an ethics of autonomy.

841
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.970
They can't just say it's disgusting.

842
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:34.130
So they exhibit what height describes his moral dumbfounding meaning that they

843
00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:35.750
struggle to find an explanation.

844
00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:39.750
They say it's terrible because they'll have a kid and the kid will grow up

845
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:42.540
freaky and then the experiment,

846
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:43.770
or it's an interview situation says,

847
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:44.161
well,

848
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:44.341
no,

849
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:46.590
remember they're both using a lot of birth control.

850
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.210
Uh,

851
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.710
maybe she's under age,

852
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.341
no,

853
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:51.174
not underage.

854
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.000
And finally it's just wrong.

855
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.800
Similarly,

856
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.353
um,

857
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.130
another one,

858
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.060
<v 1>the scenarios,</v>

859
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.500
this isn't as bad as you might expect.

860
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.180
<v 0>The family dog is playing outside and gets hit by a car.</v>

861
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.380
They bring it in and they say,

862
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:19.771
oh,

863
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:21.360
Fido's dead Fido's dead,

864
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.800
but what's for dinner?

865
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.930
So they cook it and eat it.

866
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.020
Who says it's okay?

867
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.383
Good.

868
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.710
Who says it's not okay?

869
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.683
Okay.

870
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.700
Then they notice,

871
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.930
then they notice that their toilet is kind of dirty,

872
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.600
but whoa,

873
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.250
there's an American flag.

874
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.040
They then use the toilet to clean the flag.

875
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.260
<v 1>Who says that's okay?</v>

876
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.321
<v 0>Anyway,</v>

877
00:36:57.321 --> 00:36:58.280
I think it's not okay.

878
00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.340
And this keep in mind,

879
00:37:01.341 --> 00:37:03.140
we're getting sorta even and responses here,

880
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.670
here on all of these.

881
00:37:04.671 --> 00:37:09.140
The majority of people who are not college students in elite university say,

882
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.501
oh,

883
00:37:09.501 --> 00:37:10.490
that's so wrong.

884
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:16.450
Finally there's this one and this one really is as bad as one might expect.

885
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:17.783
Um,

886
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:20.870
the guy is lonely,

887
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.950
<v 1>so</v>

888
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.560
<v 0>purchases a frozen chicken from the supermarket,</v>

889
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.920
brings it home and has relations with it.

890
00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.310
<v 1>Then he cooks it and eats it.</v>

891
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.143
This is,

892
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.570
this is a scientific paper and psych review.

893
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.260
Okay.

894
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.510
Who says that's okay?

895
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.983
And I noticed,

896
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.580
and I noticed there's

897
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.040
<v 0>consistency among among people.</v>

898
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.610
The people think it's okay.

899
00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:58.600
Um,

900
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.540
have every right to say that they believe,

901
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.810
if they really sincerely believe,

902
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.340
okay,

903
00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.110
they are committed to an ethics of autonomy.

904
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.470
Those of you who think it's not okay,

905
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.050
none of these should ask yourself why

906
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.340
and should then scrutinize your reasons.

907
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.470
People are very smart and they could present easily presented reasons why they

908
00:38:20.471 --> 00:38:20.830
can say,

909
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:21.131
oh,

910
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:22.240
a disease.

911
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.180
But these reasons tend not to be sincere.

912
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.870
If you take away the considerations that the reaction stays.

913
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:32.920
And these are then interesting case studies of how our moral judgment is

914
00:38:32.921 --> 00:38:35.860
governed by factors that we might not conscious of.

915
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.030
Our moral intuitions can surprise us

916
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.543
milligrams.

917
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.790
The motivation for Milgram's work,

918
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:55.890
and this is the final thing we'll talk about in the context of morality.

919
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.840
The motivation for Milgram's work,

920
00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:58.440
uh,

921
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.440
was the Holocaust and he was interested in exploring why such a thing could

922
00:39:07.771 --> 00:39:08.604
happen.

923
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.323
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

924
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:14.690
<v 0>I should know by the way,</v>

925
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.030
you,

926
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.441
you know,

927
00:39:15.441 --> 00:39:17.960
for an a movie that Milgrom was uh,

928
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.360
was a Yale professor.

929
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:21.741
He,

930
00:39:21.741 --> 00:39:22.280
um,

931
00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.100
he left Yale when he didn't get tenure,

932
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.410
moved to Harvard,

933
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.270
didn't get tenure there too.

934
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.733
Um,

935
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.161
he was,

936
00:39:31.161 --> 00:39:33.590
he had a reputation by then as a mad doctor.

937
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.980
He ended up,

938
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.290
uh,

939
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.980
at City University of New York,

940
00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.960
became a full professor at,

941
00:39:38.961 --> 00:39:39.770
um,

942
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:40.940
at age 33,

943
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.450
died in his early fifties.

944
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.020
Uh,

945
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.760
did not lead a good life,

946
00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.880
but had extraordinary discoveries.

947
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.260
Another discovery,

948
00:39:51.261 --> 00:39:54.680
which we'll talk about next week is has anybody heard the phrase six degrees of

949
00:39:54.681 --> 00:39:55.514
separation?

950
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.000
Milgrom and we'll talk about that later.

951
00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:00.080
Um,

952
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.870
Milgrom had a powerful imagination.

953
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.813
Okay,

954
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.291
so we know this.

955
00:40:06.291 --> 00:40:07.310
This is all review.

956
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.563
There's the guy.

957
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.340
How many of you laughed when you saw the movie?

958
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.610
Interesting question.

959
00:40:14.611 --> 00:40:15.180
Why?

960
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.610
And we'll talk about that a little while.

961
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.733
Um,

962
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.720
shocks spite,

963
00:40:20.721 --> 00:40:21.311
shock to x,

964
00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:21.460
x,

965
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.580
X.

966
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:24.600
There's,

967
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.580
this is just repeating what you've seen.

968
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.683
Um,

969
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:31.110
the learner protest as he's being shocked more and more,

970
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.380
but the experimenter continues to request obedience.

971
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:35.310
Um,

972
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.720
for those of you who haven't seen the movie,

973
00:40:36.721 --> 00:40:37.230
again,

974
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.860
the setup is someone has a subject they don't know.

975
00:40:40.861 --> 00:40:43.260
They think that they're teaching somebody in a memory game.

976
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:48.380
But actually the person who is being shocked is a confederate confederate who is

977
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.120
trained to react in certain ways as he's being increasingly shocked.

978
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:59.900
And the finding is that the majority of people will deliver a fatal shocks that

979
00:41:01.431 --> 00:41:06.330
as person who they had never met based on the instructions of another person.

980
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:12.090
Now there's some immediate bad explanations for this.

981
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.770
One explanation is,

982
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:15.260
um,

983
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.680
these are really strange people.

984
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.480
These are an a normal group of psychopaths,

985
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.120
but we know that's not true.

986
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.550
It's been replicated with many subjects.

987
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.660
There was no reason to believe that the subjects it Milgram's original study,

988
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.410
um,

989
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.120
we're in any way unusual.

990
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.420
It's also a misreading to say that people are in general sadistic.

991
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.130
You remember from the movie,

992
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:39.590
nobody got pleasure from giving the shocks.

993
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.050
They felt acutely uncomfortable,

994
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.010
embarrassed,

995
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:45.920
conflicted under a huge amount of stress.

996
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.230
They weren't liking doing this.

997
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.240
There were follow up studies.

998
00:41:52.241 --> 00:41:53.440
This is the original study.

999
00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.200
If you take it away from Yale,

1000
00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.420
some of the authority goes away.

1001
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.950
And similarly the extent to which there are fatal shocks goes down.

1002
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.023
Um,

1003
00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.250
if the teacher is with the learner next,

1004
00:42:09.251 --> 00:42:10.090
next to him,

1005
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.380
it goes down.

1006
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:15.610
If you have to put the guy's hand on it,

1007
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.700
you're less likely to kill them.

1008
00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:19.773
Uh,

1009
00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.560
if the experiment or it gives you instructions by phone,

1010
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.930
you're less likely to do it.

1011
00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.420
If an ordinary man,

1012
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.690
not the guy in a white lab coat but in ordinary guy says,

1013
00:42:31.691 --> 00:42:32.200
hey,

1014
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.670
keep shocking and that's okay,

1015
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.260
you're less likely to do it.

1016
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.120
And if there's a rebellion,

1017
00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.740
if somebody else rebels is,

1018
00:42:38.741 --> 00:42:39.574
I won't do it.

1019
00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.400
You are much more likely not to do it yourself.

1020
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.211
There are some,

1021
00:42:46.211 --> 00:42:47.044
oh sorry.

1022
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:49.091
Yeah.

1023
00:42:49.091 --> 00:42:51.370
And if you could get to choose your own shock level,

1024
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.850
you be keep looking then very,

1025
00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:56.260
very few people go all the way.

1026
00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.130
So these are an important list of factors as to the factory that can make

1027
00:43:00.131 --> 00:43:04.150
somebody less likely to bring it up to the killing level.

1028
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:04.990
And as a rule,

1029
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:09.100
we can look at those factors and think about what is the perfect situation for

1030
00:43:09.101 --> 00:43:10.870
making somebody do something like this.

1031
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.370
And the perfect situation,

1032
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.670
not to some more serious critiques in Milgram's

1033
00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.810
Milgram's experiment is why we have human subjects committees.

1034
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.540
This is a terribly stressful experiment to do to people.

1035
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.300
And as I say now,

1036
00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:33.250
but a lot of studies I described this class,

1037
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.690
it would not today be done.

1038
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:35.950
Um,

1039
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:40.950
people did say they were happy to have participated and only 2% said that they

1040
00:43:41.831 --> 00:43:42.664
were sorry,

1041
00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:43.841
but,

1042
00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:44.560
um,

1043
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.960
but still serious damage could have been done and,

1044
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.070
and perhaps was done.

1045
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:53.430
These people left the lab having learned about themselves,

1046
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.840
they'll kill another person if someone tells him to.

1047
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:58.223
<v 1>And</v>

1048
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.970
<v 0>as psychologists,</v>

1049
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.040
I don't think we have any right to do that to people.

1050
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:05.980
I think people can learn new things about themselves.

1051
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.330
We have no right to put you in a circumstance where you believe you killed

1052
00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:15.331
somebody and then tell you it was just pretend we just made you kill somebody.

1053
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:18.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1054
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.130
<v 0>And that's a serious ethical criticism.</v>

1055
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.870
Historians and sociologists have rotten things back to the questions that,

1056
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:25.704
um,

1057
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.800
that Melbourne was interested in and argued.

1058
00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:29.310
Um,

1059
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.570
and this is controversial,

1060
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:35.810
the to which obedience really is a good model for acts of genocide.

1061
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.830
Um,

1062
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.170
so just to take one example among many,

1063
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.153
uh,

1064
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:45.210
goal hog and argued that the participants in,

1065
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:45.540
um,

1066
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.850
in Nazi Germany and in the Holocaust,

1067
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:52.530
we're actually not people who were obediently following orders,

1068
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.480
but rather we're enthusiastic people who volunteered to do it.

1069
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:01.740
Still.

1070
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:06.740
Milgram's work is interesting in many for many reasons in large part because he

1071
00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:12.681
provides an illustration of the perfect situation for getting somebody to do a

1072
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:16.740
terrible thing and a perfect situation has certain ingredients.

1073
00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:17.580
It includes,

1074
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:18.613
um,

1075
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:19.523
authority,

1076
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.211
in this case,

1077
00:45:21.211 --> 00:45:24.270
the authority of Yale and the authority of science.

1078
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.000
This is an experiment that must go on.

1079
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:29.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1080
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.470
<v 0>The notion of a self assured experimenter,</v>

1081
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.970
the results would be very different if the experimenter himself seem nervous,

1082
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.680
unwilling to proceed,

1083
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:38.670
confused.

1084
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:43.020
But he was confident and he kept saying that he will take responsibility.

1085
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:49.090
There was distance between the learner and experimenter recall,

1086
00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.580
you get less of an effect if you have to touch the guy.

1087
00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.790
But distance makes it easier for you to kill him.

1088
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.300
And finally there's a new situation.

1089
00:45:58.301 --> 00:46:00.040
And no model of how to behave.

1090
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.713
Um,

1091
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.910
one of the reasons why the Milgram experiment is so nice to know is that if this

1092
00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:08.080
ever happens to you,

1093
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:09.940
not as an experiment,

1094
00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:11.110
but in real life,

1095
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:12.490
it will no longer be new to you.

1096
00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:17.740
You'll know what sort of thing this is and you'll be able to examine it in that

1097
00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:18.574
light.

1098
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.240
I want to end this lecture,

1099
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:24.070
summing up,

1100
00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.960
drawing a lot upon Milgrom and some other work and talk first about two forces

1101
00:46:28.961 --> 00:46:30.940
for evil and in the end,

1102
00:46:30.941 --> 00:46:32.860
by talking about two forces for good.

1103
00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.570
The first force for evil is d individuation of self.

1104
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.730
And what this means is,

1105
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:41.243
<v 1>MMM,</v>

1106
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:49.040
<v 0>one reason why people are so bad and groups is because you could diffuse your</v>

1107
00:46:49.861 --> 00:46:50.850
responsibility.

1108
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.390
If I'm running through the street alone with a baseball bat,

1109
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.070
smashing through windows,

1110
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.080
it's me and I know it's me.

1111
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.210
If I'm with 20 other people,

1112
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:02.730
it's not me anymore.

1113
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:06.150
It's part of the group and I don't feel as bad.

1114
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.330
Responsibility becomes diffused.

1115
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.330
One of the powers of a group then is it diminishes responsibility.

1116
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.730
You could diminish responsibility in other ways.

1117
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.030
Another way of diminishing responsibility is you could accept orders.

1118
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.620
It's not me.

1119
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:23.370
I'm just an instrument of somebody else telling me what to do.

1120
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.601
And yet,

1121
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:27.870
another way of diminishing responsibility is anonymity.

1122
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.310
Here's a question.

1123
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.620
In so many violent acts in so many people,

1124
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:36.760
gold go to war,

1125
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:41.620
what they do is they paint their faces or they put on masks.

1126
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.173
Why?

1127
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:44.800
Well,

1128
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.570
there's anonymity from others.

1129
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.730
If I'm wearing a mask,

1130
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.440
as I do my terrible stuff,

1131
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.910
nobody will know it's me.

1132
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.320
But there's also a psychological liberating effect.

1133
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.060
If I'm anonymous,

1134
00:47:58.090 --> 00:47:58.930
it's not me.

1135
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.060
And I could do terrible things were feeling the same moral responsibility.

1136
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.990
This analysis has explained why people don't always help others in need.

1137
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.830
If there was a group responsibility to help decreases,

1138
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.400
and this is captured in different ways,

1139
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.100
but the main idea is we all think someone else will help.

1140
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:21.880
Um,

1141
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.840
so we don't,

1142
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:24.310
there's a diffusion.

1143
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.980
This just summarizes some studies,

1144
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:28.600
some famous studies,

1145
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.200
uh,

1146
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.280
supporting this.

1147
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.490
And the classic example,

1148
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:38.491
which is discussed in detail in the textbook is the cat kitty Genovese case

1149
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.930
where somebody was murdered.

1150
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:42.190
Uh,

1151
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:46.990
in the common law that apartment building surrounded while dozens of people

1152
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:50.740
watched dozens of good normal people watched and did nothing.

1153
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.510
Um,

1154
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:55.000
if there's some advice I've heard on this,

1155
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.520
which is pretty good advice,

1156
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.430
if you're ever in a predicament on a city street,

1157
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.230
you know,

1158
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:03.160
you have a heart attack,

1159
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.881
you broke your leg,

1160
00:49:03.881 --> 00:49:05.290
you're being mugged and everything.

1161
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.400
And there's,

1162
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.960
this is based on a research.

1163
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:13.530
Screaming help is often not very successful because if I'm with 10 people and

1164
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:16.420
there's somebody screaming help,

1165
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.980
I look up the other nine people,

1166
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:19.330
they're not doing anything.

1167
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:19.931
They're looking at me,

1168
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:20.890
I'm not doing anything.

1169
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:21.993
We keep walking.

1170
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.920
What is useful is point to somebody and say you in the green sweater,

1171
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.210
call the police.

1172
00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.770
And the psychological evidence is if you,

1173
00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:35.604
if somebody,

1174
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.490
if I'm wearing a green sweater and somebody asked me to call these,

1175
00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:40.330
I will call the police.

1176
00:49:40.331 --> 00:49:41.164
I'm a good guy.

1177
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:42.431
I,

1178
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:42.821
I wouldn't,

1179
00:49:42.821 --> 00:49:44.860
I wouldn't sit aside when somebody is being harmed.

1180
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.813
On the other hand,

1181
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:46.630
if somebody says,

1182
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.310
somebody called the police,

1183
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:48.881
well,

1184
00:49:48.881 --> 00:49:49.750
I got things to do.

1185
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.483
And so,

1186
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:52.480
um,

1187
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:57.480
the fusion of responsibility explains both when we're willing to do terrible

1188
00:49:58.451 --> 00:50:00.850
things and also when we're willing to,

1189
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.310
to help people who are in trouble,

1190
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:05.530
denigration of others.

1191
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.380
There's a lot of ways to make other people matter less.

1192
00:50:08.381 --> 00:50:09.430
So this is the flip side,

1193
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.170
the way to do terrible things.

1194
00:50:11.171 --> 00:50:14.080
One way to do terrible things is to lose yourself as,

1195
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:15.580
so you're not an individual anymore.

1196
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:20.350
But another way to do terrible things is so that the person you're doing it too

1197
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:21.730
isn't an individual.

1198
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.130
How do you do that?

1199
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:24.701
Well,

1200
00:50:24.701 --> 00:50:28.070
you have psychological distance or physical distance.

1201
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.980
I'm more likely to kill you if you're very far away.

1202
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.210
Then if your close,

1203
00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:35.340
I don't,

1204
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.150
I could describe you and start to think about you not as a person.

1205
00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.300
And language can be used for this.

1206
00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:43.650
Instead of people.

1207
00:50:43.651 --> 00:50:46.710
You can use terms like cargo instead of murder,

1208
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.910
extermination.

1209
00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.580
Humor is very powerful in denigrating and demoting people.

1210
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.490
When you start laughing at somebody,

1211
00:50:56.491 --> 00:50:57.960
you think of them as less of a person.

1212
00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.300
And we'll get to that a little bit more.

1213
00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.740
When we talk about laughter,

1214
00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.960
you would take away their names.

1215
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:11.160
One of the more interesting things in the United Nations Declaration of Human

1216
00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.640
Rights is a very interesting,

1217
00:51:12.641 --> 00:51:13.330
right?

1218
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:18.330
It says every person has a right to a name and you might think what a strange

1219
00:51:19.601 --> 00:51:20.434
right?

1220
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.450
But there's a cleverness to it.

1221
00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.030
When you take away some of these name,

1222
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.840
they matter less people have named people have distinct individual names that

1223
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.860
that that mark them as people.

1224
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.740
And once you know somebody's name,

1225
00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:37.930
you're less likely to do bad things to them.

1226
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:43.450
And another option which I'm interested in from the standpoint of my own

1227
00:51:43.451 --> 00:51:45.940
research is you could see them as disgusting.

1228
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.793
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1229
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:53.050
<v 0>Discussed is what Paul Rosin has called the body and soul emotion.</v>

1230
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.910
And we know certain things about discuss.

1231
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:57.860
It is a human universal,

1232
00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.553
<v 1>okay?</v>

1233
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:04.040
<v 0>It is a basic emotion with a characteristic facial expression.</v>

1234
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:08.630
Remember Paul Ackman's work on the basic emotions and universals of emotional

1235
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:09.464
expression,

1236
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:10.723
um,

1237
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.290
discussed is one of them

1238
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:20.290
and it is universally elicited by certain things like this list.

1239
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.850
Wherever you go,

1240
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:24.021
feces,

1241
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:24.501
urine,

1242
00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:25.340
blood vomit,

1243
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:27.560
rotten flesh and most meat will be disgusting.

1244
00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:29.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1245
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.600
<v 0>Now if that was all we had to say about discussed,</v>

1246
00:52:32.601 --> 00:52:35.240
it wouldn't affect morality very much,

1247
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.480
but we know that people can be seen as disgusting.

1248
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:43.720
And Charles Darwin actually who was an astute observer of Human Behavior,

1249
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.040
tells a nice story that illustrates this.

1250
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:48.470
How a native touch with his fingers.

1251
00:52:48.471 --> 00:52:50.870
I'm cold preserve meat and playing the show.

1252
00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:52.960
Disgusted the softness whilst the,

1253
00:52:52.961 --> 00:52:56.300
I felt utter disgust in my food being touched by a naked savage,

1254
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.280
though his hands did not appear nerdy.

1255
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.110
People can be disgusting.

1256
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:01.363
Um,

1257
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.640
and if people are seen as disgusting,

1258
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.990
they matter less.

1259
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.170
The philosopher and legal scholar,

1260
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:11.990
Martha Nussbaum nicely summarizes this.

1261
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.430
Thus throughout history,

1262
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:16.230
certain discuss properties have repeatedly in Manassas,

1263
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.390
Lehman associated with Jews,

1264
00:53:17.391 --> 00:53:17.721
women,

1265
00:53:17.721 --> 00:53:18.554
homosexuals,

1266
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:19.461
untouchables,

1267
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:20.420
lower class people.

1268
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.500
All of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body.

1269
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:26.190
Um,

1270
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.640
any,

1271
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.451
I won't read this,

1272
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:28.150
but this is a,

1273
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.983
uh,

1274
00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.250
a typical bit of Nazi propaganda.

1275
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:36.180
Any genocidal movement that has left behind a written record,

1276
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:37.440
um,

1277
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:42.440
has been shown to use the mechanism of disgust to dehumanize people and make

1278
00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:45.570
them easier to kill.

1279
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:47.903
Skip that.

1280
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.410
Um,

1281
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:54.410
I want to end though on a positive note and a positive note,

1282
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:59.870
our forces for good so forces for bad or are to lose yourself as an individual.

1283
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:03.690
Lose yourself in a crowd,

1284
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.310
lose yourself because there's some authority using you as an instrument.

1285
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:09.990
Lose yourself cause you're anonymous.

1286
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.450
Plus treat others not as people as numbers,

1287
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:16.320
as objects,

1288
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:17.700
as disgusting things,

1289
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.430
but there are some forces for good.

1290
00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:22.683
Um,

1291
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.400
these include contact and interdependence with this often is what is,

1292
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.490
can be viewed as,

1293
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.170
as an extended version of selfish gene theory,

1294
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:38.520
which is that to the extent you are interconnected with other people,

1295
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:42.570
you care about the more for purely selfish reasons.

1296
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:43.440
Um,

1297
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.070
Robert Wright presented us in a very blunt way,

1298
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.290
but I think his quote is quite moving.

1299
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.340
One of the many reasons I don't want to bomb the Japanese is that they built my

1300
00:54:53.341 --> 00:54:54.174
minivan.

1301
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:57.840
And the idea is he has economic co-dependencies people.

1302
00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.400
There are different group,

1303
00:54:59.401 --> 00:55:01.770
he might want to kill them under normal circumstances.

1304
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.420
But the inner dependence,

1305
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:07.350
it gives rise to a moral connection.

1306
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:09.150
Um,

1307
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:13.710
Thomas Friedman proposed the Golden Arches theory of human conflict,

1308
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.120
which said that no two countries which each have a Mcdonald's will ever go to

1309
00:55:18.121 --> 00:55:22.260
war because Mcdonald's forces global interdependence.

1310
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:23.910
This was falsified,

1311
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:24.750
uh,

1312
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.450
in the NATO bombing of I think Siri Evo,

1313
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:30.540
but still his heart's in the right place.

1314
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:35.541
The idea is that India connection makes you more likely to get along with other

1315
00:55:35.911 --> 00:55:36.744
people

1316
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.060
more generally.

1317
00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:42.090
There's what's been called the contact hypothesis.

1318
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.490
So interdependence is one thing,

1319
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:50.240
but what's maybe more interesting is that simple contact with other people,

1320
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.760
particularly if are of equal status.

1321
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:59.030
You have a common goal and you have social support makes you like people more.

1322
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:01.770
There are now dozens,

1323
00:56:01.771 --> 00:56:05.760
probably hundreds of studies that show that people who would otherwise show

1324
00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:10.740
animosity towards one another like blacks and whites in the United States like

1325
00:56:10.741 --> 00:56:11.940
each other more.

1326
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:17.240
If they're brought together and there's a lot of social psychology research as

1327
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:19.860
to the conditions in which you have to bring them together.

1328
00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:20.820
Um,

1329
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.100
the robber's cave study talked about,

1330
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:24.490
it's a nice example.

1331
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.670
It was not easy to bring them together,

1332
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.220
but when they had a common goal that brought them,

1333
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:35.860
that that caused the interconnection and then the contact led to moral feeling.

1334
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:39.670
The military is a superb example.

1335
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.250
The military United States was a situation which brought together people who

1336
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:48.700
wouldn't otherwise have any contact and they liked each other.

1337
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.380
There's been study after study showing that people in the military or otherwise,

1338
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:53.741
for instance,

1339
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:58.240
racist after working with people of different races,

1340
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:03.330
like the more because you had all of the right ingredients you had to have,

1341
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:06.010
they worked together for a common goal.

1342
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.130
The military supported bringing these people together.

1343
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:09.700
Um,

1344
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.340
and they were brought together on an equal and fair footing.

1345
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:18.340
There was of course a lot of debate about universities like Yale to the extent

1346
00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:20.860
which they promote interdependence and starting to update,

1347
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:23.770
promote a positive contact between groups.

1348
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:28.720
And you could think of yourself as an exercise if these are the conditions for,

1349
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:29.583
for um,

1350
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:31.120
for contact.

1351
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:36.300
To what extent are they met in a university setting between say blacks and

1352
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:37.834
whites,

1353
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:38.440
uh,

1354
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.830
people from the American south versus people from American north,

1355
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:44.470
people from other countries versus people from the United States.

1356
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.000
And I know there's debate on campus about the extent to which your segregation

1357
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:52.180
within the Yale community and you could ask yourself to extended,

1358
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.860
extended that segregation and how that reflects what role it should play with

1359
00:57:56.861 --> 00:57:58.660
regard to the contact hypothesis.

1360
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.041
Finally,

1361
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:01.630
and this is the last thing I'll say,

1362
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.660
if you take another's person perspective,

1363
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:05.590
you'll care more about them.

1364
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:10.930
This is the final force for good from a moral perspective.

1365
00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:12.280
Um,

1366
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:17.280
JFK when making the plea for equal rights didn't produce an abstract

1367
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.780
philosophical argument,

1368
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:25.110
but rather are tried to invite his listeners who were white to engage in

1369
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:29.750
perspective taking if an American,

1370
00:58:29.751 --> 00:58:30.700
because the skin is dark,

1371
00:58:30.701 --> 00:58:31.810
can not eat lunch in a restaurant,

1372
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:34.150
open to the public and so and so and so.

1373
00:58:34.151 --> 00:58:38.170
And then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin change in

1374
00:58:38.171 --> 00:58:39.010
stand in his place.

1375
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.150
Who among us would be content with the councils of patients and and delay.

1376
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:43.550
Again,

1377
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:48.550
Nussbaum goes on and talks about how in Greek dramas,

1378
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:54.310
Greek dramas invited people to take the perspectives of those who they would

1379
00:58:54.311 --> 00:58:59.311
never imaginably B or even be in contact with and argue that this gave led to an

1380
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:03.190
empathetic expansion.

1381
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:08.470
I think one of the greatest circles for moral good is storytelling where you're

1382
00:59:08.471 --> 00:59:12.640
invited to take the perspective of another and see the world as they do.

1383
00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:14.493
Finally

1384
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.000
do our direct ways you can ask people,

1385
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.070
and this is the way which we talk to our children when we try to get our

1386
00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:25.820
children to expand their moral concern of compassion.

1387
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:27.890
We say try to see it from their point of view.

1388
00:59:27.891 --> 00:59:31.340
How would you feel if vendor is indirect ways?

1389
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.291
You can,

1390
00:59:33.291 --> 00:59:34.220
for instance,

1391
00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.660
use the power of metaphor.

1392
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.240
There could be familiar things,

1393
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.050
um,

1394
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:46.070
that you are close to and you could bring in together new things as falling

1395
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:47.960
under the rubric of these familiar things.

1396
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:48.710
Uh,

1397
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:51.890
so if I want it to cause you to feel more concerned for a fetus,

1398
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.100
I would do well to describe it as a preborn child.

1399
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.520
If I wanted you to care about an animal,

1400
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.760
I would do well to describe it as if it were human.

1401
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.713
Um,

1402
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:09.010
if I wanted to think about all of you and get you and establish more of a

1403
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:10.400
connection with you,

1404
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.110
I would not describe you as,

1405
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:12.830
you know,

1406
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:17.830
unrelated strangers rather you are my brothers and my sisters and of course any

1407
01:00:20.001 --> 01:00:22.900
political movement and tries to bring together people together,

1408
01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.280
says uses a family metaphor.

1409
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:26.150
Um,

1410
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.983
finally,

1411
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:28.430
uh,

1412
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:31.880
when Steven Spielberg tried to get us to,

1413
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:32.660
um,

1414
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:37.660
to entertain the notion that computers and robots are sentient moral beings,

1415
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.170
he did not show us one that looked like this.

1416
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.600
He showed us one that looked like that.

1417
01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.273
Okay.

1418
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.350
The reading response for next week is a simple one.

1419
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.840
I know I've been giving difficult reading responses.

1420
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:53.860
This is simple.

1421
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.280
You could write it up very short and that will be a passing grade.

1422
01:00:57.281 --> 01:00:58.660
If you just read up very short,

1423
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.450
you could also write it up a bit longer.

1424
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:05.920
Suppose the Milgrim express had never been done and it was being done for the

1425
01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:07.480
first time here.

1426
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:10.223
What would you do?

1427
01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.510
What do you think everyone else would do?

1428
01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:14.880
Okay,

1429
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.660
I'll see you next week.
