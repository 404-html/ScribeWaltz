1
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.180
What we've been talking about so far in the course are human universals,

2
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.040
what everybody shares.

3
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.380
So we've been talking about language,

4
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.700
about rationality,

5
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.080
about perception,

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.700
about the emotions,

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.760
about universals of development.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.920
And we've been talking about what people share.

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.280
But honestly what a lot of us are very interested in is why we're different.

10
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.090
Um,

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.380
and the nature of these differences and the explanation for them.

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.180
And that's what will turn to today.

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.570
So first we'll discuss how are people different,

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.620
different theories about what makes you different in a psychological way from

15
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.130
the person sitting next to you.

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.570
And then we'll review different theories about why people are different.

17
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.551
And,

18
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:03.240
um,

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.360
this is the class which is going to bother the most people.

20
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.340
It's not dualism,

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.290
it's not evolution.

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.800
It's this because the scientific findings on human psychological differences are

23
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.591
too many of us.

24
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.210
Shocking and unbelievable.

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.433
Um,

26
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.190
and I will just try to persuade you to take them seriously.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.301
Okay.

28
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.310
So how are people different?

29
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.971
Well,

30
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:28.170
there's all sorts of ways.

31
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.220
Um,

32
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.510
your sexual identity,

33
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.090
it is at the core of your being for almost all of us,

34
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.100
whether you're male or female,

35
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.410
how we refer to you in language,

36
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.130
what Pronoun we use indexed on how we are on your,

37
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.090
on how,

38
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.710
whether you're male or female.

39
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.490
Um,

40
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.110
and related to that though in perfectly your sexual orientation who you're

41
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:52.944
attracted to,

42
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.970
the question of why some of us think of ourselves as males and others as

43
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:57.750
females.

44
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.710
And the question of why some of us would ideally want to have sex with males,

45
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:02.790
others were females,

46
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:03.870
others were both.

47
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.080
And in a few others who have harder to define desires is such a good question

48
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.020
that we're going to talk about it after spring break.

49
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.423
Um,

50
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.800
while all the sexual desire has been spent and you could focus on a scientific

51
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:21.450
discussion of this,

52
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.030
not that I recommend you do that on spring break.

53
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.193
Um,

54
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.310
how happy are you?

55
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.780
This is also such a good topic is going to get his own class.

56
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.390
I,

57
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.980
the very last class of the semester is devoted to happiness.

58
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.280
And the question of what makes people happy,

59
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.480
um,

60
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.830
what makes people unhappy?

61
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.320
And what makes people differ in their happiness.

62
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.740
If I asked you to rank how happy you are from a scale of one to 10,

63
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.980
the numbers would differ across this room.

64
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.020
And there's different theories as to why,

65
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.243
um,

66
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.410
your success and failure in life.

67
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.230
This is somewhat interesting because you can study this in more or less

68
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:00.220
objective ways.

69
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.330
We don't have to ask people.

70
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.310
We can look at your relationships,

71
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.211
how they begin,

72
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.790
how they end your job satisfaction.

73
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.890
We can look at your criminal records.

74
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.900
Some of you are going to see time,

75
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.910
most will not.

76
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.080
Um,

77
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.690
some of you will get into a little troubles all through your life.

78
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:21.430
Some of you already have seen the inside of a police station possibly align up.

79
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.210
Others couldn't go near such a thing.

80
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.321
What,

81
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.820
what determines that?

82
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.510
And at the root of all,

83
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.620
human differences

84
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.620
are two main factors.

85
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.560
And so I want to talk about the two main interesting factors.

86
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.520
Um,

87
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.750
one is personality,

88
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.760
the other's intelligence.

89
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.163
And this is what,

90
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.180
these are the differences I'll talk about today.

91
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.050
First from the standpoint of how do we characterize them,

92
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.250
how do we explain them?

93
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.470
And then from the standpoint of why these differences exist in the first place.

94
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.623
I'm

95
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
one way to characterize personality is in terms of people style,

96
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.810
with dealing with,

97
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.880
in dealing with the world and particularly their style with dealing in dealing

98
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:13.780
with other people.

99
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.490
So you take a simple character,

100
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:16.240
you know of,

101
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.840
um,

102
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.600
and you could talk about that person's personality,

103
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:22.060
but talk about in terms of being impulsive,

104
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.530
irresponsible,

105
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.270
sometimes lazy,

106
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.253
goodhearted,

107
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.333
um,

108
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.390
you could compare that person's personality with other people's personality,

109
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.840
such as my colleague who gave a talk last class.

110
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.003
He's wonderful.

111
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.980
He's responsible and reliable and very kind,

112
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.203
um,

113
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.800
and and different from homer.

114
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.030
And so there's differences,

115
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:45.040
a difference in personality.

116
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.710
Now when we talk about personality,

117
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:50.080
we're talking about something else as well.

118
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.070
We're talking about a stable trait across situations in time.

119
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.750
So if all of a sudden the person next to you kind of smacks you in the head,

120
00:04:58.751 --> 00:04:59.650
you might be angry,

121
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.330
but we wouldn't call that personality because that's something that,

122
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:05.740
that's the result of a situation.

123
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.450
We'd all feel that way in that situation.

124
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.610
It's personality.

125
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:11.860
If you walk around all the time angry,

126
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.070
there'd be a stable trait to be sending you carry around with you.

127
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.480
Um,

128
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.610
and that's what we mean by personality.

129
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.893
Now,

130
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.950
how do we scientifically characterized differences in personality?

131
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.690
And it's a deep question,

132
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.250
has been a lot of attempts to do so.

133
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.210
Um,

134
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.210
any assessment has any good assessment has to satisfy two conditions and these

135
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.830
are terms which are going to show up all over psychological research,

136
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.040
but it's particularly relevant for this sort of measure.

137
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.590
One is reliability.

138
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.460
Reliability means there is not measurement error.

139
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.320
And one crude way to think about reliability is a test is reliable.

140
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.830
If test the same person at different times and you get the same results.

141
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.000
My bathroom scale is reliable.

142
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.350
If whenever I stand on it,

143
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.150
it gives me more or less the same number.

144
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.980
It's not reliable if it's off by 10 pounds in the course of a day.

145
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.360
Um,

146
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.260
similarly,

147
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.580
if I give you a personality tests now and it says that you're anxious and

148
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:24.100
defensive while and then give it to you tomorrow and it says you're calm and

149
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:24.934
open minded,

150
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.110
it's not a reliable test.

151
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.720
So reliable is something you could trust over time.

152
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.060
Validity is something different.

153
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.890
Validity is,

154
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:34.724
um,

155
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.780
is that your test measures what it's supposed to measure.

156
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.990
So validity means it's sort of a good test.

157
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:43.700
Forget about how reliable it is,

158
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.860
does it tap what you're interested in?

159
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.911
So for example,

160
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.960
suppose I determine your intelligence by the date of your birth.

161
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.720
I figured out what day you were born.

162
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.110
And I have a theory that from that predicts how smart you are.

163
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.790
That's my own intelligence test.

164
00:06:58.791 --> 00:06:59.720
The date of your birth,

165
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.501
maybe,

166
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:00.860
um,

167
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.860
people born in January or the dumbest people born in December or the smartest is

168
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:09.440
that I was born on Christmas Eve.

169
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.190
Um,

170
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.023
is that,

171
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.860
is that a reliable test?

172
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.850
Yes.

173
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.440
It's a wonderfully reliable test.

174
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:16.161
I'll test you today.

175
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:17.090
I'll text you tomorrow.

176
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.260
I'll test your next year.

177
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:19.520
I'll text you the day you die.

178
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.200
I'll get the same Iq score.

179
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.180
Is it a valid test?

180
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.110
It's a joke.

181
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.730
It's absolutely not a valid test.

182
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:27.500
It has nothing to do with intelligence.

183
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.170
But you notice these are two different things.

184
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.840
Somebody can be reliable but not valid.

185
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.890
Um,

186
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.180
and something can be valid.

187
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.500
And not reliable.

188
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.820
Now there are no shortage of personality tests.

189
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.740
You could get them all over the place,

190
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.793
um,

191
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.450
including on the web.

192
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.830
So I took one recently,

193
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.910
I've took,

194
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.743
I took a,

195
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.340
which superhero are you?

196
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.890
And it's a series of questions.

197
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.590
I determining what superhero are you are,

198
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.900
you could take this yourself if you want to.

199
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.153
Um,

200
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.630
the same web page by the way offers you a test and whether you're hot or not,

201
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.130
and we'll discuss that later.

202
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.330
And when I did this,

203
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.580
it told me I was Batman.

204
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.173
Um,

205
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.810
and you are dark love gadgets.

206
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:17.930
And I vowed to help innocent not suffer the pain you have endured.

207
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.210
Now the honest now,

208
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.440
to be honest though,

209
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.990
it's neither reliable nor valid.

210
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.310
When I first did the test,

211
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.050
I came up as the incredible hulk.

212
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.040
Um,

213
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.870
I then change my answers a bit and was wonder woman.

214
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.173
And finally,

215
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.340
finally at a frustration,

216
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.370
I carefully tailored my answers so I will be Batman.

217
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.960
But the fact that I can do that well raises questions about,

218
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.380
um,

219
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.310
about both the reliability of this measure and it's validity.

220
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.240
Um,

221
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.051
here's an example,

222
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:49.160
a real world example.

223
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.790
This is in black and white form a version of the roar shock test,

224
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.580
the Rorschach inkblot test.

225
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.940
How many people have heard of the Rorschach test?

226
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.290
Okay.

227
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.980
Is there anybody here who is actually in any sort of situation taken a Rorschach

228
00:09:05.981 --> 00:09:06.814
test?

229
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.660
Some people scattered room have taken them.

230
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.590
Um,

231
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.950
it was originally used only for a psychiatric cases,

232
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:15.750
but then became extremely common.

233
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.873
Um,

234
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.090
about 80% of clinical psychologists claim to use it.

235
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.340
And most graduate programs,

236
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.710
I'm in American Psychological Association,

237
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.520
uh,

238
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.720
who are accredited.

239
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.960
I teach it a Catholic seminaries and use it for people who want to join the

240
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:34.404
seminary.

241
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.473
Um,

242
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.950
it was invented by a guy named Herman,

243
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:38.880
a roar shock.

244
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.810
Um,

245
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.470
he devoted his entire life to the inkblot test,

246
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.720
his nickname when he was a teenager.

247
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.510
I am not kidding you was inkblot.

248
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.343
Um,

249
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.700
and the idea is by looking at these inkblots and then seeing what somebody says,

250
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.280
you get great insights into the nature of their personality,

251
00:09:59.520 --> 00:09:59.981
into,

252
00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:00.390
um,

253
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.230
what they are.

254
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.090
Anybody want to cry?

255
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.433
<v 1>Come on.</v>

256
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:08.750
<v 0>Yes.</v>

257
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.620
What do you see

258
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.040
<v 1>that's together?</v>

259
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.200
<v 0>Two people holding hands pressed together.</v>

260
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.070
Very good.

261
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.600
Anybody have a different reading?

262
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.040
Yes and back?

263
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.873
Yes.

264
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.973
<v 1>Yes.</v>

265
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.370
<v 0>Dancing bears.</v>

266
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.290
Okay,

267
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.123
good.

268
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.433
Good.

269
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.330
Okay.

270
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.340
I got to write her name down.

271
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.470
Report you to help certain no.

272
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:34.130
Death dancing.

273
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.230
They're dancing bears.

274
00:10:35.231 --> 00:10:35.770
Very good.

275
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:36.401
Anybody else?

276
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:37.030
One other,

277
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.290
yes man.

278
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.960
A man and a ski mask.

279
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.190
Well,

280
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.570
it turns out that there are right answers and wrong answers to the Rorschach

281
00:10:46.571 --> 00:10:47.404
test.

282
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.513
Um,

283
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.910
according to the test,

284
00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:53.740
and this is from a real Rorschach test.

285
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.920
It is important to see the blog as to human figures.

286
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.900
Usually females are clowns.

287
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.190
Good work over there.

288
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.511
If you don't,

289
00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:02.410
it's seen as a sign.

290
00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:04.060
Do you have problems relating to people?

291
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.563
Um,

292
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.380
if you want to go for a caveman,

293
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.580
France or butterfly or vagina,

294
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.720
that's also okay.

295
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.853
Um,

296
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.563
now

297
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.360
the Rorschach test is transcendently useless.

298
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.400
It has been.

299
00:11:21.401 --> 00:11:25.450
It has been studied and explored and it is as useless as,

300
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.640
as throwing dice.

301
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.570
It is as useless as tea leaves.

302
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.460
Um,

303
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.570
nonetheless,

304
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.450
people love it and it's used all over the place.

305
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.110
Um,

306
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.861
it is used,

307
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:36.581
for example,

308
00:11:36.581 --> 00:11:38.020
in child custody cases.

309
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:38.951
If,

310
00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:39.340
um,

311
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.850
if you have broken up with your partner and you guys are quarreling over who

312
00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:43.930
gets to keep the kids,

313
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.591
uh,

314
00:11:44.591 --> 00:11:47.770
you might find yourself in a shrink's office looking at this.

315
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.731
And in fact,

316
00:11:48.731 --> 00:11:50.920
this is why they end up on the web.

317
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.240
There are services,

318
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.690
there are people have been kind enough to put on the web these inkblots

319
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.540
including the right answers to them,

320
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.870
but they are worthless as psychological measures.

321
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.850
Can we do better?

322
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.570
Well,

323
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.710
we probably can.

324
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.760
Um,

325
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.760
Gordon Owl court did a study where he went through the dictionary and took all

326
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:16.420
of the traits that he believed to be related to personality.

327
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.200
Um,

328
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.030
and he got 18,000 of them.

329
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.910
But what was interesting was they weren't necessarily independent traits.

330
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.190
So the traits like friendly,

331
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.630
socio bubble,

332
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.973
welcoming,

333
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.850
warm hearted seem to all tap the same thing.

334
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.140
So Catell and many others try to narrow it down,

335
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.440
try to ask the question in how many ways are peoples personalities different

336
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:44.764
from one another?

337
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.130
How many parameters of difference do you need?

338
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:48.790
How,

339
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.790
how many numbers can I give you that was narrow you in and say what personality

340
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:55.710
you are?

341
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.320
Um,

342
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.410
one approach was from um,

343
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.150
icing who claimed they were just too,

344
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.750
you going to be somewhere on a scale of introverted,

345
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:09.520
extroverted and somewhere on a scale of neurotic and stable.

346
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.110
And since there's basically two types of traits with two settings reach,

347
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.970
there are basically four types of people.

348
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.180
Later on he added another trait trait a which he described as psychotic CISM

349
00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:22.630
versus non psychotic autism.

350
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.330
But crudely meant whether you're aggressive,

351
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:26.170
are empathetic,

352
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.780
and then you have three traits with two settings,

353
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:30.970
each giving you a types of people.

354
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.703
Um,

355
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.040
later on Cattell dropped it down into 16 factors.

356
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.020
So these 16 personality factors are 16 ways people would differ.

357
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.830
And so if I ask you to describe your roommate along these 16 dimensions,

358
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.150
you should be able to do so.

359
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.950
More recently people have come to the conclusion that two or three is too few,

360
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.630
but 16 might be too many.

361
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.480
And there's a psychological consensus,

362
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.500
um,

363
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.350
on what's been known as the big five.

364
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.300
And the big five personality factors,

365
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.530
um,

366
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.363
are these,

367
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.760
and what this means is when we talk about each other

368
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.850
and use adjectives,

369
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.630
the claim is we could do so in thousands of different ways,

370
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:29.110
but deep down we're talking about one of these five dimensions.

371
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.270
This means that when a psychological test measure something about somebody,

372
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.100
about our personality,

373
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.120
if it's a good test,

374
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:39.190
is measuring one of these five things.

375
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.240
And it means that as people interacting with one another and the world,

376
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.030
these are the five things that we're interested in.

377
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:46.990
Um,

378
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.290
so one of them is neurotic versus stable.

379
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:51.483
Um,

380
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.980
is somebody sort of nutty and a and worrying or are they calm?

381
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.680
Extrovert versus introvert?

382
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:01.940
Um,

383
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.480
open to experience versus close to experience.

384
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.310
Agreeable,

385
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.510
which is a courteous,

386
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:10.760
friendly versus non agreeable,

387
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.271
rude,

388
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:15.890
selfish and conscientious versus not conscientious,

389
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.450
careful versus careless,

390
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.310
reliable versus undependable.

391
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.533
Uh,

392
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.720
a good way to think about these things is in terms of of the word ocean,

393
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:26.881
O,

394
00:15:26.881 --> 00:15:27.310
c,

395
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:27.621
e,

396
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:27.921
a,

397
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:28.754
n,

398
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.330
uh,

399
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.640
the first letter captures openness,

400
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:32.840
conscientiousness,

401
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.130
extroversion,

402
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.230
agreeableness and neuroticism.

403
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.220
And the claim is those are a four to five fundamental ways in which people

404
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.000
differ from one another.

405
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.201
Well,

406
00:15:45.201 --> 00:15:46.370
why should we believe this?

407
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:48.650
Why should we take this theory seriously?

408
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.761
Well,

409
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:51.620
there's actually some evidence for it.

410
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.820
Um,

411
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.820
it seems to have some reliability in that it's stable

412
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.480
over time.

413
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.010
So if you test people over years,

414
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.190
if I test your personality now on a five traits and test you five years from

415
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:10.730
now,

416
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.290
it will not have changed much.

417
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.840
And once you passed the age of 30,

418
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.790
it's very stable indeed.

419
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.380
If you think about your parents and then give mum and dad a mental test and

420
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:25.490
where they stand on each of the five traits,

421
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.570
10 years from now,

422
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:27.950
mum and dad will still be there.

423
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.283
Um,

424
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.290
it also seems to get agreement across multiple observers.

425
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.810
So if I ask for each of the five traits,

426
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.260
if I asked your roommate what he or she thinks of you,

427
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.360
did they ask you're a professor,

428
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:46.580
what he or she thinks of you and your mom,

429
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.390
what he or she thinks of you Howard,

430
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.500
back to gender,

431
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.251
how would,

432
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:53.084
um,

433
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.500
they match up.

434
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.290
They tend to overlap a lot.

435
00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.880
You walk around and you leave and you,

436
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.080
your personality leaves a trail in the minds of people around you.

437
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.100
And his trail is characterized in terms of these five dimensions.

438
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.573
Um,

439
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.650
finally it seems to be predict real world behavior.

440
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.940
It just didn't have anything to do,

441
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:14.960
have to real world.

442
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.620
You wouldn't be very happy calling it a valid,

443
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.240
you wouldn't take it seriously as a desk,

444
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.200
but it does.

445
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.240
So it's so conscientious.

446
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:24.810
And how you score in a conscientious and scale,

447
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:25.640
um,

448
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.890
relates to how faithful you are to your spouse.

449
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.270
Uh,

450
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.480
how openness open you are,

451
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:31.881
are,

452
00:17:31.881 --> 00:17:33.560
are a psychological personality.

453
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:36.530
Tests relates to how likely you are to change your job.

454
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.623
Um,

455
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.260
extroverts look people in the eye more and have more sexual partners cause

456
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.130
they're extroverts.

457
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.050
So these are real scales.

458
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.530
Um,

459
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.310
the Batman Hawk wonder woman doesn't correspond to anything in the real world,

460
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.240
but where are you stand in each of these five dimensions does seem to capture

461
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.010
it.

462
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.650
Um,

463
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.050
as an example of the agreement,

464
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:58.884
by the way,

465
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.170
uh,

466
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:04.170
somebody did a study of several of the characters on the television show.

467
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.280
The Simpsons because they want it to find characters,

468
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.330
which everybody knew.

469
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.690
And they had 13 subjects judge,

470
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.501
uh,

471
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:16.890
the symptom characters on each of the five dimensions.

472
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:17.810
Um,

473
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.660
this is an openness,

474
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:19.560
neuroticism,

475
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.870
conscientiousness and extraversion.

476
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.093
Um,

477
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.480
and he,

478
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.360
they found considerable agreement.

479
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.380
And this isn't actually what I've covered up is to agreeableness.

480
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.530
So for those of you who've never seen a television show,

481
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.200
this is all going to be confusing,

482
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.180
but those of you who have,

483
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.470
can you guess which characters would be particularly agreeable?

484
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.631
Anybody?

485
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:46.464
Yes.

486
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.693
Yeah.

487
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.990
Flanders.

488
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.010
Um,

489
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:50.850
you are right.

490
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:56.150
The most agreeable people are Flanders and march who would be not so agreeable.

491
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.340
Cresty is actually Cressey.

492
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.810
Is it complicated case?

493
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.873
Um,

494
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.730
but,

495
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.900
but Mr. Burns,

496
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.040
but also

497
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.733
where is he?

498
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.091
Oh,

499
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:14.280
he's not was Nelson.

500
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.143
Where's Nelson?

501
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.770
Anyway,

502
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.603
there's Nelson.

503
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.473
Um,

504
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.480
you get strong consensus that Ned,

505
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:25.740
Ned Flanders and Marge Simpson are highly agreeable people.

506
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.890
Six Point two seven and 5.46.

507
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.371
Well,

508
00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:31.290
Mr. Burns and Nelson are very low.

509
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.510
Nelson's the little kid that when trouble happens,

510
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:33.870
he goes,

511
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.703
ha ha.

512
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:35.670
And that's,

513
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.070
that's a psychological sign for low agreeability.

514
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.593
Okay.

515
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.170
That's all I want to say at this point about personality and how we measure it.

516
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.951
And again,

517
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.590
we're going to get back to it later when we talk about differences in

518
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:47.424
personality.

519
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.970
Now I want to deal with the second big difference.

520
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.400
The second big difference is intelligence.

521
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.330
Now how do you define intelligence?

522
00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:58.680
There is no easy definition,

523
00:19:58.681 --> 00:19:59.640
light personality.

524
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.180
It's kind of difficult to get your fingers on what we're talking about here.

525
00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:03.661
Uh,

526
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:08.220
in one survey they asked a thousand experts to define intelligence and some

527
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:09.990
answers showed up over and over again.

528
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.730
So just about everybody said intelligence involves abstract reasoning,

529
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:15.660
problem solving,

530
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.520
and the capacity to acquire knowledge.

531
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.490
That's at the core of being smart.

532
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.820
Other people mentioned things like memory,

533
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.840
mental speed,

534
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:25.471
language,

535
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:26.304
math,

536
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.151
mental speed.

537
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:27.780
Again,

538
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.550
knowledge and creativity.

539
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.760
Also as hallmarks for intelligence.

540
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.073
And again,

541
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.840
it might be difficult to define it,

542
00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:39.300
but you have a gut feeling about what it is.

543
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:39.990
So,

544
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.291
you know,

545
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:41.340
homer is,

546
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:41.881
is actually,

547
00:20:41.881 --> 00:20:43.260
and this is part of the show,

548
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:45.030
is actually of limited intelligence.

549
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.043
Um,

550
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.300
my colleague is a very high intelligence,

551
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.710
wonderful fellow.

552
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.813
Um,

553
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:52.660
but,

554
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.810
but he's probably not as smart as that guy who's like really,

555
00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:56.920
really smart.

556
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.130
And this Guy Ralph Whigham,

557
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.450
it's particularly stupid.

558
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.360
And so you have a range and,

559
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:03.630
and,

560
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.130
and it's important to figure out how to characterize it.

561
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:07.090
This is what research does,

562
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.620
but there's a gut feeling that there's some people who are smart and other

563
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:15.400
people who are very smart and some people who are dumb and others who are very

564
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:16.030
dumb.

565
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.721
What you want to do,

566
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:21.721
I do from a scientific standpoint is characterize this in a more robust and

567
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:23.320
interesting fashion.

568
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.600
And The textbook has a nice review of the history of attempts to define and

569
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:29.740
measure intelligence.

570
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.680
But there's just a couple of ideas I want to focus on.

571
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.890
One is an idea developed by,

572
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.120
by a Spearman,

573
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.141
which is,

574
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:40.060
there's two types of intelligence.

575
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.040
Um,

576
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.040
there is g and there's s s is your ability on specific tests.

577
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.650
So if there's 10 tests that you're given as part of an Iq,

578
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.030
an Iq test,

579
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.480
10 sub tests,

580
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.340
you'll get a different score in each of the sub tests will be a math test and a

581
00:22:00.341 --> 00:22:01.270
reading test.

582
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.850
And a spatial test and you'll get different scores.

583
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:10.350
G refers to a general intelligence and the general intelligence is something you

584
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:15.490
bring to each of the tests in common.

585
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.780
So this is diagrammed here you have these six tests.

586
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.490
For each of them there is an ass and then above that there is a g.

587
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:25.901
Now,

588
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:27.640
GE is a very important notion.

589
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:31.870
The term g is used by psychologists a lot even in casual conversation,

590
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:32.530
you know,

591
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:33.130
people say,

592
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.180
so what do you think of him?

593
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.050
And he has high g and what you mean is he's a smart guy.

594
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.280
Why do you need g where you wouldn't need,

595
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:42.790
Gee,

596
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.240
if your performance on each of these tests had nothing to do with each other.

597
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.820
If the test were genuinely separate,

598
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.790
there'd be no general intelligence.

599
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:56.470
But what people find over and over again is that when it comes to explaining

600
00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:59.290
people's performance on multiple intellectual tasks,

601
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.790
there's two things going on.

602
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.530
There's how good their is.

603
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.600
They are on a specific task.

604
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.670
But then there's also a sort of general correlation that people bring to the

605
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:10.480
tasks.

606
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.120
And I could express this with an athletic analogy.

607
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:18.510
Imagine I'm running a gym and we have all of these different athletic tests.

608
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.130
So we have a running test,

609
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.590
we have a basketball shooting test,

610
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.270
a swimming test,

611
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.490
fencing list of 10 of them.

612
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:32.800
Now each of you go through each of the tests and then you'll each get 10 scores.

613
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.670
But what we'll discover is that the scores are not independent of one another.

614
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.350
People who are good at one athletic thing tend to be good at another.

615
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.440
Um,

616
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.140
if there's somebody who's really good at running and swimming,

617
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.750
odds are they're probably pretty good at climbing.

618
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.190
Um,

619
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.080
and the same thing holds for Iq,

620
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.680
which is above and beyond how good people are at specific things.

621
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.370
There seems to be a factor as to how well they are in general.

622
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.980
And this factor is known as g.

623
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.523
Now

624
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:08.330
there's a,

625
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.751
again,

626
00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:11.660
an extensive history of modern intelligence tests.

627
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.530
Uh,

628
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.800
and what's really interesting is the tests now where you need to know,

629
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:17.150
but the modern test,

630
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.740
the Wechsler test for both adults and children is how they're scored.

631
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.000
The way they are scored is that a hundred is average.

632
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.570
So it's just automatic.

633
00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:36.800
Whatever to averages is a hundred is as if I did the midterm graded the midterm

634
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:40.490
computer to average gave everybody who got to average a hundred said your

635
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:41.324
score's a hundred.

636
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.010
It's just the average.

637
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.460
It works on a normal curve.

638
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.850
And what this means is that it works so that the majority 68% get between 85 and

639
00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:59.000
115 under Iq tests.

640
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.880
The vast majority,

641
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:06.050
95% get between 70 and 130.

642
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.703
Uh,

643
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
if you are say above 145 Iq,

644
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.820
which I imagine some people in the room are,

645
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.670
you belong to a 0.13% of the population.

646
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.620
That's the way Iq tests work.

647
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.650
Now this is about Iq tests.

648
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.670
We can now ask about their reliability and their validity.

649
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:29.750
What did they mean?

650
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.550
Well this is turned out to be a matter of extreme debate.

651
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:37.160
This just reiterates what I just said.

652
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:38.180
Um,

653
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:43.180
a lot of the debate was spawned by the book by Hurnsteen and Marie about called

654
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:49.001
the bell curve and in a bell curve these authors made the argument that Iq

655
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:54.070
matters immensely for everyday life and that people's status in society,

656
00:25:56.301 --> 00:26:00.950
like how rich they are and how successful they are follows from their Iq as

657
00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:02.660
measured in standard Iq tests.

658
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.740
Now this book made a lot of claims and,

659
00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:08.090
and it's probably before many of you,

660
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.140
many of your time,

661
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.010
um,

662
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.110
but spawn huge controversy.

663
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.720
And as a result of this controversy,

664
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.730
some interesting papers came out.

665
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:22.930
One response to the Hurnsteen and Murray book was by the American Psychological

666
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.480
Association,

667
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.190
which put together a group of 50 leading researchers and intelligence to write a

668
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:30.950
report on what they thought about intelligence,

669
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.180
what they thought about,

670
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.620
does Iq matter,

671
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:35.510
how does Iq relate to intelligence?

672
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.470
How does,

673
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.130
um,

674
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.521
what's,

675
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:38.320
what's the different,

676
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.860
wider people different than intelligence,

677
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.270
wider different human groups,

678
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.140
different intelligence and so on.

679
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.273
Um,

680
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.410
at the same time there was also another group of Iq research and researchers,

681
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.920
not quite the same as the first group got together and wrote another report.

682
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.840
And if you're interested in this,

683
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.840
the links to the reports are on a power point slide.

684
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.630
Well what did they conclude?

685
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.790
The conclusions were slightly different,

686
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.330
but here's the broad consensus by the experts,

687
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.963
um,

688
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.850
regarding the importance of Iq tests and the claim is Iq is strongly related

689
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.710
more so probably more so than any other single measurable human trait to many

690
00:27:19.711 --> 00:27:20.970
important educational,

691
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:21.571
occupational,

692
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:23.640
economic and social outcomes.

693
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.420
In some cases the correlation is very strong,

694
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.730
such as um,

695
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.950
success in school and success in military training.

696
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.600
In other cases it's moderate but robust such as social competence.

697
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.880
And in other cases it's smaller,

698
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.940
but consistent law abiding this and they can include whatever Iq tests measure

699
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.640
it is of great practical and social importance.

700
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.290
So IQ matters.

701
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.070
Um,

702
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.590
more particularly Iq matters for social achievement,

703
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.240
for prestigious positions and for Andre job performance and other work related

704
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:57.960
variables.

705
00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.760
If I know your Iq score,

706
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.580
I know something about you that matters.

707
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.990
It's not irrelevant.

708
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:08.730
Just as if I know your score on a personality test at a big five,

709
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.490
I would know something about you that as you would tell me,

710
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:14.340
something interesting about you in the real world.

711
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.560
On the other hand,

712
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.550
there's a lot of controversy about why this connection exists.

713
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.683
Um,

714
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:27.230
so to some extent people have worried that the effectiveness of Iq is a self

715
00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:29.220
fulfilling prophecy.

716
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:30.780
And here's why.

717
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.330
If society takes Iq tests important,

718
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.680
seriously,

719
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.240
they become important.

720
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.600
So it's true that your Iq is very related to your success in getting into a good

721
00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:46.710
school like Yale.

722
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.290
But the reason for this in large extent is because to get to Yale they give you

723
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:53.220
an Iq test,

724
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.210
the sat.

725
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:55.940
So,

726
00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:56.160
um,

727
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.390
same for graduate school,

728
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.330
there's a GRE which is yet another Iq tests.

729
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.750
So to some extent it's a self fulfilling prophecy.

730
00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:04.590
Um,

731
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.550
I could make,

732
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.460
society could choose to make how tall you are.

733
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.010
Extremely important for educational success.

734
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.130
They could say nobody under six feet tall gets into Yale.

735
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.800
And then some psych professor would stand up and say,

736
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:17.401
of course,

737
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:20.400
height is profoundly related to educational accomplishment.

738
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.980
And it would be because people made it so,

739
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.640
so to some extent is society that draws highly and Iq tests,

740
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.610
um,

741
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.710
regarding promotion and educational,

742
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.760
educational achievement and military status and so on.

743
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:36.983
Um,

744
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:42.250
it's just going to follow that Iq then becomes important at the same time.

745
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:43.084
However,

746
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.680
the role of Iq is pretty clearly not entirely a social construction.

747
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:48.790
Um,

748
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.790
there's some evidence that your Iq score you're relates to intelligence and an

749
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:57.880
interesting sense including domains like mental speed,

750
00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.990
um,

751
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.980
and uh,

752
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.880
memory span.

753
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.081
So you're,

754
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:02.410
you're,

755
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.240
you're scoring Iq tests for instance,

756
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.900
is to some extent related to how fast you could think and,

757
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:08.620
uh,

758
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.880
your memory abilities.

759
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

760
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.590
<v 0>Now I want to shift to the second half of the class and talk about why.</v>

761
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.900
So we talked about two differences.

762
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.450
One in person at one personality,

763
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.650
one intelligence.

764
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.810
I want to talk about why people defer,

765
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.890
but before I do,

766
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.400
uh,

767
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.600
do people have any questions?

768
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.183
<v 1>Yes.</v>

769
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:34.863
Test,

770
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.833
test works.

771
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.730
It's a very strong self presentation.

772
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.943
Yes.

773
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.510
But how did you deal with that?

774
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.551
<v 0>It's a good question.</v>

775
00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:07.790
The question is this young man took,

776
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.633
um,

777
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:09.571
took,

778
00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:10.980
I just took a personality test.

779
00:31:10.981 --> 00:31:11.281
He was,

780
00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:12.770
he was accepted into Slitherin,

781
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.000
which is a Hogwarts reference.

782
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:15.780
I'm,

783
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.830
I'm hip to that.

784
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.693
Um,

785
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.713
and,

786
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:19.620
and uh,

787
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.850
but the question is a good one.

788
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:21.480
Um,

789
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.313
um,

790
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:23.011
you're,

791
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:23.371
you're a,

792
00:31:23.371 --> 00:31:24.420
you're a clever man,

793
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.230
um,

794
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.160
hygiene,

795
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.030
um,

796
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.710
and you want it to be in slitherin.

797
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.570
How do we know he didn't work the test?

798
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.500
I mean,

799
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:31.771
you know,

800
00:31:31.771 --> 00:31:32.011
you,

801
00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:34.960
you're going to get these personality tests all the time and you know,

802
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.500
pretty nice to test if you're applying for a business.

803
00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:40.680
And one of the test is I like to steal from my bosses.

804
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:41.530
Oh,

805
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.121
I don't think so.

806
00:31:42.121 --> 00:31:42.540
No,

807
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.460
that's a little Iq test right there.

808
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.420
Um,

809
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.730
so the question is how do you avoid that problem?

810
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.360
Um,

811
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.290
the test constructors have done so in certain clever ways.

812
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.580
Um,

813
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.091
for instance,

814
00:31:54.091 --> 00:31:57.780
there are often catch questions designed to catch a liar.

815
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:58.920
Um,

816
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.000
some of these questions posed very unrealistic phenomena.

817
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.340
So you might have a question in there saying,

818
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.383
um,

819
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.523
uh,

820
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.900
I have never done anything I am ashamed of.

821
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.940
Now some people will say,

822
00:32:11.941 --> 00:32:12.420
yes,

823
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.260
that's true of me,

824
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.910
but they tend to be lawyers.

825
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.380
And so unrealistic questions tend to catch liars.

826
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.000
Also you get to the same question asked in different ways across the hundred

827
00:32:24.001 --> 00:32:26.970
items and they could use the correlations to figure these things out.

828
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:27.841
I mean,

829
00:32:27.841 --> 00:32:28.560
again,

830
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.940
the proof is sort of in the pudding.

831
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.840
The reliability and validity of a test,

832
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.063
um,

833
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:40.220
is determined in part by just how well it does at predicting future performance

834
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:45.221
on a desk and your real world performance and a test that is easily fool,

835
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.380
easily tricked by smart people wouldn't survive long as a personality test.

836
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.400
So we know that we know the test you got is a pretty good test because it seems

837
00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:56.360
to work for most people.

838
00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:59.503
<v 1>Yes,</v>

839
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.380
that's success is more related to emotional like you rather than to it.

840
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.831
<v 0>It's a good question.</v>

841
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:08.360
The question was about emotional Iq,

842
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:08.871
which is Sunday.

843
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:11.030
I'm actually going to touch upon a little bit later in the course,

844
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:14.900
but people have talked about different forms of intelligence and emotional

845
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.980
intelligence.

846
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.440
Social intelligence is,

847
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:19.040
um,

848
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.320
is a,

849
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.690
can arguably a candidate for success across different domains.

850
00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.560
Um,

851
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.560
the evidence for its predictive power is not as strong as for regular Iq tests.

852
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.510
So you might be right,

853
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:34.430
it might turn out to be a much better predictor,

854
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.580
but one is not clear that we know that yet.

855
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.210
I'm Peter Salovey's actually done some very interesting research on us and it's

856
00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:42.830
continuing work along those lines.

857
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.280
The second thing is emotional intelligence actually related to good old

858
00:33:46.281 --> 00:33:47.360
fashioned intelligence.

859
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.430
They kind of pulled together a lot.

860
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:50.780
So it's not entirely separate.

861
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:52.221
But that's a good point.

862
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:54.830
And I'd like to return to it a little bit later on in the course.

863
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.993
Yes.

864
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.733
<v 1>One</v>

865
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.560
better than another test of what makes NSA to you with analogies works that sat.

866
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.651
<v 0>Good question.</v>

867
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:11.960
How do you determine when to get a good test is,

868
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.183
and again,

869
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.850
it's a real art going through the details of how to do that,

870
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.790
but the broad answers involve reliability and validity.

871
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.350
It's a good test.

872
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:23.750
If I test you today and I test you tomorrow,

873
00:34:23.751 --> 00:34:24.770
I get the same score.

874
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.450
It's a really good test.

875
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:31.540
If your score on that test predicts your grades are,

876
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:34.510
if it's a personality test predicts um,

877
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.020
how many girlfriends you have,

878
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:41.230
our predicts whether people think you're a nice guy so you have to see both the

879
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:45.830
replicability of the test over time but also its relationship to real world

880
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:47.570
phenomena and that's important.

881
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:47.960
Again,

882
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.960
why do we know the Batman wonder woman hoke test is a bad one?

883
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:53.541
Well,

884
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:56.650
one answer is because what,

885
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:57.681
what I,

886
00:34:57.681 --> 00:34:58.514
what I,

887
00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.430
how I score on that test isn't that tell you anything about me.

888
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.940
It's not going to relate to my grades is not going to relate to how well I'm

889
00:35:03.941 --> 00:35:04.774
liked.

890
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.890
How do we know to sat is useful?

891
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.190
Well it actually corresponds with other things like grapes.

892
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:13.923
<v 1>Yes and back.</v>

893
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:29.021
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

894
00:35:29.021 --> 00:35:31.780
The question is when I'm talking I'm a personality,

895
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:34.900
I'm defining it in terms of sending which is stable over time.

896
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.310
And your question,

897
00:35:36.311 --> 00:35:37.144
which is a good one,

898
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.810
how do we know it's stable over time?

899
00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.100
Candidate change and the answer is yeah,

900
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.590
a lot of personality does change over time.

901
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.770
A personality tests you give to a 10 year old will relate,

902
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:51.660
but not so strongly with that individual when he's 50.

903
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.580
On the other hand,

904
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.020
we know that that the psychological claim that there exists such a thing as

905
00:35:58.021 --> 00:36:02.580
personality and it is stable over time is supported by the fact that if you're

906
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:03.930
an extrovert now,

907
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.700
you're likely to be an extrovert 20 years from now,

908
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.530
not perfectly.

909
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.131
So you're right,

910
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:09.000
you could change,

911
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.260
you could become an introvert,

912
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.730
you can become more of an extrovert.

913
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:17.090
But where do you stand now is significantly related to where you'll be in the

914
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:20.970
future and that justifies talking about it as a stable trait.

915
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.200
Same with Iq.

916
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.090
Your Iq might change,

917
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:24.661
it might go up,

918
00:36:24.661 --> 00:36:25.494
it might go down,

919
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.810
but it won't go up and go down that much.

920
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.200
And this is why it makes sense to talk about intelligence as a more or less

921
00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:32.034
stable trait.

922
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.983
Okay.

923
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.400
Why are we different?

924
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.551
Well,

925
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.384
you're different

926
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.600
because of two things.

927
00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:44.010
Uh,

928
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.690
your genes and your environment,

929
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.820
your nature and your nurture,

930
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.840
your heredity and your experience.

931
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.790
This doesn't say anything.

932
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:55.290
This is just defining the question.

933
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.513
Um,

934
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.050
but the question of the role of genes and the role of environment,

935
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:01.950
uh,

936
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:02.281
in,

937
00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:05.460
in explaining human differences is an interesting one.

938
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.520
And it could be explored in different ways.

939
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.020
But before talking about it,

940
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:12.030
I have to clear up a common misconception.

941
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.690
I'm going to talk about the effects of jeans and I'm going to talk about

942
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:16.524
heredity,

943
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.870
but I want to be clear.

944
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:24.350
I am talking about the role of genes and also the role of environment in

945
00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:26.940
explaining human differences,

946
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.930
not in explaining human characteristics.

947
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.880
So the distinction is we're interested in amount of variation due to genetic

948
00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:36.714
differences,

949
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.560
not to proportion of an individual's trait that's due to genes.

950
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.960
So for instance,

951
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.340
you could pull these apart.

952
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.420
The question of,

953
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:46.254
um,

954
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.950
when we ask what's the role of genes,

955
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.280
what's the rule of heredity in how tall people are?

956
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:59.430
The question is not asking for you what is the role of your genes and

957
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:00.720
determining how tall you are.

958
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.471
It's not clear.

959
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:02.760
It's even a sensible question.

960
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.990
The question is there is a height difference between you and me and him and her.

961
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.000
How do we explain that difference?

962
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.680
And I could illustrate why heredity doesn't mean the same thing as the

963
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:14.970
contribution of the genes.

964
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.200
Um,

965
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.570
height is reasonably heritable,

966
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.003
meaning,

967
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.060
um,

968
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.060
the differences between people in the population and how tall they are is due in

969
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:27.330
large part,

970
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:28.230
not entirely,

971
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.090
but in large part to their jeans.

972
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.760
What about the number of legs people have?

973
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:33.991
Well,

974
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:38.991
the number of legs people have from zero one or two is actually not very

975
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:44.221
heritable at all because almost everybody has two legs and people will have

976
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:49.570
fewer than two legs typically have lost one or both legs in an accident.

977
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.370
It's not due to their genes.

978
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.470
So of course,

979
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:56.320
whether or not you have legs is a very genetic matter.

980
00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:00.190
But the differences in number of legs is,

981
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.200
is not usually genetics.

982
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.560
And so heredity is a claim about differences,

983
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.100
not a claim about the origin of any specific trait.

984
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.430
Well now we,

985
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.760
that's what heredity,

986
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:13.840
which is genetic.

987
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.040
Now we could talk about environment and we could break up environment into two

988
00:39:18.041 --> 00:39:19.000
sorts of environment.

989
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:24.210
One is shared environment and shared environment is the extent to which the

990
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:29.881
differences are caused by things by phenomena that's people raised in the same

991
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:31.360
household share.

992
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.880
So if one,

993
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.010
suppose some of you are neurotic

994
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.250
and suppose we want to say it.

995
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:40.900
Part of that's due to your environment.

996
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:45.190
Well suppose you're neurotic because you have lousy parents

997
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.700
that would be part of your shared environment because presumably siblings raised

998
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.660
in the same household would have the same lousy parents.

999
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:01.090
This is contrasted with non shared environment which is everything else.

1000
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:05.560
Suppose I think you're neurotic because when you were five years old somebody

1001
00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:06.660
threw a snowball at unit,

1002
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.750
bounced off of your head.

1003
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.640
That's non shared environment.

1004
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.140
Suppose you're neurotic because you won the lottery when you were 21 and all the

1005
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:15.100
money messed you up.

1006
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.560
That'd be non shared environment.

1007
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.620
So what you have here is heredity,

1008
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.720
shared environment and non shared environment and this equals one that's

1009
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:26.554
everything.

1010
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.230
Non shared environment is a sort of garbage can category that includes

1011
00:40:32.231 --> 00:40:35.410
everything that's not heredity and not shared environment.

1012
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.340
Suppose you think you're an erotic because aliens from the planet,

1013
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:41.470
Pluto are Zapping your brain.

1014
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.600
Suppose you're right.

1015
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.620
Well I would be non shared environment because they're presumably not

1016
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:52.210
necessarily zapping your siblings brings everything else is non shared

1017
00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:53.044
environment.

1018
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.150
It becomes interesting to ask

1019
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.960
for all these differences,

1020
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.180
the physical differences like height,

1021
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.450
but psychological differences like um,

1022
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.810
personality and intelligence.

1023
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.980
How do we parcel it out and to what's genetic and what's environmental?

1024
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:13.623
Um,

1025
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:18.580
this proves to be really difficult in the real world because it's in the real

1026
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:18.851
world.

1027
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.700
It's hard to pull apart genes and environment.

1028
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.361
So,

1029
00:41:22.361 --> 00:41:23.194
um,

1030
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.160
so,

1031
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.190
so you and me will have different personalities.

1032
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:28.623
Why?

1033
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:29.110
Well,

1034
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:33.890
we were raised by different parents and we have different genes and we can't

1035
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.420
tell my,

1036
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.910
my brother and me,

1037
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.051
my chair,

1038
00:41:39.051 --> 00:41:40.370
all sorts of things in common.

1039
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.970
But we had the same parents and the same genes,

1040
00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:45.050
50% of the same genes.

1041
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.080
So how do we tell what's causing us to be alike?

1042
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:49.461
So to do,

1043
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:51.350
to pull these things apart,

1044
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.580
you need to be clever.

1045
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.970
You need to use the tools of behavioral genetics.

1046
00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:56.840
Um,

1047
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.640
and to use these tools,

1048
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.320
you have to exploit certain regularities about genes and about environment.

1049
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.900
One thing is this,

1050
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.120
some people are clones.

1051
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.040
Mano is,

1052
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.360
I got a twins are genetic duplicates.

1053
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.790
They share 100% of the same genes.

1054
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.500
That's kind of interesting.

1055
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.940
Dies I got twins are not clones.

1056
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.110
They share 50,

1057
00:42:21.111 --> 00:42:21.740
50.

1058
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.740
They're just like regular siblings and adopted siblings have no special genetic

1059
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.234
overlap.

1060
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:34.040
That's 0% above and beyond randomness.

1061
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.720
Those three groups then become rather interesting,

1062
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:44.450
particularly when we keep in mind that by definition two people raised in the

1063
00:42:44.451 --> 00:42:48.680
same house by the same parents have a 100% the same shared environment.

1064
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.610
So now we can start to answer these questions.

1065
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.890
Suppose you find that monozygotic twins are much more similar than dies.

1066
00:42:59.891 --> 00:43:00.371
I got it.

1067
00:43:00.371 --> 00:43:01.204
Twins.

1068
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.721
Well,

1069
00:43:01.721 --> 00:43:06.470
I would suggest that there's a large role of genes in those traits that you're

1070
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.323
interested in.

1071
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:11.530
It would not cinched a matter because there were other factors at work.

1072
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.071
For instance,

1073
00:43:12.071 --> 00:43:12.521
Mano is,

1074
00:43:12.521 --> 00:43:15.910
I got a twins look more alike than dies.

1075
00:43:15.911 --> 00:43:19.030
I got twins and maybe they have different than Deb.

1076
00:43:19.031 --> 00:43:22.930
More similar environments because of this similarity in appearance.

1077
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.711
Armando is,

1078
00:43:25.711 --> 00:43:26.081
I got it.

1079
00:43:26.081 --> 00:43:27.450
Twins just as similar as dies.

1080
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.303
I got a twins.

1081
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:32.240
If so then it would show that though that all of that extra overlap and jeans

1082
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:37.360
doesn't really matter and so it was suggested a low role of heredity are adopted

1083
00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:42.410
children highly similar to their brothers and sisters.

1084
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:47.030
If so dinner is a high role of shared environment.

1085
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.010
Suppose the bloom children,

1086
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.880
um,

1087
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.880
and there's seven of them all have an Iq of 104 and we adopted three kids and

1088
00:43:57.831 --> 00:44:02.120
then at the end of the day those three kids each have an Iq of 104 that would

1089
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:03.560
suggest that.

1090
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:07.130
And we do this over and over again across different families that would suggest

1091
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:12.131
that there's something about the bloom family being raised by me that gives you

1092
00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:16.820
an Iq of 104 on the other hand,

1093
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.910
if the Iq of the adopted kids had no relationship to those of the biological

1094
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:23.564
bloom children,

1095
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.350
it was suggested.

1096
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:28.460
Being raised by me has no effects really in your Iq is sort of separate.

1097
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.321
A separate,

1098
00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:31.160
a second,

1099
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.180
a final contrast,

1100
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:38.300
which is the thing that psychologists love is identical twins reared apart.

1101
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.060
That's the gold standard because you'd have these people who are clones but

1102
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:47.160
they're raised in different families.

1103
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.060
Um,

1104
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.640
and to the extent that there are similar,

1105
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.000
this suggest it's a similarity of their jeans.

1106
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:54.930
Um,

1107
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.210
and in fact one of the,

1108
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.630
one of the most surprising findings in behavioral genetics,

1109
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.570
the caption here is separated at birth.

1110
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:08.010
The Malheur for twins meet accidentally ended at a patent office with the same

1111
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:08.880
device.

1112
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.690
Um,

1113
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:14.190
one of the hugely surprising findings from behavioral genetics is how alike

1114
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:18.810
identical twins reared apart are they seem to have similar attitudes to the

1115
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:21.810
death penalty to religion and to modern music.

1116
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.870
There they have similar rates of behavior in crime,

1117
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:26.280
gambling and divorce.

1118
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.560
They often have been founded,

1119
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:30.360
have bizarre similarities.

1120
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.680
They meet after being separated at birth and they meet at age 30.

1121
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.670
And then it turns out they both get into a lot of trouble because they pretend

1122
00:45:38.671 --> 00:45:39.840
to sneeze and elevators.

1123
00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.220
Um,

1124
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:41.971
there was one,

1125
00:45:41.971 --> 00:45:44.280
one pair of twins studied by,

1126
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:44.580
um,

1127
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.510
behavioral geneticists were known as the giggle twins because they were both

1128
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:49.590
would always giggle.

1129
00:45:49.591 --> 00:45:53.820
They burst into giggles at every moment even though it couldn't be environment

1130
00:45:53.821 --> 00:45:56.010
because they weren't raised together.

1131
00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:57.180
Um,

1132
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.630
more objective Lee,

1133
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:04.190
the brain scans of identical twins reared apart show that their brains are so

1134
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:08.070
similar.

1135
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:13.190
In many cases you can't tell who's brain is who I get tell your brain from my

1136
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:13.621
brain,

1137
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:15.220
from a brain scan and my,

1138
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.070
my brother's brain from my brain,

1139
00:46:17.071 --> 00:46:17.904
from a brain scan.

1140
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.860
But if I were to have an identical twin,

1141
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.960
it would be very difficult to tell who's brain is,

1142
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:24.840
who's even if we had no environment in common.

1143
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:30.360
So this leads to two surprising findings of behavioral genetics.

1144
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.860
This is the first one.

1145
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.540
There's high heritability for almost everything.

1146
00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.100
Um,

1147
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.420
for intelligence,

1148
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.800
for personality,

1149
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:45.950
for how happy you are for how religious you are for your political orientation

1150
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:47.431
there,

1151
00:46:47.431 --> 00:46:48.990
for your sexual orientation,

1152
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:50.940
there was high heritability.

1153
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.420
There's a high effect of genes for just about everything.

1154
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:59.640
Now that's actually not the controversial thing I'm going to tell you.

1155
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.150
But before getting to the more controversial thing,

1156
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:03.900
um,

1157
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.160
I want to raise another issue,

1158
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:07.800
which often gets discussed and has a good treatment in a textbook.

1159
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.910
Um,

1160
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.400
this suggests that individual differences within this,

1161
00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:13.770
within a group have genetic causes.

1162
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:19.010
Does that mean that group differences are largely the result of genetic causes?

1163
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:25.010
So we know that there are clear differences in Iq scores among American racial

1164
00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:25.980
groups,

1165
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.660
between whites and Asians,

1166
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:28.740
African Americans,

1167
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.280
Ashkenazi Jews,

1168
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.780
there's clear and reliable Iq differences as well as some other differences.

1169
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.633
Now,

1170
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.420
to some extent these groups are partially socially constructed.

1171
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.620
Um,

1172
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.590
and what this means is that whether or not you fall into,

1173
00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:45.550
into a group,

1174
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.090
um,

1175
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:50.290
is not entirely determined by your genetic makeup is often determined by social

1176
00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:51.124
decisions.

1177
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.590
So whether or not you count as a Jew for instance,

1178
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:53.980
um,

1179
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.680
depends not entirely on genetic factors,

1180
00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.800
but also on factors such as whether you're reform or Orthodox and whether you,

1181
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.830
so whether you would,

1182
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:03.100
uh,

1183
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.050
accept that the child of a Jewish man and a non Jewish woman is Jewish.

1184
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:08.920
Um,

1185
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.551
similarly,

1186
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:14.551
categories like African American and white and Asian often overlap broad genetic

1187
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:15.490
categories.

1188
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:18.700
And they don't make fully coherent genetic sense.

1189
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.350
At the same time though,

1190
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.030
there's plainly some genetic differences across human groups and um,

1191
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.660
say with regard to vulnerability to disease,

1192
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.370
Ashkenazi Jews for instance,

1193
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.050
are vulnerable to taste sacks.

1194
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.580
And the fact that you would have this sort of genetic vulnerability suggests

1195
00:48:35.581 --> 00:48:38.170
that there's some sort of reality to these groups.

1196
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.240
So you have to ask the question now.

1197
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.440
To what extent does the high heritability in individuals mean that there has to

1198
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:50.560
be a heritable explanation across groups?

1199
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.200
And the answer is not at all.

1200
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.060
I'm not saying that this means that there is no genetic explanation for human

1201
00:48:58.061 --> 00:48:58.930
group differences.

1202
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:04.290
All I'm saying is the question of the phenomena of Wolf ingroup genetic

1203
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:09.481
differences does not mean that there's a cross group genetic,

1204
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.610
sorry between group genetic differences.

1205
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:13.840
Um,

1206
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.510
there was a nice example by Richard Lewington,

1207
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:17.200
the Iba,

1208
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.200
the geneticists where he imagines two plots of,

1209
00:49:22.241 --> 00:49:22.690
um,

1210
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.130
what are you some sort of a wheat?

1211
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:24.700
Yeah,

1212
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.700
two plots of land and each one has a set of seeds and oh no,

1213
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.060
they're over here.

1214
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.170
No there anyway,

1215
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:33.363
one of them,

1216
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.870
you fertilize a lot.

1217
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.370
The other one you fertilize a little now with in each plot,

1218
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.880
how much the seed grows is actually largely determined by the genetics of the

1219
00:49:44.891 --> 00:49:45.724
seed.

1220
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.300
And so you'd find high heritability for growth in the seats.

1221
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:54.780
But the difference between groups has no genetic cause at all.

1222
00:49:55.481 --> 00:49:58.090
It's caused by which groups you fertilize more than others.

1223
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.940
Here's another way to do to,

1224
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.833
to do the logic.

1225
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:07.020
Suppose from the middle down here you guys,

1226
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:08.283
I hate you,

1227
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.370
I really hate all of you and I like you.

1228
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:14.050
So I make up two midterms.

1229
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:15.190
You probably didn't notice,

1230
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:16.060
but there are two midterms.

1231
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.940
This Mitchard was fiercely hard,

1232
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.560
savagely hard.

1233
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.300
It took many of you till the end,

1234
00:50:22.301 --> 00:50:23.134
the class to do it.

1235
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.550
This midterm was,

1236
00:50:24.551 --> 00:50:25.384
you know,

1237
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:26.560
which is bigger,

1238
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.230
a dog,

1239
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.063
an elephant.

1240
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.810
Because I like you and I want you all to succeed now.

1241
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.190
So you have two different groups,

1242
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.370
you guys and you guys with any age group,

1243
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.530
some people are going to do better than others.

1244
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.680
The explanation for that might actually have to do if your genes,

1245
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.380
it may have to do for your environment how much you've studied with all sorts of

1246
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:46.070
reasons for that.

1247
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.270
Well if any each group,

1248
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.330
some of you will do better in a heart test and then others on a heart test,

1249
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.470
some better on easy test then then then than others and easy test.

1250
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.750
But how do we explain the group difference?

1251
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.550
Why has nothing to do with genes?

1252
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:02.450
The group difference if I do you will do much worse than you has to do with

1253
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.931
exams.

1254
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:07.931
I give my point again is that there is a logical difference between a within

1255
00:51:07.971 --> 00:51:12.971
group difference within this half of the class and a difference between groups

1256
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:15.230
within between this group and this group.

1257
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.170
What do we know about,

1258
00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:20.000
so that just shows they're not the same thing,

1259
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.380
but what's the fact of the matter?

1260
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:23.720
What do we know about human differences,

1261
00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:24.470
uh,

1262
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.970
between different human groups?

1263
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:27.391
Again,

1264
00:51:27.391 --> 00:51:29.390
the textbook has a good discussion of this,

1265
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.583
but um,

1266
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:35.890
I'm going to give two reasons from the textbook that at least screw differences

1267
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.340
or at least to a large extent due to environmental and not genetic causes.

1268
00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:45.290
One is that the difference is we find an Iq seem to correspond better to

1269
00:51:45.291 --> 00:51:46.640
socially defined groups.

1270
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.350
Then genetically defined groups.

1271
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:53.210
They seem to correspond to groups defined in terms of how people treat you and

1272
00:51:53.211 --> 00:51:55.970
how people think about you as opposed to your DNA.

1273
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:58.880
And to extend that turns out to be true.

1274
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:03.470
That would mean that that a genetic explanation is not reasonable for those

1275
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:04.304
differences.

1276
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:10.540
A second factor is that we know I Q can differ radically without any genetic

1277
00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:15.290
differences at all.

1278
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.580
And the most dramatic evidence of that is the Flynn effect.

1279
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.330
The Flynn effect is one of the freakier findings.

1280
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:28.810
The Flynn effect is the finding that people have been getting smarter.

1281
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.380
You are much smarter on average than your parents.

1282
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:34.893
<v 1>Um,</v>

1283
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:36.843
if,

1284
00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.320
<v 0>and the Iq test hide that,</v>

1285
00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:46.600
here's why they hide that they hide that because they always make a hundred the

1286
00:52:46.601 --> 00:52:47.434
average.

1287
00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.600
So you come home and say,

1288
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.340
Dad,

1289
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:50.770
dad,

1290
00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:52.150
I just did an Iq test.

1291
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:55.570
I got 120 and your fathers could work,

1292
00:52:55.571 --> 00:52:56.060
son,

1293
00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.930
I got 122 when I was your age,

1294
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:00.820
Bro.

1295
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.200
What neither of you acknowledge is your test was a much harder as people got

1296
00:53:05.201 --> 00:53:05.531
better.

1297
00:53:05.531 --> 00:53:07.630
They had to make the test harder and harder.

1298
00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.970
And this is plotted by the Flynn effect.

1299
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:10.630
Um,

1300
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.550
one of these lines is,

1301
00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:13.443
um,

1302
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:18.970
one of these lines is an American one is Dutch.

1303
00:53:18.971 --> 00:53:20.110
I don't know which is which.

1304
00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:22.480
But the gist of it is that,

1305
00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:23.080
um,

1306
00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:28.080
that somebody who would have that if you in 1980 would take the 1950 test,

1307
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.080
your average person in 1980 which score 120 on the 1950 tests with this means is

1308
00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:38.670
you take your,

1309
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:43.350
your person who's average now and push them back through time,

1310
00:53:43.351 --> 00:53:43.981
20 years,

1311
00:53:43.981 --> 00:53:44.814
30 years,

1312
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.773
um,

1313
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.150
he would do much better than average.

1314
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.420
Nobody knows why people are getting smarter.

1315
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:52.943
Um,

1316
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.960
and there's different theories of this

1317
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:57.240
and in fact,

1318
00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.300
well wait,

1319
00:53:58.310 --> 00:53:59.520
Gcu reading response.

1320
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:00.713
But,

1321
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.520
but what this illustrates is that Eicu can change dramatically over the span of

1322
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.170
a few decades without any corresponding genetic change.

1323
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:14.603
And

1324
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.370
that leaves open to possibility.

1325
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:17.701
In fact,

1326
00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:21.000
maybe the likelihood that the difference is we find in human groups,

1327
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:25.050
existing human groups are caused by the same environmental effects that have led

1328
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:25.890
to the Flynn effect.

1329
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.993
Okay.

1330
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:28.890
This is not the surprise in claim though.

1331
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.260
The high heritability for almost everything.

1332
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:32.970
This is the surprise and claim.

1333
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.560
Almost everything that's not genetic is due to non shared environment.

1334
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.760
The behavioral genetic analyses,

1335
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:40.940
um,

1336
00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.300
suggests that

1337
00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.293
<v 1>MMM,</v>

1338
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.860
<v 0>shared environment counts for little or nothing.</v>

1339
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.770
When it comes to personality or intelligence,

1340
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:54.771
then an adopted child is no more similar to his siblings then he or she is to a

1341
00:54:55.861 --> 00:54:56.694
stranger.

1342
00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.230
To put it in a different way,

1343
00:55:00.231 --> 00:55:01.520
the Iq correlation,

1344
00:55:01.521 --> 00:55:04.640
you genetically unrelated adults who are raised in the same family is about

1345
00:55:04.641 --> 00:55:05.270
zero.

1346
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:10.270
Suppose the bloom family all has an Iq of 104 and we adopt a kid.

1347
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.430
What will this kids we adopted as a baby.

1348
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.290
We raised him to be a 20 year old.

1349
00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.240
What's his Iq answer?

1350
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:22.420
We have no idea because the Iq of the bloom family who are unrelated to him has

1351
00:55:23.241 --> 00:55:24.620
no effect at all.

1352
00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.240
Now if you think about the implications of it,

1353
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:30.770
it becomes controversial.

1354
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:31.520
Um,

1355
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.530
and Newsweek I think caught the big issue when,

1356
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.140
when they put in their title the question,

1357
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.850
do parents matter?

1358
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.570
And the question and the issue is parents are shared environment to say shared

1359
00:55:44.061 --> 00:55:48.230
environment does not affect your intelligence or your personality.

1360
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.593
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1361
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:54.500
<v 0>Suggest that that how your parents raised you.</v>

1362
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.380
It does not affect your gene,

1363
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.561
your,

1364
00:55:57.561 --> 00:55:59.210
your intelligence or your personality.

1365
00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:02.130
This isn't to say your parents didn't have a big effect,

1366
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.020
um,

1367
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:03.500
on your,

1368
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.600
on your intelligence and personality.

1369
00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:10.010
Your parents had a huge effect on your intelligence in your personality around

1370
00:56:10.011 --> 00:56:10.850
0.5.

1371
00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.060
Actually they had this affected the moment of conception.

1372
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.950
From then on end,

1373
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.340
they played very little role in shaping you what you are.

1374
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:24.880
The case for this which generated a cover came up in a controversial book by

1375
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:28.000
Judith Paris called the nurturer assumption,

1376
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:28.990
um,

1377
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:30.910
which has a very long subtitle.

1378
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.700
Why parents turn white children turn out the way they do.

1379
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.400
Parents matter less than you think.

1380
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.320
And peers matter more.

1381
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:39.100
Um,

1382
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.850
Judith Harris has had an intellectual and an interesting history.

1383
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.540
Um,

1384
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.990
she was kicked out of graduate school at Harvard,

1385
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:47.740
um,

1386
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.600
and told that she wouldn't amount to much.

1387
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.630
The person who wrote the letter saying that she was not going to amount to much

1388
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:56.680
was the department chair George Miller in 1997.

1389
00:56:56.681 --> 00:57:00.460
She wanted a George Miller award for her astounding accomplishments.

1390
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.553
Um,

1391
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:03.430
and when she wrote the book,

1392
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:04.990
She took as a starting point,

1393
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:06.700
her point of disagreement,

1394
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.060
a famous poem by the poet Philip Larkin.

1395
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.810
And many of you have probably heard us DePaul and goes like this.

1396
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:15.131
They fuck you up.

1397
00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:16.150
Your mom and dad.

1398
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:17.440
They may not mean to,

1399
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:18.274
but they do.

1400
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.960
They feel you have the false they had and add some extra just for you.

1401
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.010
Um,

1402
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:25.390
the last line of the poem,

1403
00:57:25.391 --> 00:57:28.120
the last bit of the poem ends,

1404
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:29.621
man,

1405
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:31.480
hands on misery to man.

1406
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.730
It deepens like a coastal shelf.

1407
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.570
Get out as early as you can and don't have any kids yourself.

1408
00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.353
It's beautiful.

1409
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.473
Um,

1410
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.550
Harris wrote a rebuttal.

1411
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.120
How sharper than a serpent's tooth to hear your child make such a fuss.

1412
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:50.771
It isn't fair.

1413
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:51.700
It's not the truth.

1414
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.901
He's fucked up.

1415
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:53.261
Yes,

1416
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:54.190
but not by us.

1417
00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:56.240
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1418
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.910
<v 0>Just to show that academic debates never end.</v>

1419
00:57:59.040 --> 00:57:59.720
Um,

1420
00:57:59.720 --> 00:57:59.811
uh,

1421
00:57:59.811 --> 00:58:01.700
British psychoanalyst named Oliver.

1422
00:58:01.701 --> 00:58:05.330
Jane's James Outraged by Judith Harris's book.

1423
00:58:05.331 --> 00:58:10.280
The nurture assumption wrote another book in response called they fuck you up.

1424
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:12.583
<v 1>Um,</v>

1425
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:13.803
now

1426
00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:18.450
<v 0>how do you tell your grandparents I wrote a book.</v>

1427
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:19.550
What's it called?

1428
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.693
Can't tell you.

1429
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:21.543
<v 1>Um,</v>

1430
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.690
anyway,

1431
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:24.523
um,

1432
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:25.550
<v 0>look,</v>

1433
00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:26.750
if you're paying attention,

1434
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.130
this has to sound wrong.

1435
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:30.320
You must be thinking.

1436
00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:32.960
Of course there must be an effective shared environment.

1437
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.891
Of course,

1438
00:58:33.891 --> 00:58:38.540
parents have an effect after all good kids have good parents.

1439
00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:42.260
There is no doubt at all that this is true.

1440
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:46.040
There's a high correlation in parent and child for everything.

1441
00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:48.860
If your parents read a lot and there's a lot of books in your house,

1442
00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.570
you will become a reader.

1443
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:51.410
Um,

1444
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:52.760
if your parents are religious,

1445
00:58:52.761 --> 00:58:53.780
you will be religious.

1446
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.330
If you're,

1447
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.770
if you're raised by Bonnie and Clyde,

1448
00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.390
you will be a young thug.

1449
00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:00.563
Uh,

1450
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.120
if your parents are poor,

1451
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.200
you are likely to be poor.

1452
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:04.490
If your parents are brilliant,

1453
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.600
you are likely to be brilliant.

1454
00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:07.190
No doubt at all.

1455
00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.470
It is extremely robust correlation.

1456
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:11.780
But the problem is this correlation.

1457
00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.700
It could be explained in different ways.

1458
00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:18.140
Everybody thinks it's because parents do something that affects their kids.

1459
00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.490
Your parents are bookish,

1460
00:59:19.491 --> 00:59:23.180
they read to their kids so their kids become bookish.

1461
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:25.940
Um,

1462
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:27.200
but another possibility,

1463
00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:28.520
which we know is true,

1464
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:32.300
that almost always parents share their jeans with their kids.

1465
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:38.600
Another possibility is it's the parents who are affecting,

1466
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:38.931
sorry,

1467
00:59:38.931 --> 00:59:40.850
it's a child is affecting the parents,

1468
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.290
not vice versa.

1469
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.870
And to illustrate this,

1470
00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.693
um,

1471
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.290
these different possibilities.

1472
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:51.980
I want to tell you a little bit about a study and I really find this a

1473
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:54.110
fascinating study that was reported last year.

1474
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:55.203
Um,

1475
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.610
and it was a study shown that suggested it.

1476
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.040
Family meals help teens avoid smoking alcohol,

1477
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:05.540
drugs and involve a phone questionnaire when he phoned up teenagers and their

1478
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:06.470
parents that said,

1479
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.820
a teenager,

1480
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.530
do you do a lot of drugs?

1481
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.101
Uh,

1482
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:10.910
yes.

1483
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:12.080
Do you have a dinner?

1484
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:16.970
If your parents know and they take it off and then they ask other people and

1485
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:18.620
they find that the,

1486
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:23.830
the kids who are the good kids have meals with their parents suggesting this

1487
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:26.684
headline.

1488
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:29.690
I like this study because I have read,

1489
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:34.691
I must have read in my career a thousand studies and this is the worst study

1490
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.180
ever done in the history of science.

1491
01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:39.383
Um,

1492
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.233
and,

1493
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:42.230
and it's almost,

1494
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:42.861
we could devote,

1495
01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:45.470
we could devote a week to discussing what's wrong with this study,

1496
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:46.543
let's just,

1497
01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:46.791
but,

1498
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:47.624
but here's the idea.

1499
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.010
It is possible that they are right.

1500
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.900
It is actually possible and there's no,

1501
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:58.930
I have no evidence against it that having meals with your kids makes them into

1502
01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:00.620
good drug free,

1503
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:02.900
non promiscuous non-drinking kids.

1504
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.071
Of course.

1505
01:01:04.071 --> 01:01:05.360
It's equally possible.

1506
01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.680
It's the other way around.

1507
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:12.100
If little Johnny is kind of is out there smoking pot and,

1508
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.940
and cavorting with prostitutes and,

1509
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:15.450
and,

1510
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:15.721
and,

1511
01:01:15.721 --> 01:01:17.150
and stuff like that,

1512
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.100
he's not going to come home for a family meal.

1513
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:20.390
It's the other way around.

1514
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:20.541
Well,

1515
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:21.680
if he's a good kid,

1516
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.750
he might be more likely to have a family meal.

1517
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.970
So the direction it might actually be,

1518
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.740
not family meals,

1519
01:01:27.741 --> 01:01:28.790
make good kids,

1520
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.550
but writ rather good kids stick around the house.

1521
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:33.530
They have nothing better to do and have meals with mum and dad.

1522
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.130
Another possibility is

1523
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.400
there's good families and bad family's.

1524
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:44.060
A good family is likely to have drug free kids and a family meal.

1525
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:47.420
A bad family is likely of stone kids and no family meal.

1526
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:48.681
So there may be,

1527
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:51.470
there's an effect of the parents that had nothing to do with the family meal.

1528
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:55.220
Here's the even weirder part.

1529
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.620
They didn't factor out age.

1530
01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.180
So think about this.

1531
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.990
Their sample included children ranging from 12 to 17.

1532
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:03.561
Well,

1533
01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:05.090
let me tell you something about 12 year olds.

1534
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:08.450
12 year olds don't do,

1535
01:02:08.451 --> 01:02:11.450
is a lot of drugs and likely to eat with their family.

1536
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:16.280
17 year olds are stoned all the time and they don't eat with their family.

1537
01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.470
Um,

1538
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.280
I've just be gone on this study.

1539
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:20.940
Uh,

1540
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.610
but the point is when you hear something like,

1541
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.580
so now take something which you may be more likely to believe,

1542
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.540
maybe you will either having parents who read to their kids that's good for

1543
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:31.374
their kids.

1544
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.100
Well maybe it is,

1545
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:40.970
but most of these criticisms apply to that study to a bookish kid is more likely

1546
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.690
to get his parents to read to them.

1547
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:44.540
A good family.

1548
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.010
Parents who are good parents in general are more likely to do all sorts of good

1549
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:55.011
things that our kids and have good kids besides take another case to the so

1550
01:02:55.891 --> 01:02:57.300
called cycle of violence.

1551
01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:57.961
Yes,

1552
01:02:57.961 --> 01:02:58.794
it's true.

1553
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.720
Parents who smack their kids tend to have statistically more violent kids,

1554
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.890
but maybe the causality goes the other way around.

1555
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.710
Maybe if you have a kid who's a troublemaker,

1556
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.470
you're more likely to smack them maybe,

1557
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.180
which seems to be entirely likely.

1558
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:20.130
The propensity for violence is to some extent heritable and so even if the,

1559
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.830
if the kid was not raised by the smacking parents,

1560
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.260
whatever properties of that parent caused him,

1561
01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.080
led to the violence got inherited by the kid.

1562
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.550
Now again,

1563
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:32.160
this doesn't going to sit right for you.

1564
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:32.970
And I've had,

1565
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:35.070
I put this down because last year when I gave this talk,

1566
01:03:35.071 --> 01:03:36.900
people ran up to me and told me this.

1567
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:37.480
They said,

1568
01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:37.980
look,

1569
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.290
I know my mum dad had a huge role in my life.

1570
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.390
That's why I'm so happy and successful.

1571
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.950
Then other people said,

1572
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.930
that's why I'm so miserable and screwed up.

1573
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.820
But either way,

1574
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.270
blame it on mom and dad or thank mum and dad.

1575
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:53.341
And you might think,

1576
01:03:53.341 --> 01:03:54.174
you know,

1577
01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:55.530
when you become famous,

1578
01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.270
you stand up and you get your awards.

1579
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.770
Maybe you'll thank you mum and dad.

1580
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:02.520
When you go to your therapist and explain why you're so screwed up,

1581
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.450
maybe you'll blamed.

1582
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:05.550
He never took root my baseball game.

1583
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.260
Well maybe,

1584
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:09.000
maybe,

1585
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.260
but you don't know.

1586
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:12.743
We adopted.

1587
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.180
If you weren't adopted,

1588
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:20.100
you can't even begin to have the conversation about how your parents messed you

1589
01:04:20.101 --> 01:04:20.310
up.

1590
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:21.840
Because if you're a lot like your parents,

1591
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.340
you might be a lot like your parents.

1592
01:04:23.341 --> 01:04:24.240
Did you share their genes?

1593
01:04:24.241 --> 01:04:25.770
Of course you resemble your parents.

1594
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:26.760
Um,

1595
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.391
moreover,

1596
01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:32.391
how do you figure out which is the cause in which is the fact no mom's smack me

1597
01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:33.120
a lot.

1598
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.070
And that's why I turned out to be such a rotten person.

1599
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.470
Or maybe she smacked you cause you were rotten.

1600
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:38.220
I mean,

1601
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:38.730
no,

1602
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:39.690
I don't want to get personal,

1603
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.610
but it's very difficult to pull these things apart.

1604
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.540
I'm a final point on this

1605
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:52.050
one.

1606
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.780
One response to Harris's book is this,

1607
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:55.710
look,

1608
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:56.940
even if this is true,

1609
01:04:56.941 --> 01:05:01.800
you shouldn't let this get out because if parents don't molar children's

1610
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:02.790
personalities,

1611
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.060
maybe why should they treat their kids nicely?

1612
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:09.240
And you might be wondering is you might be thinking,

1613
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:10.163
well gee,

1614
01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:12.960
if you don't have any effect on how your kids turn out,

1615
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.913
um,

1616
01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.340
why be nice to them.

1617
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.183
But there are,

1618
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:19.900
you might want to be nice to them because you love them.

1619
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.380
You might want to be nice to them because you want them to be happy.

1620
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:27.100
You might want to be nice to them because you want to have good relationships

1621
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.053
with them.

1622
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.100
And I have a little bit more,

1623
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:33.190
but I'm going to skip it and I'm going to move right to your reading response,

1624
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:33.971
which is very,

1625
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:34.840
very simple,

1626
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.441
easy to,

1627
01:05:35.441 --> 01:05:36.221
easy to answer,

1628
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:37.054
easy to grave.

1629
01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:39.130
Explain the Flynn effect.

1630
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.051
It's a toughy.

1631
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:42.070
So just explain that.

1632
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:43.403
Um,

1633
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:44.973
okay.

1634
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.160
Have a wonderful spring break and I'll see you when you get back.
