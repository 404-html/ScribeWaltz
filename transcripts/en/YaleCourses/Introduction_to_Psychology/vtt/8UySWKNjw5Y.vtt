1
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.670
On Monday we presented,

2
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:19.671
I presented an introduction to evolutionary psychology to looking at psychology

3
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:25.500
from evolutionary perspective and trying to make a case and give some examples

4
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.860
of how it can help illuminate and illustrate certain aspects of how the mind

5
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.064
works.

6
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.430
One of the advantages of an evolutionary perspective on the mind is that it

7
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.980
forces us to,

8
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.814
um,

9
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.750
to look scientifically at what we were otherwise take for granted.

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.430
There are a lot of aspects of how we are and what we are and what we do that

11
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:52.230
seems so natural to us.

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.290
They come so instinctively and easily.

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.550
It's difficult and sort of unnatural to step back and explore them

14
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.390
scientifically.

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.680
Um,

16
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.100
but if we're going to be scientists and look at the mind from a scientific

17
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:05.934
perspective,

18
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
we have to get this sort of distance from ourselves and ask questions that other

19
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.600
people would not normally think to ask.

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.700
And the clearest case of this,

21
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.563
um,

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.330
arises with the emotions.

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.790
And as a starting point,

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.660
uh,

25
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.340
there's a lovely quote from the psychologist and philosopher William James,

26
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:27.570
I didn't want to begin with.

27
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.510
So he writes to the psychologist alone,

28
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.250
can such questions occur as,

29
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.100
why do we smile when please did not scour?

30
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.630
Why are we unable to talk to a crowd as we talked to a single friend,

31
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.900
why does a particular maiden turn our wits upside down?

32
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.520
The common man,

33
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.620
none of you are the common man.

34
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.420
The common man can only say,

35
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.740
of course we smile.

36
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.221
Of course,

37
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.050
our heart palpitates at the site of the crowd.

38
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.741
Of course,

39
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:57.360
we love the maiden and so probably does each animal feel a bit of taking their

40
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:57.661
things.

41
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.690
It tends to do in the presence of certain objects to the lion.

42
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.780
It is the lioness which is made to be loved to the beer,

43
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:05.730
the she bear to the broody.

44
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.450
Hen.

45
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.840
The notion would probably see monsters that there should be a creature in the

46
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:13.890
world whom a nest full of eggs was not the utterly fascinating and precious and

47
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:15.930
never to be too much sat upon object,

48
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.130
which it is to her.

49
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.391
Now,

50
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.330
there's a few things to note about this passage.

51
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.691
First,

52
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:23.010
it's incredibly sexist.

53
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.280
It assumes a not just merely in reflective use of phrases.

54
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.050
It assumes that William James,

55
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:29.150
as soon as he's talking to,

56
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.690
to,

57
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.030
uh,

58
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.810
males,

59
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.130
male humans who sometimes take the perspective of male bears and,

60
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:35.964
um,

61
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.741
and,

62
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:38.490
and so it assumes a male audience.

63
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.480
You wouldn't normally,

64
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.310
you wouldn't actually ever write this way.

65
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.750
Um,

66
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.620
a second point is it's beautifully written and you're not awesome.

67
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:48.540
I allowed to write that way anymore either.

68
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.350
Um,

69
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.850
it's poetic and lyrical.

70
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.240
And if a William James Characteristically writes that way,

71
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.781
um,

72
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:58.230
I think he writes so much better than his brother Henry James and obscure

73
00:02:58.231 --> 00:02:59.064
novelist.

74
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.023
Um,

75
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.800
finally though,

76
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.350
the point that he makes is a terrific one,

77
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.910
which is,

78
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.743
yes,

79
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.450
all of these things seem natural to us,

80
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.440
but the reason why they seem natural is not because they are in some sense

81
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.730
necessary or logical truth.

82
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.451
Rather,

83
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.780
they emerged from contingent aspects of our biological nature.

84
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.073
Um,

85
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.920
and so we need to step back.

86
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.461
We actually,

87
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.140
we need to step back and ask questions like,

88
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:30.700
and these are questions we're gonna ask.

89
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.660
Um,

90
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.250
why does poop smell bad?

91
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.580
Avoid the temptation to say,

92
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.971
well,

93
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.520
poop smells bad because it's so stinky.

94
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.290
This thinking is of poop is not an irreducible factor,

95
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.060
but the universe rather,

96
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.710
the sneakiness of poop is a fact about human psychology to a dung beetle.

97
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.150
Poop smells just fine.

98
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.950
Why does chocolate tastes good?

99
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.881
Well,

100
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.361
chocolate,

101
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:55.690
the ta,

102
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.690
the good tastiness of chocolate isn't some necessary fact about the world.

103
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.560
It's a fact of our minds that doesn't hold true for many other creatures.

104
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
And so we have to step back and ask why to us do we find chocolate appealing?

105
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.540
Why do we love our children?

106
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.060
Don't say they're lovable.

107
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.560
Many of them are not.

108
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.813
And,

109
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.553
and,

110
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.490
and as William James points out,

111
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.453
every animal,

112
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.181
most animals,

113
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.830
many animals love their children.

114
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.810
They think their children are precious and wonderful.

115
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.763
Why?

116
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.790
Um,

117
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.710
why do we get angry when people hit us?

118
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.430
Suppose somebody walked up to you and slap you in the face.

119
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.860
You'd be afraid you'd be angry.

120
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.323
Would you?

121
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.340
Would you get sleepy?

122
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.270
You feel,

123
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.710
feel nostalgic,

124
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.980
suddenly desire some cold soup?

125
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.660
No.

126
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.190
Those are stupid alternatives.

127
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.851
Of course,

128
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:52.900
if somebody slapped us,

129
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.560
you would,

130
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.720
we would get angry or afraid.

131
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.123
Why?

132
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.633
Um,

133
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.840
why do we feel good when someone does us a favor?

134
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.770
Why don't we feel angry?

135
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.540
Why don't we feel fearful?

136
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.370
What we're going to do throughout this course is step back and ask these

137
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:12.761
questions.

138
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:16.210
We're gonna ask questions nobody would have otherwise thought to ask where the

139
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:17.044
common man,

140
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.273
um,

141
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.570
wouldn't address.

142
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.620
And this is of course,

143
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.750
standard in all the sciences.

144
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.440
Um,

145
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.740
the,

146
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.460
the,

147
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.460
the first step to insight is to ask questions like why do the things fall down

148
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.790
and not up?

149
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.230
And I imagine the first person who articulated the question aloud probably met

150
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:36.100
with the response saying,

151
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.600
what a stupid question.

152
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.800
Of course things fall down.

153
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.730
Oh yes,

154
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.020
of course things fall down,

155
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.153
but why?

156
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.760
Um,

157
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.050
why is our flesh warm?

158
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.620
Why does water turned solid when it gets cold?

159
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.260
These are natural facts about the universe,

160
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:54.040
but the naturalness needs to be explained and not merely assumed.

161
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.180
In this class,

162
00:05:55.181 --> 00:06:00.181
we're going to explore throughout course what seems natural to us and try to

163
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.150
make sense of it and to that.

164
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.710
And to that end,

165
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.560
we have to ask questions that you wouldn't normally ask.

166
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.710
We've already done this to some extent with domains such as visual perception,

167
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.943
memory,

168
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.580
language and rationality.

169
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.020
But now we're going to move to the case where it's maybe even somewhat more

170
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.880
difficult to do this.

171
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.250
And I want to start dealing with their emotions.

172
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.660
Um,

173
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.250
we're going to talk about their emotions,

174
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.330
why they exist,

175
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.290
what they're there for,

176
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:31.370
and how they work.

177
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.780
I want to start off with the wrong theory of emotions.

178
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.120
And the wrong theory of the emotions is beautifully illustrated in a television

179
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.050
and movie series,

180
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:42.884
Star Trek.

181
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.053
Um,

182
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.523
in,

183
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.920
in this alternatives fantasy world,

184
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.330
there are characters,

185
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.170
um,

186
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.170
ms Mr Spock and original star trek data in one of the spinoffs who are described

187
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.280
as competent,

188
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.570
capable.

189
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.051
In fact,

190
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:04.130
many ways super competent and super capable people,

191
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.700
but they're described as not having emotions.

192
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.930
Spock is described as not having emotion cause he's half Vulcan from a planet

193
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.190
where they lack emotions.

194
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.910
Um,

195
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.790
data is an android who has said to lack an emotion chip.

196
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.100
This lack of emotions on us,

197
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.990
on a TV series does not hurt them much.

198
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.850
They're able to fully function.

199
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.621
And in fact,

200
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.770
in a TV series,

201
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.700
um,

202
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.740
emotions are often seen as a detriment.

203
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.330
You do better off without them.

204
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.530
And there are many people in sort of common sense might think,

205
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.220
Gee,

206
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.650
if only I could just use my rationality,

207
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.830
think reasonably and rationally and not let my emotions guide my behavior,

208
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.340
I'd be much better off.

209
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.720
It turns out that this is a notion of how to think about the emotions that is

210
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.150
deeply wrong and in fact makes no sense at all.

211
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.610
I'm using the example of Star Trek Steven pinker in his book,

212
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.940
how the mind works nicely illustrates the problem here.

213
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.553
He writes,

214
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.840
spark must've been driven by some motives or goals.

215
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.370
Something must have led him to explore strange new worlds,

216
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:17.240
to seek out new civilizations and to boldly go where no man had gone before.

217
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.990
Presumably it was intellectual curiosity that set them to drive and solve

218
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:21.824
problems.

219
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.693
Um,

220
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.510
it was,

221
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.140
um,

222
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.110
solidarity with his allies that,

223
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:30.410
that led him to be such a competent and brave officer.

224
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.220
What would he have done if attacked by a Predator or an invading clean on?

225
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.200
Did he do a handstand,

226
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.000
solved a four color map theorem,

227
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.700
presumably a part of his brain,

228
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.840
quickly mobilized his faculties to scope out how to flee and had to take steps

229
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:49.430
to avoid the vulnerable predicament in the future.

230
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.181
That is,

231
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:51.230
he had fear.

232
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.860
Swath did not walk around naked around the ship.

233
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.960
Presumably he felt modesty.

234
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.970
He got out of bed,

235
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.220
presumably he had some ambitions and drive.

236
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.340
He engaged in conversations presumably at some social interests without emotions

237
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:08.401
to drive us.

238
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:10.020
We would do nothing at all.

239
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.050
And you could illustrate this scientifically.

240
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.160
Creatures like swack and data don't exist in the real world,

241
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.640
but there are unusual and unfortunate cases where people lose to some extent or

242
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.160
another,

243
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.720
their emotions and you could look at these people and see what happens to them.

244
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.700
The classic case,

245
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.470
the most famous case is that of a man called Phineas gage.

246
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.890
Phineas gage is the classic intro psych example.

247
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.100
Extremely poor guy portion.

248
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.283
Um,

249
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.810
in 1848,

250
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:47.190
he was a construction foreman.

251
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.880
In 1848 he was working at a site with explosion explosives and iron rods and due

252
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:57.210
to an explosion,

253
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.240
an iron rod pass through his head like so imagine that rod shooting upwards.

254
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.830
It went under his eye and popped out the top of his head.

255
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.500
It landed about a hundred feet away,

256
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.780
covered with blood and brains.

257
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.440
The rod itself weighed 13 pounds.

258
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.253
Um,

259
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.210
amazingly gage was not killed.

260
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.771
In fact,

261
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:25.440
he was knocked unconscious only for a short period.

262
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.030
And then he got up and his friends surrounded him and asked,

263
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.910
are you okay?

264
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:31.561
And they,

265
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:31.860
uh,

266
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.680
and then they took him to the hospital on the way that a hospital,

267
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:39.350
they stopped by a tavern and he had a little pint of cider drink,

268
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.680
sat down to talk to people.

269
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.910
And um,

270
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.591
and then he had,

271
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:43.560
he had an infection,

272
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.580
had to have surgery,

273
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.970
but when it's all said and done,

274
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:48.781
he wasn't blind.

275
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:49.680
He wasn't deaf,

276
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.320
didn't lose language and become APHASIC,

277
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.060
no paralysis,

278
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.560
no retardation

279
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.171
in some sense.

280
00:10:58.171 --> 00:10:59.910
What happened was much worse.

281
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:00.841
He,

282
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:01.674
um,

283
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.210
he lost his character.

284
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.530
Here's a description at the time of what gauge was like.

285
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.650
And this is from Damasio's.

286
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.663
Excellent book,

287
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.080
Descartes' error.

288
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.213
Um,

289
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.010
used to be a really responsible guy,

290
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:17.970
a family man,

291
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.590
very reliable,

292
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:20.580
very trustworthy.

293
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.150
But after the accident he was fitful,

294
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:25.080
irreverent,

295
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.760
indulging at times and a gross is profanity manifesting,

296
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:32.010
but little deference for his fellows.

297
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.710
Impatient of restraint or advice.

298
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.813
Um,

299
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.360
a child in his intellectual capacities and manifestations.

300
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.000
He had an animal pleasures of a strong man.

301
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.120
His foul language is so debased that women are advised not to stay long in his

302
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:49.404
presence.

303
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.090
Um,

304
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.890
and he couldn't hold a job.

305
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.490
He lost his family,

306
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.870
couldn't hold a job.

307
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.400
He ended up in the circus.

308
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.110
He was in a circus going around the country with his big iron rod,

309
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.350
telling everybody the story as they surrounded in clap.

310
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:06.743
Um,

311
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.680
there are other cases,

312
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.800
like Phineas gage cases where people have had damage to that same part of the

313
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:15.214
brain,

314
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.901
parts of the,

315
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.220
of the frontal cortex.

316
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.443
Um,

317
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.570
and what they've lost is they basically lost a good part of their emotions.

318
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.700
And what this means is they don't really care that much about things.

319
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.410
They can't prioritize.

320
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.640
Dimassio tells a case of one of his patients who were,

321
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:41.641
who was under the pseudo name here of Elliot and Elliot had a tumor in his

322
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.370
frontal lobe and the tumor had to be removed.

323
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:47.920
And with it came a lot of Elliot's frontal lobe.

324
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.233
And again,

325
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.670
as a result of this,

326
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.540
Elliot was not struck blind or deaf or retarded and he didn't become the sort of

327
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.900
profane character that Phineas gage became.

328
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.401
But he,

329
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:01.234
um,

330
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.520
he lost the ability to prioritize.

331
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:04.990
He lost the ability to set goals.

332
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.000
Damasio describes him here,

333
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.623
um,

334
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.650
at his job,

335
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.370
um,

336
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.210
at an activity he would read and fully understand the significance and the

337
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:16.541
material.

338
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:17.620
He works in an office.

339
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.753
Um,

340
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.500
but the problem was he was likely all of a sudden to turn from your task.

341
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.830
He had initiated to doing something else and spending an entire day doing that.

342
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.180
He might spend an entire afternoon deliberating on which principal of

343
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:33.640
categorization he should apply to files,

344
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.630
should it be the day or the size of the document pertinent to the case or

345
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:38.464
another.

346
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.870
He couldn't set his goals.

347
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:41.740
He couldn't,

348
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.750
he ended up not being able to keep a job,

349
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.340
not being able to deal with people.

350
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.510
And these are not men who have lost her emotions.

351
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.040
There is no case around,

352
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.880
we could tie,

353
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.830
have your emotions entirely blotted out,

354
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.150
but they lost a large part of their emotional capacity.

355
00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.500
And as a result,

356
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.630
their rationality failed emotion,

357
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.110
set goals and establish priorities.

358
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.180
And with Elac Numb,

359
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.980
you wouldn't do anything.

360
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.150
You couldn't do anything.

361
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.430
You desire to come to class,

362
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:13.264
to study,

363
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.500
to go out with friends,

364
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:15.700
to read a book,

365
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.121
to,

366
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.560
to raise a family,

367
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.191
to be,

368
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.024
to be,

369
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.080
to do anything.

370
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.710
Our priorities set by your emotions.

371
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.370
Life would be impossible without those emotions.

372
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:28.960
Um,

373
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.840
and so there's a certain themes we're going to explore here.

374
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.980
The first is this,

375
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:37.270
that emotions are basically mechanisms that set goals and priorities.

376
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.010
And when a talk a lot about in this class and next class about universals,

377
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.690
um,

378
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.250
we're also going to talk about culture.

379
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.140
It turns out that culture is different cultures including differences between

380
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.870
America in Japan and the American south in American north have somewhat

381
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:00.950
different emotional triggers and emotional baselines to respond to.

382
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.710
But at the same time as Darwin,

383
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:08.711
well new emotions have universal routes that are shared across all humans and

384
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:10.880
across many animals.

385
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.360
So the agenda for this class and next class is going to go like this.

386
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.370
First I want to talk a little bit about facial expressions,

387
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.580
which are ways in which we communicate our emotions,

388
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:23.900
not the only way.

389
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.700
What an important way and look in particular at the case of smiling cause it's

390
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:29.540
kind of interesting.

391
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.500
Then I want to look at one case study of a non social emotion.

392
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.760
That of fear.

393
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.780
I wanted them deal with feelings towards our kin.

394
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.570
People were genetically related to and then,

395
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:43.010
and this will take us to next class,

396
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.560
feelings towards non Kim.

397
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.663
Okay.

398
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.980
So first faces and as an introduction to face is I have a brief film clip from

399
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:55.580
Paul Ekman who's one of the world's great scholars in the study of facial

400
00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:56.414
expressions

401
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.290
and that Cummins work.

402
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.180
He presents us with instructions

403
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.320
on how to make different faces and identify faces.

404
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.400
Ekman actually has a sort of more practical career long for scientific career.

405
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.480
He trains police and secret service members to them too.

406
00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:17.780
I did to try to figure out cues to honesty and dishonesty.

407
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.310
It was a very interesting New Yorker profile on him by Malcolm Gladwell a few

408
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.311
years ago.

409
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:23.810
Some of you may be interested in,

410
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.890
but um,

411
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.150
let's do one of his faces.

412
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.240
<v 0>Please lower your brows and draw them together.</v>

414
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.470
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

415
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.600
<v 0>that means even those who aren't making eye contact with me,</v>

416
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.580
hence your lower and upper eyelids don't pop out contact lenses,

417
00:16:48.581 --> 00:16:49.600
but just to them

418
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.990
stare your eyes can bold somewhat.

419
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.640
Okay.

420
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:57.881
Now,

421
00:16:57.881 --> 00:16:59.020
last part important.

422
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.160
Press your lips together.

423
00:17:00.161 --> 00:17:00.520
The corner.

424
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.353
Straight or down.

425
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.400
<v 1>That's good.</v>

426
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:03.701
That's good.

427
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:04.534
You got it.

428
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.733
Okay.

429
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.781
<v 0>Cause you're making,</v>

430
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:11.240
not making eye contact with me doesn't mean I can't see you.

431
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.643
Okay.

432
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.030
Well what you're looking like presumably as this and um,

433
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.381
and what,

434
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:19.640
what face is that,

435
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.860
what emotion does that correspond to?

436
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.253
Anger.

437
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:24.950
Um,

438
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.950
there's all sorts of databases of different phases from around this guy.

439
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:31.761
I don't know who he is,

440
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:32.840
but he seems to be on,

441
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.220
on a lot of these things.

442
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.000
Um,

443
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.833
but,

444
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.500
but,

445
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.730
but the thing is you don't,

446
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:38.564
um,

447
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.680
you don't need to,

448
00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:40.514
uh,

449
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.870
you don't need to rely on him.

450
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:43.310
You don't need to rely on Western faces.

451
00:17:43.311 --> 00:17:44.450
Even if you go online,

452
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.090
there's by now a lot of databases from faces,

453
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:50.160
from all sorts of genders and a national origins.

454
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.210
This is from a Japanese,

455
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.430
Japanese women facial expressions.

456
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.290
And there are some subtle and very interesting differences across countries and

457
00:17:58.291 --> 00:17:59.160
across people,

458
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.060
but there's also deep universals.

459
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.860
Um,

460
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.370
you don't have to work very hard to figure out what these different facial

461
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.130
expressions mean.

462
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.480
I want to give one more face example cause I want to focus on this a little bit.

463
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.020
Um,

464
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.070
this one's a little bit easier.

465
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.160
Raise the corners of your lips back and I please

466
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.600
<v 1>raise your cheeks.</v>

467
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.470
<v 0>Raise your lower eyelids if you can.</v>

468
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.403
The smiling,

469
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.513
you're smiling,

470
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.780
you can stop

471
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.233
<v 1>smiling.</v>

472
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.090
<v 0>Yale is actually really big on smiling.</v>

473
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:38.840
Um,

474
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.390
we have two of the world's experts on smiling.

475
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:42.200
Um,

476
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.561
this is,

477
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:43.040
uh,

478
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.600
this is the Angus Trumbull.

479
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.030
I'm the curator at the British art gallery,

480
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.840
um,

481
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.980
who wrote this wonderful book,

482
00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:50.660
a brief history of the smile,

483
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.410
um,

484
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.550
looking at a smile and art.

485
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.690
And this is my colleague,

486
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:56.510
Maryann La France who was actually not smiling in that picture,

487
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.350
but um,

488
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:02.350
but she studies smiling and smiling and adult smiling children smiling across

489
00:19:02.361 --> 00:19:06.230
cultures and the different social uses of smiling.

490
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.960
And there's some interesting discoveries people have made about smiles and about

491
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:13.400
smiles and emotions.

492
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.520
Uh,

493
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.210
one oh well one is that smiles are,

494
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:17.870
um,

495
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.770
are universal.

496
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.001
We,

497
00:19:20.001 --> 00:19:20.690
um,

498
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.680
we know for instance,

499
00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:23.090
that young children smile.

500
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.111
This is,

501
00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:24.380
uh,

502
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.570
this is my son accurate when he was younger.

503
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.651
Not,

504
00:19:27.651 --> 00:19:28.700
not that we're looking at.

505
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.503
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

506
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.833
<v 0>Thank God.</v>

507
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.910
And,

508
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.743
um,

509
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.083
and even um,

510
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.500
even blind,

511
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.820
even blind children,

512
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.190
children blind from birth will smile.

513
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.990
They'll smile appropriately.

514
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.820
Making an important point.

515
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.780
This smiling has not learned by looking at other people's faces.

516
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.020
Smiling is also not uniquely human.

517
00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.560
Nonhuman primates smile as well.

518
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.610
Smiles are social signals.

519
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.710
You might imagine that people smile when they're happy.

520
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.320
This is actually not the case.

521
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.510
It's not as simple as that.

522
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:19.120
Rather people smile when they wish to communicate happiness.

523
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.640
And we know that from several studies.

524
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.923
Um,

525
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.580
there's some studies of boulders and the studies are very nice.

526
00:20:27.581 --> 00:20:29.920
What they do is they film bowler sort of boulders,

527
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.850
do their bowling and sometimes they knocked down all the pins,

528
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.740
which is called a what?

529
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.001
A strike.

530
00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:39.880
So strict and that's good in the bowling world.

531
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:40.870
Um,

532
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.520
so they knocked down all the pins,

533
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.520
but what they don't do is they don't smile after you knocked down to pence.

534
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.631
They're being filmed.

535
00:20:46.631 --> 00:20:51.631
They don't then they turn around to their friends and give a big grant.

536
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.380
Other studies have looked at films of people who have just won Olympic gold

537
00:20:58.601 --> 00:20:59.434
medals.

538
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.473
Now,

539
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.860
not surprisingly,

540
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.280
uh,

541
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.470
people who want Olympic gold medals are very happy.

542
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.990
This is good news to win an Olympic gold medal,

543
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.760
but they don't actually stand on the podium like grinning.

544
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.280
Rather they stand there,

545
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.710
put your faces and normal expression.

546
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.010
Then when they stand up and face the crowds,

547
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.270
there's a big smile.

548
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.913
Um,

549
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.220
you can ask yourself whether during sex and activity where many people enjoy,

550
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.810
um,

551
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.390
whether or not people smile during sex.

552
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.870
And you can discover this yourself with

553
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.010
partner or a mirror.

554
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.153
Um,

555
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.583
<v 1>so,</v>

556
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.583
so,

557
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.000
<v 0>or other things we know about smiles,</v>

558
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.433
um,

559
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.600
there are different types of smiles.

560
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.040
They're actually quite a few different types of smiles that are different in

561
00:22:02.041 --> 00:22:03.300
interesting ways.

562
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.260
Um,

563
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.490
this is Paul Ekman again,

564
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.510
which one's a hat?

565
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.250
Which one's a better smile?

566
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.860
Who votes for the 100?

567
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.703
Right?

568
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.810
Who will votes for one on the left?

569
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.690
There are two different sorts of smiles.

570
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:19.933
Um,

571
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.310
the one on the right is a smile of greeting.

572
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.940
It's sometimes known as a Pan Am smile.

573
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.490
Pan Am is a now defunct airline,

574
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.570
um,

575
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.610
which had at that time they weren't,

576
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.080
you don't call them stewardesses anymore,

577
00:22:34.081 --> 00:22:35.160
but the stewardess,

578
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.320
this would come in and they would smile.

579
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.790
That was part of your job,

580
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.280
but it was a big fake smile.

581
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.780
The Pan Am's smile,

582
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.240
a smile to communicate hello.

583
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:50.450
And but it's as opposed to a smile where the communication is that of genuine

584
00:22:51.271 --> 00:22:51.990
happiness.

585
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.820
The differences around the eyes.

586
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.411
It's not the mouth,

587
00:22:55.411 --> 00:22:56.280
it's the eyes.

588
00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.270
Um,

589
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.650
I real happiness,

590
00:22:58.651 --> 00:22:59.484
smile.

591
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.640
What's known as a Duchenne smile after a neurophysiologist who studied it

592
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.560
involves moving the eyes.

593
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.920
What's interesting is about only one out of every 10 people can fake a Duchenne

594
00:23:14.131 --> 00:23:14.964
smile.

595
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:21.350
So if you smile at somebody and you just hate their guts,

596
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.100
but you want to smile at them,

597
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.010
um,

598
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.880
it's unless you're quite gifted,

599
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.970
it's difficult to fake a really good,

600
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.040
really happy smile.

601
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.693
Um,

602
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.791
you could say it's,

603
00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:38.070
it's not difficult to study smiles in the real world.

604
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.700
Um,

605
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.620
you can look at politicians for instance.

606
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.011
Um,

607
00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:45.380
politicians are often in context where they have to smile lot.

608
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.250
Um,

609
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.000
and what they do is they simply give the Pan Am smile,

610
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.020
the mouth moves up.

611
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:52.010
Particularly if somebody is,

612
00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:52.370
you know,

613
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.740
it's hacking or record our are ridiculing know,

614
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.660
and they'll smile and,

615
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.160
but it's not as sincere smile.

616
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:59.150
The eyes don't move.

617
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.650
My favorite example of this was a few years ago when there was a huge battle for

618
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:04.484
the house,

619
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:10.090
the House majority leader and a guy named a Republican named John Bonner one.

620
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.360
This position,

621
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.020
I'm in quite a heated battle and it took a picture of the guy.

622
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.460
This is not very nice there.

623
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:16.971
The visual guy,

624
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:17.804
Roy Blunt,

625
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.410
as he stepped out and he had lost and this was his expression

626
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.350
<v 1>and you know,</v>

627
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.630
<v 0>he's not really very happy</v>

628
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.350
as opposed to a smile like this,

629
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.760
which is a real smile.

630
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.703
So,

631
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.000
so you have two sorts of smiles that are real happiness,

632
00:24:42.001 --> 00:24:43.330
smile and,

633
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:43.650
and,

634
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.820
and a Duchenne smile called also known as the Duchenne smile.

635
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:49.711
And then,

636
00:24:49.711 --> 00:24:50.544
um,

637
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.081
uh,

638
00:24:52.081 --> 00:24:53.910
Pan Am's smile or greeting smile.

639
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.050
And you'll use each of those smiles at different points in your day,

640
00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:58.950
in your life.

641
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.880
It turns out the DS,

642
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.040
the DS,

643
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.010
different smiles have real psychological validity.

644
00:25:05.011 --> 00:25:10.011
They seem to sort of reflect deep differences in your mood and emotions and Fox,

645
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.183
um,

646
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.570
10 month olds for instance,

647
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.790
give different sorts of smiles.

648
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:15.660
Um,

649
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.670
when their mother approaches there,

650
00:25:17.671 --> 00:25:19.200
they give a real happiness smile.

651
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.300
Then when a stranger approaches or someone else approaches there,

652
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.140
it will tend to give more of a greeting smile.

653
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.950
Uh,

654
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.900
John Gottman studied married couples and John Gottman does a lot of work where

655
00:25:30.901 --> 00:25:35.901
what he does is he looks at film and clips of couples and by analyzing the film

656
00:25:37.021 --> 00:25:37.854
clips,

657
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.180
he tries to predict,

658
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.070
well their marriages survive.

659
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.470
And one of his cues,

660
00:25:43.471 --> 00:25:45.000
there's different queues incidentally,

661
00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.140
sort of side topic.

662
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.160
Um,

663
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.000
did the death knell for a marriage for Gottman,

664
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.170
this is his big finding.

665
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.050
It's not if they fight a lot,

666
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.820
it's not a scream at each other.

667
00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.510
It's not even if they hate each other,

668
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.170
the death knell of a marriage is contempt.

669
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.750
And so if he,

670
00:26:06.751 --> 00:26:07.920
if he shows these clips,

671
00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:08.520
you know,

672
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:08.880
you know,

673
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.700
I walk in honey,

674
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.640
I'm home and my spouse goes,

675
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:12.870
the look of contempt.

676
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.663
It's bad sign.

677
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.300
But another clue is the sort of smiles they give when they see each other when

678
00:26:20.701 --> 00:26:21.810
they walk into the lab.

679
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.730
If it's a true happiness smile,

680
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.940
that's actually bodes better for,

681
00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:27.330
um,

682
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.840
the relationship then a pan am or greeting smile.

683
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.243
Finally,

684
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.210
studies haven't been done at college yearbook photos,

685
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.650
looking at people.

686
00:26:37.651 --> 00:26:39.330
I'm 30 years later.

687
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.240
And it turns out that there's a correlation,

688
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:47.690
a reliable relationship between how happy somebody is now and back 30 years ago

689
00:26:49.491 --> 00:26:50.670
near Yearbook photo.

690
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.350
What sort of smile they're giving.

691
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.660
There's some evidence for a third sort of smile.

692
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.150
This is known as a coy smile or an appeasement smile.

693
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.823
Um,

694
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.100
this is sort of a very specialized sort of smile.

695
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.540
This is a smile.

696
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:10.560
Um,

697
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.760
I've embarrassment or stress you give it when,

698
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:15.594
um,

699
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.560
when,

700
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.840
when you want people to like you,

701
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.950
you want to join him,

702
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.710
you want to make people feel positive about you,

703
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.330
but you were in sort of a high stress situation often with some sort of risk.

704
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.100
And what you do is you sort of,

705
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.240
you sort of,

706
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.073
uh,

707
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:31.770
you,

708
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.461
you turn away,

709
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:33.570
there's no eye contact.

710
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:35.460
You turn away and kind of give this,

711
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.980
and this actually shows up in other primates.

712
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.330
Here's a nice picture.

713
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.103
Um,

714
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.940
so the reason is Munkee bites her own infant and infant gives a screen and then

715
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.620
this submissive Koi smile.

716
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.280
Um,

717
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.110
and it also shows up in human infants.

718
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:53.630
Here's a nice clip of a Koi baby smile.

719
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.473
Walk you through it.

720
00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.130
Um,

721
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.963
the baby,

722
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.103
um,

723
00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.963
being approached.

724
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.480
I was like this and then the version.

725
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.550
Yeah.

726
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.050
Babies are babies are cute.

727
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.193
Um,

728
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.360
any questions at this point about smiling?

729
00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

730
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.220
<v 0>What are your smiling questions?</v>

731
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.663
Yeah,

732
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.923
it's a good question.

733
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.400
I don't know.

734
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.580
There's evidence that the Koi smile shows up in non,

735
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.660
the question was do nonhuman primates give the same,

736
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.500
the same smiles that humans do,

737
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.390
such as the distinction between,

738
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.200
um,

739
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.240
the Pan Am smile,

740
00:28:40.241 --> 00:28:43.250
a greeting smile versus a genuine smile of happiness?

741
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.120
I don't know.

742
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.620
I'll find out for you for next class though.

743
00:28:45.621 --> 00:28:46.454
That's a good question.

744
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.163
Yeah,

745
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.450
come.

746
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.560
Some people smiles are better than other people's smiles.

747
00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.000
How come some people smiles are better than other people's smiles?

748
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.930
Um,

749
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:57.660
you know,

750
00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.830
the non interesting psychological answers.

751
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.760
Some people are better looking and there's more,

752
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.170
more thing but,

753
00:29:03.171 --> 00:29:03.411
but,

754
00:29:03.411 --> 00:29:06.080
but the deeper answer is some people are,

755
00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:06.914
um,

756
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.010
are better able to smile.

757
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:15.140
Some people are better able to use the cues to express true happiness.

758
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.190
There's something else about smiles which is going to come up with what's your

759
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:19.701
question?

760
00:29:19.701 --> 00:29:20.301
Raises,

761
00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:21.050
I think,

762
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:26.050
which is gonna come up in when we talk about emotional contagion and asking you

763
00:29:27.201 --> 00:29:28.490
some issues of morality.

764
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.490
Smiles are extremely contagious.

765
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.800
So what I'd like people to do,

766
00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:35.120
if you're sitting next to somebody,

767
00:29:35.121 --> 00:29:35.720
please,

768
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.560
please turn around and find someone next to you and look at them.

769
00:29:39.561 --> 00:29:40.191
Don't do anything.

770
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:41.024
Just look at them.

771
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.170
Look at them.

772
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.030
Whoever's being looked at,

773
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:43.864
looked back.

774
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:44.763
This is not.

775
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.323
Please,

776
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.240
please arbitrarily decide,

777
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.110
okay.

778
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.920
Please arbitrarily decide on the smiler that will be no,

779
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:54.461
not at me.

780
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:55.120
At each other.

781
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.350
Yeah.

782
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.183
<v 1>MMM.</v>

783
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.020
<v 0>And that will be the person.</v>

784
00:29:59.021 --> 00:29:59.470
If you are,

785
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.450
if you are unable to resolve this dispute,

786
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:01.631
yes,

787
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:01.971
you too.

788
00:30:01.971 --> 00:30:02.804
Please.

789
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.720
If you aren't able to resolve this dispute,

790
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.060
the person to the right of me will be a smiler.

791
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.551
So look at each other.

792
00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:10.480
Expressionless

793
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.160
now the person who's the mandated smiler on three,

794
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.210
please smile.

795
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:20.463
One,

796
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.333
two,

797
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.233
three.

798
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

799
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.950
Worst class demo ever.

800
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.153
Um,

801
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.943
but

802
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.120
<v 0>if one could imagine more restraints,</v>

803
00:30:41.121 --> 00:30:42.020
circumstances,

804
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.560
it is actually extremely difficult to,

805
00:30:45.561 --> 00:30:46.394
um,

806
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.870
to be facing somebody who's really smiling at you and not smile.

807
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.460
This is true,

808
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.323
by the way,

809
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.160
for virtually every other emotions.

810
00:30:55.310 --> 00:31:00.310
The phenomena is known as emotional contagion where if you're facing somebody

811
00:31:00.801 --> 00:31:05.180
for instance and there they look at you in a phase of absolute rage,

812
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:11.080
it is very difficult to just sit there about your own face molding in a core to

813
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:15.500
their own and the reasons why this happens and how that works.

814
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.150
It's something we'll talk about later on.

815
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.133
<v 1>So that's</v>

816
00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:22.751
one more question.

817
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:23.584
Yes.

818
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.960
People smiling in their teeth.

819
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:33.490
<v 0>I don't know if that's the question is is there a devotee smiling like with your</v>

820
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.810
t uh,

821
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.620
versus just your lips closed?

822
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.340
Um,

823
00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.470
there probably is.

824
00:31:38.471 --> 00:31:40.250
That's not a main smile difference,

825
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:44.000
but my bet is that there probably is a difference.

826
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.600
And my bet also is that that sort of distinction,

827
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.560
how much teeth you show when you smile is the sort of thing that will feel

828
00:31:51.561 --> 00:31:54.710
regional and country by country differences.

829
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.371
For instance,

830
00:31:55.371 --> 00:31:59.240
there's been research finding that people in England smile different from people

831
00:31:59.241 --> 00:32:00.074
in the United States.

832
00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.770
And I think that those are the sort of contrast that you would expect to find

833
00:32:03.771 --> 00:32:04.940
cross cultural differences.

834
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.910
Every culture is going to have Pan Am's smiles,

835
00:32:07.911 --> 00:32:08.391
happiness,

836
00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:08.760
smiles,

837
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.593
coy smiles.

838
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.360
But the variation of that sort,

839
00:32:11.361 --> 00:32:12.410
it's something which will vary,

840
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.610
uh,

841
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:16.220
as a result of how you're raised and the people around you.

842
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.350
I want to deal with a few emotions in this class and next.

843
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:26.981
And,

844
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:27.580
um,

845
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.750
the first case study of an emotion I want to deal with is the emotion of fear.

846
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.710
And I want to deal with fear for different reasons.

847
00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:37.630
One reason is it's a basic emotion.

848
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.310
It's universal.

849
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.430
All humans habit,

850
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.450
many nonhumans probably most nonhuman species habit too.

851
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.960
And it also brings us back to the lecture on behaviors and where we talked about

852
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:54.440
classical conditioning and different theories of what people are afraid of.

853
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.473
Um,

854
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.580
it's a non social emotion.

855
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:03.890
What I mean by this is it's possible of course to be afraid of a person,

856
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.710
but unlike an emotion like gratitude,

857
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.630
it's not intrinsically social.

858
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.300
You could be afraid of falling off a cliff or something.

859
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.140
Um,

860
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.000
it has a distinctive facial expression.

861
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:14.834
Again,

862
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.441
this is,

863
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:16.274
um,

864
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.060
this is,

865
00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.260
uh,

866
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.590
a famous picture of Lee Harvey Oswald,

867
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.350
who's being assassinated by Jack Ruby.

868
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.920
And this is the detectives face standing there,

869
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.840
a mixture of fear and anger.

870
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.970
The face being drawn back in a universal expression that every human everywhere

871
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.620
would be able to recognize.

872
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.080
So the basic question to ask is,

873
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.490
what are we afraid of?

874
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.280
And the answer's a little bit interesting.

875
00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.440
We're afraid of spiders,

876
00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:47.891
snakes,

877
00:33:47.891 --> 00:33:48.221
heights,

878
00:33:48.221 --> 00:33:48.731
storms,

879
00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:49.481
large animals,

880
00:33:49.481 --> 00:33:49.901
darkness,

881
00:33:49.901 --> 00:33:50.201
blood,

882
00:33:50.201 --> 00:33:50.980
strangers,

883
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.820
humiliation,

884
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.980
deep water and the living leaving home alone.

885
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.440
And you afraid of other things too.

886
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.260
But those are big things to be afraid of.

887
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:03.310
I'm not even going to ask you if there's somebody who in this room who's not

888
00:34:03.311 --> 00:34:04.720
afraid of any of those things.

889
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.460
You're a tougher person than I am.

890
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.390
I mean,

891
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.550
these are universal fear or listeners,

892
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.133
why,

893
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.850
what do they have in common?

894
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.160
Why would you be afraid of those things?

895
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.510
And the answer is,

896
00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:17.463
and why would,

897
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:20.740
why are there so few people are afraid of guns,

898
00:34:20.741 --> 00:34:21.550
cars,

899
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.750
and electrical outlets.

900
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.113
Um,

901
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.470
the answer is not particularly surprising.

902
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:27.490
Um,

903
00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:31.330
these are things that makes ticking over there.

904
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.490
These are things that are scary in our ancestral environment.

905
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.390
More particularly.

906
00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:41.650
These are things that through the course of human evolution have been dangerous

907
00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:42.484
to us.

908
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.890
And so we're afraid of these things.

909
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.830
And not so afraid of these things.

910
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.160
Similarly for nonhuman primates.

911
00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:58.350
So chimpanzees are afraid of certain things and they could often develop phobias

912
00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.370
for certain things,

913
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.030
but the phobias,

914
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:04.440
they developed a fear as they develop or things like spiders and snakes.

915
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.190
Um,

916
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.980
there was a nice study done in urban Chicago,

917
00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:11.370
in the inner city of Chicago and they asked children,

918
00:35:11.371 --> 00:35:12.630
raised in inner city,

919
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.280
what are you most afraid of?

920
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.160
And you might think they would say,

921
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.630
I'm afraid of being shot.

922
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.860
I'm afraid of guns,

923
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.360
I'm afraid of,

924
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.200
of,

925
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.033
of um,

926
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.990
being killed by somebody being harmed by sir.

927
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:26.970
I'm afraid to be run over by a car.

928
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.580
The two biggest fears of children urban Chicago are

929
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.873
<v 1>okay</v>

930
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.940
<v 0>that snakes and spiders,</v>

931
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.190
even though many of these children had probably never seen a snake outside of a

932
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:42.600
zoo in their lives.

933
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.070
These are natural fears.

934
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.840
There's some research done by the psychologist Judy Dillo to University of

935
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:53.640
Virginia where she studying babies fears of spiders and snakes.

936
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.300
Um,

937
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.420
babies obviously who since their parents are normal,

938
00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:00.600
I have not yet seen spiders and snakes for.

939
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.810
There are various ethical reasons why you can't a show babies.

940
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.070
You can't try to construct phobias in babies of spiders and snakes.

941
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:14.490
But the research is finding using more indirect methods,

942
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.830
fines as one would expect.

943
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.250
These are what psychologists would call pre potent stimuli.

944
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.240
That is,

945
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.720
these are things that naturally elicit fear and concern.

946
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.510
And that's all I have to say about fear.

947
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

948
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.900
<v 0>I want to turn for the rest of this lecture and for next lecture next week to</v>

949
00:36:38.361 --> 00:36:43.361
the social emotions and the social emotions can be broken down into two

950
00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:44.361
categories.

951
00:36:44.361 --> 00:36:44.960
Bless you,

952
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.630
bless you.

953
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.463
Um,

954
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.860
those emotions you feel towards your 10,

955
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:55.360
towards your genetic relatives and those emotions that you feel towards the

956
00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:59.210
people you're not related to but interact with.

957
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.493
Um,

958
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.113
and

959
00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:10.080
I want to focus particularly on emotions that generate kind or altruistic

960
00:37:10.871 --> 00:37:11.704
behavior.

961
00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.250
Altruism is the biologist term meaning kindness,

962
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:20.280
generosity and evolutionary biologists have worked really hard to explain why

963
00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:25.240
animals might evolve to be kind.

964
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.480
A very old,

965
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:34.570
very wrong view of evolution is that evolution has shaped animals such that

966
00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:37.730
they're merely survival machines.

967
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.070
If so,

968
00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.290
then from an evolutionary standpoint,

969
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:47.480
any kindness towards an animal than an animal shows towards another animal is a

970
00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:48.314
mystery.

971
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.860
If evolution wired us up simply to survive,

972
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.963
then um,

973
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.620
then it's a puzzle.

974
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.660
Why animals would relate,

975
00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.060
would relate positively to other animals.

976
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.860
But of course that's not true.

977
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.620
Um,

978
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.230
here's a simple example showing it's not true.

979
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.120
Imagine two genes,

980
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.250
two sorts of animals.

981
00:38:10.251 --> 00:38:11.680
Each containing their own gene.

982
00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.240
Gna makes an animal care for its offspring.

983
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.140
Gene B makes an animal care only for itself.

984
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.440
Imagine what will happen in the next generation.

985
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.670
Plainly,

986
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:23.930
GNA will win out.

987
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.360
It's a very simple case.

988
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.170
An animal who has evolved the brain that says,

989
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:35.060
take care of your offspring will do much better from a natural selection point

990
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.050
view from an animal who has evolved the brain that says,

991
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.950
eat your offspring.

992
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.080
The animal that eats its offspring,

993
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.030
those genes are biological,

994
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:43.893
dead end.

995
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:44.740
Um,

996
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.950
what matters then is not survival per se.

997
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.380
What matters is reproduction.

998
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.170
And so that simple fact is why we would explore,

999
00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:01.230
expect animals to care for their children because children are the means through

1000
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:03.160
which genes replicate.

1001
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.800
But against a little bit richer than that.

1002
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:12.750
And this is one of the major revolutions in evolutionary biology over the last

1003
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.713
half century.

1004
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.200
Forget about the animal a bit and take another perspective.

1005
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.680
Take a perspective of the cold virus.

1006
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.500
People have been sneezing in the front row.

1007
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.001
Now you're coughing.

1008
00:39:25.001 --> 00:39:25.660
Thank you.

1009
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.493
Um,

1010
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.780
why do you sneeze when you get a cold?

1011
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.053
Here's not a

1012
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.873
point made.

1013
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.990
Um,

1014
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.411
here's,

1015
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:36.730
here's not a bad answer.

1016
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.930
You sleeves because you got all these germs inside you and your body wants to

1017
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:42.820
get their germs out so you sneeze.

1018
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.163
Um,

1019
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.460
it's not that it's totally wrong,

1020
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:45.941
but it's not,

1021
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:46.774
it's not bad.

1022
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.290
The real answer is a little bit more interesting.

1023
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.260
Don't look at it from the person's perspective.

1024
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.120
If you have a cold,

1025
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.280
try to get away from your own selfish perspective.

1026
00:39:57.281 --> 00:40:02.020
I have a cold look at it from the perspective of the cold virus.

1027
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:07.470
The cold virus has evolved just as much as you evolved and it's evolved due to

1028
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:08.171
survival.

1029
00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:09.010
And reproduction.

1030
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.060
Um,

1031
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.660
what the coal virus does is it's evolved different strategies to cause it to

1032
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:14.530
reproduce.

1033
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:18.790
And what it does is one way to reproduce is to,

1034
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:23.791
is to occupy other animals and manipulate their bodies so as to expel it from

1035
00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:27.101
this point of view.

1036
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:32.050
Then the reason why you sneeze when you have a coal is that your cold virus,

1037
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.950
the cold virus,

1038
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.330
is using your body as a tool to replicate itself from this person.

1039
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:38.950
This perspective,

1040
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.010
a person is just the germs way of making other germs.

1041
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.950
And there's tons of other examples of this.

1042
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.150
There's a,

1043
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:50.830
there's a parasite known as toxoplasmosis that lives into bodies of rats,

1044
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.140
but it gets passed on when the rats get eaten by hats and an ends up in a cat's

1045
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.780
feces and then ends up back in rats.

1046
00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.620
Um,

1047
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.100
if you are a rat and you have toxoplasmosis,

1048
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.310
you are perfectly healthy except for one thing.

1049
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.940
The toxoplasmosis rewires your brain and it makes you less afraid of cats.

1050
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:15.910
Now again,

1051
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.990
this is not some sort of bizarre quirk of a humorous God.

1052
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.950
Rather,

1053
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.960
it's because this is a perfectly,

1054
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:27.190
this is the adaptive strategy of Dipak toxoplasmosis virus.

1055
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.210
Um,

1056
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:28.631
in fact,

1057
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:33.631
a real powerful virus would skip the respiratory system altogether even better

1058
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:35.600
than a cold virus.

1059
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:40.870
What it would do is it would take over the brain and it will make people want to

1060
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:44.900
run around and have sex with other people and kissing him on the mouth.

1061
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.070
Um,

1062
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.970
and in fact,

1063
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.030
there's some evidence that this happens.

1064
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.021
There's some evidence,

1065
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:51.650
for instance,

1066
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.430
that one of the effects of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis is it

1067
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:56.870
arouses the libido,

1068
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:01.760
makes people more sexually engaged because this is part of the strategy through

1069
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:04.370
which these viruses replicate what themselves.

1070
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.750
Imagine a virus,

1071
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:06.440
for instance,

1072
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.440
that captured an animal's brain and then modify the animal's brain such that the

1073
00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:18.710
animal run out and bite other animals so as to pass on the virus.

1074
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.820
And then of course,

1075
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.380
you would call that virus.

1076
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.333
Rabies.

1077
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.980
Along these lines,

1078
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:30.010
the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins took the general step of suggesting

1079
00:42:30.301 --> 00:42:35.301
the animals are the vehicles through which genes exploit to reproduce.

1080
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.910
From this perspective,

1081
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.430
I'm an animal is just the person's,

1082
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:40.820
is,

1083
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.600
is just the gene's way of creating another animal.

1084
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:46.700
Well,

1085
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.870
as psychologists,

1086
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:51.050
what benefit does that does this way of analysis gives us,

1087
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.840
it actually can help us explain altruism.

1088
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.540
So which genes are going to survive?

1089
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.681
Well,

1090
00:42:57.681 --> 00:42:58.131
the Jesus,

1091
00:42:58.131 --> 00:43:01.100
if I was going to be the ones that make the most copies of themselves,

1092
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:05.960
animals or vehicles through which genes reproduce an animals merely to gene's

1093
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:07.460
way of making another gene,

1094
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.050
hence selfish genes will lead to out heuristic animals.

1095
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.170
Because to the extent that evolution operates at a level of the genes,

1096
00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:20.330
there's no hard and fast distinction between your own body and someone else's

1097
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.164
body.

1098
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:23.563
Um,

1099
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.330
and here's an illustration by the biologist Haldane.

1100
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.220
So Haldane was once asked,

1101
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.670
would you lay down your life for your brother?

1102
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:33.860
And he responded,

1103
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:35.503
no,

1104
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.830
but I would gladly give my life for three brothers or five nephews or nine first

1105
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:40.664
cousins.

1106
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.653
Now

1107
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.143
he's joking.

1108
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.580
You don't actually do the math if you're normal,

1109
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:47.743
but,

1110
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.600
but when he's capturing is the logic,

1111
00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:54.620
the ultimate causation of our feelings towards our kin.

1112
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:55.640
Um,

1113
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.450
our genes,

1114
00:43:56.450 --> 00:44:00.680
I've wired us up our brains up to love our children and love our Ken.

1115
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:01.880
Um,

1116
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.200
because in this way,

1117
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.320
our genes managed to replicate themselves.

1118
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.110
And in fact,

1119
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:14.590
you get his calculations by looking at genetic relatedness to genetic

1120
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:20.381
relatedness from an evolutionary standpoint affects how much you care for other

1121
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:23.220
people from the standpoint of your genes.

1122
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:29.110
You dying for the life of three brothers is an excellent compromise because the

1123
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:32.640
genes replicate by 50% more.

1124
00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:33.960
Um,

1125
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.100
if you imagined.

1126
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.840
So here's this calculations.

1127
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.610
If you imagined a choice between or is one gene that makes the animal choose to

1128
00:44:41.611 --> 00:44:46.110
die and the other gene that makes an animal choose for his brothers to die,

1129
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.200
the gene that sacrifices the body it belongs to,

1130
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.180
we'll make more copies in the future.

1131
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.450
And there's an interesting irony to this.

1132
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.050
Um,

1133
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.740
the selfish gene theory is often seen as sort of a coldblooded evolutionary

1134
00:44:58.741 --> 00:44:59.574
analysis,

1135
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.330
but it provides a scientific basis for real,

1136
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:08.331
genuine altruism for really arguing that from the standpoint of the genes,

1137
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.940
there really is no hard and fast difference between yourself and another person.

1138
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.000
From this perspective,

1139
00:45:18.001 --> 00:45:20.370
we can start to answer some interesting questions,

1140
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.700
uh,

1141
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.950
at least about nonhumans.

1142
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:22.950
Um,

1143
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.440
when a new male lion takes over a pride,

1144
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:30.650
what he does is kill older remaining cubs and any lionesses undergo spontaneous

1145
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.753
abortions.

1146
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.820
This all might seem very cruel,

1147
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.650
but from a genetic standpoint,

1148
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:38.580
it makes sense.

1149
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.753
Um,

1150
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.071
the other cubs,

1151
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:42.810
our genetic competition for him,

1152
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:44.910
they do not have his genes.

1153
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:45.990
Um,

1154
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.823
moreover,

1155
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:47.663
um,

1156
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.570
only once they're out of the way can they reproduce and copulate with the

1157
00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:52.404
females,

1158
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:58.130
the females do neuro spontaneous abortions because that's a reliable adaptive

1159
00:45:58.201 --> 00:45:59.034
trick.

1160
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:01.620
These cubs are not going to survive once they're born.

1161
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.980
So the females best strategies to get rid of them and start a new

1162
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.920
from a psychological point,

1163
00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:10.260
then animals have evolved to be nice to their kin,

1164
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.550
particularly their children.

1165
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.490
And particularly in birds and mammals.

1166
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.820
Birds and mammals invest in quality and not quantity as opposed to fishing and

1167
00:46:20.281 --> 00:46:21.114
reptiles.

1168
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.550
For birds and mammals,

1169
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.440
we don't have many kids.

1170
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:27.683
Um,

1171
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.750
but so we,

1172
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.160
we devote a huge amount of psychological energy to,

1173
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:32.994
um,

1174
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.580
to protecting the ones that we have.

1175
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.600
Moreover,

1176
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:41.100
the kids we have are vulnerable for long periods of time and require our

1177
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:41.940
resources.

1178
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.280
So there was various psychological mechanisms that this gives rise to.

1179
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.570
One is how parents or how adults in general respond to children.

1180
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.690
Another one is how children respond to parents.

1181
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.630
And I'll briefly talk about a few of these phenomena.

1182
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.090
Small animals make distress calls.

1183
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.780
Um,

1184
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.660
they chirp the Myu they bleed or they cry.

1185
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.673
This,

1186
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:18.860
the governing of a distress call is actually an extremely delicate high wire act

1187
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.970
for any young organism.

1188
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.470
From an evolutionary point of view,

1189
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.680
it has done a one hand be annoying enough to actually generate help to get

1190
00:47:28.831 --> 00:47:29.740
people to help you,

1191
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.551
to feed you,

1192
00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:31.384
to pick you up,

1193
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.400
to take you and put them next to you.

1194
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:34.931
On the other hand,

1195
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:38.080
it can't be so annoying that the people around you kill you.

1196
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.170
And so it's complicated.

1197
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.030
But from your point of view,

1198
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.340
you're wired up to respond to them.

1199
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.000
Um,

1200
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.580
that sound is at very minimum,

1201
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.990
extremely annoying.

1202
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.100
Um,

1203
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:51.431
and it's,

1204
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:52.770
and it's more noise,

1205
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.850
not only because of it's volume or pitch.

1206
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.520
It's annoying because your brains are wired,

1207
00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:02.200
upset at that baby cry is going to drive you up the wall.

1208
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:03.323
Um,

1209
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.660
on a more positive side,

1210
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.490
babies are cute.

1211
00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:07.780
Um,

1212
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.840
I got this from Google images typing in cute baby,

1213
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:16.660
getting rid of the porn and coming onto that,

1214
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.930
oh no playboy anyway.

1215
00:48:19.931 --> 00:48:20.680
Is that,

1216
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.513
um,

1217
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:23.410
and um,

1218
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.570
and do not be tempted to say,

1219
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.350
isn't it wonderful that the way nature works is that babies are cute,

1220
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.200
otherwise we would have killed him.

1221
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.350
That's not the right story if,

1222
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:39.070
if babies are not human,

1223
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.410
babies are not sort of metaphysically cue.

1224
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.580
If martians came down,

1225
00:48:42.581 --> 00:48:44.740
he Wednesday OCU baby rather there,

1226
00:48:44.741 --> 00:48:44.951
Hugh,

1227
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:46.600
because of how our brains are wired up.

1228
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:49.450
They're cute because there's certain cues,

1229
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:50.600
um,

1230
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.120
that,

1231
00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.670
that,

1232
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.190
that correspond to the way our brains work.

1233
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:55.180
Um,

1234
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.190
and in fact there's a Alizar for all mammals.

1235
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:59.590
So babies have these big protruding foreheads.

1236
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.230
I'm an upturn,

1237
00:49:01.231 --> 00:49:02.200
a little nose,

1238
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.550
chubby cheeks and big eyes.

1239
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.070
Those are the ingredients for cute.

1240
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.870
Stephen Jay Gould has a wonderful essay where he discussed this looking at the

1241
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:17.380
evolution and Mickey Mouse from Walt Disney herder make email,

1242
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:19.450
starts off as an ugly little rodents.

1243
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:25.020
Over time he gets cuter and cuter and cuter as the artist's converge on more and

1244
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:27.250
more baby like features.

1245
00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.060
Um,

1246
00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.500
studies of adults show what's known as a baby face bias.

1247
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.540
This is not unique to United States.

1248
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:35.680
The same studies have been done.

1249
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.580
Um,

1250
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.090
in a,

1251
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:42.090
in Asia you find a baby face and an adult Leonardo DiCaprio to be particularly,

1252
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:44.230
um,

1253
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.861
naive,

1254
00:49:44.861 --> 00:49:46.810
helpless kind and warm.

1255
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.233
Um,

1256
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.580
and in mock trials people have,

1257
00:49:51.581 --> 00:49:56.581
baby faces are more likely to be found innocent and people like Ben Affleck who

1258
00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:58.414
do not have.

1259
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:00.543
Now.

1260
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.460
Now one question which is going to come up for an entire lecture later on is who

1261
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.294
is sexier,

1262
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:12.160
the baby face man or testosterone than here.

1263
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:13.783
Um,

1264
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.930
and I'm going to ask actually for a vote because when returned to this,

1265
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.950
I do not,

1266
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.220
I only want the men to vote.

1267
00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:21.980
Please.

1268
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:22.813
Um,

1269
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.500
who would go for and forget if he looks like an unhappy who would go for Affleck

1270
00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:28.334
hair.

1271
00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:29.963
Okay.

1272
00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:31.940
Who would go for Leonardo.

1273
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.150
Okay.

1274
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.793
Um,

1275
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.140
the women votes would actually be more complicated.

1276
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.480
We will discuss when we get to lecture on sex.

1277
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.470
Your choice.

1278
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.170
We'll the pen on where are you are in a menstrual cycle.

1279
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.393
Now,

1280
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:50.510
so far,

1281
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.560
so far we're talking about how babies respond to 'em.

1282
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.340
We talking about our responses to babies.

1283
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.160
What about babies responses to us?

1284
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:04.910
Well,

1285
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:09.470
there's a very old theory known as the cupboard theory proposed by the

1286
00:51:09.471 --> 00:51:10.100
behaviors.

1287
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:10.970
BF Skinner,

1288
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.780
which argues that baby's attachment to their parents is because the parent

1289
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:20.180
provides food characteristically,

1290
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:20.490
you know,

1291
00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:23.210
breast milk but could be food from a bottle or whatever.

1292
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.610
And because of operant conditioning,

1293
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.650
the baby is driven towards,

1294
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:28.563
uh,

1295
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.863
the adult.

1296
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.470
An alternative theory is that a Bowlby,

1297
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.240
which is that they're drawn to their mother for comfort and social interaction

1298
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.160
as well as fear of strangers.

1299
00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.020
To test this,

1300
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.610
the psychologist Harlow performed a series of ingenious experiments with

1301
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:51.140
nonhuman primates,

1302
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.250
um,

1303
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.290
distinguishing between

1304
00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.990
what he called wire mothers and cloth mothers.

1305
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.260
And you'll see illustrations of this to follow.

1306
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.310
Why are mothers are mothers that are built that they give food.

1307
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.970
They have a little nipple attached and you can drink from it and give food to

1308
00:52:10.971 --> 00:52:11.540
the baby.

1309
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.720
And that's the baby source of food clause.

1310
00:52:13.721 --> 00:52:15.500
Mothers don't give any food.

1311
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.160
Um,

1312
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.600
but they give warmth and comfort.

1313
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.980
There was a while in the psychology department where one professor was known to

1314
00:52:21.981 --> 00:52:23.960
be extremely supportive to his students,

1315
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:24.800
um,

1316
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.320
but didn't really provide much warmth than he was known as the,

1317
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.370
the cloth mother.

1318
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:33.371
And another one was very productive in everything but provide no love.

1319
00:52:33.381 --> 00:52:34.790
And she was known as the wire mother.

1320
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:35.923
But um,

1321
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:36.451
but,

1322
00:52:36.451 --> 00:52:36.741
but anyway,

1323
00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:37.610
I'll show you the movies.

1324
00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:41.150
I have to warn you.

1325
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:45.770
This third and final movie is an example of why this research is not currently

1326
00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:46.604
done.

1327
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:47.563
Um,

1328
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.900
but,

1329
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.790
but it illustrates,

1330
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.500
it illustrates an important scientific point.

1331
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:53.583
I don't know him.

1332
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.233
I think I'm

1333
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.290
just more Google images.

1334
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.273
Um,

1335
00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:06.740
I think I want to begin next class by wrapping up and explaining the Harlow's

1336
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:11.030
studies more detail and what they tell us and then we'll move towards altruism

1337
00:53:11.031 --> 00:53:12.590
towards non non-kin.

1338
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:13.400
I'll see you next week.
