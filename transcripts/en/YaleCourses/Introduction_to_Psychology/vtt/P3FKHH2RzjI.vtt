1
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.760
I'd like to welcome people to introduction to psychology.

2
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.510
My name is Dr. Paul Bloom and I'm a professor for this course.

3
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.120
Uh,

4
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.010
if you haven't yet picked up a syllabus from the front of the class,

5
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.370
please raise your hand or are we out or we had to celebrate.

6
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.440
Oh,

7
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.760
please raise your hand.

8
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.800
And when the teaching fellows will bring it to you,

9
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.090
if you don't yet have a several of us.

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.523
<v 1>MMM.</v>

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.690
<v 0>The syllabus is also available on this website.</v>

12
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.670
This website will become important to you should you choose to take this class.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.720
Um,

14
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.670
it will include the syllabus which will occasionally be revised,

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.450
um,

16
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.530
well in advance.

17
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.061
Also,

18
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:00.460
all of the class material will be on this site,

19
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.950
including copies of the slides I'm presenting,

20
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.960
including these slides right now,

21
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.980
um,

22
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.980
practice exam and any details on the written assignments.

23
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.930
So you'll need to use this website regularly.

24
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.840
Um,

25
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.730
the keep in touch with the course today will be a short class.

26
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.031
Um,

27
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:22.450
what I just want to do today is orient you,

28
00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:24.220
tell you what this course is about.

29
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.510
Um,

30
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.480
I know this is shopping period and I want to give you a good sense of what you'd

31
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:28.931
be in for.

32
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:29.980
If you took this course.

33
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.480
I want to go over the style of the classes,

34
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.700
the valuation,

35
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.200
the readings and so on.

36
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.890
Um,

37
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.670
and then give some examples of some of the specific topics that we'll be

38
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:40.504
covering.

39
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.600
But before I get started,

40
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.780
I have to point out something a little bit unusual about this class.

41
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.710
Um,

42
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.850
we are being filmed,

43
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.360
this course is one of seven courses chosen to begin the Yale University open

44
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.040
educational resources video lecture project.

45
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.900
Um,

46
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.870
and what this means is that when the year is over,

47
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.740
um,

48
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.210
these videos will be available on the Internet free for anybody who wants to see

49
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:07.890
them,

50
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.230
um,

51
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.700
and ideally will be accessed by people across many different countries.

52
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.600
Some hood would not normally have access to a university education.

53
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.153
Um,

54
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.790
I see this as a good and honorable use of Yale's resources.

55
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:25.240
And of course it's also part of Yale's plan for world domination.

56
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.630
So because of this,

57
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.370
a Yale University production team from the center of media initiatives is going

58
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:36.130
to be taping all the class lectures and they're up there.

59
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.390
Um,

60
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.410
the idea is that this should be as unobtrusive as possible.

61
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.460
Um,

62
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.060
and the classroom experience should essentially be the same as if they're not

63
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.750
there.

64
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.370
So it was their intention to tape the lectures to tape me and sometimes,

65
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.020
uh,

66
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.390
the,

67
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.750
the slides but not tape your faces or voices.

68
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.820
So we're not having you sign release forms.

69
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.020
Um,

70
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.501
two things.

71
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.910
One thing is personally,

72
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.420
um,

73
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.010
I have to remind myself not to use profanity because children may be watching.

74
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.330
So I'll try not to do that.

75
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.810
Um,

76
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.550
there was also another complexity.

77
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.200
If you are in the front row or the second row or third row,

78
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.990
it is possible that some part of your head,

79
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.080
your back or even your face might end up on film.

80
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.213
Um,

81
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.660
if,

82
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.440
if you are in the witness protection program or you are some sort of fugitive,

83
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.230
you probably don't want to sit in the front row.

84
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.070
Um,

85
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.581
I'll give him,

86
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.810
if people want to unobtrusively kind of slide back.

87
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.840
That's fine as I'm talking.

88
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.820
Okay.

89
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.653
We're ready.

90
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.440
So I like to injured to,

91
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:42.070
um,

92
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.600
welcome people to this course.

93
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:44.980
Introduction to psychology.

94
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.510
My name is Dr. Paul Bloom.

95
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.160
I'm professor of this course.

96
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.523
Um,

97
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.370
and what this is going to be

98
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.600
is a comprehensive introduction to the study of the human mind.

99
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.840
So we're going to cover a very,

100
00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:03.260
very wide range of topics including brains,

101
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:03.711
children,

102
00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:04.161
language,

103
00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:04.461
sex,

104
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:04.851
memory,

105
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:05.331
badness,

106
00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:08.810
discuss racism and love and many others.

107
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.310
We're going to talk about things like the proper explanation for differences

108
00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:14.450
between men and women.

109
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.920
Um,

110
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.590
the question of whether animals can learn language,

111
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.810
the puzzle of what grosses is,

112
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.840
help the problem of why some of us eat too much and what we could do to stop the

113
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:29.180
question of why people go crazy in groups.

114
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.170
Research into whether you can trust your childhood memories,

115
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.860
research into why some of us get depressed and others don't.

116
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.420
The style of this is there'll be two lectures a week

117
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.370
as well as course readings now to do well in the course.

118
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.210
Um,

119
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.420
you have to attend both the lectures and do the readings.

120
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.280
There will be some overlap.

121
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.490
In some cases the lectures will be quite linked to the readings,

122
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.270
but there will be some cute parts of the readings that will not find her way

123
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.030
into the lectures and some lecture,

124
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:07.210
some entire lectures that will not connect at all to the readings.

125
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.180
So to pursue this course properly,

126
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.500
you have to do both.

127
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.460
Um,

128
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.650
what this means is that if you miss a class,

129
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:15.610
you need to get notes.

130
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.930
And so you should get them from a friend or from the person sitting next to you.

131
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.980
The slides are going to be made available online.

132
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.730
So one of the things you don't have to do is you don't have to write this down.

133
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.100
You take notes any way you choose,

134
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.530
but if you don't get anything on there,

135
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.880
it'll be available online.

136
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.200
I'm going to post it in a format which will be black and white and,

137
00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:40.270
and easy to print out so you don't have to worry about this.

138
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.560
But again,

139
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.910
attending to the slide is not a substitute for attending class.

140
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.390
There's a textbook.

141
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.150
Um,

142
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.150
Peter Gray's psychology fifth edition and there's also a collection of short

143
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.474
readings,

144
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.070
the Norton reader edited by Gary Marcus.

145
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.730
Um,

146
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.930
it's an excellent textbook.

147
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:02.720
It's an extra from collection and you should get them both.

148
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.360
Um,

149
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.700
they're available at labyrinth bookstore on York street or if you get them

150
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.534
online,

151
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.550
I should note that last time I taught the course I used the Marcus reader and

152
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:13.820
um,

153
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.700
when Professor Marvin Chan taught his course last semester,

154
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.400
he used Peter Gray's fifth edition textbook,

155
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.980
sort of maybe a lot of used copies floating around.

156
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.530
You should feel free to try to get one of those.

157
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.530
The evaluation goes like this.

158
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.470
There is a midterm and there's a final,

159
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.520
the final will not be held in the exam period because I like to take long

160
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.354
vacations.

161
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.910
It will be held the last day of class.

162
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.110
The exams will mean we'll be multiple choice and short answer,

163
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.891
fill in the blank,

164
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:43.724
that sort of thing.

165
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.200
Prior to the exams,

166
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:50.201
I will post previous exams online so you have a feeling for how these exams work

167
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.860
and so on.

168
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.570
There will also be review sessions starting at the beginning of the third week

169
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:57.200
of class.

170
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.310
That is not next week,

171
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.330
but the week after.

172
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.200
On Monday,

173
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.030
each Monday I'm going to put up a brief question or set of questions which you

174
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:09.500
have to answer and your answers need to be sent to your teaching fellow and

175
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:11.720
you'll be given a teaching fellow assigned one.

176
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.770
Um,

177
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.670
by Friday.

178
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.010
This is not meant to be difficult,

179
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.750
it's not meant to be more than five,

180
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.920
10 minutes of work,

181
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.570
but the point of the question,

182
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.550
1520 minutes of work.

183
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.390
Um,

184
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.440
but the point of the question is to motivate people to keep up with the material

185
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.640
and do the readings.

186
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.650
These questions will be marked pass,

187
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:31.310
fail.

188
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.570
I expect most everybody to pass all of the questions but it's just to keep you

189
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:36.920
on track and keep you going.

190
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.980
Um,

191
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.260
there's a book review,

192
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.430
a short book review to be written towards near the end of the class.

193
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.880
I'll give details about that later on in the semester and there's also an

194
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.950
experimental participation requirement.

195
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.230
And next week I'll,

196
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:52.970
I'll hand out a piece of paper describing the requirement.

197
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.620
The point of the requirement is to give you all experience actually seeing what

198
00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:01.820
psychological research is about as well as to give us hundreds of subjects to do

199
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:02.660
our experiments on.

200
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.323
Um,

201
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.020
the issue sometimes comes up as the how to do well in the course.

202
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.733
Um,

203
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.510
here's how to do well at 10 all the classes.

204
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.770
Keep up with the readings.

205
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.030
Ideally keep up with the readings before you come to class.

206
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.990
Um,

207
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.830
and one thing I would strongly suggest is to form some sort of study groups,

208
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.780
either formally or informally,

209
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.700
have people you could talk to when the exact prior to the exams or she's patting

210
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:32.900
somebody next to her.

211
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.400
I hope you know him.

212
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.503
Um,

213
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.693
and um,

214
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.651
and,

215
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:39.841
and,

216
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:41.060
and in fact what I want to do,

217
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.040
not this class cause it's dropping appeared.

218
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:44.990
I don't know who's coming next class or what,

219
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.590
but I'll set up a few minutes prior at the beginning of class for people just to

220
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.310
introduce themselves to the person next to them so they have some sort of

221
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:53.144
resource,

222
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.960
um,

223
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.793
in the class.

224
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.070
Now this is a large class.

225
00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.953
Um,

226
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.840
and if you don't do anything about it,

227
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.780
it can be very anonymous and some of you may choose to pursue it that way and

228
00:09:05.781 --> 00:09:07.230
it's totally fine.

229
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.620
But what I would suggest you do is establish some contact with us,

230
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.350
either with me or with any of the teaching fellows and I'll introduce the

231
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.660
teaching fellows sometime next week.

232
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.620
Um,

233
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.460
you could talk to us at the beginning or the end of class unless you're special

234
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:24.241
circumstances.

235
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:28.110
I always try to come at least 10 minutes early and I try and I'm willing to stay

236
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:29.460
late to talk to people.

237
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.210
Um,

238
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.010
you could come by during my office hours,

239
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.460
which are on the syllabus and you can send me email and set up an appointment.

240
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.240
Um,

241
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.300
I'm very willing to talk to students about intellectual ideas,

242
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:41.220
about chorus problems and so on.

243
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.830
And if you see me at some point just on campus,

244
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.220
um,

245
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.350
you could introduce yourself and I,

246
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.660
I'd like to meet people from this class.

247
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.740
Um,

248
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.520
so again,

249
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.660
I learned a stress.

250
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.180
You have the option of staying anonymous in this class,

251
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.660
but you also have the option of seeking out and making some sort of contact with

252
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:58.494
us.

253
00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.843
Okay.

254
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.120
That's the formal stuff of the course.

255
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.860
What's this course about?

256
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:06.630
Um,

257
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.520
unlike a lot of other courses,

258
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.810
some people come to intro psychology with some unusual motivations.

259
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.710
Um,

260
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.490
maybe you're crazy and hope to become less crazy.

261
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.683
Um,

262
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.170
maybe you want to learn how to study better,

263
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:23.520
improve your sex life,

264
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.330
interpret your dreams and win friends and influence people.

265
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.400
Those are not necessarily bad reasons to take this course and with the exception

266
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:36.030
of the sex part,

267
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.720
um,

268
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.480
this course might actually help you out with some of these things.

269
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.720
The study of scientific psychology has a lot of insight of real world relevance

270
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:48.030
to real problems that we face in our everyday lives.

271
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:48.991
And I want to try it.

272
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:50.100
And when these issues come up,

273
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:51.760
I'm going to try to stress them and,

274
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.110
and,

275
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.100
and make you try to think about the extent to which the laboratory research I'll

276
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:58.650
be talking about can affect your everyday life,

277
00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.730
how you study,

278
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.140
how you interact with people,

279
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.470
how you might try to persuade somebody of something else,

280
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.630
what sort of therapy works best for you.

281
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.123
Um,

282
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.690
but the general goals of this course are actually,

283
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.360
I think even more interesting than that.

284
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.240
What I want to do is provide a state of the art introduction to the most

285
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:23.160
important topic that there is,

286
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.270
um,

287
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.080
us.

288
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.580
How the human mind works,

289
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.810
how we think,

290
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.010
what makes us,

291
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.000
what we are.

292
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.060
And we'll be approaching this from a range of directions.

293
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.950
So traditionally psychology often broken up into the following in into five

294
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.500
subareas neuroscience,

295
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.030
which is the study of the,

296
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.440
of the mind by looking at the brain developmental,

297
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.750
which is the area which I focused mostly on,

298
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.860
which is trying to learn about how people develop and grow and learn.

299
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.173
Cognitive,

300
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.900
which is the one term of the five that might be unfamiliar to some of you,

301
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.280
but it refers to a sort of computational approach to studying the mind.

302
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.430
Often viewing the mind on analogy with a computer and looking at how people do

303
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:10.300
things like understand language,

304
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.010
recognize objects,

305
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.960
play games and so on.

306
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.760
There is social,

307
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.760
which is the study of how people act in groups,

308
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:20.620
how people act with other people.

309
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.540
And there is clinical,

310
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.200
which is maybe the aspect of psychology that people think of immediately when

311
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:27.190
they hear psychology,

312
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.100
which is a study of mental health and mental illness.

313
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.590
And we'll be covering all of those areas.

314
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.080
We'll also be covering a set of related areas.

315
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.770
I am convinced that you cannot study the mind solely by looking at the

316
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.510
discipline of psychology to,

317
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.260
this is one that psychology spills over the issues of how the mind has evolved.

318
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.160
Um,

319
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.160
economics and game theory are now an essential tools for understanding human

320
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:55.270
thought and human behavior.

321
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.250
There was issues connecting to philosophy,

322
00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:57.941
computer science,

323
00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:58.774
anthropology,

324
00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.561
literature,

325
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:00.394
theology,

326
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.031
and many,

327
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:02.200
many other domains.

328
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.790
So this course will be wide ranging in that sense.

329
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.080
Um,

330
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.480
at this point I've been speaking in generalities.

331
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.540
So I want to close this introductory class by giving five examples of the sorts

332
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:18.280
of topics we'll be covering.

333
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.800
And I'll start off the topic that we'll be covering next week on Monday the

334
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:24.634
brain.

335
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.050
Um,

336
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.190
this is a brain,

337
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.361
in fact,

338
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:30.310
it's a specific person's brain

339
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.010
and with interesting,

340
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.530
but the brain is that little white mark there.

341
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.260
<v 1>Okay?</v>

342
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.093
<v 0>It's her brain.</v>

343
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.410
It's Terry Shabbos brain.

344
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.950
You recognize her more from pictures like that.

345
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.530
And what a case like this,

346
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.500
where somebody's,

347
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.483
um,

348
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.030
is,

349
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.580
is in a coma,

350
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.380
is without consciousness as a result of damage to the brain is a stark

351
00:13:55.381 --> 00:13:58.680
illustration of the physical nature of mental life,

352
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.550
the physical basis for everything that we normally hold dear,

353
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.370
like freewill consciousness,

354
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.540
morality,

355
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:07.410
and our emotions.

356
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.700
And that's what we'll begin the course with talking about how a physical thing

357
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.220
can give rise to mental life.

358
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

359
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.200
<v 0>We'll talk a lot about children.</v>

360
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.350
This is actually a specific child.

361
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.330
My son Zachary,

362
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.253
a younger son,

363
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.393
um,

364
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.710
dressed up as superman,

365
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.603
Spiderman,

366
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:28.730
but it is Halloween.

367
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:28.971
No,

368
00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:29.804
it's not Halloween.

369
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.230
Oh Wow.

370
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.520
There's more to say about that.

371
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:35.483
Um,

372
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.550
I studied child development for a living and I'm interested in several

373
00:14:40.551 --> 00:14:41.330
questions.

374
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.850
So one question is just a question of development.

375
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.930
Everybody in this room can speak and understand English.

376
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.070
Everybody in this room has some understanding how the world works,

377
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:54.050
how physical things behave.

378
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.800
Everybody in this room has some understanding of other people and how people

379
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:58.723
behave.

380
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.910
And the question that that preoccupies developmental psychologist is how do we

381
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:06.140
come to have this knowledge?

382
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.620
And in particular how much of it is it hardwired built in in ne and how much of

383
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:14.120
it is a product of culture,

384
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.110
of,

385
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.441
of,

386
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:16.430
of language,

387
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.520
of schooling and developmental psychologists use many ingenious methods to try

388
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:25.610
to pull these apart and try to figure out what,

389
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:26.150
what,

390
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.510
what's,

391
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.343
what's,

392
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.530
what are the basic components of human nature?

393
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.220
There's also the question of continuity.

394
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.900
To what extent is that accurate at that age going to be that way forever.

395
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.710
To what extent is your fate sealed?

396
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.540
To what extent could,

397
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.540
if I were to me when you were five years old,

398
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.970
I could describe the way you are now.

399
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.363
Um,

400
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.700
the poet William Wordsworth wrote,

401
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.820
the child is father to the man.

402
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:07.810
And what this means is that you can see within every child the adult he or she

403
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:09.440
will become.

404
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.533
Um,

405
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.050
we will look and,

406
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:12.191
and,

407
00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:12.341
and,

408
00:16:12.341 --> 00:16:14.570
and ask the question whether this is true.

409
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.130
Is it true for your personality?

410
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.630
Is it true for your interest?

411
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:19.580
Is it true for your intelligence?

412
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.110
Another question having to do with development

413
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.700
is what makes us the way we are.

414
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.460
We're different in a lot of ways.

415
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.780
The people in this room differ according to their tastes in food.

416
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:37.490
They differ according to their ICUs,

417
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.310
whether they're aggressive or shy,

418
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.470
whether they're attracted to males,

419
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:43.041
females,

420
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:44.150
both or neither.

421
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.910
Whether whether they are good at music,

422
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.080
whether they're politically liberal or conservative.

423
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.970
Why are we different?

424
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.520
What's the explanation for why we're different?

425
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.320
And again,

426
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.160
this could be translated in terms of a question of genes and environment.

427
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.940
To what extent are things the result of the genes we possess?

428
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.370
To what extent are our,

429
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.750
our individual natures the result of how we were raised and to what extent are

430
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:14.420
they best explained in terms of an interaction?

431
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.580
One common theory for instance is that we are shaped by our parents.

432
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.390
Um,

433
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.160
this was best summarize most famously by the British poet Philip Larkin

434
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:27.860
who wrote,

435
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.110
they mess you up,

436
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.540
your mom and dad,

437
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.700
they may not mean to,

438
00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:35.540
but they do,

439
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.730
they fill you with the false they had and add some extra just for you.

440
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.453
Is he right,

441
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.530
is very controversial.

442
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:45.810
You,

443
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.810
it's been a series of a huge controversy in popular culture to the extent to

444
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:52.410
which parents matter.

445
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.700
And this is an issue which will preoccupy us for much of the course.

446
00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.220
A different question.

447
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.830
What makes somebody attractive?

448
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.540
And this can be acid,

449
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.650
all sorts of levels,

450
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.310
but as symbol level is what makes for a pretty face.

451
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.910
So these are according to ratings,

452
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.250
very attractive faces.

453
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.040
They are not the faces of real people.

454
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.800
What's on the screen are computer generated faces,

455
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:20.890
um,

456
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.890
a a Caucasian male and a Caucasian female who don't exist in the real world.

457
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.420
But through using this sort of computer generation and then asking people what

458
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:33.660
they think of this face,

459
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:34.650
what they think of that phase.

460
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.550
Scientists have come to some sense as to what really makes a face attractive

461
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.970
both within cultures and across cultures.

462
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.290
And that's something which we're going to devote some time to when we talk about

463
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.190
social behavior.

464
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.800
And in particular when we talk about sex,

465
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.030
um,

466
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.410
not all attractiveness,

467
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.140
not all beauty of course is linked to sex.

468
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.280
Um,

469
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.113
so,

470
00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.700
so pan does for instance,

471
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.960
like this panda are notoriously cute and I don't,

472
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.480
I don't have anything to say about it really.

473
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.470
It's just a cute picture.

474
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:11.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

475
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.230
<v 0>Um,</v>

476
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:17.230
morality is extremely central to our lives and a deep question which we will

477
00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:23.900
struggle with throughout most of the course is the question of good and evil,

478
00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:24.890
evil and good.

479
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:25.490
Um,

480
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:29.660
these three pictures exemplify different sorts of evil.

481
00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:32.180
We can call institutional evil,

482
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.200
um,

483
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.033
by somebody

484
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.020
behaving cruelly to report somebody for somebody else.

485
00:19:39.021 --> 00:19:40.310
Perhaps not due to malice,

486
00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:42.410
but because of the situation that she's in,

487
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.810
it has a picture of Osama bin Ladin um,

488
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.170
a mass murderer or driven by political cause.

489
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.030
And then there's this guy on the bottom.

490
00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:51.080
Anybody know who he is?

491
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.630
Ted Bundy who got that film,

492
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:58.380
that man.

493
00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.213
No.

494
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.083
Ted Bundy.

495
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.373
Exactly.

496
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.290
And that's like I,

497
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.820
before we get into the technical stuff,

498
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.970
like crazy evil and,

499
00:20:06.971 --> 00:20:07.240
and,

500
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.240
and we're going to have to come to terms with why some people are like that.

501
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.041
And again,

502
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:15.840
the same situation comes up.

503
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.010
Is it part of your nature to be good or bad?

504
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.173
Um,

505
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.960
or is it largely due to the situation that you,

506
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.823
that you fallen?

507
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.121
And there's a lot of,

508
00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:31.980
some quite spectacular experiments that try to tease that apart.

509
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.290
If we're going to talk about evil,

510
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.910
we should also talk about good.

511
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.973
Um,

512
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.521
this is,

513
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:39.600
these are pictures of,

514
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:40.140
um,

515
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.540
of two notoriously Goodman,

516
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.740
Oscar Schindler and Paul recessive,

517
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.980
but Ganja,

518
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.233
um,

519
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.730
each who at different times in history,

520
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.893
um,

521
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.120
save the lives of many,

522
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.160
many people at great risk to themselves.

523
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.173
Um,

524
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.670
she didn't learn the Holocaust.

525
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.853
Um,

526
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:02.310
and,

527
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.601
and,

528
00:21:02.601 --> 00:21:04.060
and then the other guy in,

529
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.261
and I'm good,

530
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:06.430
I can't pronounce his name.

531
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.413
Recessive again.

532
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.010
Yeah.

533
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.710
Um,

534
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.543
in Rwanda.

535
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.550
And they both had real good movies made about them.

536
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:13.983
Um,

537
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.070
and,

538
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.670
and so,

539
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:15.920
but,

540
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.690
but what's interesting with these cases is you couldn't have predicted ahead of

541
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:22.210
time that day would be heroes.

542
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:28.230
And one personal issue within any of us is what would we do in such situations.

543
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.573
Um,

544
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.060
finally throughout this course we will discuss mental illness.

545
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.040
Now towards the end of the class,

546
00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:44.041
I want to devote a full week to discussing major or disorders like depression

547
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:47.890
and anxiety because of their profound social importance.

548
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:48.893
Um,

549
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.300
such disorders are reasonably common in college students.

550
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.020
Uh,

551
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.590
many people in this room are currently suffering from a mood disorder and

552
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.710
anxiety disorder or both.

553
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.990
And I won't ask for a show of hands,

554
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:07.060
but I know a lot of people in this room are on some form of medication for this

555
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:07.894
disorder.

556
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.920
Um,

557
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.850
and we'll discuss,

558
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:14.440
we'll discuss the current research and why people get these disorders and what's

559
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:16.420
the best way to make them better.

560
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.200
But I also have a weakness for the less common mental disorders that I think

561
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:26.020
tell us something really interesting about mental life.

562
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.810
So when we talk about memory,

563
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.673
for instance,

564
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.750
we'll talk about disorders and memory,

565
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.340
including some disorders that keep you from forming new memories as well as all

566
00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:39.610
disorders of Amnesia where you forget the past.

567
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.170
And these are an extraordinarily interesting for all sorts of reasons.

568
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.270
Early in the course.

569
00:22:47.271 --> 00:22:47.601
In fact,

570
00:22:47.601 --> 00:22:52.601
I think next week we will discuss later on in the course in the middle of middle

571
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:53.210
of the semester,

572
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.600
we will discuss the amazing case of Phineas gage.

573
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.030
Phineas gage was a construction worker,

574
00:22:59.031 --> 00:23:02.450
but a hundred years ago due to an explosion,

575
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.540
a metal pipe went through his head like so miraculously he was not killed.

576
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.543
In fact,

577
00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.270
his friends and it went through his head when ended up a hundred feet away,

578
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.870
covered with brains and blood and Phineas gage.

579
00:23:17.871 --> 00:23:22.871
You sat down and then on the way to the hospital they stopped by a pub,

580
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.100
have some cider.

581
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.700
He was not blind,

582
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:29.960
he was not deaf.

583
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.940
He was not retarded,

584
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.820
but something else happened to them.

585
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.450
He lost a sense of right and wrong.

586
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.960
He lost his control.

587
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.310
He used to be a hardworking family man.

588
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.110
After the accident,

589
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:49.310
he lost all of that.

590
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.020
He couldn't hold a job.

591
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.940
He couldn't stay faithful to his wife.

592
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.090
He couldn't speak for five minutes without cursing.

593
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.980
He got into fights.

594
00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.970
You got into browse,

595
00:23:58.971 --> 00:23:59.804
he got drunk,

596
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.520
he lost his control.

597
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:06.410
He ended up on a circus side show traveling through the country with the big

598
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:08.060
steel pipe that went through his head.

599
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.410
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

600
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:14.410
<v 0>and this is again an extraordinary example of how the brain can give rise to the</v>

601
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:20.090
mind and how things that go wrong with the brain can affect you in a serious

602
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:20.924
way.

603
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.020
We'll discuss cases and multiple personality disorder where people have more

604
00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:29.840
than one personality and also discuss the debate over wet weather.

605
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:31.850
Such cases are true or not.

606
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.840
Whether they can be taken as a real phenomena or have made up phenomena,

607
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.350
which is,

608
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.220
there's a matter of a lot of controversy and then we'll even discuss some rarer

609
00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:41.054
cases.

610
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.223
Um,

611
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.750
like capgras syndrome.

612
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.840
[inaudible] Syndrome is typically,

613
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:47.941
is,

614
00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:48.210
is,

615
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.040
is,

616
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.330
there's hundreds of cases,

617
00:24:50.331 --> 00:24:52.190
not many hundreds of cases.

618
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.590
It's typically the result of some sort of stroke.

619
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.710
And what happens to you is very specific.

620
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.220
You develop a particular delusion,

621
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.050
like it's getting dark.

622
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:11.530
And the delusion is that the people you love the most have been replaced.

623
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.580
They've been replaced by aliens or robots.

624
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.133
Thank you.

625
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:21.800
Um,

626
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.140
by,

627
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:22.501
by,

628
00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:22.940
by,

629
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.721
by Martians,

630
00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:24.830
by CIA agents,

631
00:25:24.831 --> 00:25:26.390
by trained actors and actresses.

632
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.493
But the people,

633
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:30.643
<v 1>okay.</v>

634
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.230
<v 0>But the idea is the people you care for the most you believe are gone.</v>

635
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.723
<v 1>And</v>

636
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.030
<v 0>this could lead to tragic consequences.</v>

637
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:44.380
Cop Grass Syndrome is associated with a very high level of violence.

638
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.310
Um,

639
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.420
one man in Australia a couple of years ago was under the delusion that his

640
00:25:49.421 --> 00:25:52.390
father was replaced with a robot and cut off his head.

641
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

642
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.541
<v 0>Uh,</v>

643
00:25:54.541 --> 00:25:59.541
related disorder involving the very same parts of the brain is called

644
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.470
[inaudible] syndrome and could tarnish syndrome is you believe that you're dead.

645
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

646
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.010
<v 0>You believe that your dad,</v>

647
00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:08.151
you,

648
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:08.381
you,

649
00:26:08.381 --> 00:26:09.670
you are persuaded that you're dead.

650
00:26:09.671 --> 00:26:10.421
You're walking around,

651
00:26:10.421 --> 00:26:10.691
you know,

652
00:26:10.691 --> 00:26:12.790
you're walking around and you know that there are people around.

653
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.900
Um,

654
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.490
but you think that you're dead.

655
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.430
And what's striking about these is it's not,

656
00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:21.910
these are not just sort of big screwy problems of messed up people.

657
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.740
Rather they're located,

658
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.660
they're related at a pinpoint level to certain parts of your brain and we're

659
00:26:28.661 --> 00:26:33.340
going to talk about the best modern theories as to why these syndromes occur.

660
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.610
Now the reason to be interested in them again is not because they're frequent,

661
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.980
they aren't and it's not because of some sort of gruesome morbid curiosity.

662
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.700
Rather by looking at extreme cases,

663
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.750
they can help us best understand normal life.

664
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.700
Often by looking at extremes,

665
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:59.600
it's rose into sharp contrast things we naturally take for granted.

666
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.670
The issue of of psychopathy,

667
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.470
of people who either due to brain damage or because they born that way have no

668
00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:10.940
moral understanding can help us cope with questions of freewill and

669
00:27:10.941 --> 00:27:15.170
responsibility of the relationship or difference between mental illness and

670
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:15.860
evil.

671
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.720
Multiple personality cases forced us to address the question of what is a self,

672
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:26.650
what to what extent do are all of us compose the multiple people and to what

673
00:27:26.931 --> 00:27:29.900
extent are we a single unified person over time?

674
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.760
Cases like cop grass

675
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.320
<v 1>yeah,</v>

676
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.680
<v 0>are important because they tell us about how we see the world.</v>

677
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.431
They tell us,

678
00:27:37.431 --> 00:27:38.030
for instance,

679
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.210
that there's a difference between recognizing something in a sense that you can

680
00:27:41.211 --> 00:27:45.460
name it and knowing what it is and,

681
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.771
and,

682
00:27:45.771 --> 00:27:48.200
and so by studying these abnormal cases,

683
00:27:48.201 --> 00:27:50.630
we can get some insight into regular life.

684
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.860
So that's the end of the illustration of the example topics.

685
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.530
The syllabus lists many more.

686
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.180
I'll end by telling you that

687
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.460
there's a little,

688
00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.270
there's a lot of stuff that we'll be talking about that I want to talk about

689
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.680
that I am not expert in.

690
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.760
And fortunately there is a community at Yale of the best scholars and teachers

691
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.293
on the planet.

692
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:22.310
And so it would be a shame for me not to use them to cover some of these issues.

693
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.090
And so I want to include four guests lectures.

694
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.870

695

696
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:35.564
competition.

697
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.950
Um,

698

and he's going to give an amazing lecture on cognitive neuroscience,

699
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.210

700
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.620
Dr. Susan Nolan Eczema is the world's authority on depression and in particular

701
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.360

702
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.210
And she's going to talk about this towards the end of the course.

703
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.000
Kelly Brown hell,

704
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.083

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:14.743

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:19.720

716
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.300
All of these details are in the syllabus.

717
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.050
Um,

718
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.700
and I'll stick around and answer questions.

719
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:35.540
Hope to see you next week.
