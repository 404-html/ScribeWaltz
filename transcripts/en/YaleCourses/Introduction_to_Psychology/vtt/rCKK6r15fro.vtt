WEBVTT

1
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.040
I actually had one to begin by going back to Freud and hitting a couple of loose

2
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:17.730
ends.

3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.500
There was a point in my lecture on Wednesday what I skipped over some parts.

4
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.270
I said,
we don't have time for this.

5
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:28.860
And I just whipped passed it and I couldn't sleep that we over the weekend been

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.980
tormented.
Um,
I shouldn't have skipped that.
And,
and I want to break,

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.770
let me tell you why I skipped it.

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.220
The discussion I skipped was a discussion of why we would have an unconscious at

9
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:44.850
all.
So it was talking about the scientifically respectable ideas of Freud.

10
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.220
And I want to talk about some new ideas about why there could be an unconscious.

11
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.421
Now,

12
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:56.421
the reason why I skipped it is I'm not sure this is the best way to look at the

13
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:00.030
question as we will learn throughout the course.

14
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.960
By far the vast majority of what our brains do,

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.610
the vast majority of what our minds do is unconscious and we're unaware of it.

16
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.160
So the right question to ask may not be why are some things unconscious,

17
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.120
but rather at,
why is this tiny subset of mental life,

18
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.780
why is this conscious?
On the other hand,

19
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.170
these claims about the utility of unconsciousness,

20
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.270
I think are provocative and interesting.

21
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.680
So I just wanted to quickly share them with you.
Um,
so the question is,

22
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:33.240
from an evolutionary standpoint,

23
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.630
why would an unconscious evolve and an answer that some psychologists and

24
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.240
biologists have given his deception.

25
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.430
So most animals do.

26
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:49.431
Some deception and deception defined broadly is simply act or be in some way

27
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.500
that fools others into believing or thinking or responding to something that's

28
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.180
false.
Um,

29
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.460
there's physical examples of deception when threatened chimpanzees,

30
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.300
they're here,

31
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.200
stands up on end and that makes them look bigger to fool others to think,

32
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.100
you know,
more dangerous than they are.
Um,

33
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.040
there's an angler fish at the bottom of the ocean that has a rod sticking up

34
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.550
from the top of its head with ular to capture other fish,

35
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.240
to fool them and thinking that this is something edible and then to themselves

36
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.740
be devoured.
But humans,
primates in general,

37
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:29.340
but particularly humans,
um,
are masters at deception.

38
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.090
We use our minds and our behaviors and our actions continually to try to trick

39
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:39.930
people into believing what's not true.
We try to trick people,
for instance,

40
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.520
I'm into believing that were tougher,
smarter,
sexier,

41
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.020
more reliable,
more trustworthy,
and so on.
Then we really are,

42
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.190
and a large part of social psychology concerns the way in which we present

43
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:57.540
ourselves to other people so as to make the maximum we positive impression even

44
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:01.870
when that impression isn't true.
Um,
at the same time though,

45
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.230
we've also evolve very good lie detection mechanisms.

46
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.290
So not only is their evolutionary pressure for me to lie to you,

47
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.760
for me to persuade you,
for instance,
that if we're going to have a calm,

48
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.250
if you're threatening me,
don't threaten me.

49
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.650
I am not the sort of man you could screw around with.

50
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.220
But there is evolutionary pressure for you to look and say,
no,
you are an accord,

51
00:03:25.221 --> 00:03:29.200
a man you get screw around with.
I could tell.
So how do you,

52
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.150
how do you become a good liar?

53
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.560
And here's where the unconscious comes in the iPod is,
is,

54
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:40.561
is the best lies are lies we tell ourselves you're a better liar more generally

55
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.450
if you believe the lie that you're telling.

56
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.150
Um,
this could be illustrated with a story by a about Alfred Hitchcock.

57
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.780
The story goes,
he hated working with truck,
with child actors,

58
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.420
but he often had to,
and the story goes,

59
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.140
he was dealing with a child actor who simply could not cry.

60
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.160
And finally frustrated.
Hitchcock wintered actor leaned over,

61
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.130
whispered in his ear,
your parents have left you and they're never coming back.

62
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.200
The kid burst into tears.
Hitchcock said,
Roland and filling the kid

63
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.300
and the kid,
if you were to see him today,
that's boy,
he's really,

64
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.860
he really looks as if he's sad because he was,
um,

65
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.710
if I had a competition of where I give $100,000 to the person who looks the most

66
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:38.140
as if they are in pain,

67
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.770
it is a very good tactic to take a pen and jam it into your groin because you

68
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:48.280
will look extremely persuasively as if you are in pain.

69
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.260
If I want to persuade you that I love you would never leave you.

70
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.000
You can trust me with everything.
It may be a superb tactic for me to believe it.

71
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.790
And so this accounted evolution of the unconscious,
um,

72
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.290
is that certain motivations and goals,

73
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.970
particularly sinister ones,

74
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.900
are better made to be unconscious because of a person doesn't know they have

75
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.730
them,
they will not give them away.

76
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.400
And this is something I think we should return to later on when we talk about

77
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.220
social interaction and social relationships.

78
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.880
Um,
one other thing on Freud as just a story of the false suffocation of Freud.

79
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.270
I was taking my younger child home from a play date on Sunday and he asked me

80
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:44.020
out of the blue,
why can't you marry your mother or your father?

81
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.360
Now that's actually a difficult question to ask answer for a child.

82
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:53.320
But I tried my best to give them an answer and then I said,
um,

83
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.660
then I thought back on the Freud lecture.

84
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.680
And so I asked him if you could marry anybody you want,

85
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.920
who would it be imagining?

86
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:08.450
He make explicit the oedipal complex and main name his mother.
Um,

87
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.950
instead he paused for a moment and said I would marry a donkey

88
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.960
and a big bag of peanuts.

89
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.233
<v 1>Both,</v>

90
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.310
<v 0>both his parents are psychologists and he hates these questions and tiny you</v>

91
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:31.510
just screws around with us.

92
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.080
Last class

94
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.020
<v 0>I started with Freud and I want to turn to Skinner and the story of Skinner and</v>

95
00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.030
science is somewhat different from the story of Freud.

96
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.240
Freud developed and champion the theory of psycho analysis by himself.

97
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.940
It is as close as you could find in science to a solitary invention.
Um,

98
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.880
obviously he drew upon all sorts of sources and predecessors,

99
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.960
but psycho analysis identified as Freud's creation.

100
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.940
Behaviorism is different.

101
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.360
Behaviorism is a school of thought that was there long before Skinner championed

102
00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:19.380
by a psychologist like a John Watson for instance.

103
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.410
Skinner came a bit late into this,

104
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.420
but the reason why we've heard of Skinner and why skin are so well known is he

105
00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:31.620
packaged these notions he expanded upon and we publicized them.

106
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.400
He developed them scientifically and presented in both to the scientific

107
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:37.470
community and to the popular community.

108
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.120
And sociologically in the 1960s,
1970s,

109
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.730
United States behaviorism was incredibly well known.
So it was Skinner.
He was,
uh,

110
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.180
he was a sort of person you would see on talk shows.
His books were bestsellers.

111
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.890
I'm now at the core of behaviorism are three extremely radical and interesting

112
00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.963
views.

113
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.190
The first is a strong emphasis on learning.

114
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.450
The strong view of behaviorism is everything.
You know,

115
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.440
everything you are is a result of experience.

116
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.470
There's no real human nature.

117
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.540
Rather people are infinitely malleable.
Um,

118
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.850
there's a wonderful quote from John Watson and in this quote,

119
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:28.800
John Watson is a paraphrasing,
a famous boasts by the Jesuits.

120
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.660
The Jesuits used to claim,

121
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.110
give me a child until the age of seven and I'll show you the man that they would

122
00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:41.160
take a child and turn them into anything they wanted.

123
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.670
And Watson expanded on this post,

124
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.970
give me a dozen healthy infants well formed and my own specified world to bring

125
00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:48.530
them up and,

126
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.990
and I'll guarantee to take anyone at random and train them to become any type of

127
00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:56.370
specialist.
I might select doctor,
lawyer,
artists,
merchant chief,

128
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.320
and yes,
even beggar man thief.
Regardless of his talents,
pensions,
tendencies,

129
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.200
abilities,
vocations,
and race of his ancestors.

130
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.810
Now you could imagine,
you could see in this a tremendous appeal to this view.

131
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.960
Um,
because Watson,

132
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.670
it's an extremely egalitarian view in a sense.
If there's no human nature,

133
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.020
then there's no sense in which one group of humans,
um,

134
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.320
by dent of their race or their sex could be better than another group.

135
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.910
And Watson was explicit.

136
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.320
None of those facts about people will ever make any difference.

137
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.870
What matters to what you are is what you learn and how you're treated.

138
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.560
And so wants and claim he could create anybody in any way simply by treating

139
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:44.850
them in a certain fashion.

140
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.183
<v 1>MMM.</v>

141
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.840
<v 0>A second aspect of behaviorism was anti mentalism.</v>

142
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.890
And what I mean by this is the behaviors were obsessed with the idea of doing

143
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:03.891
science and they felt largely in reaction to Freud that claims of an internal

144
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:09.270
mental states like desires,
wishes,
goals,
emotions,
and so on.

145
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.780
Our unscientific,
these invisible,

146
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.800
vague things can never form the basis of a serious science.

147
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.340
And so to behaviors manifesto would then be to develop a science will anything

148
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:28.281
that's unobservable and instead use notions like stimulus and response and

149
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:34.650
reinforcement and punishment and environment that refer to real world and

150
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:35.880
tangible events.

151
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.073
<v 1>Finally,</v>

152
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.890
<v 0>behavior is believed.
There were no interesting differences across species.</v>

153
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.280
I behaviors might admit that a human can do things that a rat or pigeon

154
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:52.010
couldn't,
but behavior is might just say,
look,

155
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.010
there was or just general associate of powers that differ.

156
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.840
Or they may even deny it.
They might say humans and rats aren't different at all.

157
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.340
It's just humans tend to live in a richer environment than rats.
Um,

158
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.530
from that standpoint,

159
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.500
from that theoretical standpoint comes to methodological approach,

160
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.380
which is if they're all the same,

161
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.910
then you can study human learning by studying nonhuman animals.

162
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.210
And that's a lot of what they did.
Okay.

163
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.150
I'm going to frame my introduction,

164
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.500
my discussion of behaviors and in terms of the three main learning principles

165
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.420
that they argued can explain all of human,
um,
mental life,

166
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.160
all of human behavior.
And then I want to turn to objections to behaviorism.

167
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.940
But these three principles are powerful and very interesting.

168
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.990
<v 0>The first is habituation.
This is the very simplest form of learning.</v>

170
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.630
And what this is,
is,
uh,

171
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.720
is re described as a decline in a tendency to respond to stimuli that are

172
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.470
familiar due to repeated exposure.
Hey,

173
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:05.950
<v 1>okay,</v>

174
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.940
<v 0>hey,</v>

175
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.150
the sudden noise startles.
But,
but as it,

176
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.080
as you hear it,
the second time it startles less third time.

177
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.880
It's just me being goofy.
It's just,

178
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.680
it's you get used to things now.
And this,

179
00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:26.071
of course,

180
00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:30.090
it's common enough in everyday life we get used to the ticking of a clock or the

181
00:12:30.091 --> 00:12:32.270
noise of traffic.
Um,

182
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.300
but it's actually a very important form of learning

183
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.403
<v 1>because</v>

184
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.610
<v 0>imagine life without it.
Imagine life where,</v>

185
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.660
where you never got used to anything where,
you know,
something,

186
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.830
somebody steps forward and waves her hand go,
huh.
And then they were drunk girl.

187
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.470
And You keep and you know,
and,
and there's,

188
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.120
there's a loud ticking of a clock and he's like,
whoa.

189
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.540
And you know,
that's not the way animals or humans work.

190
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.530
You get used to things and it's actually critically important to get used to

191
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:09.750
things.
Um,

192
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.910
because it's a useful adaptive mechanism to keep track on new events and

193
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:16.444
objects.

194
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.680
It's important to notice something when it's no because then you have to decide

195
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:24.160
whether it's going to harm you,
how to deal with it,
to attend to it,

196
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.360
but you can't keep on noticing it.

197
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.010
And in fact you should stop noticing it after it's been in an environment for

198
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:33.844
long enough.

199
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.320
So this counts as learning because it happens through experience.

200
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.540
It's a way to learn through experience,
to change it,

201
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.480
your way of thinking through experience.
And also it's useful,
um,

202
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.920
because harmful stimuli are noticed.

203
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.660
But when something has shown itself to be part of the environment,

204
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.050
you don't notice it anymore.
Um,

205
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.080
the existence of habituation is important for many reasons.

206
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.840
One thing that's important for is clever.

207
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:06.250
Developmental psychologists have used habituation as a way to study,

208
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.620
um,
people,

209
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.820
creatures who can talk like nonhuman animals and young babies.

210
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.810
And when I talk on Wednesday,
but developmental psychology,

211
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.300
I'll show different ways in which psychologists have used habituation to study

212
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.960
the minds of young babies.

213
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.830
The second sort of learning is known as classical conditioning.

214
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.860
<v 1>And what this is</v>

215
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.430
<v 0>in a very general sense is the learning of an association between one stimulus</v>

216
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.940
and another stimulus where stimulus is a technical term,

217
00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:46.710
meaning events in an environment like a certain smell or sound or site.

218
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.880
Um,
it was thought up by a Pavlov.

219
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:58.270
This is Pavlov's famous dog and this is an example of scientific serendipity.

220
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.531
Pavlov,

221
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:04.850
when he started this research had no interest at all in learning.

222
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.630
He was interested in saliva and to get saliva he had to have dogs and he had to

223
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:15.980
attach something to dog so that their saliva would pour it out.

224
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:20.230
So he could study saliva,
no idea why he wanted to study alive.
Um,

225
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.100
but he then discovered something.

226
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.230
What he would do is he put food powder in the dog's mouth,
degenerate saliva.

227
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.920
But Pavlov observed that when somebody entered the room who typically gave him

228
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:38.660
the food powder,
the dog to food pattern,
saliva would start to come out.

229
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.790
And later on,
if you right before or right during,

230
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:46.700
you give the dog some food,
you,
you ping a bell,

231
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.800
the bell will cost the saliva to come forth.

232
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.600
Um,
and in fact,
this is the apparatus that he used for his research.

233
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:04.950
He developed a theory plastic conditioning by making a distinction between two

234
00:16:04.951 --> 00:16:09.951
sorts of conditioning to sorts of stimulus response relationships.

235
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:18.210
One is unconditioned and I'm condition is when an unconditioned stimulus gives

236
00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:22.080
rise to an unconditioned response.
And this is what you start off with.

237
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.820
So if somebody pokes you with a stick and you say,
ouch,

238
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.830
because it hurts the poking and the out is an unconditioned stimulus causing an

239
00:16:31.831 --> 00:16:32.700
unconditioned response,

240
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.880
you didn't have to learn that when Pavlov put food powder in a dog's mouth and

241
00:16:37.951 --> 00:16:39.810
saliva was generated,

242
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.010
that's an unconditioned stimulus giving rise and then condition response.

243
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.700
But what happens through learning is that another association develops that

244
00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:54.060
between the condition stimulus and the conditioned response.

245
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.550
So when Pavlov,
for instance,
um,
well when Pav law for instance,

246
00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:02.790
started before conditioning,
there was simply an unconditioned stimulus,

247
00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:07.320
the food and a mouth and an unconditioned response.
Saliva.
The bell was nothing.

248
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.460
Bell was a neutral stimulus.
But over and over again,

249
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.550
if you put the bell and the food together,

250
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.060
<v 1>okay,</v>

251
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.510
<v 0>pretty soon the bell will generate saliva.</v>

252
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.760
And now the bell,
when you start off with the unconditioned stimulus,

253
00:17:24.761 --> 00:17:28.480
unconditioned response,
when the condition stimulus,

254
00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:32.350
an unconditioned stimulus are brought together over and over and over again,

255
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.970
pretty soon the condition stimulus gives rise to the response.

256
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.110
And now it's known as the condition stimulus giving rise to the condition

257
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.970
response.
This is discussed in detail in textbook,
but it also,

258
00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:48.470
I'm going to give it,
don't,
don't panic if you don't get quiet.

259
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.120
Now I'm going to you further and further examples.
Um,

260
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:58.130
so the idea here is repeated pairings of the unconditioned stimulus and the

261
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:01.920
conditioned stimulus,
um,
will give rise to the response.

262
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.840
And there's a difference between reinforced trials and unreinforced trials.
Uh,

263
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:09.210
reinforce trial is when the conditioned stimulus,

264
00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.770
an unconditioned stimulus go together.
Your tee it up,
put it in a crude way.

265
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.970
You're teaching the dog that the bell goes with the food.

266
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.970
An unreinforced trial is when,
um,

267
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.750
you get the food without the bell.
You're not teaching the dog this.

268
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.510
And in fact,
once you teach an animal something,

269
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.630
if you stopped doing the teaching,
the response goes away.

270
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.280
And this is known as extinction.
So here's a graph.
Um,

271
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.450
if you,
you get it,
they really count the number of cubic centimeters a saliva.

272
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.770
The dog is trained so that when the bell comes on,

273
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.210
actually your misframed it,
I'll try again.
When the bell comes,
um,

274
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.280
connected with food,

275
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:57.630
there's a lot of saliva and unreinforced responses when the bill goes on,

276
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.200
but there is no food.
So it's like,
imagine you're,
you're,

277
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:05.930
you're the dog so you get food in the mouth,
bell food,
Bill food,

278
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.753
and now bell.

279
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.680
But next you get bell Bell Bell,

280
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.910
you give it up,
you stop.
This isn't working.

281
00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:20.970
You stop responding to the bell.

282
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.720
A weird thing which is discussing a textbook is if you wait a while and then you

283
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:32.490
try it again,
if the bell,
after a couple of hours,
the saliva comes back.

284
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.740
This is known as spontaneous recovery.

285
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.110
So this all seems very technical phenomena related to animals and the like.

286
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.360
Um,
but it's easy to see how a generalizes and how it extends.

287
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.730
One interesting notion is that a stimulus,

288
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:54.310
generalization and stimulus generalization,
um,

289
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.400
is the topic of one of your articles in the Norden reader.
The one by Watson,

290
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.751
John Watson,

291
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:05.751
the famous behaviors who reported a bizarre experiment with a baby known as

292
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:08.550
little Albert.
Um,
and here's the idea.

293
00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:11.190
A little Albert originally like rats.

294
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.630
If I'm going to show you a movie of Little Albert Originally Liking Rhett's,

295
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.220
see he's okay.
No problem.
Now Watson did something interesting

296
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.970
as little Albert was playing with the Rad.
Oh,
I like rats.
Oh,

297
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.040
Watson wind behind the baby.
This is in the,
it's in the chapter.

298
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.220
And Bang,
the metal bar right there,

299
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.330
baby scream started to sob.
Okay,

300
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.970
what's the unconditioned stimulus?
Somebody,

301
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.730
the loud noise.
The bar to bang.
What's the unconditioned response?

302
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.960
Crying,
sadness,
misery.
Um,

303
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.550
and as a result of this little Albert grew afraid of the rat.

304
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:12.040
So there,
what would be the condition?
Stimulus.

305
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.260
The rat.
What would be the condition response?
Fear.
Excellent.

306
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.840
Moreover,
this,
this fear extended to other things.
So this is,

307
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.510
this is a very weird and unpersuasive clip,

308
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.550
but the idea is the clip is to make the point that the fear will extend to a

309
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:33.310
rabbit,
a white rabbit.
So the first part,

310
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.890
we'll Albert's fine with the white rabbit.

311
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.450
The second part is after he's been conditioned and he's kind of freaked out with

312
00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:40.284
the right rabbit.

313
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.360
The problem is in the second part that we're throwing the rabbit at them,

314
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.820
<v 1>but
now he's,
okay,</v>

315
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.613
Micah,

316
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.290
<v 0>this is going,</v>

317
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.710
this is one of a long list of experiments that we can't do anymore.

318
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.800
<v 1>Um,
so</v>

319
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.230
<v 0>classical conditioning is more than a laboratory phenomenon.
Um,</v>

320
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.440
the findings of classical conditioning have been extended and replicated in all

321
00:22:31.531 --> 00:22:34.830
sorts of animals,
including crabs,

322
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.120
fish,
cockroaches and so on.

323
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.940
And it's been argued to be an extension of

324
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:52.190
argued to underlie certain interesting aspects of human responses.

325
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.950
So I have some examples here.
One example is fear.

326
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.220
So the Little Albert idea,
um,

327
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.200
the little Albert experiment provides an illustration for how phobias could

328
00:23:04.201 --> 00:23:07.800
emerge.
Some proportion of people in this room have phobias.

329
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.830
Imagine you're afraid of dogs.
Well,
a possible story for the,

330
00:23:13.831 --> 00:23:16.850
for why he became afraid of dogs,
um,

331
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:21.450
is that one day a dog came up and he was a neutral stimulus,
no problem.

332
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.280
And all of a sudden he beat you.

333
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:29.390
Now the pain of a bite being bit and then the pain and fear of that is an

334
00:23:30.301 --> 00:23:34.180
unconditioned stimulus.
Unconditioned response.
You're just born with that out.

335
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.070
But the presence of the dog,
there is a condition stimulus.

336
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.930
And so you grew to be afraid of dogs.
If you believe this.

337
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.520
This also forms the basis for ways,

338
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:49.970
for theory of how you could make phobias go away.

339
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.650
How do you make conditioned stimulus?
Conditioned response links go away.

340
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.890
Well what you do is you extinguish no extinguish them when you show the thing

341
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:06.011
that would cause you to have the fear with l the unconditioned stimulus.

342
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:11.210
Here's a,
an illustration.
Um,
it's a joke site.

343
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.630
He's a simultaneous,
the confronting the fear of heights,

344
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.210
snakes and the dark cause he's trapped in that thing.

345
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.760
And the logic is the logic.
The logic is not that he stuck in there.

346
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.360
Those are all the t conditioned stimulus,
but nothing bad happens.

347
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.790
So his fear goes away.

348
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.930
The problem with this is while stuck in there,

349
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.850
he has a screaming horrific panic attack and then it makes us fear much worse.

350
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.590
So what they do now though,

351
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.920
and we'll talk about this much later in the course when we talk about clinical

352
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:43.754
psychology,

353
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.790
but one cure for phobias does draw upon in a more intelligent way to behaviorist

354
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.510
literature.

355
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:55.510
So the claim I've got a phobia is that there's a bad association between say dog

356
00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.060
and fear or between airplanes or snakes and some bad response.

357
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.090
So what they do is what's called systematic desensitization,

358
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.230
which is they expose you to what causes you the fear,

359
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.480
but they relax you at the same time.

360
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.220
So you replace the averse of classical conditioning fear with something more

361
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:17.750
positive.
Um,

362
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.410
traditionally they used to teach people relaxation exercises,

363
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.980
but that proves too difficult.
So nowadays they just pump you full of some drug.

364
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.850
You you're really happy and so you really stoned out of your head.
You're,

365
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:33.050
you're there if the dog,
cause I,
this isn't so bad,
it's more complicated in that,

366
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.520
but the notion is you can use these associated tools perhaps to,
um,

367
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:44.030
to deal with questions about fear,
phobias and how they go away.

368
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.220
Um,
hunger.

369
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.480
We'll spend some time in this course discussing why we eat and when we eat.

370
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.650
And one answer to why we and when we is that there's cues in the environment

371
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:02.030
that are associated with eating and these cues generate,
um,
hunger.

372
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.920
For those of you who,
um,
who are trying to quit smoking,

373
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.010
you'll notice that there's time or quit drinking.

374
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.780
There's times of the day or certain activities that really make you want to

375
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:19.310
smoke are really make you want a drink.
And from a behavioral point of view,

376
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:23.990
this is because of the associated history of these things.
Um,

377
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.730
more speculative lay,
um,

378
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.840
classical conditioning has been argued to,
um,

379
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.140
to be implicated in a formation of sexual desire including fetishes.

380
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:40.810
So a behavior,
a story about fetishes for instance is,
um,

381
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.770
it's straight forward classical conditioning.

382
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.040
Just as your lover's caress brings you to orgasm,

383
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.190
your eyes happen to fall upon the shoe

384
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.930
through the simple tools of plasma conditioning,

385
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:59.931
then the issue becomes a condition stimulus are giving rise to the conditioned

386
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:03.690
response of sexual pleasure.
Um,

387
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.400
this almost certainly is not the right story,
but again,

388
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:12.300
just as an phobia,
some ideas of classic conditioning May,
um,

389
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:17.130
may play some role in determining what we like and what we don't like sexually.

390
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:17.881
And in fact,

391
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:22.881
one treatment for pedophiles and rapists involved controlled fantasies during

392
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:29.601
masturbation to shift the association from domination and violence,

393
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:31.480
for instance,
um,

394
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.190
to develop a more positive associations with sexual pleasure.

395
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:41.030
So the strong class conditioning stories about fetishes and fears sounds silly

396
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:44.580
and extreme and they probably are,
but at the same time,

397
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.760
classic conditioning can be used at least to shape the focus of our desires and

398
00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:54.960
our interest.
Um,
final thought exercise.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

399
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:57.870
So what do we think about classic conditioning?

400
00:27:57.871 --> 00:28:01.610
We talked about what habituation is for,
what's classical conditioning for?
Well,

401
00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:04.890
a traditional view is it's not for anything.
It's just association.

402
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.280
So what happens is the ucs and to see us,

403
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.210
the bell and the food go together because they happen at the same time.

404
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.570
And so classical conditioning should be the strongest when these tourists are

405
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.570
simultaneous.

406
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.740
And the response to one is the same as the response to the other.

407
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.940
This is actually no longer the mainstream view.

408
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.160
The mainstream view is now a little bit more interesting.

409
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.330
It's that what happens in class of conditioning is preparation.

410
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.700
What happens is

411
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.320
you become sensitive to a queue that an event is about to happen and that allows

412
00:28:42.481 --> 00:28:47.040
you to prepare for the event.
Um,
this make certain predictions.

413
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:50.010
It predicts that the best timing is when the condition stimulus,

414
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.030
which is the signal comes before the unconditioned stimulus,

415
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.680
which is what you have to prepare for.

416
00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:01.260
And it says the condition response may be different from the unconditioned

417
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:03.780
response.
So move away from food.

418
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.260
Imagine a child who is being beaten by his father and when his father raises his

419
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:12.960
hand,
he flinches last classical conditioning.

420
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.990
What happened in that cases,

421
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.340
he has learned that the raising of the hand is a signal that he is about to be

422
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:23.820
hit.
And so he responds to that signal.

423
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.540
His flinch is not the same response that one would give if one's hit.

424
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.770
If you're hit,
you don't flinch.
If you hit,

425
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:33.720
you might feel pain or bounce back or something.

426
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.600
Flinching is preparation for being hit.

427
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.830
And in general the idea that what goes on in class of conditioning is that the

428
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:43.750
response is sort of a preparation.

429
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.920
The condition response is a preparation for the unconditioned stimulus.

430
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.140
Um,
glass conditioning shows up all over the place as a final exercise and had to

431
00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:56.350
think about it.
Has Anybody here seen the movie clockwork orange

432
00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.430
audio?
Um,
it's kind of a shocking movie and,

433
00:30:01.431 --> 00:30:05.530
and unpleasant and very violent,
but at its core,

434
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:08.650
one of the main themes is a right out of intro psych.

435
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.700
It's classical conditioning.

436
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.180
So our main character who's a violent murder and rapists is brought in by some

437
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:21.400
psychologists for some therapy and the therapy gets his class with conditioning

438
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.290
in particular,
what happens is he has given a drug that makes him violently ill,

439
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.830
extremely nauseous,
and then his eyes are prompt,

440
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:34.831
open and he's shown scenes of violence as a result of this sort of conditioning.

441
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.970
He then when he experienced his real world violence,

442
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.190
he responds with nausea and shock.

443
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.120
Basically training him to to get away from class from,

444
00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:53.290
from these acts of violence.
In this example,
take a moment.

445
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.590
Don't say it out loud.
Just take a more,
what's the unconditioned stimulus?

446
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.780
Okay.
Anybody?
What's the unconditioned stimulus?
Somebody just say it.
Good.

447
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.040
The drug.
What's the unconditioned response?

448
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.400
Nausea.
What's the condition?
Stimulus.
Violence.

449
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.060
What's the condition response?
Perfect.

450
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.320
The third and final type of learning is known as opera and conditioning or

451
00:31:26.401 --> 00:31:29.340
instrumental conditioning,
and this is the thing.

452
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:34.370
This is the theory championed and developed most extensively by Skinner.

453
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.300
What this is is learning the relationships between what you do and how

454
00:31:41.851 --> 00:31:44.490
successful or unsuccessful they are.

455
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.360
Learning what works and what doesn't.
It's important.

456
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.160
This is very different from classical conditioning and one way to see how this

457
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:56.130
is different is for classical conditioning.
You don't do anything.

458
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.590
You could literally be strapped down and be immobile.
Entities.

459
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.670
Connections are what you appreciate and you make connections in your mind.

460
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.940
Instrumental conditioning is voluntary.

461
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.510
You choose to do things and by dint of your choices,

462
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.720
some choices become more learn than others.

463
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.950
So the idea itself was developed in a nicest form,
um,

464
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.070
by Thorndyke who explored how animals learn.

465
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.860
Remember,
behaviorists work entirely comfortable studying animals and drawing

466
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:38.410
extrapolations to other animals and to humans.

467
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.390
So he would put a cat in a puzzle box.

468
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:47.150
And the trick to a puzzle box is there's a simple way to get out,

469
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.990
but you have to kind of pull on something.
So special lever to make it pop open.

470
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.500
And Thorndyke noted that cats do not solve this problem through insight.

471
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.260
They don't get to sit in the box for a while and mull it over

472
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.850
and then figure out how to do it.
Instead.

473
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:09.851
What they do is they bounce all around doing different things and gradually get

474
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:12.250
better and better at it.
So what they do is,
um,

475
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.900
the first rally might scratch at the bars,
portrait portraits,

476
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.180
ceiling ticketed for Howell,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

477
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.610
And one or their behaviors is pressing the lever.

478
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.040
The lever gets to better to box.

479
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.990
But after more and more trials,
they stopped scratching.

480
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:30.560
At the bar is pushing it to ceiling and so on.
They just pressed the lever.

481
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.660
And if you graph it,
they gradually get better and better.
They throw it,

482
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:37.910
all of these behaviors randomly,

483
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.060
some of them get reinforced.

484
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:46.400
And those are the ones that survive and others don't get reinforced.

485
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.560
And those are the ones that go extinct.

486
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.980
And it might occur to some of you that this seems to be an analogy with a

487
00:33:52.981 --> 00:33:57.730
Darwinian theory of natural selection where there's a random assortment of,

488
00:33:57.731 --> 00:33:58.760
of,
of,
um,

489
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.920
random mutations and sexual selections give rise to a host of organisms,

490
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:08.780
some which survive and are fit and others which aren't.
And in fact,

491
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:10.000
Skinner,
um,

492
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.530
explicitly made the analogy from the natural selection of species to the natural

493
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:17.210
selection of behavior.

494
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.190
So this could be summarized as the law of effect,

495
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.290
which is a tendency to perform an actions increased if rewarded.

496
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:32.420
We can,
if it's not.
And Skinner extended this,
um,

497
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.350
more generally.
So the illustrate,
um,

498
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.570
Skinnerian theory and operant conditioning.
I'll give an example of,

499
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:44.680
of training a pig.
So here's the idea.
You,

500
00:34:44.681 --> 00:34:49.040
you need to train a pig and you need to do so through opera and conditioning.

501
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:56.530
So one of the you want to do is the pig is going to do some things you like and

502
00:34:56.721 --> 00:35:00.800
some things you don't like.
And so what you want to do,

503
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:06.130
basically drawing upon the law of effect is reinforced a pig for doing good

504
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:09.140
things.
So what did you want to pick to walk forward?

505
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.570
So you reinforce the pig for walking forward and you punish the pig for walking

506
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.560
backward.
And if you do that over the fullness of time,

507
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:23.600
your reinforcement and punishment will give rise to a pig who walks forward.

508
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.533
There's two,

509
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:31.070
one technical distinction that people love to put on an intro psych exams is

510
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:34.700
that the different in positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement

511
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.630
reinforcement is something that makes the behavior increase.

512
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.940
Negative reinforcement is very different from punishment,
negative reinforcement.

513
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:49.140
It's just a type of reward.
The differences and positive reinforcement.

514
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:52.590
You do something in negative reinforcement,

515
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.510
you take away something a versa.

516
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.730
So imagine the pig has a heavy color and to reward the pig for walking forward,

517
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.920
you might remove the heavy color.

518
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.870
So these are the basic techniques to train an animal.

519
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.850
But it's kind of silly because the boilers,
you want your pigs,
the dance,

520
00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:17.010
um,
you don't just want you to pick to walk forward,
you want your pig to dance.

521
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:18.443
Well,

522
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.230
you can't adopt the policy of I'm going to wait for this pig to dance and when

523
00:36:24.361 --> 00:36:28.800
it does and went to reinforce it because it would take you a very long time.

524
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.370
Um,
similarly,
if you're dealing with,
um,
with,

525
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:35.790
with immature humans and you want your child to get you a beer,

526
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.110
you can't just sit,
wait for the kid to give you a beer,

527
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:43.620
like grab a bottle and say excellent,
good hugs.

528
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.760
You gotta work your way to it and act of working your way to it is known as

529
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:55.080
shaping.
So here is how to get a pig to dance.

530
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.880
You wait for the pig to do something that's halfway close to dancing,

531
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.180
like stumbling and you reward it.

532
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.970
Then it does something else that's even closer to the dancing.

533
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.790
And you reward it and you keep rewarding it as it gets closer to closer.

534
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.390
Here's how to get your child to bring you some beer.

535
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.680
You say,
Johnny,
could you go to the kitchen and get me some beer?

536
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.290
And he walks to the kitchen and then he forgets why he's there and you went up

537
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.090
there.
You're such a good kid.
Congratulations.
Hugs.
And then,

538
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.600
and then you get them to,

539
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.910
and finally you get them to also open up the refrigerator and get the beer open

540
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:33.744
liver get.

541
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.900
And in that way you can train preachers to do complicated things.

542
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:43.710
Um,
Skinner had many examples of this Skinner developed in World War Two,

543
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:47.760
a pigeon guided missile.
It was never actually used,

544
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.740
but it was a great idea.

545
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:56.390
And people in fact that the history of the military in the United States and

546
00:37:56.581 --> 00:38:00.210
other countries includes a lot of attempts to get animals like pigeons are

547
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:04.830
dolphins to do interesting and deadly things through various training.

548
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.450
Um,
more recreational.
Skinner was fond of teaching animals to play ping pong.

549
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:10.770
And again,

550
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.040
you don't teach an animal play ping pong by waiting for her to play ping pong

551
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:16.720
and then rewarding it.
Rather you,

552
00:38:16.721 --> 00:38:19.380
you reward approximations to it.

553
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.010
Now in basically they're our primary reinforcers.

554
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.990
There are some things pigs naturally like,
um,
food for instance.

555
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.080
There are some things pigs actually automatically don't like,

556
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:39.081
like being hit or but in the real world when dealing with humans.

557
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:41.320
But even when dealing with animals,

558
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.120
we don't actually always use primary reinforcers are negative reinforcement.

559
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.971
What you,

560
00:38:46.971 --> 00:38:51.971
we often use are things like for my dog saying good dog.

561
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.320
Now saying good dog is not something that dog has been built pre wired to find

562
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:03.220
pleasurable.
But what happens is you can do a two step process.

563
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.840
You can make good dog positive through classical conditioning.

564
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.050
You give the dog a treat and say good dog.

565
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:16.540
Now the phrase good dog will carry the rewarding quality and you could use that

566
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:21.430
rewarding quality in order to train it.
And through this way,

567
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.460
behaviors have developed token economies where they get nonhuman animals to do

568
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:31.720
interesting things for seemingly arbitrary rewards like poker chips.

569
00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.430
Um,

570
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:38.140
and in this way you can increase the utility and ease of training.

571
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:39.730
Um,
finally

572
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.910
in the examples we're giving,
whenever the pig does something you like,

573
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:46.750
you reinforce it.

574
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.010
But that's not how real life works.

575
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.910
Real life for both humans and animals involved.

576
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:59.911
Cases where the reinforcement doesn't happen all the time but actually happens

577
00:40:00.851 --> 00:40:02.320
according to different schedules.

578
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:07.980
And so there is a distinction between fixed schedules versus ratios,

579
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.900
variable schedules and ratio versus interval.

580
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.270
And this is something you would print out to look at.

581
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.810
I don't need to go over in detail.
The difference between um,

582
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:21.930
ratio is a reward every certain number of times somebody does something.

583
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:27.930
So if every 10th time your dog brought you to newspaper,

584
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.300
you gave it huddles and treats,

585
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.900
that's ratio and interval is over a period of time.

586
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.970
So if your dog gives you,
um,
if your dog,
I dunno,

587
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.400
dances for an hour straight,

588
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.310
that would be an interval saying and

589
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:51.520
fixed versus variable speaks to whether you give a reward on a fixed schedule

590
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:55.120
like every fifth time or variable,
sometimes under third time,

591
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:57.130
sometimes on the seventh time and so on.

592
00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.450
And these are there examples here and had no need to go over them.

593
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.340
It's easy enough to think of examples,
um,
in real life.
So for example,

594
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.450
um,

595
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:12.220
a slot machine is variable ratio.

596
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.630
It goes off after it's been hit a certain number of times.

597
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.910
It doesn't matter how long it takes you for to do it,

598
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:20.830
it's a number of times you pull it down,

599
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.510
but it's variable because it doesn't always go off and the thousands of time you

600
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:26.980
don't know it's unpredictable.

601
00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.060
The slot machine is a good example of a phenomena known as the partial

602
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:37.880
reinforcement effect.
And this is kind of neat.

603
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:41.120
It makes it makes sense when you hear it,

604
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.510
but it's a sort of finding that's been validated over and over again with

605
00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:48.680
animals and nonhumans.
Here's the idea.

606
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:53.740
Suppose you want to train somebody to do something and you want a training such

607
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.460
that they'll keep on doing it even if you're not training them anymore,

608
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.260
which is typically what you want
if you want that.

609
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.520
The trick is don't reinforce it all the time.

610
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.860
Behaviors last longer.
If they're reinforced intermittently,

611
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.800
and this is known as the partial reinforcement effect.

612
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.170
Thinking of this psychologically as it's as if,

613
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:23.180
if whenever you put something in a slot machine,
it gave you money,

614
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:28.430
then all of a sudden it stopped.
You keep on doing it a few times,

615
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.410
but then he'd say,
fine,
it doesn't work.

616
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.310
But what if it gave you money one out of every hundred times?

617
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.920
Now you keep on trying.

618
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:42.140
And because the reinforcement is intermittent,

619
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.640
you don't expect it as much.

620
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.880
And so your behavior will persist across often a huge amount of time.

621
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.920
I mean,
here's a good example.

622
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:57.970
What's the very worst thing to do when your kid cries to go into bed with you?

623
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

624
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.000
<v 0>And you don't want him to go into bed with you.
Well,
one,</v>

625
00:43:04.001 --> 00:43:08.230
the worst thing to do is for any asked you for any form of discipline with a kid

626
00:43:08.231 --> 00:43:13.000
is to say no.
Absolutely not.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

627
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:13.893
Okay.

628
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.090
And then later on the kid's going to say,
I want to do it again.

629
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.653
<v 1>And</v>

630
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:24.340
<v 0>you say,
no.
I think he's,
uh,</v>

631
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.620
the kid keeps asking because you could put it the way,

632
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:30.700
I'll put it in a psychological way,
not the way to behaviors.
We've put it,

633
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.220
the kid knows,
oh,
he's not going to get it right away.
He's gonna keep on asking.

634
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.600
And so typically what you're doing in the advertently in those situations is

635
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.430
you're exploiting the partial reinforcement effect.

636
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:48.410
If I want my kid to do something,
I should say yes one out of every 10 times.

637
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:54.130
Unfortunately that's the evolution of nagging because you nag,

638
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:58.430
Nag,
Nag person says fine.
Okay.

639
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:03.140
And that reinforces it.
Um,

640
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.210
if Skinner kept the focus on rats and pigeons and dogs,

641
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.360
um,
he would not have the impact that he did,

642
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:16.870
but he argued that you could extend all of these notions to humans and the human

643
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:19.550
behavior.
So for example,

644
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:24.580
he argued that the prison system needs to be reformed because instead of

645
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.820
focusing on notions of justice and retribution,
um,

646
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:34.230
well we should do is focus instead on questions of reinforcing good behaviors

647
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.640
and punishing bad ones.

648
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.840
He argued for the notions of awkward and conditioning to be extended to everyday

649
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.690
life.

650
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:47.550
And argue that people's lives would became fuller and more satisfying if they

651
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:49.680
were controlled in a properly behaviors.

652
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:50.743
<v 1>Wait,</v>

653
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.050
<v 0>any questions about behaviorism?</v>

654
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.270
What are your questions about behaviorism?

655
00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.693
<v 1>Wow.</v>

656
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.043
Yes.

657
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.423
<v 0>Good question.</v>

658
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:26.100
The discussion was over using things like poker chips for reinforcement,

659
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.320
and the point is exactly right.

660
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.260
Since the connection of the poker chips is established through classical

661
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:34.110
conditioning,
sooner or later by that logic,

662
00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:37.770
the poker chips would lose their power to serve as reinforce it.

663
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.710
You'd have to sort of start it up again.
Retrain.

664
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:41.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

665
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.430
<v 0>Again,
if you have a dog and you say,</v>

666
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:47.730
good dog to reward the dog by your logic,
which is right,

667
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.610
at some point you might as well give the dog a treat.
A lot of good dog,

668
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.100
otherwise good dog is not gonna cut it anymore.

669
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.700
<v 1>Yes.
Brilliant.</v>

670
00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.180
<v 0>Um,
as far as I know,
um,</v>

671
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:10.220
Skinner and Skinnerian psychologist were never directly involved in the creation

672
00:46:10.221 --> 00:46:13.400
of prisons.
On the other hand,
the psychological theory,

673
00:46:13.401 --> 00:46:18.320
behaviorism has had a huge impact and I think a lot of people's ways of thinking

674
00:46:18.321 --> 00:46:22.970
about criminal justice and criminal law has been shaped by behavior principles.

675
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:24.200
So,
for instance,

676
00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:29.330
institutions like mental institutions and some prisons have installed token

677
00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:34.320
economies where there's rewards for good behavior,
often poker chips of a sword,

678
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.410
and then you could cash them in for other things.

679
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.100
And to some extent these had been shaped by an adherence to behaviors.

680
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.963
Principles.

681
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.240
<v 1>Okay.
Um,</v>

682
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:52.790
<v 0>so here are the three general positions of behaviorism,</v>

683
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.170
um,
that there is no innate knowledge.

684
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:03.260
All you need is learning that you could explain human psychology without mental

685
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.690
notions like desires and goals.

686
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:12.010
And at these mechanisms apply across all domains and across all species.

687
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.270
I think it's fair to say that right now,

688
00:47:17.271 --> 00:47:20.750
just about everybody agrees all of these three claims are mistaken.

689
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

690
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.320
<v 0>First,
we know that it's not true,
that everything is learned.</v>

691
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.090
There's considerable evidence,

692
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.760
different forms of innate knowledge and innate desires.
And we'll look,
look when,

693
00:47:33.761 --> 00:47:35.890
we'll talk about it in detail.

694
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:38.990
When we look at case studies like language learning,
uh,

695
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.020
the development of sexual preference,

696
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.690
the developing understanding of material objects,

697
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.910
there's a lot of debate over how much is innate and what the character of the

698
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:50.590
builtin mental systems are.

699
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.040
But there's nobody who delts nowadays that I considerable amount for humans and

700
00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:58.990
Fernando other animals is built in.

701
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.460
Is it true that talking about mental state does unscientific?
Um,

702
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.190
nobody believes this anymore,
either.
A science,

703
00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.030
particularly more advanced sciences like physics or chemistry are all a belt

704
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:18.170
unobservable is they're all about things you can't see.
Um,

705
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:23.370
and it makes sense to explain complex and intelligent behavior in terms of

706
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:29.410
internal mechanisms and internal representations.
Once again,

707
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.010
the computer revolution has served as an illustrative case study.
Um,

708
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.980
if you have a computer that plays chess and you want to explain how the computer

709
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:39.814
plays chess,

710
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:44.500
it's impossible to do so without talking about the programs and mechanisms

711
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.450
inside the computer.

712
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.720
Is it true that animals need reinforcement and punishment to learn?
Now,

713
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.550
and there's several demonstrations at the time of Skinner suggesting that they

714
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:58.280
don't.

715
00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:03.090
This is from a classic study by Toleman where rats were taught to,
um,

716
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.180
run a maze.
And what they found was the rats did fine.

717
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.290
They learn to run a maze faster and faster when they're regularly rewarded.

718
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.940
But they also learned to run a maze faster and faster if they're not rewarded at

719
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:19.480
all.
So to reward helps,

720
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:23.650
but the reward is in no sense,
um,
necessary.

721
00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.790
And here's a more sophisticated illustration of the same point

722
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:35.380
and this is a sort of finding an old finding from before most of you were born.

723
00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.550
Um,

724
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:41.500
that was a huge embarrassment for the Skinnerian theory as I suggest that rats

725
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.020
in fact hadn't mental maps,
um,

726
00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:49.130
an internal mechanism that he used to understand the world entirely contrary to

727
00:49:49.131 --> 00:49:50.230
the behaviorist idea,

728
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:54.520
everything can be explained in terms of reinforcement and punishment.

729
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:56.620
Um,
finally,

730
00:49:56.621 --> 00:50:00.940
is it true that there's no animal specific constraints for learning?

731
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:05.020
And again,
the answer seems to be no.
Um,
animals for instance,

732
00:50:05.021 --> 00:50:10.021
have natural responses so you could train a pigeon to peck for food.

733
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.160
But that's because packing for food is a very natural response,

734
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:19.570
is very difficult to train it,
to peck,
to escape a situation.

735
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.680
You can train it to flap its wings to escape a situation,

736
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.010
but it's very difficult to get it to flap.
It's wings for food.

737
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.770
And the idea is they have sort of natural responses that these learning

738
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:33.710
situations might exploit and my channel,

739
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:39.190
but essentially they do have certain natural ways of acting towards the world.

740
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.113
Um,

741
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:46.150
we know that not all stimuli and responses are created equal.

742
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:51.460
So the Grade Hex book has a very nice discussion of the Garcia effect and the

743
00:50:52.941 --> 00:50:54.590
Garcia effect goes like this.

744
00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:56.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

745
00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.900
<v 0>Does anybody here have any food aversions?</v>

746
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:04.610
I don't mean foods you don't like.
I mean foods that,
that really make you sick.

747
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

748
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.180
<v 0>Often food aversions and humans and other animals can be formed through it.</v>

749
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.020
A form of association.

750
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:20.390
What happens is suppose you have the flu and you get very nauseous and then at

751
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:23.750
the same point you eat some Sashimi for the first time.

752
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:29.030
The connection between being nauseous and eating a new food is very potent.

753
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:34.360
And even if you know intellectually full well that the Sashimi isn't why you

754
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:36.350
became nauseous,

755
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.790
still you'll develop an aversion to this new food.

756
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:45.020
When I was younger,
uh,
when I was a teenager,

757
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:49.630
I dranked as a Greek Lik cure,
uh,
Ouzo with,
uh,

758
00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.550
with beer.
I didn't really have a flu at the time,

759
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:57.700
but I became violently ill and as a result I cannot abide the smell of that

760
00:51:59.511 --> 00:52:04.440
Greek word cure.
Now thank God it didn't develop an aversion to beer but but

761
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.880
but small miracles but um,

762
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:11.600
but the smell is the smell is very distinctive and for me was new to me.

763
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.490
And so through the Garcia effect I developed a strong aversion was interesting

764
00:52:16.491 --> 00:52:18.680
though is the version is special.

765
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.160
So if you take an animal and you give it a new food and then you give it a drug

766
00:52:24.231 --> 00:52:26.570
to make it nauseous,
it will avoid that food.

767
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:31.850
But if you take an animal and you give it a new food and then you shock it very

768
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:34.910
painfully,
it won't avoid a new food.

769
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.250
And the idea is that a connection when what something tastes and getting sick,

770
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:44.990
it is natural.
We are hardwired to say,
look,

771
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.750
if I'm needed a new food and I'm going to get nauseous,

772
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.460
I'm going to avoid that food.

773
00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:54.950
The Garcia fact is that this is special to taste.
The nausea,

774
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.430
it doesn't extend more generally.
Finally,

775
00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:03.320
I talked about phobias and now return to phobias later on in this course,

776
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:08.560
but the claim that people have formed their phobias through classical

777
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:12.590
conditioning is almost always wrong.
Instead,

778
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:16.970
it turns out that there are certain phobias that were specially evolve to have.

779
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.380
So both humans and chimpanzees for instance,

780
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.380
are particularly prone to develop fears of snakes.

781
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.070
And when we talk about the emotions later on in the course,

782
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.900
we'll talk about this in more detail,

783
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:36.330
but what seems likely is the sort of phobias you're likely to have does not have

784
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:38.850
much to do with your personal history,

785
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:44.280
but rather it has a lot to do with your evolutionary history.
Finally,

786
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:49.290
the other reading you're going to do for this part section of the course is

787
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:53.730
Chomsky's classic article.
His review of verbal behavior,
um,

788
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:57.000
Chomsky is one of the most prominent intellectuals alive.

789
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.010
He's still a professor at Mit,

790
00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:03.160
still publishes on language and thought among other matters.
Um,

791
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.200
and the excerpt you're going to read is from his review of verbal behavior.

792
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:12.600
And this is one of the most influential intellectual documents ever written in

793
00:54:12.601 --> 00:54:17.601
psychology because it took the entire discipline of behaviorism and more than

794
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:18.750
everything else,

795
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:23.870
more than any other event could be said to have destroyed it or ended it as a

796
00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:27.520
dominant intellectual endeavor.
And Chomsky,

797
00:54:27.521 --> 00:54:29.760
his argument is complicated and interesting,

798
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:33.430
but the main sort of argument he had to make is go,

799
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.900
it goes like this when it comes to humans,

800
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:42.980
the notions of reward and punishment and so on that Skinner tried to extend the

801
00:54:43.171 --> 00:54:47.610
humans are so vague,
it's not science anymore.

802
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.380
And remember the discussion we had with regard to Freud with Skinner Chomsky is

803
00:54:52.381 --> 00:54:57.150
raising here is the concern of an falsifiability.
So here's a sort of example.

804
00:54:57.151 --> 00:54:59.580
He would discuss Skinner in his book.

805
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:04.230
Verbal behavior talks about the question of why do we do things like talk to

806
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:08.610
ourselves.
Imitate sounds,
create art,
give bad news to an enemy,

807
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.740
fantasize about pleasant situations.

808
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:13.950
And Skinner says that they all involve reinforcement.

809
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.050
Those are all reinforced behaviors.

810
00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:21.930
But Skinner doesn't literally mean that when we talk to ourselves,

811
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.640
somebody gives us food pellets.

812
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.550
He doesn't literally mean even that when we talk to ourselves,

813
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:30.360
somebody passes on a headset.
Good man.
Perfect.
I'm very proud

814
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.660
what he means.
For instance,

815
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:38.661
this case is well talk into yourself as self reinforcing or I'm giving bad news

816
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:43.440
to an enemy is reinforcing because it makes your enemy feel bad.

817
00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.630
Well,
Chomsky says the problem is it's not that that's wrong,

818
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:53.190
that's all true.
It's just so vague as to be useless.

819
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.760
Skinner isn't saying anything more to say.

820
00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:01.860
Giving bad news to an enemy is reinforcing because it makes the enemy feel bad.

821
00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:06.660
Doesn't say anything different from giving bad news to an enemy feels good

822
00:56:06.661 --> 00:56:08.520
because we like to give bad news to an enemy.

823
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:12.090
It just putting in more scientific terms more generally,

824
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:17.091
Chompsky suggests that the law of effect when applied to humans is either

825
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:25.190
trivially true trivially or uninterruptedly true or scientifically robust and

826
00:56:28.061 --> 00:56:29.110
obviously false.

827
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:35.400
So if you want to expand the notion of reward or reinforcement to anything,

828
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:42.990
then it's true.
So why did you,
um,
why did you come?

829
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:46.660
Those of you who are not freshmen,
oh,
why did you come?
All of you.

830
00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.780
Why did you come to Yale for a second semester?
Well,

831
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:54.490
I repeated my action because the first semester was rewarding.
Okay.

832
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.930
What do you mean by that?
Well,

833
00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:58.810
you don't literally mean that somebody rewarded you,

834
00:56:58.811 --> 00:57:00.970
like gave you pellets and stuff.
Um,

835
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:04.720
well you mean as you chose to come here for the second semester and there's

836
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:08.320
nothing wrong with saying that,
but we shouldn't confuse it with science.

837
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.090
And more generally,

838
00:57:10.091 --> 00:57:15.091
the problem is you can talk about what other people do in terms of reinforcement

839
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:18.370
and punishment and operative conditioning,
classical conditioning.

840
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.590
But in order to do so,

841
00:57:20.591 --> 00:57:24.640
you have to use terms like punishment and reward and reinforcement in such a

842
00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:28.690
vague way that in the end you're not saying anything scientific.

843
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:35.700
So behaviorism as a dominant intellectual field has faded,

844
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.180
but it still leaves behind an important legacy and instilled,

845
00:57:43.081 --> 00:57:48.081
it still stands as one of the major contributions of 20th century psychology.

846
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:50.380
Um,
for one thing,

847
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.770
it has given us a richer understanding of certain learning mechanisms,

848
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:58.030
particularly with regard to nonhumans mechanisms like habituation,

849
00:57:58.031 --> 00:58:00.400
classical conditioning and operant conditioning are real.

850
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:04.900
They can be scientifically studied and they play an important role in the lives

851
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:08.290
of animals and probably an important role in human lives as well.

852
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:12.790
They just don't explain everything.
Finally,

853
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:17.050
and this is something we're going to return to on Wednesday,
actually.
Um,

854
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.250
behaviors have provided powerful techniques for training,

855
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.610
particularly for nonverbal creatures.

856
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:27.280
So this extends to animal trainers,

857
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.120
but it also extends to people who want to teach young children and babies and

858
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:35.020
also want to help populations like the severely autistic are the severely

859
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:39.160
retarded.
Many of these behaviors,
techniques have proven to be quite useful.

860
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:42.670
And in that regard,
as well as in other regards,

861
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:44.620
it stands as an important contribution.
