1
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.180
I'm delighted to introduce the first guest lecturer for this introduction to

2
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.370
psychology course,
a dean,
Peter Salivate.

3
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.640
Uh,
Peter is an old friend and colleague,
many of you.

4
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:31.500
I think everybody here knows of him through his role as dean of Yale College.
Um,

5
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.250
I'll just in the context of this introduction mentioned two other things about

6
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.170
him.
One is,
um,

7
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.410
prior to being dean and in fact still as a dean,

8
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.700
he's an active scientist and in particular a social psychologist.

9
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.840
I'm actively involved in studying a health psychology,

10
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.000
the proper use of psychological methods to frame a health messages and also is

11
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.810
the founder and developer of the idea of emotional intelligence and ID.

12
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:01.050
He's done a huge amount of research on.
Secondly,
um,

13
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.550
Peter is a or was a,

14
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.690
an active and extremely well known teacher at Yale College.

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.100
He taught at one point the largest course ever in Yale College,

16
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:15.750
of course in psychology and law,
which broke every record ever had here.

17
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.820
Um,
and before that,

18
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:22.470
during that and after that he was a legendary introduction to a psychology

19
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:23.250
teacher.

20
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.300
And I think any at some reason for why he was so legendary with his lecture

21
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:29.400
today on the topic of love.

22
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.540
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

23
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.820
thanks very much.

24
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.370
Is that okay?
Okay.
Okay.

25
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.400
<v 0>Okay.
Thank you very much professor bloom.</v>

26
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.430
It really is a pleasure to come and lecture to you today on Valentine's Day.

27
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.320
On the topic of love.
Uh,

28
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.380
my main area of research is human emotion and love is an emotion.

29
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:23.630
It's not one that I study personally,
at least not in the lab.
And,
um,

30
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.730
uh,
but it is fun to talk about and it is a,

31
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.510
a topic that lends itself to many social psychological phenomena.

32
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.410
Uh,
it's also great to be able to come in and guest lecture.

33
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:37.320
One of the things I very much miss,
uh,

34
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.940
since serving as Dean is the opportunity to teach psychology one 10.

35
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.190
And although I love being dean,
I do miss teaching introductory psychology,

36
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.750
uh,
the feeling of a exposing people to,
uh,

37
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.520
ideas that maybe you hadn't heard before.
Well,

38
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:57.460
I suspect some of the ideas in this talk you'll have not heard before.
Uh,

39
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.250
and for a variety of reasons.

40
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.220
A couple of the things you'll notice is that some of the experiments I'll talk

41
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.150
about today are not the kinds of experiments that can be done anymore.

42
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:10.330
They're not considered a ethically acceptable,

43
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.920
but they were done in the fifties and sixties and early seventies when,

44
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.570
uh,
ethical standards were different.
And,
um,
uh,

45
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.770
so we can teach them,

46
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:24.520
we just can't give you the same experiences that some of the college students,

47
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.700
uh,
that we'll talk about today in these studies ahead.

48
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.680
The other thing I will mention is that there is a certain,
um,
uh,

49
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.770
and Roe centric and heterosexual quality to much of the social psychological

50
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:42.260
research on romantic love.
A,

51
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.080
you'll see that in the experiments.

52
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.920
Usually the participants are men and usually the targets are,
uh,

53
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.280
women in these experiments.

54
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.670
I'm not endorsing this as the only way to study love.

55
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.350
It just happens to be the way these experiments were done.
And so I,
I,

56
00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:02.650
I mentioned this caution,
uh,
right from the beginning.
We'll have to think about.

57
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:07.330
One of the things you should think about is do you think these experiments

58
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:12.280
generalize to other,
uh,
kinds of dyadic relationships?

59
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.900
Uh,
and,
uh,
that's a question that I think you can,
you,

60
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.440
you can ask throughout this lecture.
Okay.
So let's get started.

61
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.140
And to start things off,
uh,

62
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.120
I think what we need to do is consider a,

63
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.390
a definition.
I'm in a define what love is,

64
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.800
but then most of the experiments I'm going to talk about are really focused more

65
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:40.650
on a traction then wove who finds each other,
uh,

66
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.730
of romantic interest.
Um,

67
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.500
that might then develop into a love relationship.

68
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.780
But let's start with a definition of love.

69
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.050
And I'm going to pick a definition from a former colleague Robert Sternberg who

70
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:01.320
is now the dean at Tufts University but was here on our,

71
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.930
our faculty yell for nearly 30 years or so.
And uh,

72
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:10.840
he has a theory of love that argues that it's made up of three components,

73
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.860
intimacy,

74
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.190
passion and commitment or what is sometimes called decision commitment.

75
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.980
And these are relatively straight forward.

76
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.240
He argued that you don't have love if you don't have all three of these

77
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.010
elements.
Intimacy is the feeling of closeness,

78
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.850
of connectedness with someone of bonding.

79
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.530
Operationally,
you could think of intimacy as you share secrets.

80
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.600
You share information with this person that you don't share with anybody else.

81
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.060
Okay?
That's really what intimacy is.

82
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.300
The bond that comes from sharing information that isn't shared with other with

83
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:56.130
many other people.
Second,
uh,

84
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.550
element,
uh,
is passion.
Passion is what you think.
Uh,
it,

85
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.640
it is a passion is uh,
uh,
the drug.

86
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.890
We would say the drive that leads to romance.

87
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.940
You can think of it as physical attraction or sex.

88
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.043
And um,

89
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.800
Sternberg argues that this is a required component of a love relationship.

90
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.760
It is not,
however,
a required component of taking a shower in Calhoun college.

91
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.923
The third,

92
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.600
the third element of love in Sternberg's theory is what,

93
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.180
what he calls decision or commitment.

94
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.420
The decision that one is in a love relationship,

95
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:45.950
the willingness to label it as such,

96
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.400
and a commitment to maintain that relationship,

97
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.810
at least for some period of time.
Sternberg would argue it's not love.

98
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:58.280
If you don't call it love and if you don't have some desire to maintain the

99
00:06:58.281 --> 00:06:59.114
relationship.

100
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.380
So if you have all three of these intimacy,

101
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.360
passion and commitment in Sternberg's theory,
you have love.

102
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.380
Now what's interesting about the theory is what do you have if you only have one

103
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.850
out of three or two out of three,
uh,
what,

104
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:23.360
what do you have and how is it different if you have a different two out of

105
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.670
three,
uh,
uh,
these are,

106
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.140
what's interesting about this kind of theorizing is it give,

107
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.200
it gives rise to many different permutations that when you break them down and

108
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:39.560
start to look at them carefully can be quite interesting.

109
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800
So what I've done is I've taken a Sternberg's three elements of love,

110
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.760
intimacy,
passionate commitment,

111
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.620
and I've listed out the different kinds of relationships.

112
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:55.100
One would have if you had zero one,

113
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:58.310
two or three out of the three elements,

114
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.410
and I'm using names or types that Sternberg uses in his theory,

115
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:07.220
these are really from him.
Some of these are pretty obvious.

116
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.640
If you don't have intimacy,
if you don't have passion,

117
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:13.550
if you don't have commitment,
you don't have love.

118
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.840
A Sternberg calls this non love,
that's the technical term.

119
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.590
And um,
uh,

120
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.810
essentially what he's saying is the relationship you now have to the person

121
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:24.740
sitting next to you,

122
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.760
presuming that you're sitting next to a random person that you didn't know from

123
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.750
your college,
uh,
is probably non love.

124
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.980
If it's something else,
we can talk about it at the end of the lecture,
uh,

125
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.190
or perhaps when I get to it in a moment.
Now let's start to add elements.

126
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.470
Let's add intimacy.
This is a sharing,
uh,

127
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.970
secrets,
a feeling of closeness,
connectedness,
bonding.

128
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.380
Let's say we have that with someone,

129
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.060
but we don't have passion that is no sexual arousal and no commitment to

130
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.800
maintain the relationship.

131
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.830
This is liking Sternberg calls it liking and liking is really,

132
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.640
uh,
what is happening in most typical friendships.

133
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.110
Not your closest friendship,
but friendships,
uh,
of a,

134
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.780
of a casual kind.
You feel close,

135
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.470
you share certain information with that person that you don't share with other

136
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.860
many other people,
but you're not physically attractive.

137
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:30.780
And there's no particular commitment to maintaining this for a long period of

138
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:35.700
time.
Now,
what if you're not in a minute,
you're not committed,

139
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.240
but you're passionate.
You feel that sexual arousal,

140
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.890
this is what a Starbuck would call infatuation.

141
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:48.700
And that term probably works for you too.
Infatuated,
love.
And uh,

142
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.130
this is love at first sight.
I don't know you,

143
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.600
we've never shared any secrets because I don't know you.
I'm not,

144
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.130
I'm not committed to defining this as anything.
I'm not committed to the future.

145
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.640
In fact,
I'm not thinking about the future.
I'm thinking about right now.
But boy,

146
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:09.720
am I attracted.
All right.
That's,
that's,
that's infatuation.

147
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.320
And that's what Sternberg means by infatuated love.

148
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.910
The third kind of one element relationship.

149
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.140
If there's no intimacy,
right?
No bonding,
no closest,
no secrets,

150
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.950
no physical attraction,
no sexual arousal.

151
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.200
But by Gosh,
we are going to maintain this relationship.

152
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.470
We are committed to it,
uh,
for all time.

153
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.750
Starbuck calls that empty love,
empty love is kind of interesting.
Um,

154
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.810
it's often the final stage of longterm relationships that have gone bad.

155
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.490
We don't share information with each other anymore.
So there's no intimacy.

156
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.930
We don't feel physically attracted to each other anymore.

157
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.250
There's no passion,

158
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.710
but we better stay together for the kids,
right?

159
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.560
Or We'd better stay together for appearances sake.

160
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.880
We better stay together because financially it would be a disaster if we don't,

161
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.740
or all of the reasons other than intimacy and passion that people might commit

162
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.340
to each other.
That's what Sternberg calls empty love.
Now,

163
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:22.341
what's interesting is in societies where marriages are arranged,

164
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.130
this is often the first stage of a,

165
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.990
of a love relationship.

166
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.380
These two people who've maybe never seen each other before,

167
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.270
who have never shared secrets,
so there's no intimacy who have never,

168
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:41.271
I don't know if they're physically attracted to each other or on their wedding

169
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.280
day revealed to each other and committed legally and sometimes religiously,

170
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.210
uh,
to each other,
right?
The commitment is there,
but at that moment,

171
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.460
nothing else might be there.
What's interesting of course,

172
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:59.461
is that such relationships don't seem to have any greater chance of ending in

173
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:04.720
divorce then people who marry for love,

174
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.000
but there's a big con found,

175
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:10.900
there's a big problem in studies of those kind of relationships.

176
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.070
What might it be?

177
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.453
<v 1>Anybody,</v>

178
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.590
<v 0>what might be the problem in the statement I just made that these kind of</v>

179
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:21.430
relationships are just as likely to survive as people who married for love.

180
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.023
<v 1>Yes.</v>

181
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.270
<v 0>Yeah.
So they,
the,
the,
they may occur,</v>

182
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:32.980
they're more likely to occur in societies that frown on divorce,

183
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.540
that make it very costly,
uh,
socially costly,
uh,
to divorce.

184
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:41.860
So they may stay together for all kinds of reasons.
Not always such good ones.

185
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.930
All right.
Now,
um,
who was it?
Who has it?
Who Sang the song?
Uh,

186
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.320
two out of three a bed.
Does that meat loaf,

187
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.390
who was it?
It was meatloaf fight.

188
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.110
Preferably if professor bloom says it was Meatloaf,
it was meatloaf.

189
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.710
You're all saying there was a sailor called meatloaf.

190
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.650
Meatloaf sang the song.
Two out of three ain't bad.
Let's see if two out of three,

191
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.790
eight bad.
What if you have,
uh,
intimacy?

192
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.860
We share secrets,
passion.

193
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.580
We feel physically attracted to each other,

194
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.290
but we're not making any commitments here.
Starboard calls that romantic love.

195
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.220
This is a physical attraction with close bonding,

196
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.720
but no commitment.
Romeo and Juliet when they first met.

197
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.800
Uh,
this is often the way relationships a start.

198
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.690
We like each other.
I'm physically attracted to each other.
I tell you,

199
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.710
I enjoy spending time with you,

200
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.270
but I'm not making any long term commitment so I'm not even willing to use the l

201
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:50.050
word in describing what it is we have,
right?

202
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.640
Many of you might've been in relationships of this sort.
That's,
that's romance,

203
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:58.600
that's romantic glove.
Now what have you have?
Intimacy.
We share,

204
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.000
uh,
secrets with each other,
but there's no particular physical attraction,

205
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.960
but we are really committed to this relationship.

206
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:13.000
This is what Sternberg coast companion at love.
This is your best friend.

207
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.870
We are committed to sharing intimacy,
to be friends forever,

208
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.400
but physical attraction is not part of the equation here.

209
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.480
This is sort of the,
uh,
maybe the Greek ideal,
uh,
in,
uh,

210
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.180
relationships of some kind.
All right?
What if we have passion?

211
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.420
I'm sexually attracted to you,
but no intimacy.

212
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.820
I don't want to really know that much about you.
I don't really,

213
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:39.100
really share anything of me with you,

214
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.320
but I am committed to maintaining this physical attraction to you.

215
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.580
Well,
that's uh,
what Sternberg calls fatuous love.

216
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:51.980
It's a whirlwind courtship.
It's a Hollywood romance.

217
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.260
It might lead to a shotgun wedding.

218
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.060
Maybe you find yourself in Las Vegas and you get married for a day and a half.

219
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:02.840
And uh,
and then realize that this wasn't such a good idea.

220
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:06.290
And maybe your name is Brittany and you're a singer.
Well,
anyway,
you got the,

221
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.600
<v 1>okay,</v>

222
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.190
<v 0>you got the idea.
Uh,
that's,
that's fatuous love.</v>

223
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.470
Uh,
we are,
we are basically committed to each other for sex,

224
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.490
but it's very hard to make those relationships last a long time because we might

225
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:24.370
not have anything in common.
We might not share anything with each other.

226
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.110
We might not trust each other.
We're not particularly bonded to each other.

227
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.680
On the other hand,
if you have all three NMSC passion,
commitment,

228
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.030
this is consummate love according to starboard complete love.

229
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.860
This is how he defines love.
Okay?

230
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.120
So now you have a definition of love and you can now as a homework assignment,

231
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:46.720
uh,

232
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.720
sit down tonight and make a list of every person you know by the three elements

233
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.280
of love and just start putting the check marks in the boxes and tallying up your

234
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:05.650
personal love box score.
And uh,
we don't want to collect those.

235
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.550
We don't even want to see those.
But um,
you can have fun with that.

236
00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:12.490
Then you can ask the other people to do it too and you can compare with each

237
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:17.470
other.
And uh,
you know,
if you all survive this exercise,
you'll be better for it.

238
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.380
You know,
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

239
00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:23.260
That's the idea behind that exercise.
All right,

240
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:29.070
now the social psychology of love really has been a social psychology of

241
00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:34.780
attraction.
What makes people find each other attractive?

242
00:16:34.781 --> 00:16:37.300
What makes them want to be intimate?

243
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.600
What makes them physically desirable to each other?

244
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.770
What might lead to a commitment,
a decision to make,

245
00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:49.030
a commitment to make the relationship last.

246
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.230
This is just so nice.

247
00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:53.350
I'm giving this lecture on love and the two of you are holding hands here in
the,

248
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.030
in the front row.
It's really

249
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.600
all three elements present,
intimacy,
passion and yeah.
Okay.

250
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.730
Just checking.
Just checking.
Okay.

251
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.760
So what's interesting about the social psychology of attraction is it as focused

252
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:24.400
on seven variables and I've divided these into two groups,

253
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.230
the big three and the more interesting for,
and I call them the big,

254
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:34.290
the big three are three variables that the effects are so powerful that they

255
00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:37.330
almost don't need to be discussed in much detail.

256
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.110
The more interesting for the ones I'm going to focus on in this lecture because

257
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.720
there are a bit more subtle and uh,

258
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.140
they may be a thing that you've never heard of before,

259
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.680
but let's quickly talk about the three.

260
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.070
The way to understand the big three is with the phrase all other things being

261
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:59.370
equal,
all other things being equal.

262
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.400
People who find themselves in clothes,

263
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.520
spatial proximity to each other,

264
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.530
like sharing an armrest in a lecture.
Uh,

265
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.970
we'll be,

266
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.980
we'll be more likely to be attracted to each other and form a romantic

267
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:20.130
relationship.
Okay.
All other things being equal.

268
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.520
Now this has been tested in lots of interesting ways.

269
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.510
Studies have been done in the city of New York where you can,

270
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.740
if you live in Manhattan,

271
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:33.000
you can actually get a very nice metric of how far apart people live from each

272
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:34.620
other in city blocks,
right?

273
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:38.840
You have a nice grid pattern and you can use a city block metric to,
to uh,

274
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.980
add up the number of blocks between people's stores and people who live more

275
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:48.981
closely together are more likely to end up in romantic relationships with each

276
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:54.210
other.
It seems kind of obvious,
right?
Uh,
this even works on college campuses.

277
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:59.211
We can measure in feet the distance between the door to your room and the door

278
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:02.700
to every other room of a student on campus.

279
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.770
And there will be a correlation between the likelihood of a negative

280
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:08.281
correlation,

281
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:12.990
the likelihood of getting into a romantic relationship with a person and the

282
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:16.740
number of feet between your door and that person's door.

283
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.480
The fewer feet,
the more likely a romantic relationship,

284
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.660
all other things being equal.
Now,

285
00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:28.740
all other things being equal is a big qualifier,
right?

286
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.400
But if we can statistically control for every other variable,

287
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.450
all I'd need to do is measure the distance from your door to everybody else's

288
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:41.410
door on campus.
And I could chart out who's going to fall in love with whom,
uh,

289
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.320
on the yell a campus.
Now this idea,

290
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.890
uh,
in a way,
um,
is,

291
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.080
uh,
I don't know,
maybe it's a little counter intuitive.

292
00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:00.000
There's a kind of cultural myth around the,
uh,
the stranger,

293
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:04.290
the person you don't know who you,
uh,
will,
uh,

294
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.460
who you fall in love with.

295
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.110
And that is not likely to be the case if it's the person who's nearby.

296
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.040
Right?
And you'll see as we go through the other big thing,

297
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.450
the other two big three,
uh,
that,
uh,
there's a,
uh,

298
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:21.090
a kind of repetition of this theme.

299
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.360
It isn't the stranger you fall in love with.
All right,

300
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:26.250
let's continue down similarity.

301
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.330
You've probably heard the phrase birds of a feather flock together.

302
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.540
And that's true when it comes to romance on any dimension that psychologists

303
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:40.530
have measured in these kinds of studies.

304
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.690
When people are more similar,
they are more likely to find each other,
uh,

305
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.770
attractive.

306
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.040
This could be obvious things like height or age,

307
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.480
but it also could be things like attitudes toward capital punishment,

308
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.440
preference for the red sox over the Yankees,
right?

309
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.420
All of these are dimensions of similarity.
All things being equal,

310
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.170
the more similar,
the more likely you'll find each other attractive.

311
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:13.000
So opposites don't really attract birds of a flight.

312
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.720
Feather may flock together,
but opposites don't really track.

313
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.810
Don't really attract each other.
Now,
usually at this point,

314
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:24.760
somebody in the lecture hall raises their hand and says,
well,

315
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.560
my boyfriend or my girlfriend and I are complete opposites.

316
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.480
And how do you account for that?
Professor salivate.

317
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.570
And I usually look at them and I say,
good luck.

318
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.160
And of course all things might not be equal.

319
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:46.240
There may be other variables at play here,
but all day team equal similarity,

320
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.270
uh,
does not breed contempt.

321
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.220
Similarity breeds attraction.
Okay.
Is it an interesting,

322
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:57.580
we have all of these common sayings that contradict each other and then

323
00:21:57.581 --> 00:21:58.301
empirically,

324
00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:02.590
some of them turn out to have more evidence supporting them than others.

325
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.420
So opposites attract not much evidence.
Similarity breeds contempt.

326
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.080
Not much evidence.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Yeah,

327
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:14.710
there's some evidence for that idea.
Finally,
familiarity.

328
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.360
Familiarity.

329
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.070
We tend to fall in love with people in our environment with whom we are already

330
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:23.880
familiar.
We,
uh,

331
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.920
the idea that some enchanted evening we will see a stranger.

332
00:22:29.051 --> 00:22:31.500
Where are the new blue when you need them?
Uh,

333
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.070
some enchanted evening you will see a stranger across a crowded room.

334
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.620
Alright?
What musical is that from South Pacific?
Very good.

335
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.520
You'll see a stranger across a crowded room.
That's,

336
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.450
that's kind of a cultural myth.
Of course it happens,

337
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:55.050
but much more common is somebody who already know somebody who have seen

338
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.430
repetitively,
you suddenly find a traction,
attractive,

339
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:05.190
and a relationship forms.
Okay.
So,
uh,

340
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.620
the big three people who are similar to you,

341
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.300
people who are already familiar to you,
people who are nearby in space,

342
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.620
these are the people,

343
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:19.030
all things being equal that you will find attractive.

344
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.220
Okay?
So those are the big three.
Those are big main effects.

345
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.700
Those are big,
uh,

346
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.640
easy to observe in various ways in the lab.
By the way,

347
00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:33.550
the familiarity idea doesn't just work for people.

348
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.970
I can show you words in a language that you don't speak and I can flash those

349
00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:40.661
words,

350
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:45.661
do you very quickly and I can later repeat some of those words and mix and some

351
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:52.970
new ones that you've never seen before.
And I can say,
I don't know.

352
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.730
I know you don't know what any of these words mean.

353
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.860
I know you can't read these characters,

354
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.660
but just if you had to tell me which ones do you like and which ones don't you

355
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:06.290
like or how much do you like each one?
The ones who will like more.

356
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:09.920
The ones who saw earlier,
the ones that you already have familiarity.

357
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.740
Even if you don't remember having seen them,

358
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:18.370
even if that familiarity was generated with such quick exposures that you don't

359
00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:21.650
remember even having seen anything,

360
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.880
you will get that familiarity effect.
Okay,

361
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.183
good.

362
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.560
The more interesting for these are more interesting because they're a little bit

363
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:35.690
complicated,
a little bit subtle.

364
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.430
Let's start with actually the one that is my favorite.
This is competence.

365
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.820
Think about other people in your environment.

366
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.420
Think about people who are competent generally and think about people who are

367
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:50.384
incompetent.

368
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.540
Generally we are more attracted to people who seem competent to us.

369
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:01.750
Now that isn't very interesting and it turns out that's not really the effect.

370
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.070
Yes,
we're more attracted to people who are competent than people would think are

371
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:10.610
incompetent.
But people who are super competent,

372
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.050
people who seem competent on all dimensions,
they're kind of threatening to us.

373
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.740
That'll make us feel so good about ourselves,
right?
They,

374
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.840
they make us feel a bit diminished by comparison.

375
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.210
So what we really like,

376
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:31.190
the kind of person we're really attracted to is the competent individual who

377
00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:33.650
occasionally blunders,

378
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.400
and this is called the pratfall effect that are liking for the competent person

379
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.650
grows when they make a mistake,

380
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.170
when they do something embarrassing,
when they have a failure experience.

381
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.160
Okay.
You can see this with public figures,

382
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:56.510
public figures who are viewed as competent,
but who prat fall,

383
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:57.680
who make a mistake?

384
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:02.060
Sometimes they're even more popular after the mistake.

385
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.910
Okay.
I think of,
uh,

386
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:11.210
Bill Clinton when he was president,
his popularity at the end of his term,

387
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:14.420
despite what everyone would agree with you,
like Bill Clinton or not,

388
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.280
was a big mistake with Monica Lewinsky.
His popularity.

389
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:23.570
He didn't suffer very much.
A lot of people in the media would describe him.
Well,

390
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:28.310
he's just,
it just shows he's human.
He makes mistakes like the rest of us,

391
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.250
even though that was pretty big mistake.
Right?

392
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.620
And you can see this even with smaller pratfalls,

393
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.820
sometimes public figures or liked even more after their platform.

394
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.940
Now,
the classic experiment,

395
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:45.360
the classic pratfall experiment is just a beautiful one to describe it.

396
00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:49.450
It's a work of art.
So let me tell you a little bit about your,

397
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.370
in this experiment you're brought for the lab and you're listening to a tape

398
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:58.371
recording of interviews with people who are described as possible

399
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:03.810
representatives from your college to appear on a quiz show.

400
00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.830
Uh,
the quiz show is called college ball,
which I don't think is on anymore,

401
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:09.960
but was on when I was in college.

402
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:14.910
And you're listening to interviews with possible contestants from Yale who are

403
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:18.980
going to be on college level.
You have to decide how much,
uh,

404
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.010
what you're told is you have to decide who should be chosen to be on college

405
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:25.860
ball.
And you listen to these interviews.

406
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.890
Now what's interesting is there's two types of people.

407
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.270
The nearly perfect person and the mediocre person,

408
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:39.570
the nearly perfect person answered 92% of the questions correctly admitted

409
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.190
modestly to being a member of the campus.

410
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:49.220
Honor Society was the editor of the yearbook and Wa and ran varsity track.

411
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.920
That's the nearly perfect person.

412
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.590
The mediocre person answers only 30% of the questions correctly.

413
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.750
Uh,
and myths that he has only average grades.

414
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.390
He worked on the yearbook as a proofreader and he tried out for the track team

415
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.320
but didn't make it.
So you see,
they're keeping a lot of the elements consistent.

416
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:14.190
But in one case,

417
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:19.020
he's kind of an average performer and the other case nearly perfect.
Now,

418
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:24.021
which of these two people do you find more attractive in listening to the tape?

419
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.680
So when they ask you questions about which person should be on the quiz show,

420
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.520
people say the more competent person,
but they also ask questions like,

421
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.190
how attractive do you find this person?

422
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:36.870
Now you're only listening to an audio tape.

423
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.150
How attractive do you find this person?

424
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.630
And the results are pretty obvious.

425
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.520
They're competent person is rated as much more attractive,

426
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.960
considerably more attractive than the mediocre person.
Okay?

427
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.150
If this were the end of the story though,

428
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:58.620
it would be a kind of boring story and it's not the end of the story.
Now,

429
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:03.621
what happens is half of the participants in the experiment who have listened to

430
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:06.870
each of these tapes,
you only get to listen to one take.

431
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.740
Half of them are assigned to the blunder condition.

432
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.550
And what happens in the blundered condition is the tape continues.

433
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.240
And what you hear is the clattering of dishes.
Uh,

434
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.860
a person saying,
the person saying,
oh my goodness,

435
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.690
I've spilled coffee all over my new suit.
Okay,

436
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.890
that's the blender.
That's the Prat Fall.
Now you're asked,

437
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.580
who do you find more attractive?
And look what happens?

438
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.780
Your rating of the attractiveness of the competent person grows even higher.

439
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.940
The carbon and person who blunders,

440
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.270
this is the person that I love.

441
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.750
Unfortunately the mediocre person who blunders you now think is even more

442
00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:56.584
mediocre.

443
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.940
This is the sad irony in these experiments.

444
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:02.800
The effect works both ways.

445
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.040
So the mediocre become even more lowered in your esteem and your regard.

446
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.660
Now I'll tell you a little personal story about my coming to yell that that

447
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:14.710
relates to this experiment.

448
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.820
This is one of the most famous experiments in the history of social psychology.

449
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.200
I wouldn't quite put it up there.

450
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:25.201
You'll care maybe later about mill or maybe you've already about Milgrom and,

451
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:30.350
and maybe asch conformity and maybe robber's cave.
Those are even better than,

452
00:30:30.351 --> 00:30:35.170
than this,
but this is right up there.
This is a top five experiment.
What?
Um,
so,

453
00:30:35.171 --> 00:30:38.500
so,
uh,
and it was done by Elliot Aronson who has retired now,

454
00:30:38.501 --> 00:30:41.770
but for many years taught at the University of California.

455
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:45.340
Santa Cruz name is not one that you need to know.

456
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:46.781
In any case.

457
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:51.640
I came to yell in 1981 is a graduate student and I was looking for an advisor

458
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.820
and I was kind of interviewing with a faculty member at yell at the time named

459
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:58.294
Judy Roden.

460
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.560
Some of you may know that name because she went on later to become the president

461
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:06.940
of the University of Pennsylvania and now as the president of the Rockefeller

462
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.370
Foundation.
But I was interviewing with her.

463
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.320
I've had it set up a meeting and what I was trying to persuade her in this

464
00:31:14.321 --> 00:31:18.760
meeting was to take me on as one of her students to let to be my advisor.

465
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.390
And it's about my third or fourth week of graduate school and I'm pretty nervous

466
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:24.130
about this.
And uh,
you know,

467
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.160
she could be intimidating to a first year graduate student.

468
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:32.610
And I remember I was holding this Mug of coffee and I was pleading with her,

469
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:37.570
trying to convince her to take me on as her student.
I was saying,
Judy,
all,

470
00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:40.180
I'll get a lot done.
I'll work really hard.

471
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:44.230
All I can analyze data I can write,
you know what I'm talking about myself.

472
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:47.200
And I'm sad.
I'm swinging,
I'm using my hands as I talk.

473
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:51.670
I'm swinging this cup of coffee around and um,
fairly uh,

474
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.050
sued into the conversation.

475
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.950
I demonstrated some principle that you've probably learned in your physics class

476
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.780
having to do with an object at rest remaining at rest unless acted upon by a

477
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:05.200
force.
Well,
the object at rest was the coffee in the cup.

478
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.860
And when I pulled the Coffee Cup out from under the coffee,

479
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.090
it landed right on her desk and began,

480
00:32:13.091 --> 00:32:18.091
I've watched in slow motion as this wave of coffee just moved from my side of

481
00:32:21.221 --> 00:32:23.260
the desk to her side of the desk.

482
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.760
She jumped up and jumped back and started moving papers around and really was

483
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:30.610
giving me this look like,
why don't you just leave?

484
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.570
So I was trying to save the moment as best as I could.

485
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:37.690
And I looked there and I said,
uh,
Judy,

486
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.440
you remember old experiment that Elliot Aronson did on attractiveness?

487
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.420
She looked at me kind of out of the corner of ride.
I said,
well,

488
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.900
that was my blunder.

489
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.490
Now you're going to like me even more.

490
00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.740
And she just shook her head and she said,
Peter,
Peter,

491
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.710
Peter,
you know,

492
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:07.010
that affect only works if I think you're competent first.

493
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.970
Anyway,
that was my introduction to Yale graduate school.
Yep.
All right.

494
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:18.110
So blundering blundering only blender if you're competent,
uh,
first,

495
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:21.080
and it will make you more attractive.
That is the,

496
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.210
the pratfall effect.

497
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.450
Let's move on and I'm,

498
00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:29.360
I'm gonna move a little bit quickly through all of this because I want to leave

499
00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:33.820
time for a few questions at the end of the lecture.
Uh,

500
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.890
let's talk about physical attractiveness as number two of the more interesting.

501
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.390
For now,

502
00:33:41.391 --> 00:33:46.100
physical attractiveness is one that really bothers us.

503
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.760
We don't like to believe that physical attractiveness accounts for much in life.

504
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.250
It seems unfair except at the margins.

505
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:58.190
There isn't much we can do about physical attractiveness.

506
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:02.960
And when we're not pictured in the rumpus,
it can really hurt,
you know,

507
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.420
the,
uh,
so we don't like to believe that physical attractiveness matters.

508
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.760
And the interesting thing is if you do surveys of college students and you say

509
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:14.594
to them,

510
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.720
rate how important different characteristics are in relationships that you might

511
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:26.690
be involved in,
they will say that warmth is important,

512
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:30.590
sensitivity isn't important.
Intelligence is important.

513
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:34.820
Compassion is important.
Sense of humor is important,

514
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.540
and they'll say that looks aren't important,

515
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.780
but if you measure all of those things,
let's do it it in different order.

516
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.840
If you send everybody out on a blind date,

517
00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.270
<v 1>okay,</v>

518
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.390
<v 0>and then you look at after the blind date,</v>

519
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:58.070
how many of those people who are matched up blindly actually go on a second
date,

520
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.130
actually get together again?

521
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.850
What predicts who gets together?
Again,

522
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.770
was it the rating of warmth?
No sensitivity,

523
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.580
no intelligence,
no compassion,

524
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.980
no sense of humor,
no.

525
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:22.800
What was it looks so we believe that looks don't matter.

526
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.180
And unfortunately they do.

527
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.240
Now the good news in all of this is the studies that looked at physical

528
00:35:33.761 --> 00:35:35.050
attractiveness in this way.

529
00:35:35.051 --> 00:35:39.090
We're just looking at what predicts a date after a first date.

530
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.040
Obviously what predicts a longterm relationship are probably things less

531
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:48.930
superficial,
uh,
than look.
So at least other things in addition to looks,

532
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:54.140
but it is a great predictor of a second date and college students year after

533
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:55.530
year say,

534
00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.360
but it's not important and it's one of those classic dissociation between what

535
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:04.980
we think is an important and what empirically turns out to be more important.

536
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:05.311
All right.

537
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:08.550
Well they're very interesting studies that have been done with physical

538
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:12.090
attractiveness at the University of Minnesota.
Uh,

539
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.380
a computer algorithm paired people up.

540
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:19.560
I couldn't have been a very complicated algorithm because it basically paired

541
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:23.610
people up randomly,
uh,
on the campus,
uh,
but the computer,

542
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:28.080
but a lot of data about all the students on campus were color was collected,

543
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:31.020
were collected and uh,
uh,

544
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:36.050
people were then randomly paired up and sent to the dance and then they were

545
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:41.670
tracked over time.
And just as in the thought experiment I just gave you,

546
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:46.530
the University of Minnesota students acted in the same way.
If the computer,

547
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:50.930
if they rated their partner as attractive,
uh,
the,

548
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.710
the randomly assigned partner,

549
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.270
they were more likely to continue the relationship.
Now,

550
00:36:57.271 --> 00:37:02.271
it's interesting to ask why and we have to start to look at other experiments to

551
00:37:02.861 --> 00:37:07.620
try to get at what is it about physical attractiveness that,
um,
uh,

552
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.570
makes people want to pursue the relationship.
And once again,
Elliot Aronson,

553
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.310
the person who,
uh,
did the blunder experiment,
the pratfall experiment,

554
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.150
he did some nice work on a track then this as well.

555
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.370
And it wasn't what experiment,

556
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:27.870
which many people know is the frizzy wig experiment.
He did the following.

557
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:32.130
He,
he invited a,
uh,
a confederate,

558
00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:35.550
a graduate sooner who was working with him in his lab,
psychologist,

559
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:36.211
social psychologist,

560
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:41.160
always called people who were in the employ of the experimenter,
confederates.

561
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.020
It doesn't mean that they grew up south of the Mason Dixon line or a wave a

562
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:50.760
wave,
a certain kind of flag.
Uh,
but the older term for it was stooge.

563
00:37:50.761 --> 00:37:52.000
They would say,
we,

564
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.250
we've hired a stooge to act in the following role in the experiment.

565
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.120
But I think a certain generation of college students thought stooge stooges were

566
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:03.720
only named moe,
Larry and curly.
And so they,
uh,
they,

567
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.630
they started to this phrase confederate.
Now,
they'll usually just say,

568
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:08.640
we hired an actor now.
Anyway,

569
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.670
their confederate that they hired was a woman who is naturally attractive in

570
00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:16.050
most people's view,

571
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:21.090
but they made her look either more attractive or less attractive by,

572
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:25.680
uh,
giving her kind of frumpy clothes,
bad makeup,

573
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.210
and a frizzy wake.

574
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.740
And it was the frizzy wig that everybody remembers from this experiment at what

575
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:32.910
she does in the experiment.

576
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:37.911
And she poses as a graduate student in clinical psychology who is interviewing

577
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.720
male participants,
only men in this experiment.

578
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.480
And at the end of the interview,

579
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:49.050
she gives them her own personal clinical evaluation of their personality.

580
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.700
Okay.
So that's all it is to have this interview with this woman.

581
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:59.680
She's either made to look very good or she's made to look a kind of ugly with

582
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:02.650
this frizzy wig.
And they talked to her.

583
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.050
She gives them an evaluation of their personality.

584
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.510
Half of the subjects received a favorable personality assessment.

585
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:15.310
Half of them receive a kind of unfavorable evaluation.

586
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.230
How do they respond?

587
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.880
Well when she was made to look attractive,

588
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:27.270
they were delighted when she gave them positive feedback about themselves once

589
00:39:28.051 --> 00:39:32.650
she was made to look,
when she gave,
when she was made to look attractive,

590
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.660
but gave them unfavorable information about themselves,

591
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.940
they were really upset about it.

592
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.750
When she was made to look unattractive.

593
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.460
They didn't really care what kind of information she gave.

594
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.110
It didn't really matter whether it was positive or not.

595
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.720
It didn't really make any difference.

596
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.430
It was interesting in the condition where she was made to look attractive,

597
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.460
but gave you bad feedback about yourself.

598
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.890
Often the subjects in that condition,

599
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.180
we'd look for an opportunity to interact with her in the future.

600
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.360
Obviously to try to prove that her evaluation was wrong,

601
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.010
it mattered that much to them.

602
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.060
So there's kind of this idea that attractive people,

603
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:24.250
their feedback to us has more impact.
I'm not saying this is fair,

604
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.630
I'm not saying it's rational.
I'm not endorsing it,
but empirically,

605
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.220
excuse me,
empirically we can see it.

606
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.310
It's somehow the attractive,

607
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.110
the feedback from the attractive person matters.
Uh,
more uh,

608
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.000
to us.
Okay.

609
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:48.400
Number three of the more interesting for gain loss.

610
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.870
This is really a general idea in psychology that we are in a way wired up to be

611
00:40:56.951 --> 00:41:01.510
more sensitive,
to change then to steady states.

612
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.270
And you could imagine why that might be true.

613
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.290
Change often signals danger or opportunity.

614
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.150
And if we are especially tuned in to change,

615
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.301
uh,
it,

616
00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:18.910
it helps us survive and it helps us pass along our genes.

617
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:25.150
Okay,
so we're more sensitive to change.
How does that play out in love?

618
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.580
Well,
in love,
uh,

619
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.700
we are in what is very powerful to us is not just that someone always is

620
00:41:34.431 --> 00:41:38.990
positive toward us.
I love you,
I love you,
I love you,

621
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:41.750
I love you.
I love right.
It wears out.
It's welcome.

622
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:47.410
What's more powerful is the person who was not that positive to us,

623
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.890
but over time becomes more positive.

624
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.290
The first derivative of their regard for us is positive.

625
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.920
Okay.
Aronson calls this the gain effect.

626
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:06.370
We are really attracted to people whose regard for us is gaining momentum over

627
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:09.400
time.
Okay.

628
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:15.010
And even if over a period of time the average amount of their regard is lower

629
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.080
because they started lower and then got higher than someone who was always high.

630
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.960
It's the ones who are first lower who then went up that capture our attention.

631
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:32.090
The first derivative is more important than just the position of their regard

632
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.490
for us getting better and better.

633
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.750
Now what's interesting is there's also a loss affect.

634
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:44.260
People who really hurt us are not the people who have always been negative.

635
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.510
The president who every time they seize you hates you,

636
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.340
it says they hate you and a company's it with an obscene gesture.

637
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.200
After a while,
this person can't hurt you,
right?

638
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.400
There's a,

639
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.560
there's a country song that Ricky Skaggs sings that has the phrasing it.

640
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:10.070
Nothing can hurt you like the person you love.

641
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.110
That's what hurts the prison who always was positive,
who's now,

642
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.970
who's regard starts to fade.

643
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:20.330
You can only hurt the one you love,
right?

644
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:25.220
You can only hurt the one you love because you are expecting positive feedback

645
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:29.600
from the one you love and when that turns negative,
it's,

646
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.830
it's a blow.
It's a blow to the solar plexus,
right?

647
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.590
So you can only hurt the one you can love.

648
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.760
But the one who always loves you sometimes has trouble showing you that they

649
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:43.160
love you,
the one who didn't really love you that much.

650
00:43:43.161 --> 00:43:45.380
But then she starts to show you that they love you.

651
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:50.450
That person is a powerful influence on your,
uh,

652
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:55.520
behavior.
Okay.
Low last,

653
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.480
whoops,
come back.
The last set of studies

654
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:05.120
have you talked about chapters?
Singers,
emotion.
Okay.
So let me,

655
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.860
let me describe to you this phenomenon.
This is a phenomenon,

656
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:10.760
uh,

657
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.760
about the miss attribution for the causes of arousal.

658
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.360
You feel physiologically aroused,

659
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.220
but you're not completely sure why and you have to make up an explanation for

660
00:44:28.371 --> 00:44:32.850
it.
I think what I want to do,
and sometimes that explanation is accurate,

661
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.120
but the ones that are interesting here are the ones where you misattribute the

662
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:40.260
cause of the arousal.

663
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:45.261
You make a mistake and think it's love when it might be due to something else.

664
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.380
So let's do a thought experiment.

665
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.540
I'm a gay male college student for the purposes of this thought experiment.

666
00:44:55.690 --> 00:45:00.690
And I live in Pearson because I need to walk a great distance to Chapel Street,

667
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.720
to the Starbucks on Chapel Street.

668
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.580
And I have a friend who,
I don't know that well,

669
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.700
somebody who was sitting next to me in class a few weeks in a row.
And I said,

670
00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:12.534
you know,

671
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.600
would you like to go see the new blue in concert and then get coffee after it

672
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.310
Friday night?
And she says to me,

673
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.320
sure that I would do that.

674
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.470
And so the new blue concert takes place in the Pearson Davenport Theater in the

675
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:35.130
basement there,
what used to be a squash court and is now a little theater.

676
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:38.850
And we enjoy ourselves at the concert.
And then I say,

677
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:41.160
let's go to Starbucks and get a coffee.

678
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:46.500
And so we walk that distance from Pearson College,
uh,

679
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:51.000
down to the York street gate over to Chapel Street.

680
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:52.680
Nick the left on Chapel Street,

681
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.340
another block down to high walk into the Starbucks.

682
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.520
And she says to me,
you know,

683
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:03.930
I better have a decaf because,
uh,

684
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.950
it's title late.
I want to be able to sleep.
And I say,
that's fine.

685
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:10.050
Whatever you want.
She says,
yes,

686
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:15.051
I'll have a DECAF double expressor Mocha skinny with a what?

687
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.500
What other dimensions are there?
Right.

688
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.420
A Double Espresso or Mocha skinny frost.

689
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:27.350
And I say,
okay,
fine.
I'll have a coffee and a,

690
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.470
I go up there and I ordered the drinks.
I'll have a car,
a small coffee please.

691
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:36.740
And a double espresso or Mocha skinny [inaudible] except the Barista makes a

692
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:43.140
mistake that the word Barrista exists before Starbucks.

693
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.670
I don't think so.
The Barista makes a mistake.

694
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.120
The Barista uses caffeinated coffee in the drink instead of DECAF.

695
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.840
Doesn't tell anybody.
Doesn't tell me.
I don't see it.

696
00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:02.990
I just come back with my black coffee and my double espresso or Mocha Latte,

697
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:09.210
skinny frost,
except it isn't expresso.

698
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.560
It's got two shots of caffeinated and specimen.

699
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.240
I'm sorry it isn't decaffeinated.

700
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.540
It's got two shots of caffeinated espresso in it and I put it down on the table

701
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:25.980
and we're having this nice conversation and we're drinking our beverages and

702
00:47:25.981 --> 00:47:30.981
it's about 1231 o'clock now and Starbucks is closing and it's time to walk back

703
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:32.523
to Pearson.

704
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:38.890
When we're walking back to Pearson and when we leave this Starbucks,

705
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:42.670
we make a left on chapel street.
We're walking up to York.

706
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:47.680
I'm getting a little sleepy,
but my friend looks at me and says,

707
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.910
Huh,
I feel a little funny.
What's actually happening?

708
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.610
Our heart is beating a little faster.

709
00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

710
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:59.300
<v 0>Her POVs are beginning to sweat.</v>

711
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:05.230
Her breath is coming a little shorter than it otherwise would.
I Dunno.

712
00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.250
Right?
Said warm in here.

713
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.280
I don't think I've felt this way in a very long time.

714
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:14.463
<v 1>No,</v>

715
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.910
<v 0>couldn't be the coffee I ordered.
Decas what could this be?</v>

716
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:25.880
What?
Then she turns and she looks at me

717
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.240
and she says,

718
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:37.230
what a day this has been.
What are rare booed?
I'm in.
Why?

719
00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.560
It's almost like being in love.

720
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.430
It is almost like being love except what it really is is two shots of

721
00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:47.090
caffeinated espresso
causing a rapid heart rate,

722
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:51.560
a decrease in respiration,
sweaty palms,

723
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.150
but I don't realize she doesn't realize that's what it is.

724
00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.720
She turns to the most salient or this is the way social psychologists would say.

725
00:49:00.721 --> 00:49:05.721
It turns to the most salient object in her immediate social environment that

726
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:09.830
that would be me and says she's in love.

727
00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.930
That's the idea of misattribution arouse due to something else.

728
00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.750
Don't know what that is.
It's best if you don't know what that is.

729
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:22.820
Or even if you do mistakenly attributed mis,
attributed,
uh,

730
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.810
to physical attraction,
romance,
intimacy,

731
00:49:26.811 --> 00:49:30.890
passion and commitment.
It's love.
All right.
Now,
uh,

732
00:49:30.891 --> 00:49:35.891
I don't necessarily recommend that you do this thought experiment,

733
00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:40.490
uh,
in,
uh,
uh,
in Vivo,
uh,
this weekend.
Uh,

734
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.020
although if you're lonely,
you might want to try it.
But,
um,
we can go,

735
00:49:45.021 --> 00:49:49.520
we can take this idea,
right?
Uh,
we can,
we can actually do a search on this.

736
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.300
We could take it into the lab.
But before I tell you about lab experiments,

737
00:49:53.301 --> 00:49:56.960
let me tell about the most famous field experiment on this idea.

738
00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.990
We call this the rickety bridge experiment.

739
00:49:59.991 --> 00:50:04.780
And there's a bridge at the University of British Columbia,
uh,

740
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:10.060
that crosses a river that runs through campus and the rickety,

741
00:50:10.701 --> 00:50:11.900
there's actually two bridges.

742
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:16.130
The rickety bridge is one that's kind of a rope bridge.

743
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.720
It's hundreds of feet above the river.
It's ways in the breeze.

744
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.820
It's only about three feet wide.

745
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.210
You kind of hold on to it carefully and you crossed the river.

746
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.260
It's pretty scary to cross that river.
Does anybody bit been seeing this bridge?

747
00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:32.240
It's still there?
Yes.
You know there's bridge.
Okay.

748
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.530
There's another way to cross the river.
It's on us.

749
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.300
Low Bridge near the water,
solid wood planks,
nice and wide,

750
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.610
uh,
uh,

751
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.640
hand railings made out of solid wood and you can cross the bridge that way.

752
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.860
So what a two investigators at the University of British Columbia did is they

753
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:55.970
simply positioned,
uh,
once again,
man,

754
00:50:55.971 --> 00:51:00.740
attractive,
uh,
actor or confederate,
uh,

755
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:05.741
on one side of the bridge she was a woman and she met men crossing the bridge

756
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:14.270
and she would intercept them as they came across the rickety bridge or the low

757
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:18.560
bridge and she would ask them a few questions and conclude with,

758
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:20.210
can you write me a story?

759
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:24.080
Just it would help me out with my experiment if you just write a little story

760
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:28.730
right now.
Then she would collect this story and she would say,

761
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:33.260
if you have any questions about this experiment,
here's my phone number.

762
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.280
Actually this happens when you're an experiments.

763
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.870
You get the phone number of the experiment.
What happens?

764
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.380
Well,
the men,

765
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.200
male students who crossed the rickety bridge,

766
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.670
they wrote these sexy stories with interesting content,

767
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:52.910
with kind of a,
uh,
kind of,
um,

768
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.550
little bit reibel themes.

769
00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.400
And the people are the Rick on the solid bridge.

770
00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.730
He just wrote pretty boring stories.

771
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:04.580
The people who crossed the rickety bridge,

772
00:52:04.581 --> 00:52:07.430
we're more likely to call her up later and say,
yeah,

773
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:11.390
I'd like to talk about that experiment.
I was in a,
can we meet at the Starbucks?

774
00:52:11.391 --> 00:52:15.710
Uh,
you drink decaf,
don't you write the,
uh,

775
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.990
and the people on the low bridge were much less likely to call her up.
Okay.

776
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.950
The eye,
what was going on?
Well,

777
00:52:22.951 --> 00:52:27.500
what this was interpreted as miss attributed arousal on the rickety bridge.

778
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.310
You're swaying in the breeze hundreds of feet above the water.

779
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.000
The bridge seems unstable.
Maybe you'll make it,
maybe you won't.

780
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:38.930
Your heart is beating yours.
Palms are sweating.
You're breathing harder.

781
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.000
You meet this person and uh,

782
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.600
she seems more attractive because you're feeling all these things and you

783
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:48.140
attribute it to,
to the attraction.
Now,

784
00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:52.100
there's a reason why this study is bad science.

785
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:56.090
There's a major flaw in this study.

786
00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:01.940
The clue to the flaw is that you can't even call this study and experiment.

787
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.350
<v 2>What's the flaw?
Anybody?
Yes?</v>

788
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.770
<v 0>People who take the rickety bridge might be the kind of people who are more</v>

789
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:21.570
looking for adventure.
Uh,
then the people who take the solid bridge,

790
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.080
right?
Another way of saying it is there isn't random

791
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.700
of the subjects to the two conditions in the,
in the study.

792
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.340
That's no random assignment.
It's not an experiment.

793
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.470
You by not randomly assigning people to these two conditions,

794
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:42.471
you may be capturing just individual differences in the kind of person who,

795
00:53:42.781 --> 00:53:47.590
when there's a perfectly stable,
safe,
low bridge.
So it's,
ah,

796
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.050
I don't want to go on that bridge.

797
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.550
I want to go on the Bridgeway after risk by life that get the class

798
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:59.400
and then should it surprise us that that's the kind of person who would call a

799
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:02.850
perfect stranger on the telephone and write a sexy story and give it to them,

800
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:04.800
right?
We're not so surprised.

801
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.800
So what we have to do of course is take it into the lab and do this in a more

802
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:15.990
systematic way with random assignment.
And this is how I want to finish up.

803
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.760
Uh,
today we have til to til uh,
two 45,
three 45.
Okay,

804
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:21.541
great.
I'll,

805
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:24.990
I'll take about five more minutes to finish up and now they'll give us some time

806
00:54:24.991 --> 00:54:29.700
for questions.
So how do you do this in the lab?

807
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:32.220
Well,

808
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:37.280
you can bring people into the lab and I can present you with a confederate who

809
00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:44.580
says,
let's say you are all in condition one.
Everybody on this side of the room.

810
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:48.720
And I can say to all of you,
please wait here.

811
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:54.120
We'll begin the experiment in a moment.
While you're waiting,

812
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.620
please fill out this form.
And the form includes how attractive,

813
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:02.190
how attracted you are to the experiment.
To me,

814
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:06.690
I can do the same thing over here.
I can say,

815
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:11.010
I can give you the form that asks you to rate how attractive you think I am and

816
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:15.150
I can give you the same instruction where the crucial difference.

817
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.010
Please wait.
Here

818
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:23.010
we will begin the painful shock experiment in a moment.

819
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:26.340
Please fill out these forms.
By the way,

820
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:32.180
what happens to people who got the painful shock instruction are more likely to

821
00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:38.580
find the confederate attractive.
Why?
Well,

822
00:55:38.581 --> 00:55:41.190
they're sitting there thinking about painful shock.

823
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:45.660
It's making their heartbeat faster.
It's making their palms sweat.

824
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:47.430
It's making them breathe harder maybe.

825
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.060
And even though it's fairly obvious what's doing that,

826
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:54.720
they still miss attribute that arousal too.

827
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:59.490
I must be falling in love even with that obvious a,

828
00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:04.800
uh,
even with that obvious and instruction,
you can do this in other ways.

829
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:08.100
You can bring here,
here,
here's one of my favorite ones.

830
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:12.150
You bring people in the lab.
Let's,
we'll,
we'll make them the control group.

831
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:15.960
This time we bring you in to the lab and we say to this group of people,

832
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:19.470
please wait here.
We'll begin the experiment in a moment.

833
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:21.600
Can fill out these forms.
In the meantime,

834
00:56:21.601 --> 00:56:25.120
the forums ask how you are to the experimenter.

835
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.660
You're now in the experimental group and I say,
please,
uh,

836
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:34.190
wait here.
We'll begin to experiment a moment.
Uh,

837
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.010
I'm going to ask you to fill out some forms,

838
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:38.590
but first to get ready for this experiment,

839
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:42.040
I'd like you to get on this treadmill and run for 10 minutes.

840
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.890
So you've run on the treadmill,

841
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.660
you've just sat around the people who run on the treadmill,
even when that,

842
00:56:48.661 --> 00:56:51.190
that arousal is fairly obvious,
you've got,

843
00:56:51.191 --> 00:56:54.910
you do worry a little bit of aerobics exercise,
you still find

844
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.260
<v 2>the experimenter more attractive.
Okay?</v>

845
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.800
<v 0>This is why the fourth floor of Payne Whitney Jim is such a dangerous place and</v>

846
00:57:07.771 --> 00:57:11.370
I urge you as your dean to be very careful there.

847
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.510
It's that combination of aerobic exercise and SPANDEX

848
00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.590
leads to trouble.
All right?
Now here's the final experiment,

849
00:57:22.591 --> 00:57:26.290
and I apologize for this.
It is a bit sexist in uh,

850
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:30.900
2007 context.
But let me explain it.

851
00:57:30.901 --> 00:57:34.890
And we could never do this one,
could never do this experiment today,
but let me,

852
00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:39.630
let me,
let me go through it with you and you'll apologize for its,
um,
uh,

853
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:43.290
some of its qualities in this experiment.

854
00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:48.410
Male subjects were brought into the lab and then were asked to look at

855
00:57:48.691 --> 00:57:50.790
centerfolds from Playboy magazine.

856
00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:54.270
So these are essentially photographs of naked women

857
00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.920
and they are wearing headphones that amplify their heartbeat and they are asked

858
00:58:04.201 --> 00:58:05.340
among other things,

859
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:10.610
how attracted are they to the centerfold photograph that they're looking at?

860
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.300
This maybe,
I don't remember how many they look at.
Maybe it's about 10.

861
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:20.220
So these slides are coming up.
They've got the headphones on,

862
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:25.670
the headphones are amplifying their heartbeat and the slides are moving one

863
00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:29.550
after another for a few seconds each slide,

864
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:32.890
<v 2>and they're listening to their heartbeat.</v>

865
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:40.150
Slide one
slide to

866
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:46.270
slide three,
slide four,

867
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:52.690
slide five,
slide six.

868
00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.980
<v 0>And then they're asked which one did you find most attractive?
Uh,</v>

869
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:05.090
which one are you most attracted to?
Oh,
slide five.
Absolutely.
Uh,

870
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.940
she's,
she's the woman I want to marry.

871
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:13.350
And what has happened is they're using this bodily Q of their heartbeat to infer

872
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.120
that that's who they find more attractive.

873
00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.410
Now here's the twist.

874
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.980
They're not actually listening to their heartbeat.

875
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.560
They're listening to a tape recording of a heartbeat and experimenter is back

876
00:59:32.421 --> 00:59:37.340
there with the speed knob and at random intervals,

877
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.710
he just speeds up the tape of their heart

878
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:42.830
and then just slows it down again.

879
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:48.790
And it doesn't matter which slide he speeds up the tape of the heartbeat on.

880
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.460
That's the one the subject is more likely to think is,

881
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:59.570
uh,
the person of their dreams,
a person they're attracted to.

882
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:04.130
So even you can miss a tribute,
real arousal.

883
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.960
You can even miss a tribute,

884
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:11.260
phony arousal arousal that isn't even coming from your body that's just coming,

885
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.530
that's just,
it's just been played to you randomly.

886
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.290
You can even miss attribute that.
Okay.

887
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:23.530
I think these experiments are cute and I think there's an interesting phenomena

888
01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:24.500
there.

889
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:29.500
And it says something in a way about how easily we can be misled as to what

890
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:34.400
things in our environment,
even things coming from our own body,
me.

891
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:38.690
But there's also some very serious implications of this kind of work.

892
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.720
One of them has to do with domestic violence,

893
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:47.420
so think about domestic violence situations and why people stay in them.

894
01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:52.310
Why do people stay in relationships that are violent now?
The number one reason,

895
01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:54.770
and we have to acknowledge it up front,

896
01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.160
is usually economically there's no alternative p or people believe there's no

897
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:06.650
alternative.
I can't leave because if I leave,
I'd be homeless.
If I leave,

898
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:08.720
I will starve.
If my lead,
if I leave,

899
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.830
my kids will starve or there'll be danger to my kids.

900
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:17.660
And that keeps people trapped in abusive relationships,

901
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.770
but,
and that's number one.
But what else might be going on?

902
01:01:21.771 --> 01:01:26.771
Sometimes people don't realize that the relationship there ein is abusive.

903
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.980
It's psychologically or emotionally abusive.

904
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.830
They get into these fights and screaming matches and name calling and such.

905
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:41.860
Even if it's not physical violence and they feel a certain arousal when that

906
01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:47.330
happens and they miss a tribute it to,
well,

907
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.100
he wouldn't be yelling and screaming at me if he didn't love me.
Right.

908
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:55.430
They misattribute that,
that what might be anger,

909
01:01:55.431 --> 01:02:00.170
what might even be aggression and violence to an expression of love.

910
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:05.500
I have a friend who's a social psychologist who told me a story once that you

911
01:02:06.371 --> 01:02:10.670
know,
that,
that really,
uh,
really,
uh,
maybe very nervous,

912
01:02:10.671 --> 01:02:15.590
although she's fine.
She said,
when I was dating my husband,
this is 30 years ago,

913
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.880
um,
we were having a tough time.
We were in many,
many arguments.
We got into many,

914
01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:25.881
many arguments and one time something happened where he came up to my car in a

915
01:02:26.161 --> 01:02:31.161
parking lot and he was yelling at me through the window and I rolled up the

916
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:36.780
window and before you know it,
he had punched out the window and you know,

917
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:42.480
you know,
yelling at her,
punched out the window.
He didn't touch her and he,

918
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:47.250
she said to me,
that's when I knew he really loved me and I thought,

919
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.810
that's scary.
All joking aside,
that's scary,

920
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.970
you know,
but that's mis attributed arousal.
I'm feeling when he did that,

921
01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:59.070
I felt something and I assumed it was love.

922
01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:02.310
What she was miss attributed as love.

923
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.750
Well she was misattributing his aggressive response as love.

924
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:11.810
She was miss attributing her own fear as mutual attraction is.

925
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:16.090
And I must love him,
you know,
so,
uh,

926
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:20.100
although we joke about these kinds of experiments and they are fun to talk about

927
01:03:20.101 --> 01:03:24.960
because they are a unusual and um,
uh,
and cute.

928
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.140
There was also some serious implications of this kind of work,
uh,

929
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:32.310
that one might think about and you might think about other possible implications

930
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:37.080
as well.
Okay.
Let me stop there and see what kinds of questions we might have.

931
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.273
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

932
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:51.060
<v 0>Thanks very much.
That's very kind of you.
Uh,
because we are on tape,</v>

933
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.620
I'll repeat any questions that come in.

934
01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:57.000
<v 1>Yup.
That's where the painful shopping experiment.
Yeah.</v>

935
01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.200
Did you not say that if you're,

936
01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:02.980
if you were informed that this experiment include painful shops,

937
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.400
you're not raising the experiment or higher because,

938
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.220
<v 0>right.
So the question is spam.</v>

939
01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:12.900
It's like the painful shock expand experiment.

940
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.510
If you're told in advance like you all,

941
01:04:15.511 --> 01:04:19.050
are you through a consent form or by the expenditure,

942
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:22.140
this is an experiment involving painful shock.

943
01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:27.590
Will you still rate the experimenter is more attractive or will you not be able

944
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:33.570
to miss a tribute?
The arousal,
it is true.
The more salient we make,

945
01:04:33.571 --> 01:04:37.410
the source of the arousal,
the less likely you can get the effect.

946
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.360
If in my thought experiment,
I say to my friend,

947
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.940
well,
I know why you're feeling that way.

948
01:04:44.941 --> 01:04:48.390
The reason why you're feeling that way is because the Barista made a mistake and

949
01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:52.290
gave you caffeinated espresso when you asked for decaf.

950
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.320
Or maybe you just love me,
right?
The person is not likely to say,
oh,

951
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:02.010
I bet it's love.
They're more likely to think,
oh,
caffeine.
Yeah.
That's the puzzle.

952
01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:05.070
Ammonia's explanation here.
So it is through.

953
01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:07.740
The more sales you'll make the cause of the arousal,

954
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.600
the less likely you'll get the effect.

955
01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:14.250
But you can see even experiments where the cause of the arousal is somewhat

956
01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:17.980
obvious,
at least to us.
You can still get a miss a trip.

957
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.580
Misattribution affect other questions.
Yes.

958
01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:24.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

959
01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.800
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
So the question is,
are any of these factors,</v>

960
01:05:33.801 --> 01:05:35.780
like particularly the big three,

961
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:38.840
a proximity familiarities similarity,

962
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.000
do they affect the maintenance of relationships or just the initial attraction?

963
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.620
You know,
it's interesting.

964
01:05:45.621 --> 01:05:50.570
My guess is they affect both initial and and maintenance over time.

965
01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.650
But the literature mostly focuses on initial attraction.
Yeah.

966
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:59.660
Much richer data on that initial attraction in those initial stages of the

967
01:06:00.171 --> 01:06:01.004
relationship.

968
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:05.690
In part because it's a little hard to follow couples over time and imagine,

969
01:06:05.691 --> 01:06:10.010
imagine the,
uh,
the sort of Heisenberg ask problems.

970
01:06:10.011 --> 01:06:15.011
We would get carefully following romantic couples over time and an interfering

971
01:06:15.441 --> 01:06:20.160
with them to,
uh,
you know,
uh,
probe and ask questions and,
and,
uh,
uh,

972
01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.550
uh,
make observations.

973
01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:26.580
It'd be hard to let this couple naturally this relationship naturally unfold.

974
01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:27.950
So we really get,

975
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:32.180
so really the focus of many of these experiments is on initial attraction.

976
01:06:32.181 --> 01:06:35.510
That's why I always say my,
my lecture is on love.

977
01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:38.480
The definition of terms is about love,

978
01:06:38.481 --> 01:06:43.190
but the experiments really are much more about attraction then about about love.

979
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:49.030
No other questions?
Yes.
Oh,

980
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:52.580
can someone feel consummate love for more than one person?

981
01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.890
Very good question.
It's actually a question that's debated in the literature.

982
01:06:57.891 --> 01:07:02.540
I didn't get into it at all and this experiment in this lecture,

983
01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.730
but there's an interesting debate going on about love and many other emotions,

984
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.541
uh,

985
01:07:08.541 --> 01:07:13.220
between people who would take a kind of evolutionary perspective on these states

986
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:17.290
versus people who take what might be called a more socially constructed a

987
01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.210
prospective.
And these aren't necessarily so incompatible.

988
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.900
But the evolutionary perspective I think would argue that you can feel like I've

989
01:07:26.451 --> 01:07:28.340
kind of love for more than one person,

990
01:07:28.341 --> 01:07:33.341
or at least it would facilitate the passing on of your genetic material to a

991
01:07:33.711 --> 01:07:38.570
larger array of the next generation.
You know?
So I think,
uh,

992
01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.500
I think the evolutionary explanation is not a problem,

993
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:47.510
but we have constructed a world where in most societies,

994
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:52.440
except for very unusual,
a polygamous societies,
uh,

995
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:57.410
the belief is that you can't,
you know,
you can't love more than one.

996
01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:59.870
All right.
And,
uh,

997
01:07:59.871 --> 01:08:04.871
so you've got this tension between what might be evolutionarily wired impulses

998
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:11.180
and a kind of social constraints that say,
this isn't good,
this is inappropriate,

999
01:08:11.181 --> 01:08:14.270
this is taboo.
And,
um,
uh,

1000
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:18.290
my guess the result is yes,
you could,

1001
01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.480
but you're not going to feel unconflicted about it.

1002
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.170
And it's because these two are confronting each other at the same time.

1003
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:28.850
How about one more question and then we'll let you go.
Sorry.
I saw him first.

1004
01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:34.680
<v 2>Natural selection favored people,
all these things and then swipe,</v>

1005
01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:37.260
like practically applied to,

1006
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:39.630
<v 0>so he's making the evolutionary argument.</v>

1007
01:08:39.631 --> 01:08:44.631
Wouldn't natural selection favor the people who take introductory psychology,

1008
01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.430
come to my Valentine's Day lecture,

1009
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:50.730
listened carefully to the big three on the more interesting for,

1010
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.380
and then go out there and put them into practice.
It feels a little bit like the,

1011
01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:59.490
um,
like we're trying to pass on an acquired characteristic,

1012
01:08:59.491 --> 01:09:03.720
which is a little bit counter to Darwinian theory,

1013
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:07.650
but if somehow,
you know,
if you could design a,
a,

1014
01:09:07.651 --> 01:09:12.651
a proclivity for learning this kind of material evolution might indeed favorite,

1015
01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.660
uh,
I could tell you this much,

1016
01:09:15.661 --> 01:09:20.661
it would make the several thousand social psychologists in this world very happy

1017
01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:26.490
and proud of their field if that turned out to be true.
Anyway,

1018
01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.230
thank you all very much.
Happy Valentine's Day.

1019
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.190
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
