1
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.160
Two followups on yesterday's lack,
I'm sorry,
on,
um,

2
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.670
Monday's lecture.
One is that,
uh,

3
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.700
that somebody came up after class and asked when the preference for your own

4
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:30.810
language emerges in development.
And fortunately,
uh,
Colleen McCrank,

5
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.010
uh,
studies pretty much exactly this sort of infant understanding.

6
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:35.940
She knew the answer.

7
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.160
There has been studies looking at newborn babies finding that pretty much the

8
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:42.330
moment they pop out,

9
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.520
they favor their own language over other language,
over other languages.

10
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.320
And this suggests that they are listening while in utero while in the womb to

11
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:55.530
the rhythms of their language and developing a preference for it.

12
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.730
A second issue is I talked very briefly about a court case in which,

13
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.913
um,

14
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.010
the person was said at a moment where someone else was pointing a gun at a

15
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:08.910
police officer,

16
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.800
let him have it and a police officer was killed and that person was charged with

17
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:14.520
murder.

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.090
But I admitted I didn't actually know how things turned out and Greg Lawan was

19
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:23.090
kind enough to do extensive research or he went to Wikipedia and,
um,

20
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.690
and,
and,

21
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.580
and find out the answer to answer is he was tried and found guilty for murder.

22
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.260
He was then subsequently it.
In fact,

23
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.920
he was pardoned in 1988,
which is really nice,

24
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:42.210
except he was executed in 1957.
Um,

25
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.380
but it did make it into a movie
movie.

26
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780
Okay.
So what I want to do today for the first part of the lectures,

27
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.930
continue the language lecture and then move to perception,
attention and memory.

28
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.300
And what we have spoken about was we first talked about universals of language,

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.050
then move to some detail about,
um,

30
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.970
the different aspects of language,
including phonology,
morphology,
and syntax.

31
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.950
We discussed the ways in which language does the amazing things it does,

32
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.230
including the fact that language is used,

33
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:21.231
arbitrary signs or sounds to convey concepts and at languages exploit a common

34
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:23.550
editorial system,

35
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880
including recursion to put together these symbols into a virtually limitless,

36
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.250
a set of meaningful sentences.
Uh,

37
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:36.360
we then talked about development and made some remarks about the developmental

38
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.200
time course,

39
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.510
talking about the emergence of language from babies to where babies are really

40
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.960
good at learning language to you who are not,

41
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.940
whose brains have atrophied,
whose language capacities are dead.

42
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.710
Um,
final issue is to shift to animals.

43
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.710
Now that we know something about,
about language,

44
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.040
we could then ask do animals,
um,
use,

45
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.670
possess the same sort of language and if not,
can they learn it?

46
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.440
Now there is absolutely no doubt at all that nonhuman animals possess

47
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.950
communication systems.
This has been known forever.
Um,

48
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.860
and it's not a matter of controversy.

49
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.070
And if you want to use the term language to mean communication,

50
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:25.360
and the answer is obviously yes,
dogs and bees and monkeys have language.

51
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.200
If you want to use language though in the more technical narrow sense as

52
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.410
anything that has the properties that we discussed earlier using English and ASL

53
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:40.030
and Spanish and so on.
As our background,

54
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.360
the answer's almost certainly no animal communication systems fall into sort of

55
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:50.320
one of three categories.
Either there's a finite list of calls.

56
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.150
So vervet monkeys for instance,

57
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:57.130
have a small list of calls to convey different warnings like attack from a snake

58
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.050
or attack from a leopard.
There's a continuous analog signal,

59
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.770
so be dance for instance,
works on this way.
Be Dance,

60
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:09.730
communicates the location of food sources but doesn't do it in any syntactically

61
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:10.541
structured way.

62
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:14.860
Rather the intensity of the dance corresponds to the richness of the food
source.

63
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.300
And then you get things like random variation on a theme such as bird song,

64
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.610
but when you don't find in any real sense is phonology,
morphology,
syntax,

65
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.660
um,
common editorial systems or arbitrary names.

66
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.170
Now this much is not particularly controversial.

67
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.320
There gets to be a lot of controversy though.
This is the summary,

68
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.030
but non human communication systems,

69
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.400
it gets more controversial when we get to famous cases of primates,

70
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.550
um,
trained by humans such as Kanzi,
um,

71
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.450
Nim chimpsky and other famous primates that you may well have seen on the

72
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:57.220
discovery channel and other venues.
And this is fairly controversial.

73
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.880
If you read the gray textbook.
Well,

74
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.130
nothing in it is particularly inaccurate.

75
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.520
I think gray is actually a little bit too credulous to believing in the claims

76
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.550
that have been made about the abilities of the animals.
So many scientists,
uh,

77
00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:17.530
argue for instance,
that animals like Kanzi,

78
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.910
even if they can be said to be learning words at all,
learn very few of them.

79
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.080
And it takes them extensive years of training to learn.

80
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.300
Unlike a normally developing child who could learn a word in a day or a word and

81
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:34.180
an hour,
um,
the,

82
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.550
the utterance is often have order,

83
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.600
but this order tends to be very limited and um,
and,

84
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.380
and lacks the recursive properties.

85
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:46.100
And in fact the lack of recursion is not controversial.
Um,

86
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.240
finally the utterances of chimpanzees trained chimpanzees are extremely,

87
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:53.410
um,
repetitive.

88
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.950
So what you often see on TV and then documentaries is it sort of a sampling and

89
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.270
the sampling could often be very impressive.

90
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.420
But if you take just what they say at random,
it tends to look like this.
Um,

91
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.120
this is typical chimpanzee I'd Irwin's has just taken at random.
Um,
Nim,
eat name,

92
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:16.200
eat,
drink,
eat mean.
M Meagan,
Meagan,

93
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.370
me mean in play.
Me Eat me,
eat me.

94
00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:24.310
Banana Yuban enemy you give banana,
Mimi eat,

95
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.620
give orange B,
give,
eat orange.
Me,
eat orange.
Um,

96
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.310
glade once commented that if any normally developing child spoke like this as

97
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.710
parents had rush them screaming to a neurologist.

98
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.153
<v 1>MMM.</v>

99
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.740
<v 0>There's a broader question here,</v>

100
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.920
which is why would we ever expect a chimpanzee to learn a human language?

101
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.980
We don't normally expect one species to have the capacities associated with

102
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.550
another species.

103
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.760
So I'm bats use echolocation to get around and some birds navigate by the stars,

104
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:04.740
but there's not an active research program seeing if cats can use echolocation.

105
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.090
Our dogs could navigate by the stars.

106
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.420
And I think one reason why you might be temped to think,

107
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.740
well of course chimps must be able to learn language is because you might be

108
00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:17.410
caught in the grips of some bad ideas about language.

109
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.330
So one idea is you might say,
look,

110
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.910
Cim should use language because chimps are so smart.

111
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.450
But the response to this is they are smart,

112
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.140
but we know that smart isn't enough.

113
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.720
<v 0>We know that the human capacity for language is not totally result of smartness.</v>

115
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.500
There are smart showrun who due to some deficit in their language capacity,

116
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.750
don't speak or understand a language.

117
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.940
So the smartness of chimpanzees does not in itself demonstrate that they should

118
00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:48.960
be able to learn language.

119
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.650
You might also point out correctly that chimps are nearest evolutionary

120
00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:56.940
relatives,
which is right.
So you one would expect on the face of it,

121
00:07:56.941 --> 00:07:59.120
it's not unreasonable to expect.

122
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.083
<v 1>MMM.</v>

123
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.800
<v 0>Asked to share a lot of abilities with them.
On the other hand,</v>

124
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.640
we split from them a long time ago and plainly,

125
00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:13.780
humans are different from chimps and there was 5 million years either way.

126
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:17.380
And that's more than enough time for language capacity to invoke too

127
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.860
<v 1>evolve.
Um,</v>

128
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.540
<v 0>now none of this is to say that his study of nonhuman communication systems</v>

129
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.920
isn't interesting.

130
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.373
<v 1>MMM.</v>

131
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.940
<v 0>From my own.
This is my personal opinion.
I'll raise here from my own opinion.</v>

132
00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:38.290
The study of the attempts to try to teach chimpanzees or Gibbons or gorillas,

133
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.580
a human language like ASL are misguided.
Um,

134
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.910
it would be as if a team of monkey is kidnapped a human child and tried to train

135
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:50.380
them how to hoot like a monkey.
It might be enjoyable,

136
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.840
but it does not seem to give us any rich insights.

137
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.460
What I think is a lot more interesting is the study of these animal

138
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:58.260
communication systems in the wild.

139
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.210
There's a linguistics of human language that has delineated the principles that

140
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:05.610
underlie all human languages.
It would be,

141
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.390
it's extraordinarily interesting to attempt the same linguistic program to the

142
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:11.790
other communication systems use in the wild,

143
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.150
such as the cries of vervet monkeys and B dance.

144
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.380
So this brings the section on language to a close,

145
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:21.900
but I want to tell you a few things we didn't talk about.

146
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.400
One of the problems with an intro psych courses,

147
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.180
we have to whip through a lot of topics very fast.

148
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.720
So if you were to take a course that focused directly on language,

149
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.110
you might learn,
for instance,
more about language and the brain.

150
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.730
Something touched about very briefly in a textbook,

151
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.690
but something that has a large literature associated with it.

152
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.350
Similarly and related to this,
there's language disorders,

153
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.390
disorders like Aphasia as and disorders like specific language impairment and

154
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:52.860
dyslexia.
There's a study of language perception and production.

155
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.660
How is it that we do this amazing feat of understanding and producing words in a

156
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:01.650
fraction of a second?
Um,
where does that ability come from?

157
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.510
There's a study of reading,

158
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.040
which is in many ways different from the study of language.
Um,

159
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.430
remember when Darwin describe language as an instinct,

160
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.690
he carefully distinguished it from other things that don't come natural to us,

161
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.150
including reading.
Um,
and in fact,

162
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:22.230
reading is difficult reading as a cultural invention.
Not every human has it.

163
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.240
And unlike language reading is acquired with tremendous difficulty over many

164
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.840
years.
And the other hand reading plainly intersects with language.

165
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.940
It's a new way of conveying language.

166
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:37.440
Moving out from speech to writing and a psychology and neuroscience of reading

167
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.360
is the US.
Very interesting.

168
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.960
There's bilingualism and multilingualism.

169
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.140
The questions people in this room typically are going to be interested in is,

170
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:53.400
um,
does it matter for how well you learn language,

171
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:56.960
whether you're learning one or two or three or four.
Um,

172
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.770
how is it that are multilingual in codes all these different languages inside a

173
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:04.140
single brain and so on.

174
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.580
Finally a very hot issue is that of the relationship between language and

175
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:14.200
thought.
And I'm,
and I'm actually,
I,

176
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.810
a few years ago I taught an entire seminar called language and thought devoted

177
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.130
to precisely this question.

178
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.080
And it's a cool question and it could break up into two very general questions.

179
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.380
One is,
is language necessary for abstract thought?

180
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.030
And one way to answer that question is to look at creatures without language

181
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.720
like babies and chimpanzees and see how smart they are.

182
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.540
It might be that they're not,
that they're very smart,

183
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:42.270
in which case it would suggest that you don't need language for abstract
thought.

184
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.201
On the other hand,

185
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.470
it might be that they have certain cognitive limitations which would suggest

186
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:48.840
that language is essential for abstract thought.

187
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.070
Then there's a related question.
Even once know a language.

188
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:57.610
Does the structural properties of the language that you know affect the way you

189
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:01.720
think and the claim that the language you know affects how you think is

190
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:06.520
sometimes described as linguistic relativity or this happened or warf
hypothesis.

191
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.561
So,
for instance,

192
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.680
there's a lot of research looking at speakers of different languages such as

193
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:12.970
English versus Korean,

194
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.110
and seeing whether structural differences in these languages affect how you

195
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:21.030
think.
Now,
some of this work is discussed in the readings,
uh,

196
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.690
the both the gray text book and the selections from the Norton Anthology.

197
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.130
And this makes up,
again,
I've showed this to you on Monday.

198
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.450
You're reading response where you have to address this question and,

199
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.790
and take your best shot at answering it.

200
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

201
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.460
<v 0>What are your questions about language?</v>

202
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.863
<v 1>Yes,</v>

203
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.360
<v 0>the question was raised,
some people learn languages easier than others.</v>

204
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.370
And how do we explain this?
And the answer is,
um,

205
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.440
you could ask the question both with regard to first language learning.

206
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.030
So some children learn language,
uh,
very quickly.

207
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.870
Some are very slow.
And also with regard to second language learning,

208
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:28.280
some of you are breezing through your second language requirement here at Yale.

209
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.080
Others are struggling and miserable.
Um,

210
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.920
and there's considerable variation.

211
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:39.070
There's a story of Einstein who was very slow to learn language and didn't speak

212
00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:43.340
at all until he was four.
And in fact,
he was,
uh,

213
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.490
he said his first words when all of a sudden he was having separate with his

214
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:50.930
parents and he put down the spoon and he's,
and he said,
the soup is too hot.

215
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.360
And his parents did.
I'm astonished and said,
you've never spoken before.

216
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.260
And he said,
well,
up to now,
everything has been fine.

217
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.800
It's not a,
it's not a true story.
Um,

218
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.490
the question of why and where do these differences come from?

219
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.720
Nobody really knows.
And it's surprisingly hard.

220
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.540
There's a slight advantage for being female.

221
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.680
Girls are slightly more advanced in language than boys,
but it's not a big one.

222
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.500
And you need like a hundred people to just see it statistically.
Um,

223
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.700
there's you a big genetic factor.

224
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:32.330
If your parents learned language quickly and learn other languages quickly,

225
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.710
you're more likely to,

226
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.863
<v 1>but,</v>

227
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.230
<v 0>and understanding of the brain bases of these differences are the cognitive</v>

228
00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:42.890
basis or social basis is,
it's just,
it's largely an open question.

229
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.100
<v 1>Yes.
Yeah.</v>

230
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.120
Speak two different languages.

231
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.190
<v 0>Uh,</v>

232
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.810
this is actually more than norm around the world than the situation.

233
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.880
Neither states where kids are exposed to a single language.
Um,

234
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.300
what happens is children learn both languages.

235
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.430
Children are very good as adults are of distinguishing different languages on a

236
00:15:09.431 --> 00:15:11.530
basis that are sound system and her rhythms.

237
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.310
So they don't typically confuse them and then they just learn more than one

238
00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:19.300
language.
And that's actually more the average state of affairs around the world.

239
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.303
<v 1>Yes.</v>

240
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.843
<v 0>Um,</v>

241
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.110
the question is about the hemispheric specialization for language.

242
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.710
And I don't have actually much more to say than what I said before,

243
00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:48.310
which I agree is deeply unsatisfying.
If you're right handed,

244
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.620
language is probably in the left side of your brain.

245
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.370
How many people here are lefthanded

246
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:54.880
<v 1>okay</v>

247
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.150
<v 0>for you?
We don't know.
It varies.</v>

248
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.010
Some of you have in the left side,

249
00:16:00.011 --> 00:16:04.720
some of you have it in the right side for some of you is kind of die fuse.
Now,

250
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.390
why is this?
And in fact,

251
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.050
why are some people right handed and others left hand in the first place?

252
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.840
Those are really good questions.

253
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.313
<v 1>Yes,</v>

254
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.920
<v 0>yes.
I mean,
yes,
yes,
I'll answer that question.</v>

255
00:16:32.921 --> 00:16:35.950
I'm unfortunate it's gotta be the last one.
And then I'll go to two to vision.

256
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:36.881
The question is,

257
00:16:36.881 --> 00:16:41.350
does learning more than one language cause you to learn them slower than just

258
00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:44.320
learning one language and it would stand to reason that a would,

259
00:16:44.321 --> 00:16:47.890
there's a finite amount of mental resources.
If I'm just learning English,

260
00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:51.490
I use all of it for English.
If I'm learning English and Spanish,

261
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.360
I kind of got a split and you'd expect them to be each learned slower.

262
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.850
It's one of the surprises of the study of language development that that common

263
00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:02.560
sense for you does not appear to be true.

264
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.060
Troller and learning more than one language seemed to show no deficits,

265
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.003
um,

266
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:14.070
relative in each of their languages relative to a child learning just one

267
00:17:14.081 --> 00:17:15.340
language.
In other words,

268
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.610
if I am just learning English and I'm a kid and you're learning English and

269
00:17:18.611 --> 00:17:20.500
Spanish and you're a kid,

270
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.730
you'll reach the milestones in English the same time I will.

271
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.290
Your extra learning of Spanish doesn't seem to affect you.
Um,

272
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.590
there doesn't need to be any detriment for learning multiple languages.

273
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.540
Another question which comes up,
um,
is,
is there any cognitive deficit?

274
00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:40.840
In other words,
some people have argued at learning multiple languages,

275
00:17:40.841 --> 00:17:44.760
sometimes harm his children in certain ways.
This is a claim that's been made,
um,

276
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.480
in Quebec for instance,

277
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.770
over the debate over how children should be taught and French.

278
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.480
It does not appear to be the case.
There appears to be as far as we know,

279
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.320
no downside to learning many languages when you're young.

280
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.470
Does that answer your,
your question?

281
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:11.590
I want to move now to the topic that will take us through today and through the

282
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.080
beginning of next week.
Um,
perception,

283
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.040
attention and memory and I'm putting them together.

284
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.600
Um,

285
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.930
instead of treating them as separate lectures because there's a sense in which

286
00:18:23.931 --> 00:18:27.980
they're the same story.
Um,
you'll see a scene,

287
00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:32.780
you see this scene and you're looking at it and you're perceiving it is coming

288
00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:36.140
through your eyes and you're interpreting it.
It,
you see something,

289
00:18:36.141 --> 00:18:39.620
you see a man and you see a house.
If you were to shut your eyes,

290
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.110
you could still hold that scene and memory

291
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.780
and a week later if I'm to ask you about that,

292
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.890
like what season was it?
He would do pretty well.

293
00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:59.370
This is a story I want to talk about how we do this and in the course of this I

294
00:19:00.311 --> 00:19:03.490
want to make a series of of of claims.
Um,

295
00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.010
that goes something like this for perception.

296
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:08.590
I want to first persuade you the problem with perceptions hard

297
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.480
and that's successful.

298
00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:16.481
Perception involves educating unconscious guesses about the world for attention.

299
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.340
I want to suggest that we attend to some things and not others and we miss a

300
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:24.710
surprising amount of what happens in the world
for memory.

301
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.370
There are many types of memory.
The key to memories,
organization,

302
00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:31.460
understanding and you can't trust some of your memories.

303
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.150
How many of you remember where you were at nine 11.

304
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.240
Many of you are wrong

305
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.970
and I am never going to persuade you with us because you have certain memories

306
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.200
and you could tell the story.

307
00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:53.130
Everybody could tell a story where they were when the towers went down.

308
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.830
But clever psychologist on September 12th said,
let's do a study.

309
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.940
And they asked people,
where were you yesterday when you heard the news?

310
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.810
And they told them and then they went back to them later.

311
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.300
A year later,
two years later and said,

312
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.940
tell me about what happened September 11th.
Then we said,

313
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.860
I remember totally where I was.
I have a very,
and and often a story.
It was wrong.

314
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.740
There was a lot like that,
which we're gonna talk about.

315
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:26.090
And the biggest moral then,
so I put it really in really big print.
Um,

316
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:31.250
we are often wrong about our experiences,
both of the present and,
and,

317
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.900
and have right now.
So let's start with perception.

318
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.300
There's a story.

319
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.390
I went to graduate school at Mit and there was a story there about Marvin

320
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.470
Minsky,
who's the AI girl.
He 'em if you've heard of the words,

321
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.410
the phrase artificial intelligence,
that was him.

322
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.820
And if you heard the claim that people are nothing more than machines made of

323
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:57.460
meat,
also him.
Well,

324
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.490
there's a story where he was doing work on robotics and he was interested in

325
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:05.950
building a robot that could do all sorts of cool things.
That's like a robot.

326
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:11.770
And the story goes,
the robot had to,
um,
among that I had to rate,

327
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.210
had to,
to see the world.

328
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.070
It had to be able to pick up things and recognize people and see chairs and

329
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.970
navigate its way.
And Minsky said,
that's a tough problem.

330
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.030
It's going to take a graduate student a whole summer to figure it out.

331
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.050
And he assigned it to a graduate student for a summer project.
Um,

332
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.510
visual psychologists,
perception.

333
00:21:32.511 --> 00:21:37.511
Psychologists love that story because the study of computer vision and robotics

334
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:43.681
vision and the attempts to make machines that can identify and recognize objects

335
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:48.430
has been a profound failure.
There is at this point,

336
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:53.431
no machine on earth that could recognize people and objects and things at the

337
00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:57.730
level of,
you know,
a really dumb one year old.

338
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.140
And the reason why is that it's a much harder problem than anybody could have

339
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:09.790
expected.
Well,
what makes it such a hard problem?

340
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.870
One reason why you might think is an easy problem is you say,
okay,

341
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.430
we have to figure out the problem of how people see,
well,
here's what we do.

342
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.510
You're,
you're over there and here's your eye.

343
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:26.500
And somehow it has to get to this television monitor and then you look at it and

344
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:30.190
that'll solve the problem of how you see.
So sometimes people say,
Hey,
I hear the,

345
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:31.990
I flip things upside down.

346
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.800
I guess this guy is going to have to get used to looking at things upside down.

347
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.910
That's an interesting problem.
No,
that's not the way to look at it.

348
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.990
Cause that doesn't,
um,
that doesn't answer any questions.

349
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.390
That just pushes the question back,
fine,

350
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.560
how does he z we're not answering anything.
Similarly,

351
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.880
although the terminators view of the world may correspond to that,

352
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.610
that doesn't solve any problem with how he actually sees.

353
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.010
So he has all these numbers shooting out there.

354
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.020
Well you have to read the numbers.
He has to see this.
This is my iTunes.
Um,

355
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:11.320
in,
in that version,
here's,

356
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.930
here's the right way to think about perception.
Um,

357
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.120
you got the eye,
which is very ugly and bloody.

358
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.560
And then around here you have the retina and the retina is a bunch of nerve

359
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:28.561
cells and the nerve cells fire as for some stimulus and not others.

360
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:35.020
And from this array of firings firing,

361
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:39.640
not firing,
firing,
not firing.
You have to figure out what the world is.

362
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.420
So a better view is like this,

363
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.060
the firings of the neurons can be viewed as an array of numbers.

364
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.760
You have to figure out how to get from the numbers to objects and people.

365
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.993
<v 1>MMM.</v>

366
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.920
<v 0>And to actions and events.
And that's the problem.</v>

367
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.660
It's made particularly a difficult problem because the retina is a two

368
00:24:03.661 --> 00:24:08.661
dimensional surface and you have to infer a three d world from a two dimensional

369
00:24:08.731 --> 00:24:13.380
surface.
And this is from a mathematical point of view,
impossible.

370
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:18.600
And what this means is that there,
for any two dimensional image,

371
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.740
there is an indefinite number of three dimensional images that correspond to it.

372
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.740
So for instance,
suppose you had this on your retina.

373
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:28.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

374
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.220
<v 0>An array of like shape like that,
what does that correspond to in the world?
Well,</v>

375
00:24:33.221 --> 00:24:37.680
it could correspond to a thing just like that that you're looking for or it

376
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.900
could correspond to a square that's tilted backwards.

377
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.290
And so you have to figure out which is which.

378
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.250
And the way we solve this problem

379
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.860
is that we have unconscious assumptions about how the world works.

380
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:59.490
Our minds contain certain assumptions about how things should be that enable us

381
00:24:59.651 --> 00:25:04.651
to make educated guesses from the two dimensional array onto the three

382
00:25:05.561 --> 00:25:06.940
dimensional world.

383
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:11.560
And I purposefully did not make the slides available for this class ahead of

384
00:25:11.561 --> 00:25:13.540
time cause I don't want people to cheat.

385
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.250
But there are several points where you could look at the slides and confirmed

386
00:25:17.251 --> 00:25:20.590
that some of the things I'm going to tell you are actually true.
Um,

387
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.270
and I want to give you three examples.

388
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.450
One is color and I'm going to conflate here.

389
00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:29.200
Color and brightness and others objects the others depth.

390
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:35.350
First,
the prom of color.
How do you tell a lump of coal from a snowball?

391
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.840
Well,
that's a lumper call as a snowball.

392
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.810
It's from Google images.
Um,
how do you know which is which?
Well,

393
00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:50.740
Alumba call you say is black and the snowball is white.
How do you know?

394
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.950
Well,
maybe have on your red.

395
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:57.310
Now you're reading their responses or the color that hits it.

396
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.130
It's oversimplified,
but let's assume the desk.
It's true.

397
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:05.370
So this is black coming out and that's white and that's how you tell.

398
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.980
But in fact,
that can't be right.

399
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:14.550
It can't be right because objects color is not merely a matter of what material

400
00:26:14.951 --> 00:26:18.760
they're made of,
but of the amount of light that hits it.

401
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.130
So as I walk across the stage,

402
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.990
I fall into shadow and light and none of you screams out.

403
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.140
Professor Bloom is changing colors.
Um,

404
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.820
rather you automatically factor out the change in illumination,

405
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.580
um,
as this is happening,
and this could actually be quite striking.

406
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.500
So you see this display over here,

407
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.030
pick a look at those two blocks.

408
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:50.930
I take it you see this one as lighter than that one you do.

409
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.943
Um,

410
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.100
you might imagine this is because this strip is lighter than this,

411
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.780
but it isn't there the same.

412
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

413
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:07.550
<v 0>And you won't believe me until you actually print it out and take a look.</v>

414
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:08.850
But they are in fact the same.

415
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.100
I'll show it to you and you could say I'm tricking you,

416
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.450
but this is the way it works.
There's a closeout.

417
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.770
So remember we're comparing this and this.
Now,

418
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:18.900
let's take away other parts of the environment

419
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.770
and you'll see they're the same.
Now you say,
but hold it.

420
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.540
This can't be the same as this,

421
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.440
but the answer is goes like this.

422
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.410
<v 1>Okay,</v>

423
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:41.030
<v 0>we know shadows make surfaces darker.
We don't know this like,
Hey,</v>

424
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.380
here's something I know.

425
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.100
Rather we know this in that is wired up in our brains,

426
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.760
so when we see a surface in shadow,

427
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.790
we automatically assume that it's lighter than it looks and we see it as lighter

428
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.830
and you can show this by removing the cubes to the shadow.

429
00:28:00.831 --> 00:28:02.000
You see it as it really is,

430
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.440
and this is an illustration of how the information to your eyes,

431
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.860
it's just one bit of information that the degree of light coming from a single

432
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.930
source is one bit of information that you use to calculate certain assumptions

433
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.010
and come to a conclusion.
Here's a different kind of example.
Objects.

434
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:27.430
You see this and you automatically and intuitively segmented into different

435
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:33.080
objects.
You segmented into a man and a house and birds and trees.

436
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:39.460
How do you do this?
It turns out to program a computer to segment a scene.

437
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.840
At the different objects.
It's hugely difficult.

438
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.340
And the question of how we do it is to some extent unknown.

439
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:51.500
But one answer to this question is there are certain cues in the environment

440
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:56.240
that are signals that you're dealing with different objects and these cues are

441
00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:58.760
often described as your stall principles.

442
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.160
So one example is proximity.
When you see things that are close to each other,

443
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.780
you're more likely than not to assume that they belonged to the same thing.

444
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.520
There is similarity.

445
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.170
That display could correspond to an an indefinite number of objects,

446
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.190
but you naturally tend to see it as too,
um,
you,
you,

447
00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.740
you do one with one texture pattern.

448
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.740
The other with the other texture pattern closure,

449
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:29.870
the fact that this is a close square here suggests it's a single object,

450
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.260
good continuation.
If you had to judge,

451
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.980
this could just as well be two shapes,

452
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.370
one that runs from a to see the other one that runs from D to B,

453
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.180
but you don't to see it that way.
Rather,

454
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:46.660
you tend to see it as one that runs from a to B.

455
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.430
The other one that runs from c to d common movement.
If things move together,

456
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.880
they're a single object and good form.

457
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.050
You see the object over there.
In the absence of any other information,

458
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:03.520
you might be tempted to say that's a single thing,
a plus sign.

459
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:07.060
Maybe this because it has lousy form.

460
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.410
You're more tempted to say it's two things.
One thing lying on top of each other.

461
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.750
And these are the sorts of cues,
expectations.
None of them are right.

462
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.070
There's cases where they could all fool you,

463
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.010
but these are useful cues that guide our parsing of the world are segmenting of

464
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:29.280
the world into distinct objects.
Here are there,

465
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.020
summarize and here's a case where they fool you.

466
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.090
So you might think if you're,

467
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:41.100
I'm suggestible that there's a triangle here and this is a case where there's

468
00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.750
certain cues driving you to think that there's a triangle here.
There is however,

469
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:51.640
no triangle here.
If you cover up these little PAC men here,

470
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:55.510
the triangle goes away.
Similarly,
there is no square in the middle.

471
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.800
There is no square.
It's very matrix.
Um,

472
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.760
and these are illusions because these are cues that there should be a square

473
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:07.840
there.
The regularity of form

474
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.620
finally depth.
Um,
you see this and you don't,

475
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.280
you see it on one level as a flat thing,
another level.

476
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:20.740
You look inside the picture and you see,
for instance,

477
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:22.360
that the man is in front of the house.

478
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.380
You look at me and you see the podium.

479
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.100
And if you have a terrible neurological disorder,

480
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.270
you see this strange creature that's half podium leading onto a chest and up to

481
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:37.600
a head that's sort of the top items wiggling in a podium,
staying still.

482
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.460
If you are neurologically normal,

483
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.810
you see a man walking back and forth behind a podium.
How do you do that?

484
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.160
Well,

485
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.160
this is really a problem because I can give you a technical reason why vision is

486
00:31:52.271 --> 00:31:53.710
hard.
But crudely,

487
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.490
you got a two dimensional retina and you have to figure out a three dimensional

488
00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:01.090
world.
How do you do it?
And the answer,

489
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.720
once again is assumptions or cubes.
Um,

490
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.010
there's certain assumptions the visual system makes that aren't always right.

491
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.940
And in fact,
in cases of visual,
illusions can be wrong,

492
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.860
but we'll guide you to perceive the world in a correct and accurate way.

493
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.610
So for example,
there's binocular disparity.

494
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.340
This is actually a sort of interesting one.

495
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.100
This is the only depth cue that involves two eyes.

496
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.290
If I look at you pretty close,
um,

497
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:37.650
the image I get here and the image I get here are somewhat different while,

498
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:41.870
or I have to focus my eyes together to get the same image.

499
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.220
If I look at you and back,

500
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:47.780
they're almost identical because the further away given the two eyes that are

501
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:52.190
static,
the closer to images,
luck.
And it's not again,
that you say to yourself,

502
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.940
oh,
back there an orange.
It's the same image in my right eye and my left eye.

503
00:32:56.941 --> 00:33:01.460
He must be far away rather unconsciously and automatically.

504
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:06.730
You make estimations on how far people are in depth based on binocular

505
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:09.680
disparity.
There's interposition.

506
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:14.210
How do you know I'm in front of the podium and the podium is not in front of me?

507
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:19.190
No.
How do you know the podiums in front of me?
Well from where I'm standing,

508
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.090
it's right.
How do you know the podium is in front of me?
Well,

509
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.770
because you know,

510
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:29.830
I'm walking here and then it cuts into me and unless I'm going through a

511
00:33:30.351 --> 00:33:32.540
grotesque metamorphosis,
um,

512
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.930
what's happening is it makes sense to say I'm moving behind the podium.

513
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.940
Interposition you take the guy,

514
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.600
how do you know the guy standing in front of the house?
Well,
um,

515
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.140
because uh,
there's,

516
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.040
you see all of him and he's blocking a lot of the house.

517
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.380
There's relative size.
How far away am I?
Well,

518
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.860
if you looked at me and you had to estimate how far away I am,

519
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.710
part of the way you'll figure that out is,

520
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.230
you know how tall a human's supposed to be.

521
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:07.070
If you thought that I was 50 feet tall,

522
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.980
you would assume I'm further away than I am.

523
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.480
And so your judgments on size dictate your judgments about distance.

524
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.900
Usually this queue is unnecessary.
But you know,

525
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.300
if you look at the empire state building,
if you,

526
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.440
if you go into a field and you see a tower and you look your judgment of how far

527
00:34:27.271 --> 00:34:30.840
away the tower's going to be depends on on your,

528
00:34:30.841 --> 00:34:35.280
your knowledge of how tall the tower should be.
If it's like this tall,
he's like,

529
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:39.450
oh,
it must be,
and then you'd be surprised.
There's

530
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.530
texture gradient,

531
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.420
which I'll explain in a second and linear perspective,

532
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.720
which will also explain in a second texture gradient goes like this.

533
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.880
Remember the problem we had before?

534
00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.420
How do you know if that thing is this object tilted backwards or an object in

535
00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:02.430
and of itself?
Well,

536
00:35:02.431 --> 00:35:07.431
the answer is things with textures will show themselves because the texture

537
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.610
will,
will get smaller from a distance.
Now logically,

538
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.610
this could still be a single thing standing upright.

539
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.590
We've just dots going up smaller.

540
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.880
But the natural assumption is the reason why the dots received in his regular

541
00:35:20.881 --> 00:35:24.720
fashion is because it's receding in depth.

542
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

543
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.690
<v 0>Classic illusion.
Um,
the Mueller lawyer illusion,</v>

544
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:35.940
people will see this as longer than this.
It's not,

545
00:35:35.941 --> 00:35:39.210
if you don't believe me,
print it out and measure it.
Um,

546
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.750
related to the Pondo illusion.
Once again,

547
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:47.360
people see this one as you get an illusions named after you when you discovered

548
00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:51.180
these,
um,
this one as longer than this.
Again,

549
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:53.370
it's not what's going on here.

550
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.470
Well the top line looks longer even though it isn't.

551
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:04.010
And one re explanation for why is these other lines in the scene cause your

552
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:09.981
visual system to make guesses about distance and then you correct for distance

553
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.590
by making assumptions about size.
If you have two lines,

554
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.690
you getting a bit more detail in a second.

555
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.920
But if you have two lines and they take up the same amount of space on your

556
00:36:22.921 --> 00:36:23.754
retina,

557
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.680
but you believe that one is a hundred feet away and the other is 50 feet away,

558
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.370
the one that's a hundred feet away you will see as bigger.

559
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.820
Cause your brain will say,
well if it takes up just this much space,

560
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.240
but it's further away,
it must be bigger than somebody that's closer.

561
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:40.410
It takes up that much space

562
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.940
and that's what goes on here for the top line.
For the mule Royer illusion.
Um,

563
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:52.320
we assumed that this is further away and this is closer based on the cues to

564
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:54.690
distance and the q's factored in.

565
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.410
And because we assume that this is further away,

566
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.790
we assume it must be bigger to take up the same space as this,
which is closer.

567
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.960
Similarly for the Panto illusion,
there's linear perspective.

568
00:37:06.961 --> 00:37:10.220
Power lines tend to recede and distance.
Um,

569
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.920
if this top one is further away than this,

570
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.170
but they take up the same size in your eye,

571
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.560
this one must be bigger and you see it as bigger.

572
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:25.200
And the book offers more details on how these illusions work.

573
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.680
I'm going to end with an illusion that I'm not even gonna bother explaining.
Um,

574
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.930
I'll just show it to you because you should be able to based on thinking about

575
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:38.300
these other illusions,
figure it out.
It was developed by Roger Shepard.
Oh,

576
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:43.620
you know that.
Um,
and it were called Sheppard tables.
And the thing about it,

577
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:44.970
if these are like two tables,

578
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:49.410
if you ask people you don't frame in terms of here's a lecture and visual,

579
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:50.730
but that you'd ask people,
where'd you,

580
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:54.780
these tables would be easier to get through a door.
If you have a thin door,

581
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.800
he will say the one on the left,
um,

582
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.330
this one looks sort of thicker and harder to get through them.

583
00:38:00.331 --> 00:38:03.420
It looks longer and leaner,
in fact,
at the same size.

584
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.800
What I mean by that is that this triangle is exactly the same as this triangle.

585
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.820
Now I'm going to prove it to you by showing you is hunting,

586
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:21.420
which took me on the computer,
which took me about seven hours to do.

587
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.850
And nobody's going to believe it because I could have faked it.

588
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.200
But if you want printed out and do it yourself,
you just take a piece of paper,

589
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:29.580
put it on here,
then you move it

590
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:38.020
the same.
I showed it to somebody.
They call me a liar.

591
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.750
Anyway,
you're going to do it yourself in the privacy of your own home or study.

592
00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.480
Um,
but

593
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.700
what I'd really like you to do after you do it is say,
okay,
fine,

594
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.970
why does this one look longer and thinner than this one?

595
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:59.530
And the answer is the same answer that will explain the Mueller lawyer illusion

596
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:04.531
of Pando illusion having to do with Qsa depth and the way your mind corrects the

597
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:06.220
perception of depth.

598
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:14.310
And that's all I have to say at this point about perception.

599
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:19.030
I want to move now to attention and memory.

600
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:24.250
Um,
and I'm on a treat attention and memory together.
We are,

601
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:29.251
I'm fascinated with memory and in particular it's particularly interesting when

602
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:33.010
memory goes wrong.
Um,

603
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:38.190
it's particularly fascinating what happens in cases of Amnesia.

604
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.660
So for example,
um,

605
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.310
I need like a volunteer who's like willing to do a little bit of acting,
um,

606
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:51.290
very little bit,
incredibly,
a little bit real.
Excellent.
Okay.
So these,

607
00:39:51.291 --> 00:39:55.870
this data,
so pretend you have amnesia.
Okay.
What's your name?

608
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.600
Perfect.
I'm really glad you said that.

609
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.750
That's the wrong answer because you don't have total amnesia.

610
00:40:04.751 --> 00:40:09.250
You still remember English.
Okay.
It's very clever.
Okay.

611
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:14.290
Okay.
So,
so you couldn't have lost all your memories.
You have English you,

612
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:19.380
so we'll do you,
what's your name?
Ah,

613
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:24.520
he looks puzzled but he still maintains bowel and bladder control.

614
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:31.000
So he hasn't forgotten everything.
Now
I always,

615
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.330
I always lose lose the third volunteering I'd demo.
Um,

616
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:40.180
so memory is a hugely broad concept.

617
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.820
It includes autobiographical memory,
which is what we standardly think.

618
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:48.190
I mean that,
that's a perfectly rational response.

619
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.920
When I say [inaudible] me losing their memory,
Oh,

620
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.930
I have a movie about somebody losing their memory.

621
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.910
You don't imagine a person in diapers.

622
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.920
You imagine a person walking around having sex with cool people and saying,

623
00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.430
where am I?
And you know,

624
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.640
and so will you imagine is you imagine them losing their autobiographical

625
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:09.040
memory,
their sense of self.
But of course,

626
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:14.130
knowing English as part of your memory and knowing how to stand and knowing how

627
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:19.711
to chew and swallow are all things that you've learned that you've had been

628
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.520
molded by experience.
Um,

629
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.560
there's another distinction which is going to come in regarding Amnesia,

630
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:30.220
which is there's broadly two types of Amnesia.
They often run together,

631
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.340
but one type of Amnesia is you lose your memory of the past.

632
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.770
Another type of Amnesia.
That's,
that's the Matt Damon Amnesia.
Um,

633
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.740
another type of Amnesia though,

634
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.710
is you lose the ability to form new memories.

635
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.070
And here's a film of a man who had exactly this problem.

636
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:56.070
Um,
he was a world renowned choir director and he's suffered,
um,

637
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.060
viral encephalitis,
which led to brain damage,

638
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.790
which destroyed most of his temporal lobes.
Um,

639
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.860
his hippocampus and a lot of his left frontal frontal lobe.
It could be,

640
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:08.510
it could have been worse.
I mean,

641
00:42:08.511 --> 00:42:11.180
and that he retains the ability to talk and he seems to eat.

642
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:15.800
He's not intellectually impaired.
You just can't form new memories.

643
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.220
And so he lives in his perpetual.

644
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:22.520
Now where does nothing affects him.

645
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.540
And he feels this is not,
this is not always happen.

646
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:30.410
There's more than one of these cases and it doesn't always happen like this,

647
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.010
but he feels continually reborn at every moment.

648
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.620
Um,
and we'll return to this and then ask what's going on here.

649
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.770
But there's a few themes here.
Uh,
I want to,

650
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.140
before getting into detail about memory,

651
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:48.890
I want to review some basic distinctions in memory.
When we talk about memory.

652
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:53.090
So crudely,
you can make a distinction being sensory memory,

653
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:58.160
short term memory,
which is also known as working memory and long term memory.

654
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.780
Sensory memory is a residue.
In your census there was a flash of lightening.

655
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.880
You might see an afterimage that after image is your sensory memory.

656
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:12.470
Um,
there's somewhat of a longer echoic memory for sounds.

657
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.520
So as somebody who's talking to you,
even if you're not paying attention,

658
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.310
you'll store a few seconds of what they're saying,

659
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:22.880
which is sometimes when somebody is talking to you and you're not listening to

660
00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:26.450
them and they say,
you're not listening to me.
And he said,
no.

661
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:30.800
You were talking about and pick up the last couple of seconds from echoic memory

662
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.460
are short term memory.
Um,

663
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.430
anybody remember what I just said?

664
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.110
If you did that short term memory spans for,

665
00:43:41.111 --> 00:43:44.480
for a few minutes and then there's long term memory.

666
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:49.160
Anybody know who Elvis is?
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you live,

667
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:54.560
your longterm memory store that you walk around with and you're not gonna lose

668
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:59.330
right away.
Um,
when we think about Amnesia in the movie sense,

669
00:43:59.331 --> 00:44:01.640
we think of a certain loss of longterm memory,

670
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:06.710
long term memory associated with autobiographical personal events.

671
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.460
There's the distinction between employee implicit and explicit,

672
00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:14.060
which we'll talk about it and more detailed but explicit crudely is what you

673
00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:18.680
have conscious access to.
So,
um,
what you had for dinner last night,

674
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:22.040
you could think back and say,
I had this for dinner last night.

675
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.580
Implicit is more unconscious.
Um,

676
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.570
what the word,
what certain word,
like what the word had means.
Um,

677
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:36.470
how to walk,
how to ride a bicycle.
You might not be able to articulate,

678
00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:40.260
might not even be conscious of,
but still have access to.

679
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.720
Um,
there's a distinction between semantic memory and episodic memory.

680
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.890
Semantic memory is basically facts,
what a word means,

681
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:54.870
what's the capital of Canada and so on.
Um,

682
00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.510
episodic.
His autobiography is what happened to you,
um,

683
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:06.030
that,
that Yale is a new haven is semantic,

684
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.890
um,
that you went on vacation away from new haven last week.

685
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.400
It would be episodic.
Uh,

686
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.440
there is encoding storage and retrieval which refers to different levels of um,

687
00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:24.840
what happens in memory in coding is getting the memory in a,

688
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:29.841
as when you study for a test or you have an experience and a storage is holding

689
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:34.950
the memory and retrieval is getting the memory out.
Um,

690
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:36.300
finally,

691
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:41.300
retrieval is often broken conveniently into recall versus recognition where

692
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:43.560
recall is when you,
um,

693
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.740
you just pull it out of memory and recognition is when you,

694
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.410
you recognize what corresponds to certainly gonna pass.

695
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.830
Anybody remember what color tie I had on two days ago?

696
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.520
Oh,
okay.

697
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.300
Well that would be impossible to remember.

698
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.160
But if I asked you is it purple or is it orange?
That would be much easier.

699
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:06.893
Um,

700
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:16.220
now you could break up crudely the memory into stages.

701
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:21.770
So you started sensory memory is just the stuff that comes in leading to short

702
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:24.270
term memory,
leading to long term memory.

703
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.220
And this stage there is unusual discuss in more detail,

704
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.650
but this leads us to the issue of attention.

705
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:39.480
How did he get memory from your sensations?
From what you're hearing,

706
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.700
I'm speaking to you and you're hearing me.

707
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.730
How does it ever get in to the other systems?

708
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.010
What decides what's remembered and what's not?

709
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.860
There's all sorts of things happening to you now.
Um,

710
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.060
the seat of your chair is pressing against your,

711
00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:56.940
but you don't think,
oh,
I want to remember this forever.

712
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.040
The seats pressing against my butt.
You know,
your,

713
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:03.540
your neighbor's exuding a certain sort of smell.
You're,
you're,

714
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.790
you're thinking about something.
Your eyes follow them.

715
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.630
Not everything gets in memory.
You'd go mad if you tried to remember everything.

716
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.070
You can't.
So what determines what gets into memory?

717
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.860
Well,
one answer is attention does and attention is,

718
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:22.860
could be crudely viewed as a flashlight,

719
00:47:22.861 --> 00:47:26.760
a spotlight on experience that willingly zooms in on something

720
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:32.560
and makes it memorable.
Attention has certain properties.

721
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.800
Some things come from attention to attention effortlessly and automatically.

722
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.190
Here's an example.
You're going to see an array of letters here.

723
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:46.870
One of them's going to be green.
When you see the green one,

724
00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.093
please clap.

725
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.480
<v 1>Okay.
No,</v>

726
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.550
<v 0>no,
not,
not this green one.
There's gotta be another method.</v>

727
00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.633
<v 1>Why?</v>

728
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:03.800
<v 0>Okay,
you're ready now.</v>

729
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.653
<v 1>Okay,</v>

730
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.670
<v 0>now fine.
Not that old,</v>

731
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:11.260
<v 1>but,
but</v>

732
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.240
<v 0>there's going to be an oh,
when you see it,</v>

733
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.980
<v 1>clap.
Okay.
Sometimes it's,
it's work.</v>

734
00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.800
Find the red.
Oh,

735
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.313
<v 0>it's harder.</v>

736
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:39.260
Sometimes it's pension is involuntary.
Um,

737
00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:41.660
I need,

738
00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.140
I need a volunteer and all I want to do is I'm going to show you colors on the

739
00:48:45.141 --> 00:48:49.580
screen and I'd like you to name the colors as they come out.

740
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.920
<v 1>Oh,
okay.</v>

741
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.640
<v 0>The first one's easy.
Hey,
is this,
you have to just go down the colors.
Anybody?</v>

742
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.833
<v 1>Okay.</v>

743
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:09.480
<v 2>Red,
green,
blue,
black.
Green,
blue.
Red,
blue.
Black.
Red.</v>

744
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:10.943
<v 1>Excellent.</v>

745
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:20.010
<v 0>Okay.
Now these,
these will be words,
but just name.
Okay.</v>

746
00:49:20.011 --> 00:49:22.770
You just name it.
Just name.
Just name the colors.

747
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

748
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:29.450
<v 2>Green.
Red,
blue.
Black.
Blue,
red,
green.
Black.
Red,
blue.</v>

749
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.300
<v 0>Perfect.
Now we'll go back to you.
Same deal words.</v>

750
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.473
<v 2>Red,
blue.</v>

751
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.260
<v 0>Don't I know you can read the colors.
Okay.</v>

752
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.360
<v 2>Blue,
green,
red,
green,
black.
Green.
Blue.
Black.</v>

753
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.363
<v 1>Right.</v>

754
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.490
<v 2>Black.
Red,
black.</v>

755
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.620
<v 0>Very good.
Actually.
That's,</v>

756
00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:02.210
that's known as the stroop effect.
Being an expert reader.

757
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.560
As you are,
your knowledge of reading your attention to what the words meant,

758
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.840
subverted,
um,
you're a desire to do the task.

759
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.750
You couldn't make that go away even if you want it to.

760
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:19.730
If somebody gave you $1,000 to read this as fast as you read this,

761
00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.830
and as fast as you read this,
you'd be unable to.
You can't block it.
Um,

762
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.690
there's some work.
There's some interesting discoveries about attention.

763
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:35.060
I have a demonstration here.
I'd like people,
actually,
it's important.

764
00:50:35.061 --> 00:50:37.460
Some of you may have seen this before.
Um,

765
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.160
it's important for you to be silent throughout it.

766
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.100
Where you're going to see is you're going to see two teams,

767
00:50:43.101 --> 00:50:44.330
the basketball players.

768
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.370
One of them is going to,
um,

769
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:54.170
have a white t shirts.
The other one will have black tee shirts.

770
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.960
There'll be passing balls back and forth,

771
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.530
but I'd like you to do is count in your head how many passes the white team does

772
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.870
with the ball.
What,
what number did people get?
Okay?

773
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.000
Did anybody notice anything unusual?

774
00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:17.290
Did anybody not notice anything unusual?
Okay.
Some people,

775
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:19.420
some people did not notice anything unusual.

776
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:23.830
Those who didn't see anything unusual,
watch this again and just watch it.

777
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.023
Um,

778
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:31.030
about 50% of people when counting who have never seen this before,

779
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.850
don't notice anything.
But then when you're not counting,

780
00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.310
it's kind of obvious what you're missing.

781
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

782
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:56.090
<v 0>And this is one demonstration among many</v>

783
00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.830
of the fact that when you're attending to something,

784
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:06.050
you have a very small window of attention and you lose the focus on other

785
00:52:06.231 --> 00:52:09.020
things.
Here's another different example,

786
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.290
like people to watch a movie and pay attention very closely to what happens in

787
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:16.610
the movie and try to remember this.

788
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:23.410
How many of you noticed something odd in that movie?
How many of you didn't?

789
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.180
Okay.
Now everybody look at the,
look at the scarf,

790
00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:32.560
the color of the plates and the food,

791
00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:33.940
among other things.

792
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.680
The phenomena in general has been called changed blindness.

793
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.710
And what it is is we tend to be,

794
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:46.130
when there's a focus of attention focused in a certain way,

795
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:49.940
we tend to be oblivious to other things that go on in the environment.

796
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:55.270
Often it is in fact quite difficult when there's a change in scene to notice

797
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:58.700
what changes and what stays the same.

798
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.880
So in this final demo,

799
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.700
um,
there's this going to be two pictures.

800
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.393
<v 1>Flicking.</v>

801
00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.870
<v 0>Could you clap when you see what's different between the two pictures?</v>

802
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:25.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

803
00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:33.620
<v 0>I,
I myself,
I'm terrible at these things have less empathy.</v>

804
00:53:33.621 --> 00:53:34.760
How many people never saw it.

805
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:52.330
<v 1>All
right,
that's very impressive.</v>

806
00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:57.640
<v 0>One more.
One more time with a different one.</v>

807
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:18.270
Did anybody not see it?
Be Honest.
I'll give you another try.

808
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

809
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:35.900
<v 0>I'll put you out of your misery.</v>

810
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.233
<v 1>MMM.</v>

811
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:49.020
<v 0>This is work by Dan Simons and,
and it's,
um,</v>

812
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.800
it's part of an extraordinarily interesting body of work on what's known as

813
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:59.880
changed blindness.
And what this means is the phenomena is we,
um,

814
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:06.020
we have a very narrow focus of attention and huge changes can happen that we are

815
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:10.020
oblivious to.
This is why in movies are so many,

816
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.990
so much difficulty with continuity changes.
Um,

817
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.630
Dan Simons is also famous for having brought this outside of the laboratory.

818
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:23.430
Um,
in some classic experiments.
I'm trying to get the film corresponding to them.

819
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:27.630
What he did was he did this great study in the Cornell campus where he was,

820
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:29.010
where what would happen is

821
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:34.740
they would get some unsuspecting person walking through campus and some guy

822
00:55:34.741 --> 00:55:38.190
would come over and say,
excuse me,
sir,
I'm,
I'm lost.

823
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:42.670
Could you help me with directions and have a map and then any,
sure.

824
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:47.850
And then there'd be two construction workers holding a door and these guys were

825
00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:52.840
going to rudely bump between these two characters and then the experimenter who

826
00:55:52.841 --> 00:55:55.020
gets switched with another guy.

827
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:59.130
So now when these two guys walk away that the subject is standard with an

828
00:55:59.131 --> 00:56:00.420
entirely different person.

829
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.983
<v 1>MMM.</v>

830
00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.570
<v 0>What's interesting is nobody notices.</v>

831
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:11.540
They notice if the person changes sexist,
if then you used to be a woman.

832
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:12.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

833
00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:19.690
<v 0>Notice if the sub,
if the experiment or changes racist,
but most other changes,</v>

834
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.110
they're oblivious to.
Um,
there's another experiment,

835
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.390
I think Brian Shoulder,
this one.
Um,
but they've been Dan Simons,
um,
where,
um,

836
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.890
where,
what happens is subject comes into the lab.
They say,
you know,

837
00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:36.040
you got to do an experiment with us.
Um,
uh,

838
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.790
you need to sign the human subject for him,
handsome to form experimenter,

839
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.570
the subject science to form experimenter takes the form,
says thank you,

840
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:47.680
I'll put it down here,
goes down here and in a different person pops up,

841
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:52.120
people don't notice.
Um,
and,

842
00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:55.630
and there's a certain level in which we're oblivious to changes.

843
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.300
What's weird is we don't see,
we don't think we are.

844
00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:02.890
We think we see the world as it is and we don't know.

845
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.670
Notice that when we're attending to something,
everything else gets blanked out.

846
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:12.070
And so about 50% of people who have never seen this demo before the gorilla
demo,

847
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:16.150
they don't notice the gorilla.
And there was,

848
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.460
you couldn't imagine anything more obvious.

849
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:23.700
The gorilla study was actually done a very long time ago and it was originally

850
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:28.870
done in a different way,
but I'll show it to you just because,
um,

851
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.940
this is the original study and that you all know what to expect.
Um,

852
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:39.610
oh,
not that one.
Oops.
Nope.

853
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.490
That's actually,
if you looked at that quickly,
it's a current Yale professor.

854
00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.490
Oh,
I'm never going to get my DVD back.
Anyway,
I'll show you the other,

855
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.850
the other demo on.
Um,
next week

856
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:02.310
I will,
um,

857
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.900
any questions about attention and memory at this point?

858
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:09.283
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

859
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:17.203
Yup.

860
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.510
<v 0>Why?
Why does it work that way?
Why is it,</v>

861
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.740
why do things that become very practice become automatic and involuntary?

862
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:30.160
It's a good question.
I don't know.
We know that they do.
We know that once you,

863
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:34.270
um,
that you can't not read once you know how to read,

864
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:38.490
you also can't not listen.
You know,
if,

865
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:42.430
if I'm talking to you and I'm extremely boring,

866
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.720
but I'm talking,
he was very hard not to listen.
You can't shut off your ears.

867
00:58:46.721 --> 00:58:48.920
You can put your fingers in them,
but you can't shut off here.

868
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:53.110
You also can't shut your eyes without actually shutting them.

869
00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.760
You can't say,
this is a disgusting movie.
I'm not going to attend to it.

870
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.970
So that's not answering your question.
It's just saying that,

871
00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:06.680
that your observation is a right one and a more general one.

872
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:09.050
When you're good at something and you're over practice,

873
00:59:09.051 --> 00:59:12.050
it becomes involuntary and you cannot stop it.

874
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:13.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

875
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.620
<v 0>Okay.
Well.
Oh,
one one more and back.
Yes.</v>

876
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.570
Why not?
Sorry.
Over there.
Yep.

877
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.710
Did he remember things before his accident?
Yes,
he,

878
00:59:31.711 --> 00:59:34.640
he had some Amnesia of events before his accident,

879
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.910
but he did remember things like he knew his name and he knew other things about

880
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:41.240
his wife.
Okay.
I'll see you next week.
