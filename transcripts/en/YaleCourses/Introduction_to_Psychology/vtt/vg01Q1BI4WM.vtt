1
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.820
We're going to begin the class proper introduction to psychology with a

2
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.060
discussion about the brain.

3
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.720
And in particular I want to lead off the class,

4
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.873
um,

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
with an idea that the Nobel prize winning biologist Francis Crick described as

6
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.640
the astonishing hypothesis.

7
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.720
And the astonishing hypothesis is summarize like this as he writes.

8
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.440
The stop judging hypothesis is that you,

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.130
your joys and your sorrows,

10
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:48.420
your memories and your ambitions,

11
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:52.110
your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the

12
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.970
behavior of avast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules as

13
00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:58.890
Lewis Carroll's Alice might have phrased it,

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.870
you're nothing but a pack of neurons.

15
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.993
Um,

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.240
it is fair to describe this as astonishing.

17
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:11.241
It is an odd and unnatural view and I don't actually expect people to believe it

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.833
at first.

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.920
It's an open question whether you believe it when this class comes to an end.

20
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.060
But I'd be surprised if many of you believe it.

21
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:21.894
Now,

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.280
most people don't.

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.540
Most people,

24
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.110
um,

25
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.060
in fact hold a different view.

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.030
Most people are dualists.

27
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.870
Now dualism is a very different doctrine,

28
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.200
is a doctrine that can be found in every religion.

29
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.780
And in most philosophical systems,

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.160
uh,

31
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.010
throughout history,

32
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.950
it was very explicit in Plato for instance.

33
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.790
But the most articulate and well known defender of dualism is the philosopher

34
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:51.180
Rene Descartes.

35
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.280
And Rene Descartes

36
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.060
explicitly asked a question,

37
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.650
are humans merely physical machines merely physical things?

38
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.060
And he answered no,

39
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.990
he agreed that animals are machines.

40
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.831
In fact,

41
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:10.740
he called them beast machines and said animals.

42
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.140
Nonhuman animals are merely robots.

43
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.840
But people are different.

44
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.450
There's a duality of people like animals.

45
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.820
We possess physical material bodies.

46
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.710
But unlike animals,

47
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.640
what we are is not physical.

48
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440
We are immaterial souls that possess physical body,

49
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.890
that,

50
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.450
that have physical bodies that recite and physical bodies that connect to

51
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.410
physical bodies.

52
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.310
Um,

53
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.690
so this is known as dualism because the claim is for humans at least are two

54
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:43.590
separate things.

55
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.910
There's our material bodies and there's are immaterial minds.

56
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.900
Now they card may two arguments for dualism.

57
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.723
One argument,

58
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.410
um,

59
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.930
involved observations about human action.

60
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.560
So they lived in a fairly sophisticated time and his time did have robots.

61
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.770
These were not electrical robots.

62
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:06.131
Of course,

63
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.100
they were robots powered by hydraulics.

64
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.750
So they current would walk around the French Royal Gardens and a French royal

65
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:17.140
gardens were set up like a 17th century Disneyland.

66
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.430
They had these characters that would operate according to water flow.

67
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.860
And so if you stepped on a certain panel,

68
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.440
a swordsman would jump out with a sword.

69
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.480
If you step somewhere else,

70
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.900
a bathing beauty would cover herself up behind some bushes.

71
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.700
And they could have said,

72
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.330
boy,

73
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.280
these machines respond in certain ways to certain actions.

74
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.950
So machines can do certain things.

75
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:42.191
In fact,

76
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.050
he says our bodies worked out way too.

77
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.390
If you tap somebody on the knee,

78
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.690
your leg will jump out.

79
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.981
Well,

80
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:49.390
maybe that's all we are.

81
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.460
But they can't said that can't be.

82
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.290
Because there are things that humans do that no machine could ever do.

83
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.100
Humans are not limited to reflexive action.

84
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:00.410
Rather,

85
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.310
humans are capable of coordinated creative,

86
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.980
spunk and spontaneous things.

87
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.360
We can use language,

88
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:08.194
for instance,

89
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.360
and sometimes my use of language,

90
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.410
it can be reflexive.

91
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.050
Somebody says,

92
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.761
how are you?

93
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.180
And I said,

94
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.871
I am fine,

95
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:14.704
how are you?

96
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.600
But sometimes,

97
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.700
um,

98
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.630
I could say what I choose to be.

99
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:20.051
How are you?

100
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.160
Pretty damn good.

101
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.600
I can just choose.

102
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.710
And machines Descartes argued are incapable of that sort of choice.

103
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.200
Hence we are not mirror machines.

104
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.550
The second argument is of course quite famous and this was the method this he

105
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:38.590
came to using the method of doubt.

106
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.050
So he started asking himself the question,

107
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.700
what can I be sure of?

108
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.411
And he said,

109
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.244
well,

110
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.870
I believe there's a god,

111
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.120
but honestly I can't be sure there's a god.

112
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.790
I believe I live in a rich country,

113
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.230
but maybe I've been fooled.

114
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.051
Even said I,

115
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:57.790
I believe I have had friends and family,

116
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.310
but maybe I am being tricked.

117
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.950
Maybe an evil demon for instance,

118
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.510
has tricked me,

119
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.860
has diluted me into thinking I have experiences that aren't real.

120
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.251
And of course,

121
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:11.980
the modern version of this is the matrix.

122
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.930
The idea of the matrix is explicitly built upon Cartesian Descartes' worries

123
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:17.890
about an evil demon.

124
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.670
Maybe everything you're now experiencing is not real,

125
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.890
but rather as a product of some other,

126
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:25.330
perhaps my level and creature

127
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.750
Descartes similarly could,

128
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:29.710
could doubt he has bought,

129
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.544
he has a body.

130
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.751
In fact,

131
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:36.751
he noticed that mad men sometimes believe they have extra limbs or they believe

132
00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:39.010
there are different sizes and shapes than they really are.

133
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.760
And the cars,

134
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.140
how do I know I'm not crazy?

135
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.000
I mean crazy.

136
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.920
People don't think they're crazy.

137
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.960
So the fact I don't think I'm crazy doesn't mean I'm not crazy.

138
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.891
How do I know?

139
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:48.820
Descartes said,

140
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.350
I'm not dreaming right now,

141
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.010
but there is one thing they'd car concluded that he can not doubt and answers.

142
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.320
He cannot doubt that he is himself thinking that would be self refuting.

143
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.720
And so they cart use the method of doubt to say there's something really

144
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:10.721
different about having a body that's always uncertain from having a mind.

145
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.980
And he used this argument as a way to support dualism as a,

146
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.020
as a a way to support the idea that bodies and minds are separate.

147
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.820
And so he concluded,

148
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.490
I knew that I was a substance,

149
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.360
a whole essence or nature of which is to think and that for its existence there

150
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.610
is no need of any place,

151
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.530
nor does it depend on any material thing.

152
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.890
That is to say the soul by which I am what I am is entirely distinct from body.

153
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.343
Now,

154
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.170
I said before that this is common sense and I want to illustrate the common

155
00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:51.260
sense nature of this in a few ways.

156
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.100
One thing is our dualism as a mashing or language.

157
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.350
So we have a certain mode of talking about things that we own or things that are

158
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.184
close to us,

159
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.911
my arm,

160
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:02.391
my heart,

161
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:03.051
my child,

162
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:03.884
my car.

163
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.400
But we also extend that to my body and my brain.

164
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.720
We talk about owning our brains as if we're somehow separate from them.

165
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.340
Are Dualism shows up in intuitions about personal identity.

166
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.060
And what this means is that common sense tells us that somebody can be the same

167
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:27.320
person even if their body undergoes radical and profound changes.

168
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.970
Um,

169
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.430
the best examples of this are fictional.

170
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.250
So we have no wonder,

171
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.290
no problem understanding a movie where somebody goes to sleep as a teenager in,

172
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.020
wakes up as Jennifer Garner as an older person.

173
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.920
Now,

174
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.753
now nobody,

175
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.840
nobody says,

176
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.141
oh,

177
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:46.100
that's a documentary.

178
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:46.641
I believe that.

179
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:47.510
Thoroughly true.

180
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.940
But at the same time,

181
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.111
nobody,

182
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:51.861
no adult,

183
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:52.671
no teenager,

184
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:53.730
no child ever leaves,

185
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.760
says I'm totally conceptually confused.

186
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.571
Rather,

187
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:57.404
we follow,

188
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.790
we follow,

189
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.590
we follow the story.

190
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.720
We can also follow stories,

191
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.950
um,

192
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.950
which involve more profound transformations as when a man dies and is reborn

193
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.790
into the body of a child.

194
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.200
Now you might have different views around people around this room will have

195
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:18.530
different views as to whether reincarnation really exists,

196
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.660
but we can imagine it.

197
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.380
We can imagine a person dying and then reemerging and another body.

198
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.540
This is not Hollywood invention,

199
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.440
that one of the great short stories of the last century begins with the sentence

200
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:31.700
by Franz Kafka.

201
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.700
As Gregor Samsa woke one morning from uneasy dreams,

202
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.910
he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.

203
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.751
And again,

204
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:43.751
Kafka invites us to imagine waking up into a body of a cockroach and we can,

205
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.910
this is also not modern.

206
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.580
Hundreds of years before the birth of Christ,

207
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.790
homer described the fate of the companions of Odysseus who were transformed by a

208
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:59.490
witch into pigs.

209
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.271
Actually,

210
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:01.470
that's not quite right.

211
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.810
She didn't turn them in at the pigs.

212
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:05.070
She did something worse.

213
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.980
She stuck them in the bodies of pigs.

214
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.250
They had the head and voice and bristles and body of swine,

215
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.320
but their minds remained unchanged as before,

216
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.180
so they were pen there weeping and we are invited to imagine the fate of again

217
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:21.060
finding ourselves in the bodies of other creatures.

218
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.310
And if you could imagine this,

219
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:28.311
this is because you are imagining what you are as separate from the body that

220
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:29.454
you reside residing.

221
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.180
We allow for the notion that many people can occupy one body.

222
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.000
This is a mainstay of some slapstick humor,

223
00:09:37.001 --> 00:09:38.620
including the classic movie.

224
00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:39.454
All of me,

225
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.151
Steve Martin,

226
00:09:40.151 --> 00:09:40.751
Lily Tomlin,

227
00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:41.680
highly recommended,

228
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.640
but many people think this sort of thing really happens.

229
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.110
One analysis,

230
00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:52.111
a multiple personality disorder is that you have many people inside a single

231
00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:54.580
body fighting it out for control.

232
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.900
Now we will discuss multiple personalities sort of towards the end of the

233
00:09:58.901 --> 00:10:01.150
semester and it turns out things are a good deal.

234
00:10:01.151 --> 00:10:02.560
More complicated than this,

235
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.560
but still my point isn't about how it really is,

236
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:06.760
but how we think about it.

237
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.560
Common Sense tells us you could have more than one person inside a single body.

238
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.830
This shows up in a different context involving exorcisms were many belief

239
00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:20.290
systems allow for the idea that people's behavior,

240
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.100
particularly they're evil or irrational behavior could be because something else

241
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.440
has taken over their bodies.

242
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.953
Finally,

243
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.273
um,

244
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.840
most people around the world,

245
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.020
all religions and most people in most countries that most times believe that

246
00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:43.520
people can survive the destruction of their bodies.

247
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.900
Um,

248
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.010
now cultures differ according to the fate of the body.

249
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.560
Some cultures have the body going to hit,

250
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:51.850
sorry,

251
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.000
the fate of the soul.

252
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.690
Some cultures have you going to heaven or descending the hell.

253
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.700
Others have you occupied another body.

254
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.480
Um,

255
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.570
still others have you occupying a morphous spirit world.

256
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.220
But what they share is the idea that what you are is separable from this

257
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:08.900
physical thing you carry around.

258
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.220
And the physical thing,

259
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.150
um,

260
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:16.150
that you carry around a can be destroyed while you live on.

261
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:17.900
Um,

262
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.290
these views are particularly common in the United States.

263
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:21.921
Uh,

264
00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:25.640
in one survey done in Chicago a few years ago,

265
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.450
people were asked her religion and then were asked what would happen to them

266
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.380
when they died.

267
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.300
Most people in the sample.

268
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:35.930
We're Christian and about 96% of Christian said,

269
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.800
when I die,

270
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.700
I'm going to go to heaven.

271
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.550
Some of the sample was Jewish.

272
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.881
Now,

273
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:45.881
Judaism is actually a religion with a less than clear story about the afterlife.

274
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.300
Still,

275
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.020
most of the subjects who identify themselves as Jewish said when they die,

276
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:51.854
they will go to heaven.

277
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.310
Um,

278
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.200
some of the sample denied having any religion at all,

279
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.850
said they have no religion at all.

280
00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.773
Still,

281
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.390
when these people were asked what would happen when they would die,

282
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.800
most of them answered,

283
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.700
I'm going to go to heaven.

284
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.440
So dualism is in Mash.

285
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.060
It lot rests on it.

286
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.520
But as Chris points out,

287
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.900
the scientific consensus now is that dualism is wrong.

288
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.470
There is no you separable,

289
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.940
are separate from your body in particular.

290
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.880
There is no use separable from your brain.

291
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.650
To put it the way cognitive scientists and psychologists and neuroscientists

292
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.550
like to put it,

293
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.000
the mind is what the brain does.

294
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:38.680
The brain,

295
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.020
the mind reflects the workings of the brain.

296
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.980
Just like computation reflects the working of a computer.

297
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.241
Now,

298
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:48.970
why would you hold such an outrageous view?

299
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.910
Why would you reject dualism in favor of this alternative?

300
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:52.481
Well,

301
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:53.380
a few reasons.

302
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.280
One reason is dualism has always had its problems.

303
00:12:57.281 --> 00:12:58.060
For one thing,

304
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.310
it's a profoundly unscientific doctrine.

305
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.620
We want to know as curious people

306
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.860
how children learn language,

307
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.520
what we find attractive or unattractive.

308
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.560
What's the basis for mental illness?

309
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.710
And dualism simply says it's all nonphysical as part of the ether and hence

310
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:22.081
fails to explain it more specifically duelist like Descartes struggle to explain

311
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.510
how a physical body connects to an immaterial soul.

312
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.100
What's the conduit?

313
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.410
How good this connection be made after all day card knew full well that there is

314
00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:36.280
such a connection,

315
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.130
you're your body obeys your commands.

316
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.090
Um,

317
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.040
if you bang your toe stub your toe,

318
00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:43.000
you feel pain.

319
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.500
If you drink alcohol,

320
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:45.790
it affects your reasoning.

321
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.160
But he could only wave his hands as to how this physical thing in the world

322
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.680
could connect to an immaterial mind.

323
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.990
They car when he was alive was reasonable enough concluding that physical

324
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:06.730
objects cannot do certain things.

325
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.160
He was reasonable left and concluding.

326
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:09.551
For instance,

327
00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:13.480
as he did that there's no way a merely physical object could ever play a game of

328
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:15.610
chess because,

329
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.600
and that's such a capacity is beyond the capacity of the physical world.

330
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.310
And hence you have to apply,

331
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.940
you have to extend the explanation to an immaterial soul.

332
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.030
But now we know we have what,

333
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.160
what scientists call an existence proof.

334
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.840
We know physical objects can do complicated and interesting things.

335
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.370
We know for instance,

336
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.960
machines can play chess.

337
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.570
We know machines can manipulate symbols.

338
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.720
We know machines have limited capacities to engage in mathematical and logical

339
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:51.391
reasoning to recognize things to do various of computations.

340
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.740
And this makes it at least possible that we are such machines.

341
00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.180
So one,

342
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.500
you can no longer say,

343
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:00.920
look,

344
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.300
physical things just can't do that because we know physical things can do a lot.

345
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.910
And this opens up the possibility that,

346
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.311
that,

347
00:15:08.311 --> 00:15:11.210
that humans are physical things in particular that humans,

348
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:12.050
our brains.

349
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.603
Finally,

350
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.020
there is strong evidence that the brain is involved in mental life.

351
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.300
Somebody who hold the hell a dualist view.

352
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.320
Um,

353
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.830
that said that what we do and what we decided and what we think and what we want

354
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.551
are all,

355
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:33.440
have nothing to do with the physical world would be embarrassed by the fact that

356
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:36.530
the brain seems to correspond in intricate and,

357
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.260
and the Lamber ways to our mental life.

358
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.430
Um,

359
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.010
now this has been known for a long time.

360
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.570
Philosophers and psychologists knew for a long time they're getting smacked in

361
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:48.404
the head.

362
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.870
Could Change your mental faculties,

363
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:56.110
that diseases like syphilis could make you the range that chemicals like

364
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:59.240
caffeine and alcohol can affect how you think.

365
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.220
But what's new is we can now in different ways see the direct effects of mental

366
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:05.000
life.

367
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Somebody with a severe and profound loss of mental faculties.

368
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.590
The deficit will be shown correspondingly in her brain.

369
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.113
Um,

370
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.140
studying is using imaging techniques like cat scans,

371
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:22.520
pet and FMRI,

372
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:27.521
ri illustrate that different parts of the brain are active at during different

373
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:30.050
parts of mental life.

374
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.040
For instance.

375
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:31.940
Um,

376
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.320
the different he seeing words,

377
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:34.131
hearing words,

378
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:39.131
reading words and generating words can correspond to different aspects of what

379
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.910
part of your brain is active.

380
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.050
To some extent,

381
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:47.170
if we put you in an Fmri scanner and observe what you're doing in real time by

382
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:50.480
looking at the activity patterns in your brain,

383
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:56.060
we can tell whether you're thinking about music or thinking about sex.

384
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.441
To some extent,

385
00:16:57.441 --> 00:17:02.180
we can tell whether you're solving a moral dilemma versus something else.

386
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.230
And this is no surprise if what we are as to workings of our,

387
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:07.460
of our physical brains,

388
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.240
but it is extremely difficult to explain,

389
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.330
um,

390
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.680
if one is a dualist.

391
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.803
Now,

392
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.600
so what you have is the scientific consensus is that all a mental life,

393
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:25.490
including consciousness and emotions and choice morality are the products of

394
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:26.570
brain activities.

395
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:32.110
So you would expect that when you rip open the skull and look at the brain,

396
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.180
you'd see something glorious.

397
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.261
You'd see like,

398
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:37.070
I dunno,

399
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.030
a big shiny thing with glass tubes and blinding lights and,

400
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.730
and sparks and wonderful colors.

401
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.880
And actually the brain is just disgusting.

402
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.193
Um,

403
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.430
it looks like like an old meatloaf.

404
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.241
It's,

405
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:51.900
um,

406
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.171
it's,

407
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.400
it's gray.

408
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.780
When you take it out of the head,

409
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.890
it's called gray matter.

410
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.560
But that's just because it's out of the hat.

411
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.460
Inside the head is bright red because it's pulsing with blood.

412
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.530
It doesn't even taste good.

413
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.953
Um,

414
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:07.860
has,

415
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.330
has anybody in here ever even brain,

416
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.390
I mean it's good with cream sauce but everything's good with cream sauce.

417
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.333
So,

418
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.761
so,

419
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:22.761
so the question is how can something like this give rise to us?

420
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.820
And I mean you have to have some sympathy for four day card.

421
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:29.880
There was another argument,

422
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:33.060
day card could have made us a lot less subtle than the ones he did make,

423
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:38.061
which is that thing responsible for freewill and love and consciousness.

424
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.163
Ridiculous.

425
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.460
What I want to do and what the goal of of neuroscience is is to make it less

426
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:50.760
ridiculous to try to explain how the brain works,

427
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.610
how the brain can give rise to thought.

428
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.330
And what I want to do today is take a first stab at this question.

429
00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.853
Um,

430
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.910
but it's something we'll continue to discuss throughout the course as we talk

431
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:05.160
about different aspects of mental life.

432
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.650
What I want to do though now is provide a big picture.

433
00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:13.651
So I want to do is start off small with the smallest interesting part of the

434
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:17.190
brain and then get bigger and bigger and bigger.

435
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.470
Talk about how the small part of the brain,

436
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.491
the neurons,

437
00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:24.600
the basic building blocks of thought combined to other mental structures and

438
00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:27.990
then the different sub parts of the brain and finally to the whole thing.

439
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.693
So

440
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.530
one of the discoveries of psychology is that the basic unit of the brain appears

441
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:43.371
to be the neuron to neuron is a specific sort of cell and the neuron has three

442
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:45.630
major parts.

443
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.580
As you could see illustrated here.

444
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.980
Neurons actually look quite different from one another,

445
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.270
but this is a typical one.

446
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.060
There are the dendrites,

447
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:59.420
these little tentacles here and the dendrites get signals from other neurons.

448
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.290
Now these signals can be either excitatory,

449
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.710
which is that they raised the likelihood to neuron will fire or inhibitory and

450
00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:12.360
that they lower the likelihood that the neuron will fire.

451
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.410
The cell body sums it up and you could view it arithmetically.

452
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.400
The excitatory signals are pluses,

453
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.340
the inhibitory ones are minuses.

454
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.640
And then if you get a certain number of plus 60 or something,

455
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.630
the neuron will fire and it fires along the Axon.

456
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.100
The thing to the right,

457
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.190
the Axon is um,

458
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.120
much longer than the dendrites.

459
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:36.781
And in fact,

460
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:38.670
some axons are many feet long.

461
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:38.970
Um,

462
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.510
there's an axon leading from your spinal cord to your big toe.

463
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:43.643
For instance.

464
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.710
It is so shocking.

465
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:47.544
The lights out.

466
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.920
I'm surrounded surrounding to complete a mechanical metaphor that would've led

467
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:56.800
Descartes to despair.

468
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.131
Thank you,

469
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:57.910
Pauline.

470
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.570
Um,

471
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.960
so rounding the Axon is a Myelin Sheath,

472
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.300
which is actually just insulation.

473
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.760
It helps to firing work quicker.

474
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.250
So here are some facts about neurons.

475
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.440
There are a lot of them,

476
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.200
about a thousand billion of them,

477
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.910
and each neuron can be connected to around thousands,

478
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:21.310
perhaps tens of thousands of other neurons.

479
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:26.050
So it's an extraordinarily complicated computing device.

480
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.360
Neurons come in three flavors.

481
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.100
There are sensory neurons,

482
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:31.960
which takes information from the world.

483
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.130
So as you see me,

484
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:33.970
for instance,

485
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:34.970
um,

486
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.210
there are neurons firing from your retina,

487
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.160
sending signals to your brain.

488
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.780
There are motor neurons.

489
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.490
If you decide to raise your hand.

490
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.930
Those are motor neurons telling the muscles what to do.

491
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.440
And there are interneurons which connect the two and basically the inter neurons

492
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.793
do the thinking.

493
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.880
They make the connection between sensation in action.

494
00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.650
Um,

495
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.070
it used to be believed and it's the sort of thing I would've when I taught this

496
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:04.060
course many years ago,

497
00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:05.440
I would lecture on that.

498
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:07.480
Neurons do not grow back.

499
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:08.590
Once you lose them,

500
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:09.763
um,

501
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.241
they,

502
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.260
you never get them back.

503
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:13.060
This is actually not true.

504
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.780
There are parts of the brain in which neurons can regrow.

505
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.060
One interesting thing about neurons is a neuron is like a gun.

506
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.790
It either fires or it doesn't,

507
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.230
it's all or nothing.

508
00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.973
Um,

509
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.180
if you squeeze the trigger of a gun really hard and really fast,

510
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:35.080
it doesn't fire any faster or harder than if you just squeezed it gently.

511
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.370
Um,

512
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.170
that is seems to be strange.

513
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.740
Wha How could neurons be all or nothing when sensation is very graded?

514
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.080
If somebody next to you pushed on your hand,

515
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.513
um,

516
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.200
the degree of pushing,

517
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.280
you'd be able to notice it.

518
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:52.810
It's not either pushing or not pushing.

519
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.830
You can degrees of pushing the Greens of heat,

520
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.030
degrees of brightness.

521
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.760
And the answer is although neurons are all or nothing,

522
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:02.470
there are ways to code intensity.

523
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:07.830
So one simple way to code intensity is the number of neurons firing the more

524
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.160
neurons and more intent.

525
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.870
Another way to increase intensity is the frequency of firing.

526
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.433
Um,

527
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.853
so

528
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.220
I'll just use those two.

529
00:23:23.221 --> 00:23:24.960
The first one is the number of neurons firing.

530
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.310
The second one is the frequency of firing in that something is more intense.

531
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.300
If it's bang,

532
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:30.601
Bang,

533
00:23:30.601 --> 00:23:30.841
Bang,

534
00:23:30.841 --> 00:23:31.081
Bang,

535
00:23:31.081 --> 00:23:31.291
Bang,

536
00:23:31.291 --> 00:23:31.541
Bang,

537
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:32.250
Bang,

538
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.060
Bang,

539
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:33.720
Bang,

540
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.553
Bang.

541
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.230
And these are two ways through which neurons,

542
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.030
Incode intensity.

543
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.610
Now neurons are connected and they talk to one another

544
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.920
and it used to be thought they were tied to one another.

545
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.211
Like a computer.

546
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:53.240
Like you take wires and you connect wires to each other,

547
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:54.710
you wrap them around and connect them.

548
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.113
Um,

549
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.770
it turns out this isn't the case.

550
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:01.820
It turns out that neurons relate to one another chemically in a kind of

551
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:06.590
interesting way between any neurons between the Axon of one neuron and the

552
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:07.880
dendrite of another.

553
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.800
It was a tiny gap.

554
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.910
The gap could be about one 10000th of a millimeter wide.

555
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.380
This infant decimal gap and this gap is known as a synapse.

556
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.740
And what happens is when a neuron fires an axon sense chemicals shooting through

557
00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:25.064
the gap,

558
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.080
these chemicals are known as neuro transmitters and they affect the den rights.

559
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.020
So neurons communicate to one another chemically.

560
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.370
Um,

561
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.990
these again,

562
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.410
the chemicals could excite the other neuron,

563
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.370
excitatory,

564
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.290
bring up the chances that we'll fire or inhibit the other neuron inhibitory.

565
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.310
Now Neuro transmitters become interesting because alon of psychopharmacology,

566
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.530
um,

567
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.980
both of the medical sort end,

568
00:24:55.981 --> 00:25:00.981
a recreational sort consists of fiddling with transmitters.

569
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.990
And so you could,

570
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.880
you could see this through some examples.

571
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.780
Um,

572
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.500
there are two sorts of ways you could fiddle with neurotransmitters and

573
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:10.520
correspondingly,

574
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.540
two sorts of drugs that are agonists.

575
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.690
And what an agonist does is increases the effect of neuro transmitters either by

576
00:25:20.961 --> 00:25:25.961
making more neuro transmitters or stopping the cleanup of neurotransmitters or

577
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:29.840
in some cases by faking a neuro transmitter by mimicking his effects.

578
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.790
Then there are antagonists that slow down the amount of neurotransmitter's

579
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.960
either because they destroyed neuro transmitters or they make it hard to create

580
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:39.560
more.

581
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.580
Or in some cases,

582
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:41.480
they go to the den,

583
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:45.230
right of the neuron and it kind of put a paste over it so that the

584
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:46.910
neurotransmitters can't connect.

585
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.660
And it's through these clever ways that neurons can affect your mental life.

586
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.870
<v 1>Okay?</v>

587
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.100
<v 0>So for instance,</v>

588
00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.613
<v 1>mmm,</v>

589
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:05.310
<v 0>there is a drug known as Carrari and Carrari,</v>

590
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.233
um,

591
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.950
is an antagonist.

592
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.680
It's a very particular sort of antagonist.

593
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.281
It,

594
00:26:11.281 --> 00:26:11.890
um,

595
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.570
it blocks motor neurons from effecting muscle fibers.

596
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.100
What this does then is it paralyzes you because your motor neurons,

597
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.870
you send the command to your arm to stand,

598
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.780
to lift up.

599
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.740
It doesn't work.

600
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.200
You send a command your leg just to move.

601
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.280
It doesn't work.

602
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.130
The Motor neurons are rd activated.

603
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.263
Um,

604
00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.900
and then because the way you breathe is through motor neurons,

605
00:26:36.901 --> 00:26:37.734
you didn't die.

606
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.320
There's alcohol.

607
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.360
Alcohol is inhibitory.

608
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.350
Now,

609
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.990
this may be puzzling to people.

610
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.141
It's,

611
00:26:45.141 --> 00:26:50.010
it's mildly paradoxical because you may be thinking alcohol is not inhibitory.

612
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.150
On the contrary,

613
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.130
when I drink a lot of alcohol,

614
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.860
I lose my inhibitions and become a more fun person.

615
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.143
I become,

616
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:02.180
I become more aggressive and more sexually vibrant and simply more beautiful.

617
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.233
And,

618
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.140
and so in what ways alcohol?

619
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.890
Inhibitory.

620
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.340
Well,

621
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.070
the answer is it,

622
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.710
it,

623
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.100
it inhibits the inhibitory parts of your brain.

624
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.630
So you have parts of your brain that are basically telling you now largely in

625
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:19.464
the frontal lobes,

626
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:20.640
okay,

627
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.780
keep your pants on.

628
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.460
Don't hit anybody,

629
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.110
don't use bad words.

630
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.210
Alcohol relaxes,

631
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.340
shuts down those parts of the brain.

632
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.920
If you take enough alcohol,

633
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:35.910
it then goes down to inhibit the excitatory parts of your brain and then you

634
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:37.170
fall on the floor and pass out

635
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.840
amphetamines.

636
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.670
Increased amount of arousal in particular,

637
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:46.500
they increased amount of norepinephrine.

638
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.280
I'm a neurotransmitter's as responsible for,

639
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:50.820
um,

640
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.250
just general arousal.

641
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.310
And so I'm Pheta means include drugs like speed and coke.

642
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.593
Um,

643
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.543
there are,

644
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.563
ah,

645
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.360
PROZAC works on Serotonin when we discuss clinical psychology and depression.

646
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.273
Um,

647
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.540
we'll learn the extent to which neurotransmitter disorders are implicated in

648
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:17.010
certain disorders like depression.

649
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.560
And one problem is that,

650
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:20.130
um,

651
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.970
for depression is that there's too little of a neurotransmitter known as

652
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:24.804
Serotonin.

653
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.243
Um,

654
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.120
Prozac make serotonin more prevalent and so in some extent might help alleviate

655
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.003
depression.

656
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.700
Um,

657
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.700
Parkinson's disease is a disease involving destruction of motor control and loss

658
00:28:41.671 --> 00:28:42.600
of motor control,

659
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.830
difficulty moving.

660
00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.580
Um,

661
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.930
and one factor in Parkinson's is too little of a neurotransmitter known as

662
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:49.764
dopamine.

663
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.730
The drug,

664
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:55.730
L-dopa increases the supply of dopamine and so does something to alleviate at

665
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:58.500
least temporarily the symptoms of Parkinson's.

666
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.440
So you have neurons and their cluster together and they fire and the communicate

667
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:05.274
to one another.

668
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:10.260
So how does this all work to give rise to creatures who could do interesting

669
00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:12.150
things like talk and think?

670
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:12.991
Well,

671
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:13.710
again,

672
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.860
it used to be believed that the brain is wired up like a computer,

673
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.190
like a PC or a mac or something like that.

674
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.620
But we know this can't be true.

675
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.970
It can't be true because there's two ways in which the brain is better than a

676
00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:27.804
computer.

677
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.700
For one thing,

678
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.530
the brain is highly resistant to damage.

679
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.400
If you have a laptop and I persuade you to open it up for me and I take the

680
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:46.531
pliers and kind of snip just about anywhere your laptop will be destroyed,

681
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.720
but the brain is actually more resilient.

682
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.960
You can take a lot of brain damage and still preserve some mental functioning to

683
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:59.740
some interesting sands through some sort of damage resistance built into the

684
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:04.330
brain that allows different parts of the brain to take over if some parts are

685
00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:05.164
damaged.

686
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:09.400
A second consideration is the brain is extremely fast.

687
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.210
Your computer works on wires and electricity,

688
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:18.450
but your brain uses tissue and tissue is extremely slow.

689
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:24.760
The paradox then is how do you create such a fast computer with such slow stuff

690
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:25.961
and you can't,

691
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:26.380
what if,

692
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:26.681
if the,

693
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:29.260
if the brain was wired up like a personal computer,

694
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.440
it would take you four hours to recognize a face,

695
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.320
but in fact we could do things extremely quickly.

696
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.310
So the question then is how is the brain wired up?

697
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:45.060
And the answer is unlike many come on like commercially generated computers,

698
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.850
the brain works through parallel processing,

699
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:51.010
massively parallel distributed processing.

700
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.930
There's a whole lot of research and this is research,

701
00:30:55.931 --> 00:30:59.710
some of which takes place outside psychology departments and an engineering

702
00:30:59.711 --> 00:31:04.711
departments and computer science departments trying to figure out how a computer

703
00:31:06.641 --> 00:31:08.650
can do the same things brains can do.

704
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.400
And one way people do this is they take a hint from nature and they try to

705
00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:18.880
construct massively distributed networks to do aspects of reasoning.

706
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.300
So there's a very simple computational network that is interesting because it

707
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:27.940
kind of looks to some extent like the way neurons look.

708
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:33.180
And this is often known as neural networks and people who study this often claim

709
00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:38.650
to be studying neural network modeling to try to build smart machines by

710
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:40.540
modeling them after brains.

711
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.810
And in the last 20 years or so,

712
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.950
this has been a huge and vibrant area of study where people are trying to wire

713
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:52.870
up machines that can do brain-like things from components that look a lot like

714
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:55.510
neurons and are wired up together as neurons are.

715
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.813
Um,

716
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:02.340
one consideration and all of this is that this is a very young field and nobody

717
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:03.820
knows how to do it yet.

718
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:09.270
There is no machine yet that can recognize faces or understand sentences at the

719
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:12.760
level of a two year old human.

720
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.320
There is no machine yet that can do just about anything people can do in an

721
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:18.190
interesting way.

722
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.360
And this is in part because the human brain is wired up and an extraordinarily

723
00:32:22.361 --> 00:32:26.470
more complicated way then any sort of simple neural network.

724
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.570
This is the sort of schematic diagram.

725
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:30.010
You're not responsible for this,

726
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:30.940
um,

727
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.241
of,

728
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:32.074
um,

729
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.810
of parts of the visual cortex.

730
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.890
And the thing to realize about this is it's extraordinarily simplified.

731
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.350
So the brain is a complicated system.

732
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.113
Now,

733
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:49.070
so we've talked a little bit about the basic building blocks of the brain

734
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:49.933
neurons.

735
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.170
Um,

736
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.200
we then talked about how neurons can communicate to one another,

737
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.620
then turned to how neurons are,

738
00:32:56.621 --> 00:32:57.140
um,

739
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.460
are wired up together.

740
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.670
Now let's talk a little bit about different parts of the brain.

741
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.380
Now there's some things you don't actually need your brain to do.

742
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.660
The study of what you don't need your brain to do has often drawn upon this

743
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:12.141
weird,

744
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:12.680
um,

745
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.220
methodology where this was actually done in France a lot where they would

746
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:17.300
decapitate people.

747
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.700
And when after the capitated people,

748
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:24.040
psychologists would rush to the body of the headless person and sort of chess,

749
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.150
Tessa reflexes and stuff like that.

750
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:26.984
It's kind of gruesome,

751
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.190
but we know there are some things you don't need your brain for.

752
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.050
You don't need your brain for newborn sucking.

753
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.893
Um,

754
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.021
limb flex,

755
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:37.790
Asian in withdrawal from pain.

756
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.940
Your limb will pull back even if your head is gone.

757
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.530
Erection of the penis can be done with voter brain vomiting.

758
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:47.060
Also done with voter braid hair.

759
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:47.460
I need,

760
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.950
I need a volunteer.

761
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:50.900
Um,

762
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.501
very simple.

763
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:53.540
This will not involve any of the excellent,

764
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.590
any of the above.

765
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.150
Could you stand up just,

766
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.553
okay,

767
00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.460
this is a new shirts.

768
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:00.200
I want to stay away because no,

769
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:04.610
this is if you hold out your hand and one hand flat.

770
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:05.690
Excellent.

771
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:06.111
Excellent.

772
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:07.700
That's the textbook fifth edition.

773
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.873
Um,

774
00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.390
now perfect.

775
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.820
What you'll notice is thank you very much.

776
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:14.130
Well,

777
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.090
you're notices this hit and his hand went back up.

778
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.790
This is something automatic,

779
00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:24.770
instinctive and there's not require your brain so your brain isn't needed for

780
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:25.604
everything.

781
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.890
What does your brain do?

782
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.311
Well,

783
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:32.960
some things that your brain does involve very low level internal structures.

784
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.010
Um,

785
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:38.420
and these are called subcortical structures because they're below the cortex

786
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.040
there underneath the cortex.

787
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.540
So for instance,

788
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.570
what we have here is a diagram of the brain.

789
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:47.840
The way to read this diagram is it's as if it were my brain,

790
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:49.190
I'm facing this way.

791
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:54.430
My head gets cut in half down here and then you could see the brain.

792
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.890
So this is the front of her hair.

793
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.120
That's the back.

794
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:00.080
Um,

795
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.360
some key parts are illustrated here.

796
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.220
The Medulla for instance,

797
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.930
is I'm responsible for heart rate and respiration.

798
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.890
It's very deep within the brain and if it gets damaged,

799
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:13.310
you could,

800
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:14.510
you're likely to die.

801
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.970
The cerebellum is responsible for body balance and muscular coordination.

802
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.920
And to give you again,

803
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.530
a feeling for the complexity of these systems.

804
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.920
The cerebellum contains approximately 30 billion neurons in the hypothalamus is

805
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:33.710
responsible here for feeding hunger,

806
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.610
thirst,

807
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.380
and to some extent sleep.

808
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.230
And here's the same brain parts in closeup.

809
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.233
<v 1>Now</v>

810
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:48.220
<v 0>all of these parts of the brains are essential and many of them are implicating</v>

811
00:35:48.221 --> 00:35:50.200
the interesting psychological processes.

812
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.500
But where the action is is the Cortex isn't this beautiful.

813
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.063
Um,

814
00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:02.250
the Cortex is the outer layer and the elder layer is all crumpled up.

815
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.420
You ever wonder why your brain looks wrinkled?

816
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:05.830
Um,

817
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.630
that's because it's all crumbled.

818
00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:09.040
Um,

819
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.210
if you took out somebody cortex and flattened it out,

820
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.310
it would be about two feet square,

821
00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.050
sort of like a nice Elica rug.

822
00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.453
Um,

823
00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:23.800
and the Cortex is where all the neat stuff takes place.

824
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.713
Um,

825
00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:26.560
fish don't have any of it,

826
00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.850
so no offense to fish,

827
00:36:27.851 --> 00:36:29.830
but I think that's fish don't have much of a mental life.

828
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.320
Reptiles and birds have a little bit about it.

829
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.060
I've it and primates have a lot and humans have a real lot.

830
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.970
80% of the volume of our brain,

831
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:45.150
a belt is cortex and the cortex can be broken up into different parts or lobes.

832
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.250
There is the,

833
00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:51.641
and again,

834
00:36:51.641 --> 00:36:54.220
this is facing in profile forward.

835
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.840
There is the frontal lobe,

836
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.880
easy to remember it as parked in front

837
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.850
the parietal lobe,

838
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.640
the occipital lobe and the temporal lobe.

839
00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

840
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.450
<v 0>One theme we're going to return to is this is half the brain.</v>

841
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.441
It's,

842
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:15.441
this is in fact the left half of the brain and the other half,

843
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.711
the right half.

844
00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:20.430
Everything's duplicated with some slight and subtle differences.

845
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.820
What's really weird,

846
00:37:23.821 --> 00:37:28.821
one really weird finding about these lobes is that include topological maps.

847
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.920
They include maps of your body.

848
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.390
Um,

849
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:38.250
here's a cartoon which actually illustrates a classic experiment by some

850
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:43.251
physiologists who for some reason had had a dog's brain opened up and started

851
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.600
shocking different parts of the brain.

852
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.530
You could do brain surgery while fully conscious cause the brain itself has no

853
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.860
sense organs to it and it turns out that the dog,

854
00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:54.300
when is that part of his brain,

855
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.610
his leg would kick up and uh,

856
00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.320
took Dr Pennfield.

857
00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.490
I'm at Mcgill University to do the same thing with people.

858
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.100
So they are doing some brain surgery.

859
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.800
We had a little electrical thing just on,

860
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:09.030
I don't know how he got to do this.

861
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.370
These are the zapping it and boom,

862
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:15.900
the person parts of her body would move more than that.

863
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.510
When he zapped other parts of the brain,

864
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.500
people would claim to see colors and exact other parts of the brain.

865
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.680
People would claim to hear sounds and other parts of the brain people would

866
00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:30.090
claim to experience touch.

867
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.320
And through his research and other research it was founded or a mass in the

868
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:38.470
brain of the body.

869
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.190
There is a map in the motor part of the brain,

870
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:43.420
the motor Cortex,

871
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.150
uh,

872
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:49.150
of the sword up on the left and the sensory cortex of the sort that you could

873
00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:50.500
see on the right.

874
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.770
And if you and you could tell what's what,

875
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.940
by opening up the brain and shocking different parts and those parts will

876
00:38:57.941 --> 00:38:59.650
correspond to the parts of the body,

877
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.550
um,

878
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.590
shown in the diagram there.

879
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.700
Now two things to notice about these maps.

880
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:07.990
Um,

881
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.840
the first is their top topographical.

882
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.610
And what this means is that if two parts of the two parts are close together on

883
00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:16.444
the Bondi,

884
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.190
there'll be close together on the brain.

885
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.530
So your um,

886
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.020
your tongue is closer to your jaw,

887
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.260
then it is to your hip in the body.

888
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.000
So too in both the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex.

889
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.130
Also,

890
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.160
you'll notice that the size of the body part represented in the brain does not

891
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.590
correspond to the size of the body part in the real world.

892
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:46.060
Rather what determines the size and the brain is the,

893
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:50.920
the f is the extent to which either they have motor command over it or sensory

894
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.963
control.

895
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.830
So there's a whole lot of sensory organs,

896
00:39:53.831 --> 00:39:54.430
for instance,

897
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.990
focused along your tongue.

898
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.500
And that's why that's so big and an enormous amount on your face.

899
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.581
But your,

900
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:01.030
um,

901
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.441
your,

902
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:05.560
your shoulder is that even Disney mean make it on there because I'll know your

903
00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:07.180
shoulder might be bigger than your tongue.

904
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.500
There's not much going on.

905
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.513
In fact,

906
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.190
if you draw a diagram of a person,

907
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.920
what their body is corresponding to the amount of Somata sensory cortex,

908
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.080
you get something like that.

909
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.000
That's your sensory body.

910
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.440
Um,

911
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:29.103
now,

912
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.210
so you have these maps in your head,

913
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.490
but the thing to realize is,

914
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.380
and these maps are part of your cortex,

915
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.210
but the things to realize is that's an important part of what goes on in your

916
00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:41.044
brain.

917
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.080
But less than one quarter of the cortex contains these maps or projection areas.

918
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.080
The rest is involved in language and reasoning and moral thought and so on.

919
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:55.391
And in fact,

920
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:57.120
the proportion as you go from rat,

921
00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:57.821
cat monkey,

922
00:40:57.821 --> 00:40:58.600
humans,

923
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.100
less and less of it is devoted to projection areas and more and more to other

924
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:03.934
things.

925
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.600
So how do we figure out what the other parts of the brain do?

926
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.231
Well,

927
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:12.490
there's all sorts of methods.

928
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:17.730
Typically these are reason imaging methods like cat scan and pet scan and FM ri.

929
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.983
Um,

930
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.350
which as I said before,

931
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.270
show parts of your brain at work.

932
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:30.660
If you want to know which part of your brain is responsible for language,

933
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:37.170
you could put somebody into a scanner and have them exposed to language or doing

934
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:39.320
linguistic tasks or talk or something,

935
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.930
and then see what parts of their brain are active.

936
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.520
Um,

937
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:50.170
another way to explore what the brain does is to consider what happens to people

938
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.570
when very bad things happen to their brain.

939
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.860
Um,

940
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.290
and these bad things could happen through lesions,

941
00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:58.310
through tumors,

942
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.750
through strokes,

943
00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:00.200
uh,

944
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.280
through injury.

945
00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:01.700
Um,

946
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.391
for the most part,

947
00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:04.730
neuro psychologists don't like helmet laws.

948
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.750
Um,

949
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.980
neuropsychologists love when motorcyclists drive about helmets because through

950
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.330
their horrible accidents,

951
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.850
we gained great insights into how the brain works.

952
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:19.660
And the logic is if you find somebody crudely behind somebody with damaged to

953
00:42:19.671 --> 00:42:21.740
this part of the brain right here,

954
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.710
and that person can recognize faces,

955
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:25.544
for instance,

956
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:29.780
there some reason to believe that this part of the brain is related to face

957
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:30.643
recognition.

958
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.150
Um,

959
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.890
and so through the study of brain damage and the study,

960
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:40.910
if we can gain some understanding of what different parts of the brain do and

961
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:42.650
some people study brain damages,

962
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.001
brain damage,

963
00:42:44.001 --> 00:42:48.800
that implicates motor control such as a praxia.

964
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.880
And what's interesting about a Praxia is it's not paralysis.

965
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:55.190
Somebody with a Praxia can move,

966
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.110
do simple movements just fine,

967
00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.240
but they can't coordinate their movements.

968
00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:02.720
They can't do something like wave goodbye or light a cigarette.

969
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:08.290
There's Agnosia and Magnolia is a disorder which isn't blindness because the

970
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:10.340
person who could still see perfectly well,

971
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.870
their eyes are intact.

972
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.980
But rather what happens in Agnosia is they lose the ability to recognize certain

973
00:43:19.251 --> 00:43:19.970
things.

974
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.970
Sometimes this is described as psychic blindness and so they may get visual

975
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:25.761
Agnosia.

976
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:27.800
And lose the ability to recognize objects.

977
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:33.010
They may get prosopagnosia and lose the ability to recognize faces.

978
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.340
There are,

979
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.530
there are disorders of sensory neglect.

980
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:37.460
Um,

981
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.960
some famous disorders,

982
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.041
again,

983
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:42.440
it's not paralysis is not blindness,

984
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.560
but due to certain parts of your damaged parts of your brain,

985
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.461
you might lose.

986
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:47.180
For instance,

987
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.180
the idea that there's a left side of your body or left side of the world.

988
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.710
And these cases are so interesting.

989
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.670
I want to devote some chunk to a class in the next few weeks to discussing them.

990
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:02.480
There are disorders of language like Aphasia.

991
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:03.650
Um,

992
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:08.150
the classic case was discovered by Paul Broca in 1861.

993
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.980
A patient who had damaged to part of his brain and can only say one word,

994
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:13.993
Tan

995
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.220
and a pretty day 10,

996
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.551
10,

997
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:17.060
10,

998
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.270
10 and everything else was gone.

999
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:21.943
Um,

1000
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.970
there's other disorders of language such as receptive aphasia where the person

1001
00:44:26.971 --> 00:44:31.971
who could speak very fluently but the words don't make any sense and they can't

1002
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:33.330
understand anybody else.

1003
00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:38.970
Other disorders that we'll discuss later on include acquired psychopathy were

1004
00:44:38.971 --> 00:44:40.380
damaged to parts of your brain,

1005
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:42.540
particularly related to the frontal lobes.

1006
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.711
Rob,

1007
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:45.720
you have the ability to tell right from wrong.

1008
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.440
The final I want to end,

1009
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.090
we're talking about neurons,

1010
00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:51.521
connections,

1011
00:44:51.521 --> 00:44:51.630
me,

1012
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:52.051
neurons,

1013
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:53.190
how neurons are wired up,

1014
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.420
the parts of the brain,

1015
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:58.770
what the different parts do I want to end by talking about the two halves of the

1016
00:44:58.771 --> 00:44:59.604
brain

1017
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.010
and ask the question,

1018
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.960
how many minds do you have?

1019
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.800
Now,

1020
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.120
if you look at the brain,

1021
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.220
if you took the brain out and held it up,

1022
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.990
it would look pretty symmetrical,

1023
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.330
but it actually is not.

1024
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:16.680
There were actual differences between the right hemisphere and the left

1025
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:17.514
hemisphere.

1026
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.930
How many people here are right handed?

1027
00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:25.510
How many people here are left handed?

1028
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.843
How many people here?

1029
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:32.000
I've heard a complicated ambidextrous.

1030
00:45:32.001 --> 00:45:33.330
Don't know bitter.

1031
00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:34.450
The right middle left

1032
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:35.763
<v 1>people,</v>

1033
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:36.560
okay.

1034
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.600
<v 0>Those of you who are right handed,</v>

1035
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.553
um,

1036
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.570
which comprises about nine out of 10 people have language in your left

1037
00:45:44.571 --> 00:45:45.404
hemisphere.

1038
00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:47.261
And in fact,

1039
00:45:47.261 --> 00:45:50.410
we're going to be talking about right handed people for the most part,

1040
00:45:50.411 --> 00:45:52.510
making generalizations in what I'll talk about.

1041
00:45:52.511 --> 00:45:56.080
Now those of you who are left handed are more complicated.

1042
00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:56.891
Um,

1043
00:45:56.891 --> 00:45:58.990
some of you have language in your right hemisphere.

1044
00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.610
Summon your left hemisphere.

1045
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.830
Some God knows where it's complicated.

1046
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.000
Um,

1047
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.660
now the idea is that some things are duplicated.

1048
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.810
So if you were to lose half of your brain,

1049
00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:12.730
the other half can actually do a lot.

1050
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:17.320
But some things are more prevalent and more powerful in one part of the brain

1051
00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.130
than the other.

1052
00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.040
And I want to show you a brief film clip from scientific American that

1053
00:46:21.041 --> 00:46:23.980
illustrates the difference is between the hemispheres.

1054
00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.300
But before doing that,

1055
00:46:25.301 --> 00:46:27.510
I want to provide some introductory facts.

1056
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:28.603
Um,

1057
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.610
some functions or lateralized.

1058
00:46:30.611 --> 00:46:32.170
So typically language in the left,

1059
00:46:32.171 --> 00:46:32.650
again,

1060
00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:34.810
this is a right handed centric thing,

1061
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.070
but if you're right handed language and left math and music on there,

1062
00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:38.904
right,

1063
00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.650
there is a crossover.

1064
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:45.370
And this is important when we think about the studies that will follow.

1065
00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:49.990
But the crossover is that everything you see in the left visual field goes to

1066
00:46:49.991 --> 00:46:51.010
the right side of your brain.

1067
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.370
Everything in the right visual field goes to the left side of the brain.

1068
00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.040
And similarly there's a crossover,

1069
00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:57.850
an action.

1070
00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.190
So your right hemisphere controls the left side of the body.

1071
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.130
Your left hemisphere controls the right side of her body.

1072
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.530
Now finally,

1073
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.920
the two halves are connected.

1074
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.570
They're connected by this huge web called the Corpus callosum.

1075
00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:16.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1076
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:21.000
<v 0>And I'm just going to skip this because the movie illustration,</v>

1077
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.600
we'll go through some of this.

1078
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.790
This illustrates certain themes that are discussed in,

1079
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:34.630
in the grade book concerning lateralization of different parts of different

1080
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:36.940
mental capacities,

1081
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:38.810
some of the left hemisphere seminar,

1082
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:39.663
right hemisphere.

1083
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.730
But it also serves as a useful method,

1084
00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.593
logical,

1085
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:43.810
um,

1086
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:44.643
development,

1087
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:49.740
which is a nice illustration as to how looking at people who are incredibly

1088
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:52.204
unusual,

1089
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.970
such as this man who had his brain by sector.

1090
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.390
So there's left hemisphere and right hemisphere,

1091
00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:59.770
don't communicate one another.

1092
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.480
How looking at such people,

1093
00:48:01.481 --> 00:48:05.550
such extreme cases can provide us with some understanding of,

1094
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.390
of how we normally do things.

1095
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.890
And this again is a theme we'll return to throughout the course.

1096
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:12.940
Um,

1097
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.110
this is generally the general introduction of the brain that I want it to

1098
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:17.944
provide.

1099
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:22.150
Giving the framework for what I'll be talking about later on throughout the

1100
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:26.740
course so that I might later on make reference to neurons or neuro transmitters

1101
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:28.900
or the cortex or the left hemisphere.

1102
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.200
And you'll sort of have the background to understand what I'm talking about.

1103
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.680
But I want to end this first real class with,

1104
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:38.660
uh,

1105
00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.880
a bit of humility

1106
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.960
as to what psychologists know and don't know.

1107
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.420
So the idea behind a lot of psychology,

1108
00:48:46.421 --> 00:48:50.120
particularly a lot of neuroscience and cognitive psychology is the treat the

1109
00:48:50.121 --> 00:48:54.040
mind is an information processor as an elaborate computer.

1110
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.713
Um,

1111
00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:00.810
and so we study different problems like recognizing faces or language or motor

1112
00:49:01.061 --> 00:49:02.800
control or logic.

1113
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.640
The strategy then often is to figure out how,

1114
00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:10.450
what sort of program can solve these problems.

1115
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.280
And then we go on to ask,

1116
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:16.240
how could this program be instantiated in a physical brain?

1117
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.000
So we would have saw,

1118
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.700
we study people much as we'd study a computer from an alien planet or something.

1119
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:27.000
And I think people I,

1120
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.100
this strategy is one I'm very enthusiastic about,

1121
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:36.070
but there's still remains what's sometimes called the hard problem of

1122
00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:36.970
consciousness.

1123
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.760
And this involves subjective experience.

1124
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.690
What's it like?

1125
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.760
So my computer can play chess,

1126
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.660
my computer can recognize numbers,

1127
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:53.920
it can do math and maybe it does it kind of the same way that I do it,

1128
00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:59.170
but my computer doesn't have feelings in the same sense.

1129
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:00.303
Um,

1130
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:00.671
this is,

1131
00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:04.150
these are two classic illustrations and this is from a very old star trek

1132
00:50:04.151 --> 00:50:04.870
episode.

1133
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:09.010
It illustrates angst I think is starships about to go into the sun or something.

1134
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.133
Um,

1135
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.250
and that's my older kid Max who's happy.

1136
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:13.443
Um,

1137
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.320
and so the question is how does a thing like that give rise to consciousness and

1138
00:50:20.261 --> 00:50:21.400
subjective experience?

1139
00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.620
And this is a deep puzzle and although some psychologists and philosophers think

1140
00:50:26.621 --> 00:50:27.260
they've,

1141
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.480
that most of us are a lot more skeptical,

1142
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:34.690
most of us think we have so far to go before we can answer questions like

1143
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:35.900
Huxley's question.

1144
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:36.351
Um,

1145
00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:39.980
Huxley points out how it is that anything so remarkable is the state of

1146
00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:43.730
consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue.

1147
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:48.110
Is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Daejeon of the genie.

1148
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.640
When Aladdin rubs his lap.

1149
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:53.330
It seems like magic that a fleshy lump of grey,

1150
00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:56.600
disgusting me can give rise to these feelings.

1151
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:02.260
The second bit of humility while in the class on is I am presenting here and

1152
00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:04.190
I'll be presenting throughout this semester.

1153
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.310
What are you can call a mechanistic conception of mental life.

1154
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.820
I'm not going to be talking about how beautiful it is and how wonderful it is

1155
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:11.780
and how mysterious it is.

1156
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.850
Rather when are we trying to explain it?

1157
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:18.950
We're going to be trying to explain fundamental aspects of ourselves including

1158
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.900
questions like how do we make decisions?

1159
00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.550
Why do we love our children?

1160
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.730
What happens when we fall in love and so on.

1161
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:31.630
Now you might find this sort of project in the end to be repellent.

1162
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.380
You might worry about how this,

1163
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:36.671
well,

1164
00:51:36.671 --> 00:51:38.750
this meshes with humanist values.

1165
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:39.763
For instance,

1166
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.100
when we deal with one another and illegal in a moral setting,

1167
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.010
we think in terms of freewill and responsibility,

1168
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.600
if we're driving,

1169
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:48.530
you cut me off.

1170
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:50.060
You chose to do that.

1171
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:50.660
You know,

1172
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.310
it reflects badly on you.

1173
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.830
If you save a life at risk to your own,

1174
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:56.480
your your you deserve praise.

1175
00:51:56.481 --> 00:51:57.740
You did something wonderful.

1176
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:03.810
It might be hard to match this with a conception in which all actions are a

1177
00:52:03.811 --> 00:52:06.560
result of neurochemical physical processes.

1178
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.150
It might also be hard to mesh notions such as the report it intrinsic value of

1179
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:16.151
people and finally it might be hard to match the mechanistic notion of the mind

1180
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.900
with the idea that people have spiritual value faced with this tension.

1181
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:27.830
There are three possibilities you might choose to reject a scientific conception

1182
00:52:27.831 --> 00:52:28.664
of the mind.

1183
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:29.503
Many people do.

1184
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.570
You may choose to embrace dualism,

1185
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:37.130
reject the idea that the brain is responsible for mental life and reject the

1186
00:52:37.131 --> 00:52:38.930
promise of a scientific psychology.

1187
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.490
Alternatively,

1188
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.960
you might choose to embrace the scientific worldview and reject all these

1189
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:48.710
humanist values and there are some philosophers and psychologists who do just

1190
00:52:48.711 --> 00:52:53.500
that who claimed that freewill and responsibility and spiritual value and

1191
00:52:53.501 --> 00:52:55.640
intrinsic value are all illusions.

1192
00:52:55.670 --> 00:53:00.670
They're pre pre-scientific notions that get washed away in modern science or you

1193
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:03.190
could try to reconcile them.

1194
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.270
You could try to figure it out.

1195
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:10.271
How to Mesh your scientific view of the mind with these humanist values you

1196
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:12.290
might want to preserve,

1197
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.560
and this is an issue which is going to return to throughout the course.

1198
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:16.580
Okay.

1199
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.270
I'll see you on Wednesday.
