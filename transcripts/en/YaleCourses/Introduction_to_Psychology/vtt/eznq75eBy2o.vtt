00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.950
Most of what we do these days,

2
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:18.180
our methods or theories or ideas are shaped to some extent by Piaget's

3
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:18.930
influence.

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.080
And so what I want to do is begin this class is going to talk about cognitive

5
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.510
development by talking about his ideas.

6
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.943
Um,

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.420
his idea was the children are active thinkers.

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.550
They're trying to figure out the world.

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.100
He often described him as little scientists,

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.773
um,

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.530
and incidentally to know where he's coming from on this,

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.680
he had a very dramatic and ambitious goal.

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.900
He didn't start off because he was interested in children.

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.830
He started off cause he's interested in emergence of knowledge in general.

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.420
Um,

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.810
it was a discipline he described as genetic epistemology,

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.000
the origins of knowledge,

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.720
but he studied development of the individual child because he was convinced that

19
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.350
this development will tell them,

20
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.240
but the development of knowledge more generally,

21
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.090
there's a very snooty phrase that,

22
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.380
I don't know if you've ever heard it before.

23
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.340
It's a great phrase.

24
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.350
It's ontogeny,

25
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.280
recapitulates,

26
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.114
phylogeny.

27
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.040
And the idea of this,

28
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:25.041
what that means is that development of an individual mimics our repeats,

29
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.360
development of the species.

30
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.643
Now,

31
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.150
it's entirely not true,

32
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.590
but it's a beautiful phrase.

33
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.050
And Piaget was committed to this.

34
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:35.070
He was very interesting.

35
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:35.400
Look,

36
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
we'll figure how to kid develops and now I will tell us about the development of

37
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.440
knowledge more generally.

38
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.060
So the [inaudible] view the child as science,

39
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.880
as a scientist who develop these understanding,

40
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:48.780
these schemas,

41
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.120
these little miniature theories of the world,

42
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.810
and they did this through two sorts of mechanisms,

43
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.480
assimilation and accommodation.

44
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.440
So assimilation would be the act of expanding the range of things that you

45
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:04.614
respond to.

46
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.480
Piaget's example would be a baby is used to sucking on a breast,

47
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
might come to suck on a bottle or on a rattle.

48
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.120
That's changing the scope of things that you respond to.

49
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.160
Accommodation is changing how you do it.

50
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:26.910
A baby will form his mouth differently depending on what he's sucking on.

51
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.150
And so these processes where you take in,

52
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.120
I've given this in a very physical way,

53
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.100
but in a more psychological says,

54
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:36.420
you have a way of looking at the world.

55
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.150
You could expand it to encompass new things,

56
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.230
assimilation,

57
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.490
when you could also change your system of knowledge itself.

58
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.790
Accommodation and Piaget argue that these two mechanisms of learning drove the

59
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:52.560
child through different stages.

60
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.390
Um,

61
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.480
and he had a stage theory which was quite different from the Floridian stage

62
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:59.440
theory that we've been introduced to.

63
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.120
So it was methods,

64
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.930
um,

65
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.000
were to ask question,

66
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.040
told them to solve problems and I asked him questions and his discoveries that

67
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.770
they did them in different ways at different ages led to the emergence of the

68
00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:13.604
stage theory.

69
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.760
So for Piaggi,

70
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.620
the first stage

71
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.900
is the sensory motor stage or to sensory motor period.

72
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.663
Um,

73
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.160
for here the child is purely a physical creature.

74
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.170
The child has no understanding in any real way of the external world.

75
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.630
There's no understanding of the past,

76
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.160
no understanding of the future,

77
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.450
no stability,

78
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.830
no differentiation.

79
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.233
Uh,

80
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.400
the child just touches and cs but doesn't yet reason.

81
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.910
And it's through this stage that the child gradually comes to acquire object

82
00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:57.744
permanence.

83
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.650
Object permanence is the understanding that things exist when you no longer see

84
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.484
them.

85
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.440
So those of you in front,

86
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:09.310
you're looking at me,

87
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.263
then I go

88
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.191
and occurred to me.

89
00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:15.490
It'd be a great magic trick by then appeared and back.

90
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.810
But no,

91
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:17.620
I'm just here.

92
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.850
That's object permanence.

93
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.343
If,

94
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.460
if I win under here and then the people said where the hell they go,

95
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.120
classes over that would show a lack of object permanence.

96
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.260
So adults have object permanence.

97
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:35.650
P and g is very interesting claim is that kids don't,

98
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.970
um,

99
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.500
before six month olds,

100
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.290
Piaget observed you take an object,

101
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:43.180
the kid likes like a rattle,

102
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.493
you hide it,

103
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.970
you put it behind something.

104
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.103
It's like it's gone.

105
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.010
And he claimed a child where he thinks it's just gone.

106
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.880
Things don't continue to exist when I'm not looking at them anymore.

107
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.063
Um,

108
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.840
and so he noticed that there were surprised by Peekaboo NPH.

109
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.850
His claim was one reason why there's a prize at peekaboo as you go,

110
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.051
you know,

111
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:04.570
we're going to kick,

112
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.840
you're looking at a kid because my anger,

113
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.580
oh,

114
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.210
peekaboo.

115
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.691
And he closed it.

116
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:09.610
You cover your face and the kid says he's gone.

117
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.640
Peekaboo.

118
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.340
Oh,

119
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.173
there he is.

120
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.733
He's gone.

121
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.391
And he really,

122
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:16.690
you know,

123
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.523
that's the claim.

124
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.070
Piaget also discovered an older children fail at a task is known as the a not B

125
00:05:24.771 --> 00:05:25.604
task.

126
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.240
And,

127
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.411
uh,

128
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:31.411
Peter Gray in a psychology textbook refers to it as the changing hiding places

129
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:32.314
problem,

130
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.820
which is probably a better name for it.

131
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.620
And here's the idea.

132
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.400
You take a nine month old and for Piaggi at nine month old is just starting to

133
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:43.030
make sense of objects and an end or permanence.

134
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.320
You take an object and you put it here in a,

135
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.470
in a cop where the kid can't see if it's in the cup.

136
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.101
So the kid,

137
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.540
if you're at a kid will reach for it.

138
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.913
You do it again,

139
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.113
reach for it.

140
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.020
You do it again,

141
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.441
reach for it.

142
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.274
That's point.

143
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.760
Then you take your,

144
00:05:58.761 --> 00:05:59.990
move it over here.

145
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.110
The IJ observed kids would still reach for this.

146
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.900
It's like they're not smart enough to figure it out.

147
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.890
It's not there anymore.

148
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.120
Even if they see it move.

149
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.990
And this was more evidence that they just did,

150
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:13.580
don't understand objects.

151
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.051
And this,

152
00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:14.230
the,

153
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.230
this thing takes a lot of time and learning to develop the next stage is the pre

154
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.140
operational stage.

155
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.490
Um,

156
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.720
the pre operational stage.

157
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:27.170
The child starts off grasping the world only in a physical way,

158
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.310
in a sensory motor way.

159
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.860
But when he gets to the pre-operational period,

160
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.380
the capacity to represent the world,

161
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.950
to have the world inside your head comes into being,

162
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.710
but it's limited and it's limited in a couple of striking ways.

163
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.210
One way in which is limited is that true winner egocentric.

164
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.990
Now egocentrism has a,

165
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.230
uh,

166
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.250
a meaning and common English,

167
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:53.480
which means to be selfish.

168
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.670
Piaget meant in a more technical way.

169
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.120
He claimed a children litter at this age literally can't understand that others

170
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.110
can see the world differently from them.

171
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.550
So one of his demonstrations was the three mountains task.

172
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.500
You have three mountains over there.

173
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.030
You put a child on one side of the mountains and you ask them to draw it.

174
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.980
And I'm like a four or five year old can do it easily,

175
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.930
but then you ask him to draw it as it would appear from the other side.

176
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.320
And Cherlynn find is extraordinarily difficult.

177
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.950
They find it very difficult to grasp the world as another person might see it.

178
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.903
Um,

179
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.090
another significant finding Piaget had about this phase of development concerns,

180
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.280
what's called conservation.

181
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.060
And the notion of conservation is that there's ways to transform things such

182
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:51.821
that some aspects of the change but others remained the same.

183
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.320
So for instance,

184
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.053
um,

185
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.250
if you take a glass of water and you pour it into another glass that's shallow

186
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.330
or tall,

187
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.220
it won't change the amount of water you have.

188
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.980
If you take a bunch of pennies and you spread them out,

189
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.120
you don't get more pennies.

190
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.690
But kids according to Piaget don't know that.

191
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.510
And this is one of the real cool demonstrations.

192
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:17.570
Any of you have access to a four or five year old,

193
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.530
um,

194
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.460
a sibling or something.

195
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.230
Do not take one without permission.

196
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.410
But if you have access to a four or five or you couldn't do this yourself,

197
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.490
this is what it looks like.

198
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.031
I,

199
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:27.380
the first one has no sound.

200
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:28.400
A second one is going to be sound.

201
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:29.390
It's going to come on at the end,

202
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.480
but there's two rows of checker.

203
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.410
She asked the kid

204
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.610
which one has more?

205
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.940
<v 1>Okay,</v>

206
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.870
<v 0>kid says they're the same.</v>

207
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.301
Then she doesn't.

208
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:40.134
Now she has him.

209
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.120
Which one has more

210
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.043
that of that?

211
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.190
So that's really stupid and,

212
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.220
and it's,

213
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.770
it's amazing.

214
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.790
It's an amazing finding.

215
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.510
Kids will do this and it's a robust finding.

216
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.710
Here's another example.

217
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.650
So they're the same.

218
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.800
So it's a cool finding of that stage suggesting a limitation in how you deal and

219
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.590
make sense of the world.

220
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.420
The next phase,

221
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.520
concrete operations from seven to 12,

222
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.220
you can solve the conservation problem,

223
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.620
but still you're limited to the extent you're capable of abstract reasoning.

224
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.580
So the mathematical notions of infinity or logical notions like logical

225
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:34.020
entailment are beyond a child of this age.

226
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.690
The child is able to do a lot,

227
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.690
but still is to some extent stuck in the concrete world.

228
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.110
And then finally at around age 12,

229
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.670
um,

230
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.960
you could get abstracts and scientific reasoning and this is the Piaggi Eddie

231
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:51.210
and theory in very brief form.

232
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.170
Now paij fared a lot better than did Freud or Skinner,

233
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.090
um,

234
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.140
for several reasons.

235
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.180
One reason is these are interesting and falsifiable claims about child

236
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:06.810
development.

237
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.810
So claims that about failure of conservation in children at different ages

238
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:15.000
because we easily tested and systematically tested.

239
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.130
And in fact there was a lot of support for them.

240
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.440
Piaggi had a rich theoretical framework pulling together all sorts of

241
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:24.810
observations and different ways wrote many,

242
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.900
many books and articles and articulated as theory very richly.

243
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.161
And most of all,

244
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.340
I think he had some really striking findings before Piaget.

245
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:35.460
Nobody noticed these conservation findings before.

246
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:39.720
Piaggi nobody noticed that babies had this problem tracking and understanding

247
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:42.330
objects at the same time.

248
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:43.164
However,

249
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.840
there are limitations in Piaget's theory.

250
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.240
Some of these limitations are theoretical.

251
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.053
Um,

252
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.690
it's an interesting question as to whether he really explains how a child goes

253
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:59.160
from a concrete thinker to an abstract thinker or how would he goes from not

254
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:01.950
having object permanence to understanding object permanence.

255
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.040
There's methodological limitations.

256
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.470
Piaget was really big into question and answer,

257
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.060
but one problem with this is that children aren't very good with language and

258
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:17.061
this might lead you to underestimate how much they know and this is particularly

259
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:17.700
a problem.

260
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.990
The younger you get.

261
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.123
Um,

262
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.280
methodology is going to loom heavy in the discussion of any science and that

263
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.760
includes psychology.

264
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.030
Often 90% of the game is discovering a clever method through which to test your

265
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:34.730
hypotheses.

266
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:35.820
Well,

267
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.980
we're going to talk a little bit about that regarding babies.

268
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.530
I'll give you another example from a very different domain.

269
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.580
There was a set of scientist interested in studying tickling.

270
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.230
So when you tickle somebody under what circumstances will a laugh,

271
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.760
where do you have to take all of them,

272
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.170
can even tickle yourself.

273
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.560
Does it have to be a surprise?

274
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.573
And so on.

275
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.310
It turns out very difficult to study this in a lab.

276
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.440
You're not going to have your experimental credit.

277
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:00.274
You come into lab say,

278
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:00.671
okay,

279
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.590
our undergraduate student,

280
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.350
uh,

281
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.183
and,

282
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.570
and in fact,

283
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.351
an example of,

284
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:09.280
of a methodological attempt was done by Henry met at University of Pennsylvania

285
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.720
who builds a tickle Michigan,

286
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.790
which was this box with these two giant hands that win.

287
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.660
And um,

288
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.570
and this was a failure because people can not go near the tickle machine

289
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:20.140
development,

290
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.250
convulsing and laughter.

291
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.000
But we will discuss when we have a lecture on laughter,

292
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.720
um,

293
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.160
a bit of the tickle sciences

294
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.570
and finally there's factual.

295
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.670
What are infants and children really know.

296
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.470
It's possible that due to the methodological limitations of Piaggi,

297
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.650
he systematically underestimated what children and babies now.

298
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.441
And in fact,

299
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:47.830
I'll present some evidence suggesting that this is in fact that this is the

300
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:48.664
case.

301
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.653
Um,

302
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.730
so I want to introduce you to the modern science of infant cognition.

303
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.370
Inven cognition has been something studied for a very long time and there is a

304
00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:05.371
certain view that has had behind it a tremendous philosophical and psychological

305
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:06.724
consensus.

306
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.970
And it's summarized in this onion headline here.

307
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.560
And the idea is that that babies are stupid.

308
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.670
Um,

309
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.220
that'd babies really don't know much about the world.

310
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.773
Now,

311
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.070
the work that this onion headline is satirizing is the reason studies,

312
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:26.950
which I'm going to talk about suggested on the contrary,

313
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.230
babies might be smarter than you think.

314
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.813
And,

315
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.000
and to discover the intelligence of babies,

316
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.560
we have to ourselves be pretty smart in developing different techniques to study

317
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:39.490
what a baby knows.

318
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:40.750
You can't ask you questions,

319
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:42.130
babies can't talk.

320
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.210
Um,

321
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.500
you could look at what it does,

322
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:47.470
but babies are not very coordinated or skilled.

323
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.270
So you need to use clever methods.

324
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.840
One Glover method is to look at their brainwaves.

325
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.863
This,

326
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.150
this trial on the right die during testing.

327
00:13:58.151 --> 00:13:58.781
It was a tragic,

328
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:00.550
a crushed by the way to the electrodes.

329
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.300
Um,

330
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.133
he's happy though.

331
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.010
Um,

332
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.350
you can study their brainwaves.

333
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.060
One of the few things babies can do is they can suck on a pacifier and you might

334
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:10.241
think,

335
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:10.870
well,

336
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.250
how can you learn anything from that?

337
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:12.491
Well,

338
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:13.270
for instance,

339
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.630
you could build machines that when babies suck on a pacifier,

340
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.280
they hear music or they hear language and then you could look at how much they

341
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:24.310
suck on a pacifier to determine what they like.

342
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.350
But undeniably we know most of our,

343
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.120
we got most of our knowledge about babies from studies of they're looking times.

344
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.523
Um,

345
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.360
that's one thing babies can do.

346
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.373
They can look,

347
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:39.700
and I'm,

348
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.241
I have up here,

349
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:44.020
this is a picture of Elizabeth Spelke [inaudible] who's a developmental

350
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:48.220
psychologist who's developed the most research on looking at babies looking

351
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.020
times and what you can learn from them.

352
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.030
And I have here two ways you could learn from looking.

353
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.130
One is preference.

354
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.541
So for instance,

355
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:58.760
suppose you want to know for whatever reason,

356
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.340
do babies liked the looks of dogs or cats?

357
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.020
Well,

358
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.310
you could put a baby down,

359
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.620
have a picture of a dog here,

360
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.010
a picture of a cat here and see which one the baby looks at.

361
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.700
Babies can move their eyes and that could tell you something.

362
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.510
Do babies distinguished pretty faces from ugly faces?

363
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.630
Well put a pretty face here and ugly phase here.

364
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.670
See if the baby prefers to look at the pretty one.

365
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.253
Uh,

366
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.270
you can also do habituation and surprise and much of the studies I'm going to

367
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:32.270
talk about here involve habituation and surprise.

368
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.060
Habituation is a fancy word for boredom.

369
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.560
What you do is you show a baby something over and over again.

370
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.280
Now remember from behaviorism the baby will learn.

371
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.930
This isn't very interesting.

372
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.750
Then you show the baby something different.

373
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.810
If the baby really sees it as different,

374
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.670
the baby will look longer and you could use that as a measure of what babies

375
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:56.480
find different.

376
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.200
For instance,

377
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.080
suppose you want to know if a baby can tell green from red.

378
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:00.981
Well,

379
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:02.480
you could show the baby a green patch,

380
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:04.310
a green patch of green patch of green patch,

381
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.350
maybe you'll get bored then a red patch.

382
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.780
If they all look the same to the baby,

383
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.290
the baby will just continue to tune out.

384
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.990
But if the red looks different to baby will perk up.

385
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.280
And this is in fact one way they studied color vision in babies.

386
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.680
Surprise as related to this.

387
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.820
You could show babies something that shouldn't happen if babies are like,

388
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.050
if babies also think it shouldn't happen,

389
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.220
they might look longer.

390
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.650
And essentially what happens is scientists do magic tricks to explore this very

391
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.820
thing.

392
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.190
And to start with some real examples,

393
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.110
a lot of this infant research has gone back to the Phd in question of object

394
00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:45.860
permanence,

395
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.640
asking,

396
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.630
is it really true?

397
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:51.890
Babies don't know that objects remain that objects,

398
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.190
uh,

399
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.810
remain even when they're out of sight.

400
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.220
So one very simple study by,

401
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:56.720
uh,

402
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.720
by spelled [inaudible] had babies shown a block with a bar going back and forth.

403
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.590
Like that sort of bar just goes back and forth.

404
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.640
Now there's something you do that's so obvious,

405
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:12.050
you probably don't even know you're doing it.

406
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:14.830
When you see a display like that where you assume is there,

407
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:17.270
there's a bar there and what that means,

408
00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:19.640
there's something in the middle that you've never seen before.

409
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.870
But of course if you were a simple perceptual creature,

410
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.100
you would just see that there'd be a bar on top and a bar in Nevato.

411
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.640
You wouldn't expect anything in the middle of that.

412
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:30.770
He never saw anything in the middle.

413
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.970
So what you do then is you show babies this and then you show them either B or

414
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.804
c.

415
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.060
And if we do this with adults,

416
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.520
you expect BC is almost a joke.

417
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.841
And in fact,

418
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:43.340
babies respond the same way.

419
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.500
Babies expect her to be an entire complete bar and our surprise and look longer

420
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.590
at the broken bar.

421
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.450
Um,

422
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.410
other studies,

423
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:53.610
some of them,

424
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.443
um,

425
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.440
well here's another study by Renee by arch hall looking at the same thing in a

426
00:17:58.441 --> 00:17:59.280
different way.

427
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.750
You show the baby,

428
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.830
say a six month old,

429
00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.520
a stage with a block on it,

430
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.790
then a screen rises and obscures the block.

431
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.360
Now if the baby's expect the blocked is still be there,

432
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.500
they should think the block should,

433
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.000
should stop the screen.

434
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.650
On the other hand,

435
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.521
if out of sight,

436
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:21.300
out of mind,

437
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.100
they should expect the screen to keep going.

438
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.650
So what you do is you set up a couple of displays.

439
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.020
One word a block keeps is stopped.

440
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.160
The other one where you take,

441
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.190
you take this away for trap door and it keeps going.

442
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.571
And as you see,

443
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.210
the baby screams when this happens,

444
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.680
that doesn't really happen,

445
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.873
but they do.

446
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.050
But they do look longer.

447
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.010
Um,

448
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.710
one final example of an object permanence study,

449
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.610
um,

450
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:49.380
if some of this work's been done at Yale and Karen winds lab where they look at

451
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:51.630
babies understanding of addition and subtraction.

452
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.090
And a lot of it is done with real objects,

453
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.800
but there's also animated versions.

454
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.810
So here is an animated example.

455
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.363
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

456
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.093
Yeah.

457
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.920
<v 0>Babies.</v>

458
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.090
Babies are surprised.

459
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.440
They expect two minus one equals equal one and went to minus one equals two or

460
00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:30.980
three or zero.

461
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.990
They look lamara indicating surprise.

462
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:38.260
And even six month olds are sensitive to these rudimentary facts of arithmetic

463
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.580
telling us something about their mathematical knowledge,

464
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.150
but also telling us something about that they expect things to remain when

465
00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:44.984
they're out of sight.

466
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.293
Now,

467
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.100
this research suggests that infants understanding of the physical world is there

468
00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:53.240
from the very start,

469
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.830
but at the same time,

470
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.450
not entirely.

471
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.570
We know there's certain things babies don't know.

472
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.190
Here's an example.

473
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.220
Suppose you show babies this,

474
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.070
you have a block here and they have something above there floating in midair.

475
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.880
Babies find this surprising,

476
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.870
even six month olds find a surprising it violates gravity,

477
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.860
but six month olds aren't smart enough to know that a block just stuck over here

478
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.970
is also surprising.

479
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.180
12 month olds will think that it should fall.

480
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.350
Six month olds don't,

481
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.430
and even 12 month olds don't find anything weird about this.

482
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:36.110
While adults are sophisticated enough to understand that that should that an

483
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:38.750
unstable configuration and should fall over.

484
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.750
So although some things are built in,

485
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.060
some things develop,

486
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.830
and this raises the question of how do we explain development?

487
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.050
How do we explain when babies come to know things that he didn't originally

488
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:53.884
know?

489
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.090
Well,

490
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.670
one answer is a neuro maturation,

491
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.850
growth,

492
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.950
growth of the brain.

493
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.970
Um,

494
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:01.830
most add up,

495
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.340
most of the neurons you've had,

496
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:05.950
you have now in your head right now,

497
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.470
you had when you were in your mother's uterus,

498
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.530
what happens in development isn't for the most part,

499
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:12.820
the growth of new neurons.

500
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.900
It's for the most part,

501
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:16.030
pruning getting rid of neurons.

502
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.100
So the neural structures change radically as babies kind of get rid of excess

503
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:22.900
neurons through development.

504
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.820
At the same time though,

505
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:25.360
um,

506
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.950
connections between neurons grow like crazy and the,

507
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.000
and there's this process of synaptic growth where there's the connections across

508
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:34.960
different synapses,

509
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.970
peaks at about two years.

510
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.590
Finally,

511
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.730
remember myelination where you sort of get this fatty sheath over your neuron to

512
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:43.720
make it more effective.

513
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.360
That also happens through development and,

514
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.530
and in fact,

515
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:52.330
it goes through development and even teenagers are not fully myelinated in

516
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:53.164
particular.

517
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.780
They're not fully myelinated in their frontal lobes.

518
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.521
Recall,

519
00:21:56.521 --> 00:22:00.520
at frontal lobes are involved in things like restraint and willpower.

520
00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.420
Um,

521
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.670
and so it could be the problem is the baby's brain doesn't develop yet.

522
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.300
Another possibility is there's problems with inhibition.

523
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.720
This is related again to the frontal lobes and this comes up with a not be

524
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:17.554
error.

525
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.590
So remember the baby reaches,

526
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:21.401
reaches,

527
00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:22.780
reaches his move,

528
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.321
reach,

529
00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:24.250
follow up,

530
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.380
keeps reaching the same place.

531
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.040
And it could be that babies don't know anything about objects,

532
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.800
but another possibility is once you do something,

533
00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:34.210
it's kind of hard to stop.

534
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.130
It takes a bit of control to stop.

535
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.690
And there's all sorts of independent evidence that babies lack this control a

536
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:44.110
part of their brain that could control certain behaviors,

537
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.333
um,

538
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.810
is just not active yet.

539
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:47.920
Um,

540
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.920
there's a very nice illustration of inhibitory problems from a Simpsons episode

541
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.920
that actually sort of covers anything you might want to know about.

542
00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:58.150
Developmental differences

543
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.870
basically may sum up much a developmental psychology that the child,

544
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.730
that the child essentially,

545
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.600
um,

546
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.540
he does a,

547
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.331
it's moved.

548
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:12.820
You go no and he keeps going for it.

549
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.190
And there's some evidence that's true.

550
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.780
Adele diamond who studied this fines that are low kids reach for AA.

551
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.610
They look for be as if the,

552
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.680
they know it's there,

553
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:25.600
but it can't stop themselves from reaching.

554
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.390
And we'll continue this theme a little bit later.

555
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.333
Finally,

556
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.050
it might be kids don't know things.

557
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.700
Some things you got to learn,

558
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:39.570
and this is true in all sorts of domains in the social world and the economic

559
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:41.380
world and the political world.

560
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.300
And it's true as well in the physical world.

561
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.351
In fact,

562
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:46.310
there's some things even adults don't know.

563
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:47.511
So,

564
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:47.930
um,

565
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.810
so here's a study by Michael mccloskey with college students.

566
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.033
Here's the idea.

567
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.700
You have a tube,

568
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.281
a transparent,

569
00:23:58.281 --> 00:23:59.031
a Tuba,

570
00:23:59.031 --> 00:23:59.870
a hollow tube,

571
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.070
and at the top of the tube you throw a ball through.

572
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.830
So whips through the tube and comes out.

573
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.170
Question is what happens to it?

574
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:14.710
Does it go in the path of a or does it go in the path of B without looking

575
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:16.100
around?

576
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.280
Who votes for a WHO votes for B?

577
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.310
Here's the weird thing.

578
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.750
Whenever I do this at Yale,

579
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.760
everybody gets the damn thing right

580
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.460
at Johns Hopkins,

581
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.220
50 50 when for a and B

582
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.340
I got to get a better demo.

583
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.353
But anyway,

584
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.900
college students not here show systematic biases of incorrect physical

585
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.310
intuitions.

586
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.350
Here's a twist and if you were,

587
00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:46.611
if you,

588
00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:47.091
if you,

589
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:50.870
if you found people who were less wonderful than you all and ask them,

590
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.190
you'd get a lot of people saying the curving thing but nears the twist.

591
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.143
Ask somebody,

592
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.990
what if you took a tube and you squirted water through it?

593
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.130
Where would the water though?

594
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.350
Nobody chooses B.

595
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.460
Everybody knows the water would continue in a straight line suggesting that that

596
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:11.270
when you have experience that helps you out but an absence of experience,

597
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.650
you're kind of lost.

598
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.690
Um,

599
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.370
we've talked about the physical world.

600
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.690
What about the social world?

601
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:18.980
What about the world of people?

602
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.980
While there's a lot of research on this as well,

603
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.010
babies start off with some social preferences.

604
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.260
If you take newborn babies,

605
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.040
it's very hard to do research with newborn babies actually because of the

606
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.200
consent procedure and everything.

607
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.330
So most of this work has done in France.

608
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.433
We're like,

609
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.020
where they have no laws at all.

610
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.700
They just rush into women,

611
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:42.360
give birth and aggression and says we are psychologists.

612
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.700
And then they do experiments.

613
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:46.040
On the babies and it's terrific.

614
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:51.310
And this is like one of them where they compare baby's looking at this versus

615
00:25:53.061 --> 00:25:56.330
this baby's like the one that lasts like a face.

616
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.010
These are newborns.

617
00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.060
Um,

618
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.350
there's some preferences with humans and with other primaries to favor faces.

619
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.820
Babies are also social animals too.

620
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.790
So there are natural mimics.

621
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.570
Um,

622
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.220
Andrew melts off for instance,

623
00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:13.550
has found that if you go to a newborn baby and if you get it,

624
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:14.870
if you find a newborn baby,

625
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.890
this is the first thing,

626
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.820
first thing you should do,

627
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.580
stick your face right up to newborn baby and toys and stick your tongue out.

628
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.960
And melts are fines that babies more often than not,

629
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.640
stick their tongues out back,

630
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.480
um,

631
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.320
suggesting some sort of social connection from one person to another and then

632
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:35.120
later on babies are,

633
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:37.670
mimics babies more often than not.

634
00:26:37.671 --> 00:26:39.620
We'll copy the face next to them.

635
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.450
Now these,

636
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.470
the nature of these responses,

637
00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:45.600
this preferring faces,

638
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:47.790
this sort of mimicry is a matter of debate.

639
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.680
There's a lot of research going on asking how smarter babies can we see you?

640
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.180
Some of the same methods.

641
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:55.243
Um,

642
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.220
two,

643
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.810
that we've looked at it for the physical world.

644
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:58.950
Look at the social world.

645
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.990
And to illustrate one of the studies,

646
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:03.450
I will tell you about a study that I did with Valerie.

647
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:05.310
Cool Meyer and Karen Win.

648
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.390
And so what we tested was nine month olds and 12 month olds.

649
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.800
And we showed the movies sort of sitting down or seeing a movie where one

650
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:14.940
character is going to help abolish,

651
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.970
achieve a goal and another character's going to hinder the ball.

652
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.600
And then we're going to see whether they expect the ball to approach,

653
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.500
um,

654
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.590
the one that helped it versus the one that hindered it.

655
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.510
So this is what a baby would see.

656
00:27:29.511 --> 00:27:32.900
This is literally the same movie a baby would see in the experiment.

657
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.080
The thing is for these sorts of experiments,

658
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.490
there's a lot of that control.

659
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.880
So something that's a square in one movie will be a triangle in another movie,

660
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.020
something that's on the top.

661
00:27:42.021 --> 00:27:43.280
And one movie will be,

662
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.671
uh,

663
00:27:43.671 --> 00:27:44.810
on the bottom and another movie.

664
00:27:44.811 --> 00:27:46.160
So this is an example movie,

665
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.690
but this is what babies would see.

666
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.100
And they see this over and over again.

667
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:08.130
And the question is would they expect babies,

668
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.371
weed,

669
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:08.701
babies,

670
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:10.740
expect them went to approach the one that helped it

671
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.020
or approach to one that hindered it.

672
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.540
And what we find is statistically babies look longer when Shawna movie where it

673
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:23.240
approach just the one that hindered at versus helped him.

674
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.480
And this we take as preliminary evidence that um,

675
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.190
that they,

676
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.860
they have a social interpretation.

677
00:28:30.861 --> 00:28:34.730
They see this movie as you see this movie in terms of helping and hindering and

678
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:37.360
somebody's going to somebody that helped it versus hindered it.

679
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.740
You could then ask,

680
00:28:39.741 --> 00:28:44.230
this makes a prediction that babies should themselves prefer the creature who's

681
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.150
to help her versus to hinder and to explore this.

682
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.980
A graduate student in his department,

683
00:28:48.981 --> 00:28:53.780
Kylie Hamlin has started a series of studies where they sh they show babies

684
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.950
three dimensional scenes and then give them the characters and see which one

685
00:28:57.951 --> 00:28:58.670
they reach for.

686
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.720
So here's video so you can see how this experiment is that

687
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.303
<v 1>okay?</v>

688
00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.763
<v 0>Oh,</v>

689
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.370
next trial is from a different study.

690
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.640
Different things were used and the baby's given a choice.

691
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:07.511
And,

692
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:08.160
um,

693
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.060
one thing to know methodologically is the person giving a choice is blind to

694
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:13.810
this study.

695
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.520
And blind here is a technical term,

696
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:18.220
meaning she had no idea what the baby's saw.

697
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:23.140
And the point of this is to avoid either intentional or unintentional,

698
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:24.940
sort of trying to get the answer you want.

699
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.940
She couldn't do that because she didn't know what the right answer is.

700
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.380
So here's what the baby would say.

701
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.413
So,

702
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:47.330
so this suggests that some social understanding,

703
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.360
maybe they're from the very start.

704
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.310
This evidence is tentative,

705
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.480
very controversial,

706
00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.053
<v 1>but</v>

707
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.080
<v 0>now I want to raise a huge developmental puzzle.</v>

708
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:04.470
And the puzzle is there are some ways in which babies are not just babies,

709
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:10.141
but young children are very clueless when it comes to people.

710
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:15.690
And so I have a film clip here of two very nice studies showing babies,

711
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:16.960
ignorant,

712
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.261
sorry,

713
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:19.300
young children's ignorance of other people.

714
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:24.340
I'll show you the studies and then we'll briefly discuss what they mean

715
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.890
before discussing that example a little bit more detail.

716
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:31.340
Um,

717
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:31.701
any,

718
00:31:31.701 --> 00:31:32.530
any questions?

719
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:33.500
What are your questions?

720
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:33.861
Yes.

721
00:31:33.861 --> 00:31:34.694
And back.

722
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

723
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.331
<v 0>Typically,</v>

724
00:31:38.331 --> 00:31:38.541
I'm,

725
00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:40.580
I don't know for those particular children,

726
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.130
but typically on those tasks,

727
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.170
three year olds and young four year olds tend to fail and around the age of four

728
00:31:48.171 --> 00:31:50.400
or five kids tend to succeed or sort of a,

729
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.550
a period around the age of four,

730
00:31:52.551 --> 00:31:55.490
four and a half where kids make the transition from,

731
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.200
from a failure to success.

732
00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:58.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

733
00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.380
<v 0>The question by the way,</v>

734
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.120
was when new children in that video,

735
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:01.690
when were,

736
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.920
what were the ages of children,

737
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.370
uh,

738
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.390
who failed and who passed?

739
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.293
<v 1>Yes.</v>

740
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.083
Tomorrow.

741
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:22.891
<v 0>Um,</v>

742
00:32:22.891 --> 00:32:26.850
the question of whether discriminant conditioning has been used with babies to

743
00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:29.220
explore what sort of concepts they have.

744
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.720
I don't know.

745
00:32:30.721 --> 00:32:31.554
Does anybody,

746
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:32.850
it has been,

747
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.833
um,

748
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.110
the,

749
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.470
um,

750
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.810
Colleen answered and said that,

751
00:32:38.811 --> 00:32:40.580
that it's not as effective as other methods.

752
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.710
Part of the problem with using operant conditioning with babies is it's

753
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:48.170
difficult to get him to behave in any systematic way.

754
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:48.891
So they're looking,

755
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:50.330
time measures tend to be more,

756
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.373
more subtle.

757
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:54.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

758
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:54.810
<v 0>Um,</v>

759
00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:55.740
any other questions?

760
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.753
<v 1>Oh yes.</v>

761
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.920
Those young boys,

762
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.290
the rocket ship one versus the

763
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.490
<v 0>Oh,</v>

764
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:09.940
um,

765
00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.600
the question of why they chose the baby that the kids chose the rocket ship one

766
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.390
as opposed to the Rafaelle one.

767
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.383
Um,

768
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.790
it wasn't what they were interested in an experiment.

769
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.050
My bed is when they can,

770
00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:21.460
when they've toes the stickers,

771
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.690
they had a pretty good sense of why of which ones the boys would prefer in those

772
00:33:25.691 --> 00:33:26.380
studies.

773
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.010
Um,

774
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:31.870
the question of why a boy you might prefer one sort of sticker and you might get

775
00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:35.420
a different response if a girl is going to come up later when we discuss

776
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:36.940
different theories of sex differences.

777
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.030
But that was something I think they were just assuming in the study to get it

778
00:33:40.031 --> 00:33:40.864
off the ground.

779
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

780
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.470
Okay.

781
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.303
Um,

782
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.943
okay.

783
00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.670
<v 0>There's a huge debate over what's going on there.</v>

784
00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.960
And if you listen at the end to the psychologist summarizing the data,

785
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:06.430
the psychologist had a very good and very clear and strong idea of what was

786
00:34:06.431 --> 00:34:07.264
going on.

787
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.880
It was that children need to know more about mines.

788
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.710
The children don't know about that.

789
00:34:14.711 --> 00:34:17.050
You can do something with the intent to deceive.

790
00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:22.530
They don't understand that somebody could choose what you chose in a malicious

791
00:34:22.661 --> 00:34:23.494
way.

792
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.500
This is possible.

793
00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.720
This is one respectable theory,

794
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.730
but the alternative is

795
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.820
they have the right knowledge,

796
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.610
but they suffer from problems with inhibition.

797
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.130
So consider both studies.

798
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.450
The first study to one of the deceptive dolls with the big shoes and little

799
00:34:43.451 --> 00:34:47.530
shoes is actually fairly difficult and it's possible that children kind of got

800
00:34:47.531 --> 00:34:48.910
overwhelmed with it.

801
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.230
And when asked,

802
00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.093
um,

803
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.840
what would the mother think,

804
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.780
who the mother would think stole the food,

805
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:56.921
responded with,

806
00:34:56.921 --> 00:34:58.030
who really stole the food?

807
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:03.310
And there's some pull towards the right answer that makes this task difficult.

808
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.020
The second one,

809
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:08.170
the second study illustrates this issue even more clearly.

810
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.050
Take the boy who kept failing.

811
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.890
He kept pointing to the rocket ship and mean monkey kept taking it away.

812
00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.243
<v 1>Okay?</v>

813
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.700
<v 0>It's possible.</v>

814
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:23.440
The heat genuinely didn't know what to do and he wasn't smart enough to

815
00:35:23.441 --> 00:35:25.960
understand that he needed to point to the other one.

816
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.560
But it's also possible that it's a homer Simpson like effect where when asked to

817
00:35:32.411 --> 00:35:33.670
point to what he wants,

818
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.610
he just couldn't help but point to the one he wanted and that the extra work it

819
00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:39.630
takes to lie,

820
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:40.770
um,

821
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:41.603
was beyond him.

822
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.280
And in support of the second alternative,

823
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.450
um,

824
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:50.450
even adults find these tasks involving lying and deception more difficult.

825
00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:53.550
There were slower at them,

826
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.890
we make more mistakes then,

827
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.311
then,

828
00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:56.640
um,

829
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.220
then Tafta don't involve lying and deception.

830
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.370
So I'm raising this not to solve the problem,

831
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.490
you'll read more about it in the Peter Gray textbook and more about it in the

832
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:09.690
Norton readings on development.

833
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.710
But just to raise this as an interesting area of debate,

834
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.650
another interesting area of debate

835
00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.800
is what's the relationship between different sorts of development.

836
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:29.190
So I started off with Pij Npha like Freud believed in general across the board,

837
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.760
changes in how children think.

838
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.830
An alternative though is that they're separate modules.

839
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.260
And this is a view depend,

840
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:42.800
uh,

841
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.480
developed again by Noam Chomsky and also by the philosopher of mind Jerry Fodor

842
00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.120
who claim that the whole idea of a child developing as a single story is

843
00:36:53.121 --> 00:36:55.580
mistaken what you get instead.

844
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:59.660
Is there separate prewired systems for reasoning about the world?

845
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:01.663
Um,

846
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.110
these systems have some built in knowledge and they have to do some learning,

847
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:11.270
but the learning pattern varies from system to system and there's a separateness

848
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.193
to them.

849
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.930
Why should we take this view seriously?

850
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.681
Well,

851
00:37:15.681 --> 00:37:20.120
one reason is that there are developmental disorders that seemed to involve

852
00:37:20.121 --> 00:37:23.090
damage to one system but not to another.

853
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.870
And the classic case of this is a disorder known as autism.

854
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:32.180
And Autism is something I've always found a fascinating disorder for many

855
00:37:32.181 --> 00:37:32.601
reasons.

856
00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:34.700
It's actually why I entered psychology.

857
00:37:34.701 --> 00:37:39.701
I started off working with children with autism and it could be taken as a

858
00:37:40.311 --> 00:37:45.311
striking illustration of how the social part of your brain is distinct from

859
00:37:46.011 --> 00:37:47.090
other parts of your brand.

860
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:51.860
So what autism is a disorder that strikes about one and a thousand people,

861
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.480
mostly boys.

862
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.380
And the dominant problems.

863
00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.890
Concern consists of a lack of social connectedness,

864
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.870
problems with language problems dealing with people and more generally,

865
00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:06.141
uh,

866
00:38:06.141 --> 00:38:06.690
problems.

867
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.370
What the psychologist Simon Baron Cohen has described as mine,

868
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:14.750
blindness in that autistic people show no impairments dealing with the physical

869
00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:15.584
world.

870
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.330
They show no impairments on.

871
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.430
They don't necessarily show any impairments on mathematical skills or spatial

872
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:23.264
skills,

873
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.490
but they have a lot of problems with people.

874
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.871
Now,

875
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:28.250
many autistic children,

876
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:28.880
um,

877
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.050
have no language.

878
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.940
They're totally shut off from society,

879
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:35.710
but even some of them who learn language and who managed to get some sort of

880
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:40.450
independent life nevertheless will suffer from a severe social impairment.

881
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.060
And this could be shown in all sorts of ways.

882
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.070
A simple experiment develop.

883
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:47.530
I Simon Baron Cohen goes like this,

884
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:49.810
you show this to three and four year olds.

885
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.390
There's four candies there and you say,

886
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.340
this is Charlie in the middle,

887
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.241
which chocolate?

888
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:58.330
We'll Charlie's hake for most children.

889
00:38:58.331 --> 00:38:59.051
And most of you,

890
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:01.150
I hope the answer's pretty clear.

891
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.013
This one,

892
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.200
autistic children will often just shrug and say,

893
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.160
how can I know?

894
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.170
Because they don't instinctively appreciate that people's interest and desires

895
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.480
tend to be attuned to where they're looking.

896
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.880
Another sort of task,

897
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.890
which is a task that has been done hundreds,

898
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.480
perhaps thousands of times,

899
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.650
is known as the false belief task and here's the idea.

900
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.970
You show the child the following situation.

901
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.490
There's a doll named Maxine and Maxine.

902
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:31.750
He puts the ball in the cupboard,

903
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.600
Maxie leaves and a second doll enters the second doll,

904
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.110
takes the ball out of the cupboard and puts it under the bed.

905
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:45.600
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

906
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.770
<v 0>Maxie comes back and the question is where will Maxy look for the ball?</v>

907
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:54.960
Now this is a question about your understanding about minds.

908
00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:01.010
The question of where is the ball really is a question about the physical world.

909
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.370
Everyone can solve it,

910
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.830
but this question is hard.

911
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.700
The right answer is Max woke.

912
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.720
Maxi will look in the cupboard even though it's not really there because Max

913
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:13.250
Max,

914
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.140
he has a false belief about the world.

915
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.210
Three year olds find this difficult to year olds find is difficult.

916
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.930
Four year olds and five year olds are able to pass this task.

917
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.330
Normal adults are able to pass this task.

918
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:32.250
Children with autism have serious problems and often people have autism who are

919
00:40:32.251 --> 00:40:35.310
otherwise very high functioning will fail this task.

920
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:35.791
They'll say,

921
00:40:35.791 --> 00:40:35.911
oh,

922
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:38.640
he must think he's going to check under the bed.

923
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.150
Any questions about um,

924
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.320
about autism?

925
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.423
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:48.383
Yes.

927
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:56.880
<v 0>Good question.</v>

928
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.713
It isn't.

929
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.590
This is,

930
00:40:58.590 --> 00:40:59.280
they're both,

931
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.060
they're both experiment designed to tap and appreciation of false belief.

932
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.740
The deception one with the,

933
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.550
with the shoes and everything looked at it in the course of deception.

934
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.750
Can you understand that?

935
00:41:09.751 --> 00:41:14.751
A mother might think it's that person even though it's really that person and

936
00:41:14.911 --> 00:41:15.744
our kid failed.

937
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:19.350
This is a sort of stripped down version without all the fanciness,

938
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.630
but it has exactly the same thing.

939
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:25.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

940
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.733
Yes.

941
00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.690
<v 0>Nobody knows.</v>

942
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.350
Um,

943
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.860
but there is a theory which won't answer your question,

944
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.420
but we'll put it in a broader context.

945
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.950
Simon Baron Cohen argues that there are certain abilities that tend to be more

946
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:46.940
sequestered for males and other abilities that are more sequestered,

947
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:48.320
more focused on females.

948
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.340
Um,

949
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.540
social abilities he argues tend to be more female than male.

950
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:59.260
So the way baron puts it provocatively is to be a man is to suffer from a very

951
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:00.830
mild form of autism.

952
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.503
Um,

953
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:07.040
the idea is then that autistic individuals suffer from what he calls extreme

954
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:08.000
male brains.

955
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.343
And as such,

956
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:13.700
it stands to reason that they'd be more sample from the male population than the

957
00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:14.660
female population.

958
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.330
That's such an interesting issue that again,

959
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:19.310
when we returned to talk about sex differences,

960
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.490
we'll look at that in a little bit more detailed to see if it,

961
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.930
if it's supported by the evidence.

962
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.723
Yes.

963
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.303
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

964
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:35.761
<v 0>I'm sorry.</v>

965
00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:37.740
Tell me that is the severity of autism.

966
00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:47.770
It's an interesting question.

967
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:48.683
Um,

968
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:53.140
the question is how do you think about the severity of autism with regard to

969
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:56.380
developmental stages and sort of surprisingly,

970
00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.550
autism can't really be thought of in that way.

971
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.020
So it's not like an adult with autism is like a three year old or two year old

972
00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.011
in some way.

973
00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:09.010
Something like autism with autism isn't like any child at all.

974
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:09.700
Um,

975
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.770
and he normally developing child at all.

976
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.260
So it's not really a developmental,

977
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:15.610
uh,

978
00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:19.150
it's not really a developmental delay in the way that it might make sense to

979
00:43:19.151 --> 00:43:21.010
think about certain forms or retardation.

980
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.630
On the other hand,

981
00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.760
when we think about how severe autism is,

982
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:28.390
we do look at things like how much language does the person have and in that

983
00:43:28.391 --> 00:43:30.280
sense it is related to development.

984
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:32.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

985
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.173
<v 0>Yes.</v>

986
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.213
<v 1>Overcompensate.</v>

987
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.970
<v 0>Um,</v>

988
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.010
the majority of people with autism,

989
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:42.851
it's a good question.

990
00:43:42.851 --> 00:43:43.684
The question is

991
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.920
what are the chances of somebody with autism would be able to overcome their

992
00:43:47.921 --> 00:43:48.760
deficiencies?

993
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:49.630
Um,

994
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.780
autism's a funny disorder and there's a lot of media publication,

995
00:43:52.781 --> 00:43:56.830
immediate presentation often to people who are showcased in a media tend to be

996
00:43:56.831 --> 00:43:58.000
very exceptional.

997
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:02.110
So there was a woman temple Grandin who's autistic and has anybody here heard of

998
00:44:02.111 --> 00:44:02.944
temple Grandin?

999
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:03.880
Um,

1000
00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.240
she wrote some wonderful books about her experience as an autistic person,

1001
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.010
but she is very unusual.

1002
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.430
So a lot depends to answer your question,

1003
00:44:12.431 --> 00:44:16.360
how one defines autism and whether one includes Asperger's syndrome,

1004
00:44:16.361 --> 00:44:17.380
which is a limited sense,

1005
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.590
a more mild syndrome as a form of autism.

1006
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:26.650
The answer is that the majority of people with autism have severe problems and

1007
00:44:26.651 --> 00:44:27.100
will not.

1008
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.970
And at this stage with this level of therapy will not lead a normal.

1009
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.350
More specifically what I meant was when you showed the example of rain that,

1010
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.170
Yup.

1011
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.003
Um,

1012
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.090
you said that most people have autism.

1013
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:44.150
Are they exceptional at math and analytical skills or are they just better?

1014
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.810
The question is about so called autistic savant.

1015
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.190
So rain man,

1016
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:54.180
the character played by Dustin Hoffman had extraordinary mathematical abilities

1017
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:59.370
and some people with autism have extraordinary artistic abilities,

1018
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:02.940
are mathematical abilities or a musical abilities.

1019
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:03.720
Um,

1020
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.830
and these are amazing.

1021
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.870
It's an amazing question why they have it.

1022
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.720
But this is a very small minority.

1023
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.830
This is a very,

1024
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.061
it's,

1025
00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:14.820
it's fascinating that happens at all that you can have severe damage but

1026
00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:16.860
compensated with some powerful skill.

1027
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:17.231
Now I know,

1028
00:45:17.231 --> 00:45:18.270
and I'm answering your question,

1029
00:45:18.271 --> 00:45:19.200
I think in a better way,

1030
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.630
but it's actually very rare.

1031
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.470
Most people have autism do not have any exceptional abilities that go along with

1032
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:26.304
it.

1033
00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.240
Another question is,

1034
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.860
if you believe in modules,

1035
00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.090
if there are modules,

1036
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.193
what are they?

1037
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.100
And so far when reviewing the developmental data,

1038
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.590
we've talked about two of them,

1039
00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:46.030
physics and people,

1040
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.910
an object module and the social module,

1041
00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:53.710
but other people have argued that there was a special module in your brain for

1042
00:45:53.711 --> 00:45:54.880
dealing with artifacts.

1043
00:45:54.881 --> 00:45:58.390
That is things like tables and chairs and cars and forks.

1044
00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:03.520
Some people have argued there's a module for sociology for dealing with human

1045
00:46:03.521 --> 00:46:04.270
groups,

1046
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:06.010
races and classes and so on.

1047
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.880
Some have even argued that there is an intuitive biology,

1048
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.990
a common sense,

1049
00:46:10.991 --> 00:46:14.830
biological understanding of the world that's separate from um,

1050
00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.830
from your understanding of people and physics.

1051
00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:22.720
And in fact the most dominant proponent of the view is our very own.

1052
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:28.410
Frank Kyle Master Morse College at Yale were strongly defended the notion of a

1053
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.570
intuitive biological module.

1054
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:35.080
Final question just to raise,

1055
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.210
I've talked in terms of the modular view,

1056
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.703
but

1057
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.190
there might also be profound general differences between children,

1058
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.830
adults,

1059
00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:48.670
not just specific to how you think about objects or how you think about people

1060
00:46:48.671 --> 00:46:50.230
or how you think about this or how you think about that,

1061
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.790
but rather than more general.

1062
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:56.890
And one claim which we're going to return to briefly next class when we talk

1063
00:46:56.891 --> 00:47:00.130
about language is that there's a very,

1064
00:47:00.131 --> 00:47:05.131
very big difference between a creature that doesn't have language and a creature

1065
00:47:05.231 --> 00:47:06.064
that does.

1066
00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.950
And part of the claim is that learning a language,

1067
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:13.951
learning to speak reconfigures the human brain in such a way that is really

1068
00:47:14.441 --> 00:47:18.430
exceptional and that has no parallel in any other species.

1069
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.920
And this is an interesting claim.

1070
00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:22.323
And um,

1071
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.800
one we'll talk about.

1072
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.760
Um,

1073
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:28.960
finally I want to end with an example from Stephen Jay Gould.

1074
00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:29.950
Um,

1075
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:32.110
suppose you hate development.

1076
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.670
You hate developmental psychology.

1077
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:34.870
You hate babies,

1078
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.950
you hate children,

1079
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.150
they're not cute,

1080
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:37.900
they're ugly.

1081
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.920
You don't want to have him,

1082
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.090
you don't want to study them.

1083
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:40.571
You're,

1084
00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:42.190
you're annoyed that we have to discuss them.

1085
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.533
Fine.

1086
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:49.470
But there are reasons to study development even if you are not interested in

1087
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:52.683
children,

1088
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.490
because sometimes developmental studies and developmental date and developmental

1089
00:47:57.491 --> 00:48:01.780
science can inform questions about adults.

1090
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.540
And Stephen Jay Gould has a very nice example of this.

1091
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.770
He asked the question,

1092
00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.480
is a zebra,

1093
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.330
a black animal with white stripes or a white animal with black stripes?

1094
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:14.770
Now,

1095
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:18.550
you could look at adult zebras all day long and you're never going to figure

1096
00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:19.384
this out.

1097
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.190
But if you want to know the answer,

1098
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:22.121
and I knew it,

1099
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:23.110
but I forget what it is,

1100
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:24.123
it doesn't matter.

1101
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:25.330
But if you wanted to know it,

1102
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.321
you could.

1103
00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:30.070
You look at development and you'd watch the embryological development of a

1104
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:30.700
zebra,

1105
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.950
and that's how you learn to answer to your question.

1106
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:33.730
In fact,

1107
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.500
I'll end with a nice quote.

1108
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.000
Um,

1109
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
this is by the famous biologist Darcy Thompson who wrote the book on growth and

1110
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:43.534
form.

1111
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:44.531
And it's sort of,

1112
00:48:44.531 --> 00:48:44.980
uh,

1113
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.250
the motto of many developmental psychologists and many evolutionary

1114
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:49.060
psychologists.

1115
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.410
So I'll end with this.

1116
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:53.710
Everything is the way it is because it got that way.

1117
00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.420
Okay,

1118
00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:56.200
I'll see you next week.
