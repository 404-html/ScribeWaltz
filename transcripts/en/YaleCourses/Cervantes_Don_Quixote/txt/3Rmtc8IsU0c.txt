Speaker 1:          00:02          There are three issues that I want to bring up. Uh, as I begin today's lecture that will determine my general themes today, improvisation, the international dimension that the fiction of the novel acquirers and the influence of art or, or of literature on reality. Those are the general topics as, as we move to the conclusion of the Quixote, the issue of how to bring the novel to a close most have loomed large in serve anthesis mind. The plot of a novel is repetitive more than sequential with the vague quest of the protagonist to revive the age of chivalry and concretely to participate in the joust and said, I've also as goals, uh, but there is no obvious or impending goal. Uh, do the character's wonderings. Uh, although one could argue with Williamson, the critic I mentioned in the last lecture that the disenchantment of Deucey Neha is the main purpose of Don Quixote and essential set by Merlin's prophecy and involving the 30,000 lashes that sanctuary most applied to his bottom.

Speaker 1:          01:31          And the interplay between the two about accomplishing that goal of is enchanting Lucinia. Uh, yet even this is no clear mission, who's accomplishment would bring the novel to an end. Uh, why did Gutierrez disenchanted? How could she be disenchanted? What would that mean? Would she ended donkey healthy then Mary, this is not mentioned by the protagonist nor his marriage. Normally a desired end to courtly love. Love itself is the, is the purpose of Courtney love the love of Luff. Um, it is overused that the only and the possible would be the death of Don Quixote making his life the shape of the fiction though which life would be the question? Is it the life of our loan Suki high? No, the Bidalgo who went mad and became donkey haughty, but about his early life and family. We know next to nothing. We only know about his knees. Then later we learned that the niece was the daughter of a sister, but we really don't know anything about his life or easy. The life invented, uh, by donkey haughty. The would be night errand. Uh, would that be the life that comes to an end to close the novel?

Speaker 2:          03:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Improvisation. I have been saying all along since two room, the plot of the Quixote serendipitous actions provoked by chancing counters on the road and by characters who pop up in the second part wanting to script the knights life or it meets at least episodes of the night life. What role will improvisation play in the ending of the novel then you said confluence. Oh, we will. We will be talking about that or we'll be seeing about that in the next few lectures on us. We come to the very end of the novel and, and discuss that there is a confluence of actual geography with current historical events. Uh, flip, just the expulsion of the Maurice Course, bringing in Catalonia and the Turkish and Huguenots ministers in the final episodes of the Quixote. These events, the returners us to the beginning of part two and the discussions of donkey hot, a ducky hope. This house about some of them, particularly the Turkish threat.

Speaker 2:          04:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:27          This is a form of, of closure to this return to those, uh, discussions at the beginning of part two. The novel acquires an international dimension announced by Don Quixote. The priests don't Sandstone Carrasco talking about the Turkish threat in the early chapters. I see Don Quixote. We're going after all to try to resolve that issue.

Speaker 1:          04:54          But notice the concurrence of real geographical settings. We spoke of the Ebro River and now we have Barcelona with historical actions. We have, uh, uh, today, uh, Elena apple juice. And I produced the slightly primitive map of, uh, of Spain. But I think that it is clear enough to give you a notion of what I'm talking about. But of course you have a real map of Spain in the website that you can, uh, you can see on your own. Um, I wouldn't be a alluding to it. Uh, so we have seen the able to river Barcelona we have now, uh, and we now we'll see historical actions, uh, involving, uh, that region. Um, now the, none of the historical actuals that, uh, appear in the hotel. By historical, I mean current historical events.

Speaker 2:          06:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:08          None is more current and pressing than the expulsion of the Maurice goes, which is taking place as sort of amp. This is writing

Speaker 2:          06:19          part two.

Speaker 1:          06:22          The topic of the expulsion centers on the character of early [inaudible] day and his family, he is one of the principal new characters, uh, in part to the international dimension of the novel, allows Advantis to introduce fresh carrots of characters who are different from those mainly Castilian ones that he has presented so far though as we know. And I'll talk about it again, not exclusively Castilian that's the second of the broad topics. And the third is the one about art influence reality. In several of the of these episodes that I will be discussing, particularly the one involving two fellows, but also in others, there seems to be at decided influence of art on reality and a coalescence of the two by which one could say that reality or the real is improved by art as we have already seen in other episodes before. But we'd have some, uh, today or where that seems to be, uh, the main topic.

Speaker 2:          07:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:33          Now, uh, let us begin with ricotta. Uh, one could say that this story is a rewriting of the captives tail from part one with a ricotta whose name is Anna Feliks.

Speaker 3:          07:55          That'd be talking about his name and let me know, recalled the name given to his daughter. Her name is Anna.

Speaker 1:          08:18          She will be the Aida of this rewriting and Pedro Gregorio. Her suitor would be the captive.

Speaker 3:          08:26          But I mean this is,

Speaker 2:          08:39          well these are,

Speaker 1:          08:40          these two episodes are very different at the same time, the one of the captive and the one involving, he caught it, or at least the record, the episode is much richer in some respects under the captives episode is, it's quite elaborate in these last few chapters of the Quixote. Cervantes appears to be offering many possible variations of narrative fiction or some of the narrative, uh, modes available to him at that moment.

Speaker 3:          09:16          Uh,

Speaker 1:          09:19          did he go and his family provides the opportunity for Emini Novella Morris or more mortgage novel and Noella Mariska is a tale about the love of a, between a Christian Young man and a morrish young woman with all the predictable obstacles. The best known of these, the whalers Maurice because is called after its prototype. Prototype. Dentists' mean?

Speaker 3:          09:55          Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          10:04          And this novel is embedded in Degooseman Guzman. They'll farace. I won't put the name on the board because you've heard it many, many times during the semester. The, all the other fictional mode in this, a kind of smorgasbord of narratives is the Byzantine Romance, the Byzantine Romance, which entailed drawn out adventures over vast geographical areas, adventures of lovers seeking to find each other and suffering. Abductions chipped rex and being lost in strange lands only to find when they finally meet that unbeknownst to them, unbeknownst to them, they are brother and sister and cannot marry. This is a, it's a kind of, uh, Ma, uh, of romance Britain at the time. A very convoluted, hence Byzantine.

Speaker 3:          11:05          Uh,

Speaker 1:          11:07          now Cervantes was writing such a romance as he raised to finish the Quixote. It's called law. Strava hosts see lists. He see his moon though the trials of pedasil lists and see he's Mukunda.

Speaker 3:          11:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:35          We will be revisiting this when we talk about the prologue to that work. Uh, which are Avantis thought would be the culmination of his life, of his career, but he was, he was wrong. Uh, a very interesting idea that I, if criticism has taken it up would be to study the influence of the writing of the trials of Perseus and see his Miranda on part two of the Quixote. As these were books that [inaudible] worked on all the same time towards the end of his life, he's rushing to finish the Quixote and rushing to also finish the trials of [inaudible]. And it will be interesting to see how much one influences the other. But here I said, we mentioned it a little bit. Uh, he, they influence is, is obvious. Ana and Pedro's abduction by the Turks and their c journey and rescue are like a small scale Byzantine romance that is played out in front of the port of Barcelona. This is like a Byzantine romance in a nutshell. They are abducted by the Turks. They're going away, uh, they finally meet and uh, there is no ending to it. Uh, uh, because you said Maurice God, she cannot come back to Spain and all of that. But that is a kind of a little Byzantine Romance. He, Larry US tidbit, if you have already read this in this story, is that Anna eager to protect pedal from their abductors and Pedro is a very beautiful young man, dresses him as a woman to make him less attractive to the Turkish

Speaker 2:          13:19          copters.

Speaker 1:          13:23          It is a comic dig at the Turks whose alleged sexual proclivities we're notorious and are even mentioned in good old [inaudible] is Tesoro. In the entry on the Turks there is a not so veiled allusion to this very practice. Dot. Cervantes is alluding to in a very, uh, I think comical way.

Speaker 2:          13:55          It is kind of a transvestite. It isn't to the second power or something like that to somebody.

Speaker 1:          14:04          Why Advantis wanted to provide this smorgasbord of narrative possibilities at the end is a mystery to me. One answer is that, uh, other than just a boast of artistic mastery is that he's consciously seeking variety in his work and he is aware and has been since part one that for all the possibilities of his newly found hero donkey hold this adventures good, become monotonous and decided to include this technical extravagant extravaganza as a kind of overture or something. This accumulation of narratives is also a sort of a closure by accumulation, what could say. But, uh, US get back to recording first, let us consider the name. Click coating. Grieco means rich in Spanish being rich. Rico can be all day.

Speaker 3:          15:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:15          Is that now we've been tative Indian ending that increases something. Remember that I mentioned this at the beginning of the course.

Speaker 3:          15:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:25          goto.is a big fat. So no, uh, so Ricotti is, uh, me and said he's very rich, which, which he is though some claim. Some critics claimed that hidden names derives from his being from the value of Ricotta Evalyn [inaudible] name. But I, I don't buy that. That is, I think a little bit, uh, to uh, Ooh, tangential. It's obvious that he's recorded because he's very rich and, uh, we know that about that because he talks about the treasure that he has buried, um, now was really caught the Cervantes passes judgment on a current event, one that is taking place as he writes the book there. Maurice costs where it's spelled in 1609,

Speaker 3:          16:20          it's bullshit.

Speaker 1:          16:23          Well, the whole process lasted several years. So remember, these are the years when he is writing this book. If you read your Elliot, you will know that a long debate proceeded the expulsion as there were many people against it, mostly for economic reasons there Maurice, because we're an integral part of the economy of several regions of Spain and had some clout in the government. Your expulsion as you have learned in earlier cost ruin in some areas of Spain as the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 had also brought about, uh, all kinds of dire consequences to the, to, to Spain. But he's a confluence, a coalescence of the text of the fiction with current history that we had not seen before in part one or even part to marine any other fiction anywhere with the possible exception of the goose man, they al Farace. But there it is not as explicit.

Speaker 1:          17:34          Um, the events that are mentioned are not as dramatic and as current as the expulsion of the Maurice costs. Now this, the fact that the story will eventually remain on finished. Remember they have to put a petition to Madrid to have Anna Felix a pardon for returning to the peninsula. She, she faced with the possibility of uh, of being sent back or even of being executed. Uh, now the fact that the store would be remains unfinished leads me to think that's an advantage is considering considering here how closure can be brought about in the story that blends with ongoing time. How can you bring closure to a story that deals with something that is in the process of happening? How can fictional time offer closure to stop something that is happening in real time? If you do that, a closure will be a way of fictionalizing what is real

Speaker 1:          18:41          by giving it a, an artistic shape. So this is a theoretical issue that I'm sure was a in Cervantes is mine. And if you remember in part one, the very last of the stories is also left unfinished. I will take this up again as we consider the consider the ending of the, uh, of the novel. But what is the meaning of all of this business of current events in, in, in terms of surveys as his opinion about the expulsion of the Maurice Course? This has been, as you can imagine, a hotly debated issue with presentism play a heavy role in the debate. Presenteeism is a way of alluding to a form of criticism, a bit of literature or, uh, an interpretation of history that favors depressant. You interpret the past in terms of the precedent, uh, or you project the present into the past. Of course, the issue is whether one can completely avoid this ever. But there are some critics and some historians who exercise this, uh, to the point where it's, it, it is, uh, uh, obvious that it's the, that is not right. And a lot of presentism has played a role in this debate about what is the advantage really favored or not. The expulsion of them are east coast, all of these colored by all of the 20th century, particularly debates about minorities on their roles and so forth. In other words, some critics want to make this into a contemporary and having a spouse views or modern liberal thinker.

Speaker 2:          20:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:31          Uh, Cervantes is obviously appalled or the expulsion of those Maurice Ngos who were obviously part of the fabric of the country, those who have truly converted, but I think he gets, he tries to give it balance, a balanced view of the whole thing. Obviously worried about an internal enemy to the state given the international situation. It is possible and it has been mentioned that he was also worried about himself. Uh, if you express an opinion, obviously opposed to that of the crown, but think of this, Morocco is a barely across the Strait of Gibraltar.

Speaker 2:          21:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:20          I'm sure that most of you know that area of the, of the world. If you have seen Casablanca, which is not there, but nearly not nearly enough, but I don't know where the young people like you have seen that classic. But in any way, you know, this is the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain and Morocco is here. So Morocco was in the hands of Nms of Spain of the same race and religion as their Maurice costs. In other words, as opposed to the Jews who had been expelled in 1492, the Maurice goes, had an international projection. They potential international projection. They could be allied with foreign enemies and become a fifth column within Spain. Fifth column is red. You say about how, uh, a group of individuals who are against a government but living within the state, within the niche.

Speaker 1:          22:21          There Maurice goes as the episode of the captive in part one. Uh, the Maurice goes a allude with their presence to one of the central myth for the constitution of modern Spain after the unification of the country under Ferdinand and Isabella, the reconquest meaning the recovery of Spanish territory from Morris Control, which culminated with a fall of Granola in 1492. What do you mean by this? Is that the Maurice Coast? Uh, we're a, uh, uh, with a very presence, recalled the presence of the Morse in Spain or two 1492. And the Reconquista, the reconquest that becomes sort of a central patriotic myths that helps paint together. So, uh, uh, so the Maurice goes or expelled in 1609, appealing to people's fears dumped the reconquest could be undone and hence her, the whole country would collapse. This is ridiculous of course, but governments do tend to, uh, to uh, motivate the populace with such fierce, particularly totalitarian governments, uh, do that.

Speaker 1:          23:39          Uh, Hitler, uh, did, uh, in Cuba. Fidel Castro has been how's bring the impending invasion of the Yankees for 50 years? It has never come to keep the people aroused. And this is what is happening in the span of this moment. The Maurice Course called somehow unleash a counter or conquest and bring the whole country down. Now, in terms of the part of our protagonists, Loki Hotel on central, the relevant thing is that here we observed central making difficult and delicate moral decision with respect to recording the decision is whether to help him and he is in need. And they got, they also offers him a very substantial, uh, material reward or tool for law, for Sandra to be loyal to the king by obeying his edicts.

Speaker 2:          24:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:45          Sanchez, uh, memories by the way, uh, play a part in the episode episode. He recalls crying when he got his family, left his town and reveals that Anna Feliks has Pedrog ago. Greg, you in my, your ass go as his suitor. Am I your escorts or word? You already know? Private ordering audio is not only a Christian Young man, but a very well to do Christian Young man.

Speaker 2:          25:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:14          Sandra chooses a middle ground. He will not help regarded dig up the treasure, but he will keep silent about record this illegal return to Spain and his plan to take the money out of the country, which is also illegal. There were heavy sanctions against taking money out of the country because with the expulsion, uh, as always happens when, when, when, when a certain, certain people are expelled from the country and they'd take the richest, this affects the economy of the country, uh, tremendously. So there were, there were, there were laws against, uh, the, the, the Briscoes taking their wealth with them too. So record tay is, is guilty of, of two crimes having returned and also planning to take money out of the country.

Speaker 1:          26:06          Sanctuary, uh, makes, uh, a very, uh, difficult, uh, decision because he himself is taking a risk. If it is learned that he has not, uh, uh, uh, uh, report it, you, this return, he could be, uh, also held responsible. Now we've got the himself is a complex character and he's one of the few figures not marked at all in any way in the book. By complex, I mean that he's caught in conflicting dilemmas and is able to weigh different of view. He is comparable to a hemo Morrato. So riders father in part one, but here this is a, uh, more, uh, this is expanded, uh, because Eh, he's, he's, he's wife is converted to Christianity. His daughter was born into Christianity. He has not quite converted. He is in a very difficult, uh, situation three. Got The sense that he's not against the edict of banishment of expulsion.

Speaker 1:          27:16          You understand the reasons of state behind it, but laments that even those Maurice Co's who have joined the main stream of society, even converting to Christianity, are paying for the actions of those who are seditious and with whom he does not agree. Santo confesses to his neighbor in passing and just marvelous, uh, postprandial, uh, or, uh, uh, exchange they have after he and the German beggars and all of that get drunk with their wine and eat and so forth. Uh, Santiago confesses his travails as a governor announced to the ability for the position and Rick [inaudible], who is clearly better educated than Antonio. Uh, and, and, and can tell that the whole thing had to be a hoax does not press the matter in this recorded this place, a deeper human understanding and four barrels for the shortcomings of another human being's Saint Joe's ignorance. So it is a very subtle touch on the part of [inaudible]. There's a certain neighborly complicity by which the figures of Saint John recorded around the house filled out. This choir is growing intellectually and spiritually. Uh, the normal, uh, uh, progresses. And Rick got the, as I said, uh, it's, uh, it's a very, uh, complex and well rounded character who goes through a very dramatic, uh, process here.

Speaker 1:          28:56          My friend did distinguished a Puerto Rican scholar, Lusail Lopez Bharath.

Speaker 3:          29:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:13          Professor at the University of Puerto Rico has written eloquently. He's an Arab east, has written eloquently about the Maurice goes on the literature they produced. Learning about it may help us understand better, regardless plight as depicted by surveying this in the hotel. I'm referring to a, uh, a study by Lopez Barel and title. What image did the Maurice goes have of themselves to rights? If I were to symbolize the fundamental in image of themselves or the Spanish Mariko's had, I believe that the epithet used by [inaudible], she's writing about, uh, the episode used by man what would be the most appropriate criers or we purse when Maurice goes being deposed by the authorities cried. Instead of rewriting elegant passages from their literature, they were determined to preserve for posterity a faithful image of themselves and how they reacted before the historical crisis that was coming upon them. Then she adds, and this is precisely what Maurice call literature is about because there was a Maurisco literature.

Speaker 1:          30:29          It constitutes a literary monument to the collect collective effort to preserve at all costs, Islamic identity mortally wounded in the Spain of the golden age. It was an enormous effort because the basic elements of Islamic culture, the language, proper names, distinctive dress, religious ceremonies, even the Zumba dance had been strictly forbidden by numerous official decrees issued all along the 16th century or code she yards finally, but these very same Maurice course divided in the deepest recesses of their souls found themselves before a new dilemma. When Phillip the third decreed against them, the order of expulsion in 1609 they had not been allowed to become bona fide the Spaniards in their country of origin, but they did not have time either to become authentic Muslims during the first decades of their exile in Barbary, the Maurisco community went through two different processes of assimilation. Their Islamic identity had been torn from them forcibly in the span of a 16th and 17th centuries.

Speaker 1:          31:40          And when they finally in Marist in the process of assimilating themselves to official Spanish, they were forced by circumstances to begin another process. Now, the opposite, one of cultural assimilation. Encore, in other words, as you have read here, when they went back to their countries of origin, what countries of origin there were from Spain, they found that they were not, uh, uh, accepted in the Muslims communities where they thought that they would be, uh, uh, welcomed and where they would be able to blend themselves into the, into the mainstream. No, they were exiles again, uh, within their own people. They were in a no man's land. Uh, culturally speaking, this is the drama that recorded and his family is living through. And [inaudible] is mentioning here.

Speaker 1:          32:33          In short, what's Advantis accomplishes in the episodes involving ricotta is to provide a view the vision of the effects of political decisions made with concern for the nation as a whole on the people that are affected by those decisions. The normal is not a treatise on political philosophy nor is that a commentary on government policies. It is a medium through which the particular can be perceived in the lives of specific people. Of course, what's advantage is dealing with here is an issue that has affected that humanity since time in memorial and that would continue to affect it until the president til today, until the issues that we're facing in this country today, it is the presence of minorities within a body politics and how a state can deal with them without endangering its own existence. More broadly speaking, the issue is how nations and states define themselves negatively as that which they are not and try to wage wars against real or perceived enemies and cleanse their own population of potential internal enemies that maybe accomplishes of external ones.

Speaker 1:          33:52          This seems to be a content in human history and one can see its manifestations in the bible and classical literature. The modern history of abuses provoked by these tendencies is long and shameful from the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 to the extermination of millions of the, by the Nazi regime in Germany, in the Spain that we are studying. It was not only their Maurice course that did not fit within the homogeneous body of the nation. Gypsies convert souls and the people in regions such as Catalonia and Galicia who were out of sorts with the Castilian driven state, Catalonia Galicia of here. Uh, we have seen through the chaotic characters from other provinces like the bask, the Galicians, the historians. Spain is a country divided against itself and continues to be. So if not Google Eta the Basque terrorist group, the basket terrorist group that uh, whose activities center all over it.

Speaker 1:          34:57          But I mean they are in both, uh, uh, uh, uh, Spain on, uh, um, France, uh, because that's where Basque people live and have lived there since the beginning of time. They have no idea where their baskets came from. Their language is not in the European, they have no idea where it came from. A, so they are separate. It's uh, on, on, on the extreme group, the terrorist group ETA is a fearful fearsome to both the Spanish and the French state. Uh, Cervantes Hot Bay is the first substantial work of fiction that dramatizes this conflict. And the regard, the story is the most dramatic from the point of view of literature. The thing to keep in mind is that the conflict involving the expulsion of the Maurice Cosi seen in its particulars, not in general terms. And that is poignancy is due to the believability of the characters, especially recorded, but also in the tenderness, the neighborly solidarity that he and to display.

Speaker 1:          36:11          These are human qualities and emotions that are beyond political policies. And the novel will from now on, always be about them. This particular, not the general theories, so, so much for recording and Anna Feliks for the time being, we may have to return to them, but now little fall into the pit with central. Uh, I, uh, uh, I assume that you have read, uh, this, uh, wonderful, uh, chapter, uh, in which central falls into a pit, uh, which is a symmetrical episode two, the Montesinos Cave, uh, uh, adventure, uh, of his master Don Quixote. There is an internal parallel by means of which Cervantes parodies himself within part two. I had told you their episodes in part two that are repetitions of episodes within part two. This episode is a parody of them Montesinos Kate Cave, which was itself a parody of several ci Valerie episodes as well as, uh, others.

Speaker 1:          37:24          Uh, that'd be salting homer virgin on Plato. These lifts sanctuary kind of equality with his master. It is a funny one, but nevertheless, it is any quality with this master. It is to be noted. However, the central falls into the pit cave after losing his island fall of Troy, uh, an ess as dissent. Uh, there is a kind of pattern here. I have a series of quotes here that I want to gloss, uh, from, uh, an excellent article written jointly by Raymond McCurdy and Alfred Rodriguez. And, uh, I will quote them and glossed them as I did with the Lopez burnout as an internal parallel. They say the series of actions that we study, meaning the fall into the pit, uh, have exceptional characteristics. It is in the first place, the most prominent example of the deliberate parallelism that largely structures that Quixote, the parallel in which the obvious resemblance that strikes one is the set for common subterranean stay.

Speaker 1:          38:36          He's talking about the cave in Montesinos in this parallelism, the parallelism. He quotes, they quote one Marasco who says m. I. R. S. Oh, we notice the correspondence, the striking parallelism of cycles in part two and Chapman of Dulcinea, like the loss of Troy, the sent to Montesinos Cave. Uh, this, the infernal descent of a [inaudible] central banks are losers, is loss of Troy falls into a deep and very dark pit in third oldest sent. So you can see that they have all, they have noticed this parallelisms in great detail. They add the parallel that we're studying by offering it, offering a curious parody of a parody becomes a mirror that reflects the entire, that reflects their advantages entire creative process because this is a parody of a parody, the parody of Cervantes himself.

Speaker 2:          39:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:43          Cervantes. They say producers in with a central Pantheon adventure. Now you can make central bank sign an adjective, at least for the reader who picks up all the hints thrown by the novelist and innovative. And at the same time Snyder re parity double pouty. By doing this, the great novel is touches on purpose. The aesthetic limits of his own artistic procedure for would appear to be the limit of parodic creation, a limit insurmountable and innovative self parody that is more over at parody of a parody. This is the reaching deep into that series of images that are repeated deep into that mirror. We see each other in the barber shop as a little boy when you're reflecting over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Now we also notice now, uh, having abandoning Mokodean [inaudible], uh, that this episode, it involves this in Ganja. We just, which makes sense to even more reflective. And he no longer yearns for the island. Uh, he values more his service and his attachment to Don Quixote. He yearns for the intimacy of their relationship.

Speaker 1:          41:04          Now they are then because doc, you hope they fines Saint Joe because he has gone out to practice for this joust he's encounter, he's supposed to have. And by chance a hero Saint Joseph's laments, uh, and that encounter is going to be the one to restore Donya Rodriguez daughter's honor by having the young man, uh, uh, uh, uh, who promised to marry her and, and uh, compromise their honor. Uh, go ahead and marry her. So here we have, we go to that third of the topics I had mentioned in an instance, an instance of art influence in life. The prank organized by the Duke and his minions brings about the possible marriage of the young woman to the young man who plays the role of her strange fiance because it is no longer the real fiance who's involved, but it's someone who's playing the strange fiance. These adventure will turn out like the loft conflicts of part one that don Quixote salts, except that here the fiction is turned into reality.

Speaker 1:          42:10          Whereas in the Doterra Fernando Panda Philando affair, the giant is only symbolically slain fiction and reality are no longer separate in part to their part and parcel of each other. Fiction does not simply reflect reality. It affects, affects it, it affects it. Fiction and reality appear to be one and the same or in other words, reality is nature improved by art. In the episode we have again in marriage where social mobility is involved [inaudible] Rodriguez, his daughter was going to marry up economically because he's young man was alive, but the groom's proxy Tostinos isn't me or servant a lackey. She however concludes that is better to marry the not at all and accepts him in a, in a gesture of, of pragmatism that is completely at odds and funny, but it's completely at all through all of the notions of idealized love that we have here. She sees that the better to get married, uh, done not to be married at all in a situation in which you used.

Speaker 1:          43:12          And in the, in the context in which she finds herself, that is an echo here. I find that a very funny one, suddenly, uh, about the fights about to begin and this, this, this proxy a groom looks at the woman on falls in love with her and said, oh, I don't want to fight. I surrender. I'll marry her. And in the end she says, okay, I'll marry him, buried him that nobody and a, and this is what it's funny. So the fiction becomes the reality that is the fiction, whatever. It's very obvious that it's an echo here of Camacho's wedding. So in a sense, the 70 is also repetition of it let be sold in part to like, uh, Sanchez for, uh, in the cave of Montesinos adventure. But the point is that fiction has improved reality and this is a theme that is repeated in the next two episodes, or at least cost very briefly, but they are very significant.

Speaker 1:          44:13          The first and most commented about is when they find this images of [inaudible] Rick saints covered with sheets on the road. These episodes just remind people of the one towards the end of part one. When the penitents carry an image of the virgin remembering the procession and don't Quixote takes her to be a lady in distress here, us with the actors in the wire of death episode and uh, uh, he makes look here that makes no mistakes. Uh, actually he does a, uh, quite an area died. Uh, uh, a study of the image of a Saint George don't get halted, knows that these are representations clinics have seen in this episode echoes of the debates involving erass mutants and those was Protestant [inaudible] leanings about images and other devout representations in this episode. If you've read in the earlier and you know, uh, there was a whole debate about whether they should be religious images in the churches are not, of course, uh, the f the faction in favor of religious images, obviously one in Spain.

Speaker 1:          45:20          Uh, but there was a debate. It involve Erasmus too. Uh, but the point is that reality here appears to have turned into art. What he finds on the road are already representations of the saints are artistic images of the saints there. They're out there. The second episode, which I find most charming, he's going to be sad when Don Quixote is caught in a net in a green net that was set there among the trees to capture birds by this, uh, by these young ladies playing a being shepherded, says, and getting ready to perform an echoed by Gfsi Lasso. That port I've mentioned so many times in the semester, and that I hope you remember his name. A cloth is pastoral pawns. They're about, they're about to stage one of them. They have learned, uh, the lines and all of that. She says, and Oh, Quixote, uh, valves to stand in the middle of the road and defend them for however long it takes.

Speaker 1:          46:19          And, and, uh, so reality again, appears as art. Young women dressed, as shepherds says about to stage a, an heck log by the Great Garcia lastro. Notice that guns last one sport. It has to become a part of common discourse. It has improved common everyday discourse is young ladies want to represent his poetry. Gutsy Lasso. Remember 1501 1536 only 35 years you lived. But when he's spoke, his poetry was published in 1543 posthumously. It changed poetry written in Spanish, Spanish language forever until today. That's how important he was. But notice that his poetry has been incorporated into everyday life by this. Uh, so we conclude by talking about rocky generic.

Speaker 1:          47:14          Rock agnostic is a Catalan bandit who really existed and lack the Maurice cause. He brings out an international dimension to the novel. Bringing the edge of this kind was coming in Catalonia. There were bands of brigans like this, which the crown felt that it had to put down, not only because they were outlaws, but because they could become a competences of the French Huguenots. Now notice again the map we have here. Now location of the Maurice Course. We had the threat of the, uh, of, of Muslims across the, the Strait of Gibraltar here. Catalonians right next to France. And in some ways it's more French and Spanish, certainly more French than Castilian and the language and all of that, uh, and has been very successful. Just like the Basques do the two today, the Catalans, the Catalans think that they have their own culture, that you have their own nation, many of them do and so forth and so on.

Speaker 1:          48:19          And this and this, or this band, it's like a rock could be in cahoots with a French Huguenot. You're going not where the French Protestants, you get notes where the French Protestants with the Calvinist background, uh, who believed in the, they good attain salvation without the intervention of the church who believed in reading and interpreting scripture directly. Typically the things that these, the, the Catholic church rejected violently, especially from Spain. So Huguenots were dangerous also, Spain and France and France had been at all throughout the 16th century. So the French were no friends of the Spaniards. And so the Spanish crowd feared this, uh, Catalan bandage because they, they could be agents of the French Huguenot. Remember what I said about states defining themselves negative, what they are not or the Spanish crown was not was Protestant for sure, or not French and not muscling, but rocky. He not, he's a compelling attractive figure. Cervantes was fascinated by the autonomous world of the bandit and by his chivalry abandoned lack. Croaky invents himself on the margins of the law.

Speaker 1:          49:46          There is something romantic of aunt Lola in rocky. He anticipates the bandit figures who are heroes in 19th century, uh, normals, John Paul, Joan and all of the dollars. Ginardis a kind of Catalan Robin Hood who rubs the rich and helps those in need. He's Lawler's except within the very strict laws of his band. I you saw how strict they are. One of his, one of his associates questions to division of the booty and he'd be heads him. Um, in this respect, rocker is like money, Paul, the you, uh, and his brotherhood and bring Canadian quarterly. Yo. His band is an anti utopia that counter society as self enclosed world built from within itself is goodness possible within an outlaw society. Goodness always appears, possibly. Serratus. Remember Buddy Doremus who is good to others, she's kind to century and also reliable within the practices of her profession. Perhaps not about trade, even if her profession is being a prostitute, but she delivers, he's Canard and new exemplar of the heroic that's advantage can never stop dreaming about you see an exemplary manner.

Speaker 1:          51:11          Arms as opposed to amount of letters is Dennard donkey Hotez counterpart. Is he not a modern night errand of sorts is, isn't this what makes him attractive to Don Quixote? Notice that the tricky treat each other with respect. That donkey haughty knows about the existence of Ragnarok and rocky NART seems to have read or heard about part one of the Quixote because he also knows about a donkey hoppy. So, uh, there is a kind of self recognition parallel to the one we find in the episode with Cardinia. We're Gnocchi hold defines Gardenia. And they have that meeting where they looked at each other having the uncanny feeling that they, they know each other. And here we're not guilty meets rock in art. We have the same kind of recognition of mutual recognition. And, and, and I know you because I know myself kind of. So that is rocky nerd who makes possible donkey holders entry into Barcelona because this bandaid is in touch and has influence with the important people in the city of Barcelona. So, uh, uh, Doki holder gets it the kind of safe conduct from the band to enter the great city of Barcelona, but not before. We cannot conclude without mentioning an episode within the episodes of rock or you're not. And it's not about Claudia heroin, Nema, Claudia. Hey, don't EMA.

Speaker 1:          52:54          Claudia had only man in Claudia had on him. And we have yet another story, another love story with a lady in distress because her lover seems to not be willing to marry her because there is a class disparity or something. But Claudia had only my takes drastic action by killing her fiance. Don't be sending who's a potential don't Fernando who or in his death row swears that he has been the victim of, of, of, uh, of rumors that he has not unfaithful to cloud your heroin. In my, to late Claudia had only mom took care of him. Uh, uh, this is the one of these, uh, instead of Antin 17 women characters who, who, uh, who, uh, wants to, uh, to take her destiny into her own hands, she goes to a little too far here. Perhaps, uh, uh, it is a piece of the bullous they come at you because of the death scene, but with a different and very tragic ending here.

Speaker 1:          54:01          Uncharacteristically tragedy occurs before marriage, which is unusual tragedies in the golden age and Golding, each Spanish literature tend to happen after a marriage. And we don't know if it is just another instance of Cervantes taking episodes from part one where we even within part two and taking them one step further in the next class will be taken about are uh, talking about our protagonist arrival in Barcelona, also about [inaudible] spurious Quixote, which by now has appearance. Cervantes knows about it. And which resurfaces in the, in the, in the, in the scene of their visit to the printing shop. And also we will talk about Doki holders, final defeat. But I want, I want you to take, uh, uh, to pay special attention, uh, to LTC Laura's dream. I'll teach you Dora, is this, this, uh, uh, very, uh, uh, active young lady with an active imagination and proclivity to acting and all of that who has a marvelous dream, uh, in, in, in one of the episodes when, uh, Don Quixote and Saint Joe go back to the Duke and Duchess Paris. And, uh, it's a, it's an episode, her dream in which the whole issue of books will resurface again.
