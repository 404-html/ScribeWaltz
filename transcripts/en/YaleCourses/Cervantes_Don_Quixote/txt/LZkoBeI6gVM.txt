Speaker 1:          00:02          I want to begin by, uh, taking up some, uh, general questions, uh, concerning the Quixote matters, such as the difference between romance and novel. Because I know from the last lecture that you must, uh, be confused and it's good to know it other matters which are what, what is it she Valerie romance because you hear a lot about it and I'm sure and that very few people know, why don't you vote or romance was, uh, and uh, who were the, uh, Spanish precursors of Cervantes because I, I want to as much as possible, although in English to give you a said Vantis in his own sauce as it were, that is within the Spanish tradition as well as the European but also with, but within the Spanish tradition, uh, I do that to counter versions of the Quixote, uh, taught here at Yale in the English department and uh, uh, and directed studies and so forth valuable courses, but in which surrounds this is seen only in the context of Western literature.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So this is why I want to give, you sort of answered this as much as possible in his own salsa. I said were in its own sauce. Now I will begin by, uh, continuing, uh, on the issue of what one, why the Quixote, Eh, has continued to be, uh, to be read. Why it has had such common currency. I just learned yesterday that the detainees in one animal, uh, Cuba, uh, ask for the Quixote, first of all, uh, of all the books or they want to read. Now, I have offered the most common of answers about Hawaii. The Quixote is so current, the least a specialized, the one that I assume a general readers would understand about wanting to be all there and so forth that I spoke about in the last class. But Doki Haka is notoriously about literature covering the entire range of about, first and foremost is about the effect that literature has on its readers.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Don't Quixote goes mad because he reads too much literature. Literature fiction allows us to rehearse in private. Our most secret desires are effecting our lives as if these desires come true. Uh, it's like dreams, dreams of the same effect. This is its allure, the allure of literature. And also it's danger. We can live lives other than ours, full of adventures on Trammell by society's constraints and by our own limitations. Does doing that purchase of those desires, uh, or does it induce more desires, uh, and induce the desire to close the gap between desire and reality. But the hotter is also in addition about the creation of literature, the relationship each text has with this, with previous texts as well as about questions of Literary John, Huh. The Quixote appears at the end of the renaissance when improvements, uh, of the printing press that created a mass readership sorta speak mass readership, nothing compared to what we have today.

Speaker 1:          04:09          Uh, a mass readership for the first time in history and when the discovery analysis and imitation of classical TVCs, uh, on poetics had brought to the four questions about content and form as well as of ethics, public and private. As you know, the renaissance, uh, involved, uh, or renaissance humanists were interested in the classics, in reading the classics in the original, in, um, in editing the classics to make them available. What is secular literature good for? What is good literature? How do new ideas about reading and writing affect the interpretation of scripture is secular literature in the vernacular, a danger to faith, religious faith, leaky hot, the is full of writers and readers. You will meet them as you read the book of books, Stories, poems, and of people, young and old affected by literature. You would meet some very early Marcel [inaudible] customer [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:29          I'm sorry. Now in this vein about Don Quixote and the issue of literature is the originality of the donkey hotel story. The fact that it does not belong to any known tradition or cycle, be it from the pastoral or Chavarria or chivalry cycles. Uh, not to mention, uh, popular narratives or even mythology that is don Quixote is not based on a classical myth or, or a traditional, uh, story handed down orally. Techie. Hotter is a new story. Uh, Indiana servant. This boasts that it is new. It is no small accomplishment to set out, to write a narrative without precedents to make of individual invention. They're fundamental factor of a literary work. The divine comedy. Tell us an original story. Yet it is based on received popular and cultural traditions, the sense to hell, a sense to heaven and it calls and incorporates many stories from biblical and classical traditions that they can run by Boccaccio.

Speaker 1:          06:47          Some of you may have read it retells tales drawn from many popular and cultural sources to their same goes for of course, for the pastoral and the chivalric romances about which I will be speaking soon. But the story of a man who goes mad because he reads too much has only one known source and it is so trifling as as to be dismissed. Although the fact that it exists is of some importance. Uh, the very act of invention on sort of antithesis part is an important modern component of the work invention is the hallmark of modern literature.

Speaker 1:          07:35          Now, how could such a revolutionary work up here in Spain? I'm sorry to make this assumption, but your conception of Spain cannot be, but the result of the black legend. What is the black legend? The black legend is the bad press that Spain's enemies, uh, disseminated beginning in the 16th century. About the mistreatment of the Indians out about Spain's backwardness and brutality, uh, and, and, and, and so forth. Uh, your images, the inquisition, religious intolerance as certain primitiveness and backwardness. This is all embedded in the English language. You're going to, you cannot escape it. It is full of what we call factoids, things that are almost true but not quite. We call factoids derisively of course. Yet during the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain Produce Serantes Velasquez, the character of don't Huang the picaresque or figures, uh, authors or kinds of writing that are at the core of the modern western tradition. How could that be? So the key hot, they aided by Elliot Imperial's pain, which you are, I hope dutifully reading will help dispel these perceptions as well as my comments in the course.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Now, let me clarify as much as possible the confusion about terms such as novel and Romance, that confusion that is augmented by the fact that they don't quite coincide with their cognates in Spanish. Cognates are a words in two different languages at sound, the same, uh, but then sometimes, uh, are not the same, uh, uh, in meaning. So romance is a term derived from the name Rome of course, meaning that originally these were works written in the languages derive from Latin, that is French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and so forth. So those are the importance that those begin with the Webster's definition for romance. It says originally along narrative inverse or pros written in one of the romantic dialects. It says in Webster's, remember what I said about language and dialect. The language is a dialect with an army, meaning that, uh, people who speak a certain dialect become powerful enough and imposed it on the rest of the population.

Speaker 1:          10:24          So originally a written in one of the romance dialects about the adventures of nights and other to evaluate heroes to a fictitious tail dealing not so much with everyday life, us with extraordinary adventures or mysterious events. That's the western definition of romance. A popular dictionary of literary terms gives the following, uh, for Romance Romance, a fictional story in verse or prose that relates improbable adventures of idealized characters in some remote or enchanted setting or more generally a tendency in fiction opposed to that of realism. Uncle. Now etymologies are fun, but they don't always clarify what a word means in the present. And in fact, sometimes words works. Uh, the tamales work against such a clarification. How many know, or how useful is it to know that candidate? The word candidate, for example, derives from the Latin word, can be reduced for Hawaii, doesn't help you in the present to know that at all helped you be pedantic if you tell somebody or if you bring it up in, uh, in that, uh, in that party that I always mention here at which a Yaley can be pedantic by saying candid derives from Kunduz in Latin, which means what?

Speaker 1:          11:53          Um, or that is a very tough guys story that you've told me in any case, uh, in, in this case, knowing that the term romance, the rise from Rome and that, um, that it, that it indicates that these stories were written in the romance languages. It does provide a historical insight. Romances emerged after the breakup of the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages as the various national languages are quiet individual identities. So it, so we have now a historical period that the etymology, romance gifts, so in English romance beans, a story with the linear plot and on changing characters want to be sold to follows another. And the heroes and heroines remain the same. This is the reason, uh, romances of chivalry are cold romances. The romance form is preferred by popular fiction. And by works with an ideological indoctrination purpose, they are easy to follow and their moral is clear. Many cartoons, for instance, uh, have the form of a romance cartoons, comic books, novels. On the other hand, our works in which there is a clash between the characters, the protagonist, and the settings in which they move. Remember the quotation from Luke acts in my earlier lecture,

Speaker 2:          13:40          uh,

Speaker 1:          13:41          and in which the characters evolve as the result of the actions in which they are involved. Characters and the romances don't change. They're always heroic and so forth. Characters in the novels do change, uh, evolve, uh, uh, because of, of the actual, now, Vicky is the first such a case of this clash between the protagonists on his, uh, uh, uh, setting. Uh, uh, although an argument can be made in favor of the picaresque on a work that I'll be mentioning today. Again, I mentioned it in the last class, last Ellis Celestina already, uh, uh, has that clash between protagonist and setting and there's change and characters evolve, but the Quixote is the first, uh, it's the first, uh, case. Uh, now I think, and I hope now we have, I hope a clear terminological distinction between normal and romance. And you will understand when I speak about them. Now get confused when we know that in English, picturesque stories are often called romances. This is particularly among English department types. Um, while in Spanish we call him, we called them no [inaudible] novels. I will always refer to picaresque tales as novels because they are, uh, they are according to the definitions that have given up off. Now, if you know Spanish, you may be further confused by the fact that girl Muncie in Spanish is a ballad and narrative. Originally popular porn, like the English balance.

Speaker 2:          15:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:34          So you must keep these distinctions clear in mind. If you happen to read something in Spanish and you hear and he read Romancing, it is not a romance in the sense that I've been explaining it is a pawn. Yeah. What was it? That donkey haughty. So avidly wanted to become, let me clarify too. What did you valid romances were, because this is something that is taken for granted everyone or devalued, no less. That does clarify. I like to clarify things and to start from the ground up. What is it that don't be hot? They want it to become, what is this whole business of the romances of chivalry?

Speaker 1:          16:22          First as I did with the term the romance, then we clarified the background of the word ci, Val, Rick, she valid. Rick comes from the French word Chevelle or horse and it reflects the fact that the knights form of transportation was the horse. What does French up to do with English? Well, William the conqueror, the battle of Hastings, the invasion of England by the French and all of that, which you learned in, uh, elementary school or high school, uh, on the fact that English to French is one of the sources of, uh, of modern English. So, uh, but the horse was more than just a form of transportation. It was an instrument of warfare, a prize possession with each having a sonorous name, if at all possible. The horse work was part of the knights identity,

Speaker 1:          17:24          hence the whole business about naming his horse at the beginning of the Quixote. Now you understand that part, uh, of the, uh, uh, culture of horses. Was it kind of courtesy? Uh, so, uh, we have in English also, uh, uh, chivalrous for instance, horses have always spawned a whole culture of their own and have Laura left a large imprint on languages because there were the, the, the, the, the principal mode of transportation to the part of the 20th century. You can imagine. So, uh, so technically a etymology clichy Valerie [inaudible] is a horsey romance or more appropriately romances about horsemen.

Speaker 1:          18:18          Uh, in Spanish, the etymology is clearer as the romances of chivalry are simply goal. Nobody, Dick [inaudible] and [inaudible] is the workforce for horse in Spanish now evaluate the romances or in Spanish? No, as they go by and he asked where the popular literature over the late Middle Ages and early renaissance who's dissemination was greatly aided by the development of print. I'm talking about the 14th and 15th centuries. The printing presses or you don't doubt? No doubt. No. What's developed in the 15th century making available to many readers books, including the Bible, which only a very few had access before we had a copy of the Gutenberg Bible in our own Beinecke library. If you went to go look at it now, this development of the printing press had a decisive impact on literature because it increased, its different, it's this dissemination, so the Quixote and the knoll in general owe their existence to this invention.

Speaker 1:          19:29          As we can see by the impact, the romances of chivalry hat on our hero and the large number of them that he had in his library. If you've got really chapter on the scrutiny of his love, the library, the romances of chivalry, where the first best sellers, they are entertaining. And I encourage you to read one or two if you have, uh, if you have time, uh, now that you valued romances originated in France and do you ride from the homeowner or courtly romance? Coahoma Google in French [inaudible], uh, eventually became the name for novel, but go home and Cook Twat or courtly romance was the narrative inverse, which was the favorite of feudal lords, no longer engaged in military exploits who looked back with nostalgia to a heroic age. The same as don Quixote will. The Hemanchu Twan took it steams from classical legends such as the Trojan wars or the exploits of Alexander the great even Oriental Tales, but it preferred themes derived from Britain legends, legends from Brittany such as that of Tristan and Isolde.

Speaker 1:          20:50          The nights in pursuit of the holy grail grail like Parsifal and Maryland and Lancet road or Arthurian tales about Arthur, the real or imaginary King of Britain and the knights of the round table. You have heard about all of these. All of these adventures take place in a fantastic atmosphere, shrouded in a vague kind of lyricists and poetry. When these hormone trois, remember embarrassed and so forth, were turned into prose narratives. The romance that you've all read romances appeared each of these books. How does a hero in knight errant that incarnated heroism, Hammertoe, fidelity, and what's the defender of justice and of the oppressed? The night was involved in the most extraordinary adventures against fantastic and frightening wrongdoers. He's passionate love for an idealized lady dominated. He's thought love was a fundamental component of these narratives. The night would offer to his lady. The glory of his fix. This love for a lady is the same as courtly love, which as you may know, is buyer the medieval lyric.

Speaker 2:          22:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:08          And, uh, what's a fashion, uh, involving all sorts of rituals, uh, in the courts of elegant ladies? Uh, it's too long a story to be told, but, uh, think that the, the romances of jewelry are, uh, uh, uh, a shot through as it were, with the idea of, of, of courtly love. This, we're not just a military heroes, but they were also great lovers in Spain. They were, uh, two notable antecedents do the romances of chivalry in the 15, the in the 14th century [inaudible] see far, but these are should not concern, concern during the 14th century, all of the European books of chivalry were disseminated in Spain, uh, in, uh, adaptations and translations, particularly those of the blood tone or cycle. The most significant chivalry romance in terms of circulation and influence as well as impact on the Kihatha was ama. This the gala about which you will hear and read a lot throughout this semester because he is don't be hopeless chief model.

Speaker 2:          23:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:33          Which was first it was written around 1492. That'd be rocky year when so many things happened. Uh, but was published in 1508 in Saragossa. It is known that there were stories about, I'm Elisa Qa dating as far back as the early 14th century and Montalvo who has its author, uh, estates in the prologue that he took the story written by several authors, divided it into four books and recasted it, adding a few touches and a fifth book about planned young and Melissa's son, the chivalric romances current did have many sequels, much like today's soap operas and television, and responding to the same kind of demand from the public. Uh, this could end here. We want more, more, I'm at least adventurous. We want, I'm a decent sons at ventures and so forth. Uh, in fact, all popular fiction, uh, from, uh, Sherlock Holmes to James bombed, uh, is sequential in this fashion, which is the reason why soap operas are derisively called in Spanish Cooler Varonis from lever I snake because it's a snake that goes on and on and on.

Speaker 1:          24:48          And so this was the way that the romances of chivalry, as you saw, uh, if you have, if you read the chapter on the scrutiny of the library, the MIDC is a very free and application of novels from the Britain Cycle. It is a complex network of the most varied and marvelous adventures. Uh, it tells the story of his, uh, of his birth, uh, virtually in the river because he's thrown in the river from which he is. I said, baby, uh, to hide his mother's sin because a, they were not married. His parents are where a king and a queen. And, uh, uh, he's, he's rescued and trained us. I say, uh, uh, uh, as a night, uh, in, in combat. Uh, then he, he falls in love with Arianna. Arianna becomes his beloved. So I'm at least an Ariana is one of the great couples of literary, uh, history.

Speaker 1:          25:44          He is put through all kinds of, of trials, uh, on the, he's enchanted and disenchanted. Uh, and he is a most loyal and faithful of lovers against all temptations from various, uh, uh, uh, a lady's, uh, in fact, he, uh, is, uh, forced, uh, to go, uh, through the arch of faithful lovers, uh, which could only be crossed by lovers who had been absolutely faithful. Uh, so how many people can go through it, uh, and, and so forth. This is what is in Tokyo, this imagination and desires, this figure, uh, of this invincible, a hero who's noble on a great a lover. Uh, and, uh, this book was so important in the 16th century, uh, that it'd be good, acquire it didactic value. I mean, it was a, uh, use as a model for department, uh, and for courtesy even more so. It's, it's, we're past the model for a courtly behavior, uh, which was written by a great it Hallean writer called Baldassarre. Castiglione. [inaudible] is one of, uh, several, uh, uh, important renaissance figures that you're going to be hearing about here. His last name is written like this.

Speaker 2:          27:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:20          And his book is called the courtroom and it was published in 15, 28. Uh, it, it, it was a very important book. Uh, but the Ama, this was much more fun to read and therefore in soar past got Costa units book as a source of, uh, models for department, for people in the courts. Um, so

Speaker 2:          27:46          yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:47          it is for all these reasons, it's not the Ama Lisa chief great success. I'm on the greatest in Spanish literature and many express their amelioration for it in gray, including great political, uh, an intellectual, uh, figures. It was for the readers of the time, the only possibility for innovation, the only food for their fantasy, the romances of jewelry were in the 16th century. What movies and television shows are for us today. But the romances and Amaris in particular had their detractors. Spoilsports are everywhere all the time. Who saw in such book a threat to public morals. Uh, they became a topic of debate. And this is behind the role. I'm at this place in the Quixote. And the reason why I said Avantis says that he writing his book, uh, against them to, uh, uh, make fun of them in such a way that people will not read them anymore.

Speaker 1:          28:47          He's entering the, supposedly the debate about the value or lack there off of the romances of, of Ho, of jewelry. So No, I hope you have a clearer idea of what it was a donkey halted, wanted to become. So it's not vague. What he wants to please is clearer and concrete. I suppose in modern day Don Quixote would like to be James Bond, um, because we have to assume a modern Alonzo Kiano to be middle aged and to have grown up with, uh, uh, James Bond as the, as the image of, of, of heroism. I read that, that, uh, Senator Kennedy in the last hours of his life or days, uh, would watch bond movies for entertainment. Obviously for a man of his age, a James Bond was the, the, the, the, the we of heroism and the devil, Nah. Or good looking, all the women fall for him and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          29:49          So if you, I guess maybe your parents or your grandparents, not you, if you want it to become like you hoped they would, they would want to be a, uh, a James Bond. Now I'm at least was the most obvious and allowed by Serantes precursor of the Quixote in Spanish, but what were, uh, set Vantis his predecessors among a more serious Spanish, uh, literary work, which were the, the Spanish works. That's the rant. This had red absorbed, uh, incorporated into his own literary, uh, uh, uh, project. I have mentioned some of these. I want to mention them again because I want to lay the groundwork in the most thorough way possible so that, you know, uh, the first was last sale Stena, which I mentioned in the last class. Uh, now it has several titles, but I think I settled for less. Ellis Tina, which is from 1499 written by Fernando.

Speaker 1:          30:59          Hurdle hus is of indeterminate jaw. The closest description would be a dramatic dialogue. Last Ellis Tina is the most significant precursor to survive this. It is a tragic story of two lovers, two young lovers Callisto in Maryvale who comes to make their love under the guidance of a go between the protagonist Sally's Tina [inaudible] and all whore madame of a whorehouse and which, but in spite of these unsavory characteristics, she is the heroine of the work. This is the most, uh, original, uh, aspect of this work that the protagonist is an old whore go between which and so forth. Still, she is the heroine in the sense that use willful and uh, and uh, goes to, it goes against the fate. And now there is a clear, a clash between neoplatonic notions of love, typical of the, uh, of the renaissance and, and the court integration and the sordid and cynical view of humankind and of love in particular, Celestina controls the whole city because she controls people's erotic, uh, adventures.

Speaker 1:          32:18          There are two worlds, not have salad, Stena the servants and horse and, uh, that of the lovers Calisto and many ways parents, we tried the gentry. So there is also a class clash here. Calisto Jackie Haldane they're making because he wants to play act. The role of the courtly lover he's killed when he falls off a wall. The wall of cell garden where he has been making love to her, uh, cell is the billionaire commit suicide on Selestica is murdered by the servants because she has swindled them to, uh, sell Latinos a pitiless book that, uh, with what can already be called a, a realistic, uh, quality. I'll talk about realism in a minute. The second important work is the other one that I mentioned, but I want to now mention more clearly lovey. They last Saturday,

Speaker 2:          33:19          Nelson Lasa Bdo,

Speaker 1:          33:24          they totally miss. This is the first picaresque novel, no known author. Uh, it is, uh, the life told to a judge as in a deposition by a petty criminal to justify his current status. He at the end, from the perspective that he writes, is married to the arch mistress. So he is a front, he's a couple. The husband who is compliant with societies, he park reeses, uh, Lossa your tells his life from birth to the present. What he writes. This is a life, a scene from the perspective of a low class individual, a criminal who learned his tricks from his first master who was ironically a blind man. Guzman. They'll farace. I won't give you the whole title, but this is good enough because this is how it is known is the second most important picaresque novel that I want to Minster.

Speaker 2:          34:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:27          [inaudible] 15, 54

Speaker 1:          34:33          g nine to nine before Guzman got Russia, uh, is a four part Pawlik stale of a criminal toll in the first person also following the formula. But the difference is that here, the life is, is told after a religious conversion to the good. So the story of Guzman's life is laced with sermons about where he went wrong and ways to improve his morals. But this retrospective moralizing is always tempered by the appeal of the stories about sin. Sin Is more interesting always. Guzman became the model picaresque instead of anthesis time. Um, there are clear allusion steward in the hotel. This is why you can see the genealogy within the Spanish tradition. Now what these words works, a show is the emergence and development of realism as we know it. And we should be continued in the work of Servantez, particularly Vicky Haughty and a lead all the way through to the 17th and 18th century or 19th century novels. I mean, here, this is the beginning of realism. Uh, its emergence in my view, has a great deal to do with the Catholic kings about whom you're reading. And Elliot, the formation of a new modern state with a, with a large bureaucracy and, and a very, uh, large, also peanut, uh, uh, not only peanut cultural but penal institutions to punish this, uh, uh, uh, this, this, this criminals, um,

Speaker 1:          36:14          a Spanish criminologist called Rafael Sally just in the 19th century, link's the picker risk with the birth of the social sciences. He thinks that in the picaresque and in this kind of novel, we have the beginnings of the study of society as criminology, sociology, and so forth, would study it in later centuries. But this is the origin.

Speaker 2:          36:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:41          Here in this, uh, in this work that is a search for truth about human nature. In, so in the social commerce of people at the lowest possible levels where civilization as it were, has barely reached.

Speaker 1:          36:58          Uh, there is an emphasis on the material and the sordid in this works against neoplatonic conceptuals of, of humankind that are more typical of the renaissance, the sordid, the ugly, the dirty becomes aesthetically valuable and appealing in this realistic works in the behavior of the characters, uh, their actions, uh, and also, uh, their attitudes. The point is that this sort of probe into the social is an attempt to uncover a truth about the human no longer available in the ancient classical literature or its imitators in the renaissance. It goes against that kind of version of the human.

Speaker 2:          37:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:51          This is too complicated, but it is, but we'll get to it. As semester evolves, it is, uh, uh, rejection parallel to that of the car as he formulates his philosophy of the self when he sort of erases, received, uh, to tradition. Uh, but, uh, I will leave that, I'll put that in the back burner and we will get to it eventually. In realism, common common objects. You will see common objects in the Quixote appear frequently. This begins, we sell is Tina and uh, but it's, it's, but it's a world mostly of the picaresque through which Don Quixote passes the characters. Accessories, uh, are what endowed description of this world with an aura of reality. What did what, what they have, uh, Sanchez wine skin for instance, uh, and so forth. Uh, liberals look for such common objects as you read Dicky Halter, you will see there is a focus on them.

Speaker 2:          38:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:56          This is a parallel to a development in painting, which began with the work of Leo Battista Alberti known as Alberti. I'll just do this in passing, but I will allude to it more during the semester.

Speaker 2:          39:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:12          You wrote a treatise called the peak Tuta in very simplistic terms for Albertie nearly invented was the sense of perspective. That is that that objects up here, uh, in different sizes with, uh, depending on where they are in reference to a pawn, the fleet boom to the vanishing point in English, it'll come to me. And so you understand objects according to Albert t a r to appear in painting, not flat,

Speaker 2:          39:53          uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          39:55          as they appeared in medieval painting board in relation to how they appear to the observer and how they are arranged according to perspective hands, objects appear now in all their fullness when all there, the roundness in all their weight and measure. This is a form of realism that begins in painting. Deputy Tuta is from 1435, 15th century. Uh, Albert teak, a harder, an enormous influence on the history of painting part on, on philosophy too. I mean this was a way of conceiving the perception of objects. Also subject to time because, because perspective in space involves also extensive of time. If something is back here and something is here, this is closer, I can get to it faster than I get to that. If you understand what I mean. So this, this is a now this is if you, if you have seen Velasquez paintings, I'm sure some of you have, you will, you will remember how those objects are, are uh, uh, just common everyday objects. Suddenly how, um, a full miss now, this is what will appear in these novels in the cortex. And this is part of the development of, uh, of, of, of realism.

Speaker 2:          41:20          Now, uh,

Speaker 1:          41:23          you will see that the, yeah, this is a cliche about Spanish, uh, literature of the Golden Age, 16th, 17th century. What will prevail. It's a between this realistic conception of vision of the world and the idealistic a conception, uh, uh, uh, that comes through the neoplatonic tradition. And that is the Taro say embodied in donkey hotel. Okay. Hottest an ideas perspective. And Sanctuary is the realistic perspective. A sanctuary is close to the material, to the world, materials that he wants to eat if he possibly can. Uh, while Don Quixote doesn't eat meat, doesn't need to eat, he lives in a world of ideas, but of course they influence each other. Uh, as you will see, this is one of the great, uh, uh, uh, things about the [inaudible] that this character's influence each other. So we could say that that is overall the overarching clash in this works of Spanish literature.

Speaker 1:          42:19          But keep in mind above all the what I've said about realistic, because realism will be one of the triumphs of serve anthesis work. Now let us finally turn to the Quixote. I assume, and I hope that you have read at least the first few chapters and that by the next lecture you will have read the first 10 chapters as well as the assigned readings in the case book, which will give you a background. I said Lantus is life that I'm not giving you here. Uh, as well as other, uh, materials. And of course, the first chapter in Elliot, which I think is now the prologue, the prologue, this 16 or five priorities. One of the most important and famous texts in Spanish literature and products are very important always for Savantas. Why? Because of his concern about the relationship between creator and his creation. And he's concerned about the nature of the self, his own self, which is a very renaissance preoccupation, said Advantis products are very much like montañas essays. Now I've mentioned Castiglioni. Uh, I've, I've now I mentioned Montanian, these are great renaissance figures that in the context of which advantage road, and you have to remember the custom Yoni Montagnier.

Speaker 2:          43:46          Uh,

Speaker 1:          43:48          and it is here that on introduces one of his favorite tropes, one that runs through the whole of the Quixote irony. Uh, this is a very ironic prologue. Uh, we just conveyed through a very seductive kind of self deprecation instead of aunties.

Speaker 2:          44:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:11          Uh, [inaudible] begins, I don't reader Jarvis, miss translates this gentle reader in your translation, but it's there. So Paolo, like Tor, uh, I don't read her, said vantage assumes a reader who comes to his book for entertainment, not instruction and who reads for not for work. This is a novelty and a kind of challenge in a period when the function of literature was very much an issue discussed by secular and religious moralists. But we soon see that was advantage means by entertainment does not preclude consideration of very thorny ethical issues that involve reading and literature in general. Uh, this, these issues emerge immediately in the prologue. It is typical of Cervantes and you can expect to see it in the rest of the work, uh, to deal lightly and humorously with weighty issues. This is one of his constituents. He's able to deal with Larry grave issues in a very light and humorous way. That is his perspective. It's part of is ironic perspective. Now the prologue, oh look what comes first. It's a kind of epilogue. Uh, it was written, uh, obviously, uh, after he finished the book. This is, uh, you cannot take for granted the sequential order of things as you read them. They are sequential in a conventional way. It doesn't mean the product that's the vantage. Sat down, wrote the prologue and then wrote the novel he wrote in Oval and then wrote the prologue to ponder about what he had just finished.

Speaker 1:          45:53          Now there is a, in, in the, in in the prologue, a tone of a prevailing theme of doubt, which is again, an echo of, uh, of Montana. Uh, now pass. This explains the self deprecating statements about his own creation and inventive powers. You know, that they are weak and that what else could he produce? And so forth. At the very first paragraph where he belittles himself, uh, it is very much like Montagnier because when 10 years stance is very modern Montagnier rights with the resignation of knowing that he will never out to do the classics. By the way, there is a, there is a very instructive piece of Montana in the latest New Yorker in the latest New Yorker. I mean, don't, 10 is still very relevant, uh, on, uh, speaks to the modern, uh, mine. Um, he writes with the resignation of knowing that he will never do the classics, that he will never really know the truth even about himself.

Speaker 1:          46:58          And that received knowledge is of dubious value. For instance, he and his famous essay called uncanny balls, he asks what business the Europeans have an imposing. Their religious doctors are natives of the new world who had been getting along just fine with their own beliefs. And he says that it is worse school to roast people alive as Europeans do to torture them, done to roast them once they're there and eat them. Um, and uh, of course he's, he's right about, about that. Uh, he's a relativist in a post Copenhagen, a world in which I'm still talking about Montana in which we know that the earth is not the center of universe pence, human kindness at the center, either in the way that it was believed to be before in his prologue. 70 sounds very much like long tenure. Who, if it was not a source, it was clearly a kindred spirit. They were both hamlet like in their display of doubt. Of course, Shakespeare had red mom Pena.

Speaker 1:          48:02          Now who is this friend who suddenly appears in the prologue? Of course it's a made up friend, is a, is a, is that an imaginary friend that's a randos invents a on to turn the prologue into a story, uh, and uh, in which is going to discuss how to route right a prolo while writing the prologue. And that is the, the whole joke behind this was a big joke. Uh, so the, this was fun. Both of telling stories rather than expounding on doctrine and have dialogue. He loved dialogue, uh, uh, of having a topic discussed from various points of view. This will be throughout the whole of the chaotic. And we have it already in the prologue. He has a dialogue with his imaginary friend is having a dialogue with himself and he's created this thing as we do occasionally, you know, create an imaginary friend or someone with whom we speak on, which is just a virtue and another version of ourselves.

Speaker 2:          49:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          49:04          Different points of view. A savant Savantas likes these things that are being discussed from different points of viewers. You will see, uh, now the main, the main topic of the prologue is the genesis and intention of the book. Uh, a common topic for a prologue only that here it is told as the issue of how to write a prologue is discussed. Uh, there is, uh, no, there is an apparent contradiction here at the beginning said, when says this book could be other than my black myself because I'm his father. Then he says, no, I'm the stepfather by which he means that is merely merely the transcriber of this book by see the unmetered billing. Kelly is fictitious morrish author about whom you will hear a lot in the book. Uh, this is the first of many disclaimers of authorship in the Quixote. Uh, what Cervantes is probing here is the genesis of literature, the genealogy of invention, which can no longer be taking it for granted as following the rules of, uh, of renaissance poetics.

Speaker 1:          50:14          In what way does a book belonged to its author? This is why I said Vantis marks the usual front matter of other books in which authors boast of their area, audition and others to attest to the quality of the production. They, the whole business that is talking about all these sonnets that he could have asked other people to write for him and so forth. By the way, those songs exist in the book and the left out of the, uh, of the translation, the front matter in a book is everything from the title all the way to the beginning of the book prologue, preface, acknowledgement. It's called the front matter loss, preliminaries in Spanish. If you want to learn that in Spanish, uh, this, uh, this, um, sonnets about the book in praise of the book or like today's Blurbs, you pick up a book and you find that there are some blurbs.

Speaker 1:          51:04          Roberto, Sally, Julia says there is a praise and what has happened is that, uh, the, the, the person blurbing the book, uh, has been one of the readers will the press to accept or another book and then they ask you to, uh, to excerpt something from your report and put her in the back. All our times they just send you the book and say, please, would you write a blurb blurb for this book? Many people are in many people who do it without reading the book. Oh, one of the greatest, you know, and they just write. So it's the same here. This is what said, this is marketing. But what he does is instead of going outside for legitimation, he has literary characters, right? The sonnets in praise of his book. It's as if I wrote a book and I, and I had a, a blurb from James Bond to, to continue with our, with our fictional character.

Speaker 1:          52:00          What is doing is showing that literature is solved, the legitimating, he's not going outside of fiction and excited of literature for legitimation, but it's using this literary characters to be those who, uh, place. Uh, the book is another game, another, uh, a joke that he is playing on the river. So what else does the, what does the, the friend tell him to do? The friend tells him to make up his own sonnets and also to make up a false bibliography. I said Guerra and put on the margins, all of these sources that he never, uh, consulted, uh, as if you created a false, we don't have a fee for a paper that you've written. Uh, he says, yeah, what? This, this is a, this is a joke. It's very amusing joke, but it's also very serious. What the, what the friend is telling Saran disease.

Speaker 1:          52:55          Forget about tradition. Forget about Aristotle. Aristotle never wrote about romances of Jibo. You're doing something new. You can just make it all up. This is what the prior August, that kind of money festival for the kind of book that they Quixote's the kind of original new book that it is, that it can break with tradition. The brentech make it all up. I hope you don't take this seriously yourselves in your own big geographies when write your papers. But this is nick. This is the advice that different gifts. He says, Oh, I thought that you were Weiss. No, what you have to do is this and that is now there are digs there and low pay. The they guy, remember I mentioned him in an earlier class Lopei who was a very successful playwright. He was rich, famous and vain. And uh, as a rant, this is taking a dig at him because apparently Lopei got himself some the sorrows compendia of quotations, familiar quotations and use them in his works to make, uh, to make it seem like he was very erudite and learn it and not, I also added the Gay Lopez.

Speaker 1:          54:07          They, they got to his last name to make it seem as if we were an aristocrat. You know, the D in Spanish, in French, Spanish or German, Vaughn, uh, indicates, uh, aristocracy. So he's taking a dig at Lopez and data in terror. Lobeck lobby was just saw successful, successful and lobby had also said a few disparate and thing about. But all of that is to sort of contingent important thing in the prologue. Is that the same way with tradition? I'm beginning here a new, I can make it up. That is the whole point of the, uh, now, uh, I am going to end by simply alluding to the beginning of the book. The birth of Don Quixote is an act of self invention by a man of 50. At the age 50 was a very advanced age. Age expectancy didn't go beyond late thirties, early forties, at the time.

Speaker 1:          55:03          So, uh, this is also conventional with Savannah is his own age. He's in his late fifties. When he publishes his book. He says that in the prologue, uh, it says lack of self invention. My amount of 15, he feels free to create himself beyond family. We don't know anything. We don't learn anything about Don Quixote is family. Only about his niece. But we learn anything about his, his parents know about his birth, know about his needs. No. Uh, Cervan Cervantes has created a hero who is beyond Freud, uh, beyond Freud's family romance. You know, and Freud's theories, the family romance is Mommy, Daddy, and the child. The boy is in love with Miami and all of that. That is the family romance. And you go through life with a resentment of daddy or your love or secret love for money and all of that. That's the family romance.

Speaker 1:          56:01          This is, this is a mock version of Freud, but Cervantes says character is born beyond Freud. When you're 50, who cares about your parents and all of that. You are who you are. And not only is he who hears, but he wills himself to be something else at the age of 50. It is important that donkey, how to be that old is, can you think of another literary hero who is that old cell? Stina but she was, she had a US co protagonist, the two young lovers, but now protagonists were either men in their full strength, like Ulysses. An Ia is, uh, the pilgrim in the divine comedy. I think it's three, three, uh, the, not an old land. Uh, why? Because it's his self invention is an act of will based on nothing isn't beyond all of the pressures of family and of need. And this is why he can invent himself. Uh, Doki holders, drew family and genealogy is the books that he read.
