Speaker 1:          00:01          Today, I'm going to talk about the transition from part one to part two of the, uh, Jihadi, um, our transition not serve and this is a transition, uh, remember, uh, that he didn't know for sure that he wasn't a right a second part. Of course when he wrote the second card, he knew for sure that he had written part one and it is a, uh, a transition for us, uh, and also a transition in his life, uh, but not one that was envisioned when part one was being conceived. I underline that fact. I have said several times because the illusion is created that it is one book by the fact that it is all bound together. You will see today, uh, that uh, are quite different as books because we will be seeing the title pages, uh, of them. Um, I would begin by reviewing what I call the grand themes of, uh, criticism, uh, regarding part one before moving on to part two.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Now the first of those grant themes, number one is ambiguity and perspectivism. This is a review session, uh, as it were, uh, Leo Spitzer, whom you will be meeting in a week or so when you read his, uh, uh, very fine piece in the case book called linguistic perspective is in Minto. Quixote, uh, says the following. Uh, I want to do, you're going to talk about his conclusions. We will talk more about, uh, how he comes to those conclusions after you have read, uh, his, his piece. But I need to go over his conclusions. Uh, he says this means that in our novel mean Nikki Haughty things are represented not fort why they are in themselves, but only as things spoken about or thought about. And this involves breaking the narrative presentation into two points of view. There can be no certainty about the own broken reality of events.

Speaker 1:          02:09          The only unquestionable truth on which the reader may depend is the will of the artist who chose to break up a multivariant reality into different perspectives. In other words, per perspective is him suggests an archimedean principle outside the plot. And the Archimedes must be Servantez himself, meaning the archimedean principle, the focus, the center of the Fulcrum is Cervantes himself who has created this perspectives. He adds a Spitzer outs and we may see in Cervantes is two fold treatment of the problem of nicknames, which has studies in great detail in his article. Another example of his baroque attitude, we will be talking about the Baroque, uh, extensively in the next few lectures. He's baroque attitude. What is true, what is a dream? This is one of the topics of the Baroque. This time continuous Spitzer toward language is not human language. Also, Vanita Vanitas, Vanny tattoo vanity of vanities is quoting of course a scripture that's the end of Spitzer.

Speaker 1:          03:17          And we saw that CD Echo Morang Aroyo who's a name you have heard, uh, before, uh, what, what he said about irony, I'm repeating a quote that you heard in a previous lecture. He says, I agree with spitzers definition of servant Ian perspectivism and now he quotes Spitzer, who says, in terms of morals, Cervantes is in no way a perspective is, does the end of the spitter quote within the Merona Royer quote in a note, more on a Rodeo continues. He has, perhaps we ought to point out here, this is CDR core Bordonaro you perhaps we are to point out here that perspectivism is inherent in two Christian thought. Uh, prospective ism is in the sense of a form of modesty that recognizes the limits of all judgment and human knowledge is indeed a Christian humility and intelligence, uh, in the strictest sense, the capacity to perceive the limit of our own creations.

Speaker 1:          04:21          And then he uses the Greek word for irony, irony. So perspectivism this partial view that creates, is irony and so forth. Moron earlier underlines is a very Christian perspective. I would add that the, the self assurance of the renaissance, uh, is being eroded, uh, on the ordered cosmos of the Middle Ages, uh, has long disappeared. Uh, now that is the, the first of the grand themes, uh, ambiguity, perspectivism and so forth. The second of the grand themes is that the self can impose its will on reality, but only to a certain extent. I'm the self is defined. That self is defined by the agonistic struggle to do so to input between postage. Well, on reality, uh, we, uh, uh, Captain Ahab in Melville's, Moby Dick is the most obvious modern example in fiction. And also of course, an air of donkey hope. The Melville was a great reader of Cervantes.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Uh, remember in this context of imposing our will on reality. Uh, what I said about, uh, how we invent our beloveds when in love that is part of this, uh, of this willful imposition, uh, of ourselves on, on reality. Um, now why is doubt such an integral part of what we could call the aesthetics of the, uh, how can doubt be a positive value? The book gives of substance, uh, to the sense of doubt brought about by the scientific discoveries and philosophical ideas of the period. It enacts doubts, the Quixote. It dramatizes it. Dramatizes it is, it is the, a modern condition. Remember what I, what I mentioned about, uh, uh, a coper, Nicole's Galileo, the fact that the world of mankind is no longer at the center of the world. The earth is no longer at the center of the universe. And this is a, has brought about this, uh, sense of, of doubt.

Speaker 1:          06:45          There is doubt. Uh, continuing with this second grand theme, uh, there is doubt about the voracity of texts, the capacity of text to convey the truth, including, and most prominently the Bible. Oh, the Bible as interpreted by the Catholic Church, uh, such a doubt was the only prevalent among Protestant thinkers, but also among Catholic Catholic ones like Erasmus of Rotterdam. Erasmus is one of the, this great renaissance figures that I have, uh, mentioned, uh, as being important, uh, for, uh, sort of, and this is a time the humanists, Erasmus was one. We're philologists. The philologists means lover of language, Phyllo Logos, lover of language, students of language, particularly classical languages like Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Chairs for the study, uh, of these languages were created in Spain, uh, at the University of Alcoa, for instance, that pound where Cervantes happens to have been born by the way, uh, humanists like Erasmus wanted to read a scripture in the original Hebrew and Greek, Hebrew, Old Testament Greek, the new testament and challenge saying your ohms official Latin Bible. They wanted to do their own translations of the Bible. The church didn't like this at all. And the Erasmian in Spain were persecuted.

Speaker 2:          08:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:25          But there is an underlying, uh, Erasmian, uh, subtext in most of the, this,

Speaker 1:          08:37          the humanists like Erasmus wanted to say, uh, wanting to say the reading of this, uh, word in St Jerome's a Latin version of the Bible is wrong. It should be this. And of course, changing that word changes the meaning of the text. So there was doubt about the sacred texts, which builds over into doubt about texts in general and about language. And we certainly have a echoes of this throughout surrenders his work. There is also continuing with the second grand theme of doubt, ontological doubt, doubt about who one is, which is an encouragement to self creation, to self fashioning to self invention as Steven Greenburg Greenblatt calls it in his book, Renaissance Self Fashioning in Quixote. There are many characters we have seen who invent themselves, not just on Quixote. Uh, he nest [inaudible] Marcella [inaudible] springs is becoming Kona and so forth. Doubt leads to pondering. Pondering comes from bundles in Latin way too.

Speaker 1:          09:55          So pondering is to way uh, uh, to weigh the different possibilities. There are differences, different alternatives to, to being to action. Self doubt is the precondition to inventiveness, to the play of the imagination. It is the gateway to freedom, which is one of the main themes of the guilty as I have been pointing out throughout doubt, doubt leads to vicarious lives, live through literature, as in the cases of Don Quixote and Marcella for instance, and many others that you will meet in part to this is again, I underlined the freedom of the imagination. Why do we want to become others in the age of myths? We want it to be gods in the modern age. We want to be heroes like donkey hot. They want it to be one of the two Valerie heroes and like people today want to be James Bond or uh, such a modern, uh, hero, a dissatisfaction with the world, the world that is unstable leads to a desire to make it other and to make one's self other. And this is very much the core of the whole day from the very beginning.

Speaker 1:          11:20          Now the third of the ground themes that I'm reviewing as we conclude, part one reading Nikki hotter is a book about reading and it protagonist is first and foremost a reader. But there are many readers in the book like Marcella Ag Resource, Tomo, [inaudible], and even the poor trooper who has trouble reading the order of arrest as we saw in that hilarious scene. The Quixote, the that you thought the encourages the reader to look for stories not told or calling directly by means of other stories or embedded in other stories. It is a book, a hotel that is a lesson in reading and interpreting in the broad sense. There are so many scenes in which challenge a deputation was, are challenged or interpretations by various characters clash. The pleasure of reading involves the discovery, the teasing out of this subtextual stories as we saw when we talked about Cardenio story, uh, unwise.

Speaker 1:          12:36          We, so when we talked about Princess Mikami corners story, this is also a lesson for life that one can learn in the hotel. The fourth of the, uh, grand themes is that characters are relational, not static that they develop in relation to each other and given to us today. This was an innovation in the Quixote and innovation developed from the picaresque where there is character development in fiction for the first time in the Selestica. There is a, there is some of that already 1499, but this begins to develop with the picker risk. Last year, 1554, the Guzman and so forth. Characters influence each other. The mutual influence and transformation take place by virtue of the dialogue which posits that the self is relational and dependent on the others. This is evident in one of the truly grand themes about the hotel started by Salbaba. They must Ariaga, which is the theme of the quick Saudization of sensual and the sanctification of donkey.

Speaker 1:          13:59          Haughty meaning that donkey, that a sancocho becomes a, is influenced by his master, and that Don Quixote is influenced by his squire. The most, the most obvious modern example of this, uh, for me, uh, is a, uh, a book and a, uh, on a film that, uh, called the kiss of the Spiderwoman by Manuel [inaudible], the Argentine writer, uh, where, uh, there is, uh, uh, there are two fellows, Eh, uh, in jail, in Argentina want a political activist. And the other homosexual. And, and the whole story is, is, is how the homosexual, uh, transforms the political activists by telling him the stories of movies. And, uh, it's a very moving a film with a very quick Celtic, uh, uh, uh, uh, structured to it, but at least two characters talking and so forth. Now don't fit it. Nando's transformation as well as that of Dorothea. Is it a, is a prime example of this evolution of characters.

Speaker 1:          15:10          Uh, in addition, we have seen the characters can invent themselves identities and have adventures in their new roles and within those new fictions. As in the case of, uh, of Princess Mikko be corner, we will meet others who do the same in part to the fifth of the grand themes of criticism. And this is mostly my own grand theme about the Quixote is improvisation. I have talked several times about improvisation in the Quixote. My Random House gives two meanings to four, uh, four to improvise, one to prepare or provide offhand or hastily extemporize to compose, but actually for meanings to compose verse music on the spur of the moment. Three to recite thing extemporaneously and four to compose other or execute anything extemporaneously. The dictionary of the Spanish Academy says, personally, I said it on our costs are prone [inaudible] studio senior [inaudible] Alguna to make or do something. Suddenly we thought study or preparation.

Speaker 1:          16:27          Improvisation has something to do with blurry. Equally a concept that was very popular during the heyday of structuralism. And that means according to my [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible], the first one probably swap [inaudible] fancy fee to install something to provide or arrange for something. I'm a tourist league and ingeniously to fix or repair something more or less in a professional way to fix something up too fancy foil to falsify it or pass it off for something else to improvise has on the one hand a positive side, it is a boast of skill to be able to do something without a model or plan, but it also has a negative side because the product of improvisation is usually shorty imperfect, fragile, and provisional. We have seen that there is a great deal of implicit improvisation in part one of the Quixote somatically. I said where a meaning that there are things and actions had described which are improvised.

Speaker 1:          17:34          I gave one pal Omegas in as an example of this because it is made up of Patchwork, uh, carried out over time, haphazardly. But I also pointed our features of the novel itself that seemed to be trade their construction. They're notorious 17 oversights such as the disappearance of Santos Donkey, but there are many others. For instance, I don't know if you noticed that it said Advantis pulls out of his out of his hat at the end that the innkeeper but one polemic, uh, was a trooper of the holy brotherhood. Something that goes on mentioned during the earlier episode. In the end when quantile Omeka puts out a candle to prevent a trooper from finding out what is going on in his establishment, how come if he was a trooper himself, I these lapses on the part of Cervantes or part of the aesthetics of the book, I would like to think that it is part of the aesthetics of the book and that the air of improvisation is very much in line with the books in formal tone with the fact that its origin is presumably a found manuscript whose discovery is episodic and who's redaction, uh, seems to be concomitant with the action and the reading.

Speaker 1:          19:01          Most notoriously, the prologue, the [inaudible] dramatizes the process of improvisation because it tells how it is being laboriously written. The prologue sets the tone for the book and it's defined and, and it is also if defining epilogue as I said earlier, it is, I know to improvisation to an imperfection qualities too, which the author resigns himself. Remember that many and the speed dial in the piece that you read, attributes, improvisation, do the Spanish character, he says this was resignation. He's a Spaniard. GMC was a Spaniard himself and Isi Riley British has been, is to love Spain. Uh, uh, admiringly compares to the improvisation in the Quixote to fighting and to Flamenco dancing, which are activities in which improvisation is the order of the day. I believe that it is a theoretical statement on the part of their Vantis which he proposes again in chapter five of the 1615 Quixote. The second part when he has the translator, apologize and you will get to the chapter for transcribing a text in which central does not sound like himself sounds to learn it. This is a text that on dos itself that is as, as it is being read, it is also a critique of my niece, me, my missus of representation. It is an improvisation made from what there is and at the translator and transcriber pass on resigned. Oh, it's imperfections.

Speaker 1:          20:43          All of this is connected to the themes that I mentioned before about doubt, self doubt and linguistic uncertainty. How can my poor self create something perfect and enduring in language given what I have said about doubt, self doubt on the instability of language and conceived by the humanists, uh, the whole, the whole thing. Uh, it also opens the question of temporality about this text that says, well, this doesn't sound like San job. I transcribe it because it is my duty to do so on so forth. Uh, uh, in what moment or at what moment does the Texas exist in relation to the originals in which it is based?

Speaker 2:          21:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:36          Uh, one solution, perhaps the only solution is to say that the texts exists only at the moment of reading of each reading.

Speaker 1:          21:48          And that is a very modern, uh, current conception of textuality that is already present in Cervantes. So these are the grand themes that I wanted to review with you about part one. And now we move to part two 16, 15, 10 years. The whole decade has elapsed. Cervantes was an instant success with Don Quixote. Uh, and he moved to Madrid in 16, 16. Publishers become interested in his work and he brings out the novella a him Pladis exemplary stories that you have in 1613 on Ochoco Manias [inaudible] eight place and eight interludes in 60 16, 15 the same year that the second Quixote appears. And I have a page here that you have read, but I want to read again, uh, from Darren's book set Avantis. Uh, and from the biogas little biographical chapter at the beginning that I reproduced in my case book so that we have, uh, a synoptic view in 1606 durangos the court settled again in Madrid.

Speaker 1:          23:06          And you have been following an Elliot. The migrations of the Spanish court said Vantis and his family moved with it. Cervantes wanted to be in touch with other writers. I was looking for new publishers, the women in his household, busy with fashion and designing and sewing. We're looking for customers. Miguel's last year in Madrid, we're relatively serene. He overcame through patience and wisdom, all these adversities that neglect the famous writers. And so just the Vega who seldom had a good word for his works and the sadness of family crisis. His daughters married but soon became uh, his daughter married but soon became the mistress of a wealthy middle age businessman. When Cervantes intervened in the interest of preventing scandal, she became a stranger. Never again visited him. Cervantes immersed himself in his work. It was harvest season for him late in life, yet in full command of his talent, he produced in books, work session at Sam.

Speaker 1:          24:10          He's extemporary Nawbo 16, 13, the second part of Funky Hotel 1615. And finally, Perseus answer, he's wound. That's the his though and novel, which is imagination. Uh, and his love for adventure found almost limitless in scope. And he hides a quoting, uh, unhealed del Rio and he'll del Rio, the Great Hispanics who was a professor at Columbia University for many years and who in the forties, published a great history of Spanish literature. Wrangles objectively serve life was not a success story. He will sell them in full control. He was too poor for many years. He lacked public recognition. Yet as an hill del Rio points out, and here he goes on in the real. There is no reason to lament. Cervantes is misfortunes nor the mediocrity of his daily life. He could those through an experience which is seldom obtain when the writer is successful and wealthy, no observe and feel the beat of Spanish life and its greatness. And it's poverty and it's heroic fantasy. And in, in the sad reality of an imminent decadence, he was to leave in his books the most faithful image of this life reflected in multiple perspectives with bittersweet irony and penetrating humor.

Speaker 1:          25:31          So the, uh, uh, uh, this moment of where the beginning of the decline of the Spanish empire, uh, begins. And so, uh, to also, uh, have a very clear vision of this moment. Uh, I want to read a text that I presumably you have a also read from imperial Spain. Uh, Elliott's a marvelous book, which I do do hope that you, that you read. Uh, um, and he goes as follows. In page. This is three 19 three 20 of your penguin classics edition. He has been talking about, um, uh, how, uh, um, the writers could find sponsors for their work and so forth. At the same time, the moral and emotional involvement of the intellectuals in the tragic fate of their native land seems to have provided an additional stimulus, giving an extra degree of intensity to their imagination and diverting it into rewarding creative channels. Ironically, a moment of crisis can create a great literature. This was especially true of Cervantes says Elliott, who's life from 1547 to 1616 spans the two ages of imperial triumph and imperial retreat. This is the important sentence spans the two ages of imperial triumph and imperial retreat. The grace, the crisis of the late 16th century cuts through the life of Servantez as it got through the life of Spain separating the days of heroism from the days of [inaudible]. This is a word that we will be visiting again during the semester.

Speaker 3:          27:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:30          They'll be on deceived, somehow said Van. There's magically held the balance between optimism and pessimism. Enthusiasm. I'm irony, but it illustrates what was to be the most striking characteristic of 17th century literary and artistic production. That deep cleavage between the two worlds of the spirit and the flesh, which coexist and yet our forever separate. This constant dualism between the spirit and the flesh. The dream and the reality belonged very much to 17th century European civilization as a whole, but it seems to have attained an intensity in Spain that it rarely achieved elsewhere. It is apparent in the writings of Calderon de la Barca, whose name I have mentioned before and the portraits of guest who's work we have seen and continue to see, and it prompted the bitter satires of Canedo Francisco. They came in through one of the great writers of this, of this vanish.

Speaker 3:          28:38          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:39          17th century. He's quoting here, so give me a little bit, are many things here that seemed to exist on, have there been and yet they are nothing more than a name and an appearance. [inaudible] road at the end of his life was the reality of Spanish experience to be found in the heroic imperialism of Charles the fifth or in the humiliating passivism of Phillip, the third in the world of Don Quixote or the world of central Panzer confused at once by its own past and its own present. The [inaudible] still of Philip, the third, the land of Arabic priestess sought desperately for an answer. I'd be curious. Does you will meet in the first chapters of a part two

Speaker 1:          29:36          from RBT or which was a, uh, an opinion [inaudible] where, uh, um, people who offered advice to the government on matters of the economy on military matters. Some of the advice was really outlandish. Uh, if he saw the people who developed into today's economists, the ones who have brought us to the present crisis is what I always think of when I think of the beauty status. Uh, you will be meeting them, as I said at the beginning of part two when the characters discuss them and discuss some of these advice given to the, and donkey Horta himself. Act as an arbitrary start by giving some advice on how to, uh, take care of the threat of the Turks, uh, coming down again after the defeat in Lepanto. So, uh, we are not responsible for answering the question of what happened in Spain. Why was it different? Uh, but we are responsible for seeing the effects of this crisis as reflected in a Saran thesis work. And I wanted to do, to have a clear, uh, uh, view of this, uh, uh, two ages of, uh, of empire, uh, uh, one, one of triumph and one of of defeat. Um,

Speaker 1:          31:09          now the second part,

Speaker 3:          31:14          uh,

Speaker 1:          31:17          let us look at the, uh, uh, various titles. Uh, the title, that page of that we saw of the 16 or five Quixote, the title page of the 1615 Quixote and the title page of the [inaudible], he, he's known by his second last name or some people are, and you have to remember his name. You will see it complete now on the, on on the screen, a, yeah, a Ne the, uh, because the two things that have happened to Cervantes since the publication of 605, the most important things is to the success of the Quixote. And in 16, 14, the appearance of an Apocryphal Quixote published by [inaudible]. Now this is the, uh, title page of the 16 or five jihad. The one we had just finished part one. And this is as is, no. Okay. [inaudible] remember we went over each one of those words in one of my first classes. Okay. Now we go to the title page of the 1615 Quixote.

Speaker 3:          32:34          Uh,

Speaker 1:          32:36          and you say Segunda Party dealing Henny Kava Yanno key hotel, a mantra. There has been a major change. He's no longer an e. Dot. Logo. Now he's a Caballero boredom. Miguel Lesser Vantis Saavedra I will tore the La Primera party by Miguel de [inaudible]. Author of the first part is being underlying because [inaudible] in 16, 14, there had appeared and apocryphal Quixote.

Speaker 3:          33:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:16          Say Wound [inaudible] [inaudible] the third Sally. It will be the third. Sally, uh, years. La, la, la I. Dot. E E Lakita the fifth part, because he goes after, normally the first part is divided in four. So this is the fifth part. Uh, and so on, so forth, uh, by, uh, loan software. [inaudible] see, yes. Uh, born in the, uh, in the village of total. The sea. Yes. Cause he just, he's a very famous, uh, little town nearby. A lead. Why? Does anyone remember why no one remembers why that treatise of after the seed. Yes. You're all very learned Yalies the treaties d software, the seizures whereby the pope, uh, in 1494 divided up to new world between Portugal and Spain. Uh, Francois Premiere, Francis the first of France, later complaining in the 16th century, she says they wanted to see Adam's will where Adam had bequeathed all of this world to the Spanish, but so toward the seizure. So you remember to turn the suggestion now. Uh,

Speaker 1:          34:35          so he took over a year though. Not only I need, I'll go. Is it because of Cervantes felt that his deeds, quote unquote in the first part, elevated him tonight? Uh, some believe that the change was made at the printers and not bite Advantis uh, in part to, uh, distinguish this book from our Jeunesse, which still call it either, so you call it [inaudible] night to distinguish it from the Apocrypha. Also, some have said that the printers felt, you see the hotels you have learned was immediately translated into several languages, English, French and so forth. And the printers felt that Caballero night was easier to translate into other languages then either Evalgo editors tend to make such changes in the interest of profits. But, uh, we, we don't know exactly, but the fact is that the cha, the title has been, uh, changed. Uh, and this is a good way of remembering that this is a different book.

Speaker 1:          35:50          Uh, now the second part was, uh, finished in a hurry. I said, one is due in large measure to the publication of the 1614 hour. You're neither a spurious. Second part. Second parts had appeared of [inaudible] of Guzman, uh, of the cell is Tina, not to mention, uh, those of romances of chivalrous as we saw in the episode of the scrutiny of the books, there were whole cycles. Second, third, fourth sparts. Uh, why William Hendricks, Hendricks has recently finished a doctoral dissertation about sequence, uh, and demonstrated that sequels dominated the 16th century in Spain when the most, uh, were among the most popular of books and a whole poetics of the sequel emerged that the same thing to write a book from scratch than to write a book that is the continuation of a previous book. Why was this, why did this happen? Well, it happened because with the advent of printing, it was, uh, uh, uh, uh, easier to produce these books and to disseminate them and to make a profit from them.

Speaker 1:          37:18          So second parts, uh, proliferate it. So, uh, in writing a second part of the Quixote Cervantes is following this trend. Most recently, the second part of it was Mondale Farace, which had been published, uh, right before the first part of the, uh, of the [inaudible], uh, now in why was he, uh, uh, so, uh, upset or the appearance of the, uh, of a Neda [inaudible] because these novels were big and these characters who are becoming commodities over which people would quarrel. Remember that we're talking about authors, as I have mentioned in earlier classes, who are the first professional offers we're trying to make a living from, uh, the writing. So the Quixote was a commodity for a set of Lantis, uh, particularly because this was not a character derived from classical mythology to which anyone had a right or from one of those cycles of jewellery romances which had been used and reuses the character that he invented.

Speaker 1:          38:30          So he felt it was his own. Of course, the character would become a literary myth under then taken up by others. But, uh, at this juncture is around, this was very jealously guarding his, uh, his creation. He is, he is, uh, very much aware of the, of the value of his invention because of his too. He brought in fame and also because he brought him a profit. And in fact you will get to a, a, an episode in part to that is a brilliant satire of uh, the uh, relationship between money and literary creation. Something that we take for granted. Now I need is the episode where Gnocchi hope smashes a puppet show that was brought by none other, that he missed the pass them onto these guys as my say, Pedro, uh, on, he breaks up all the figurines and after the episode, uh, Don Quixote has to pay for each one of those figurines, each one of those characters, depending on the importance of the character in the story. So you can see that it is a satire of the value of literary inventure. Uh, it is a Yvan Fleming said, you know, my, my James Bond is worth so much on the Pussy Galore. This woman who appears in one of his movies had Rachel's Lee named Pussy Galore. Uh, is, uh, is, uh, is worth so much and so forth and, and, and, and, and so on.

Speaker 3:          39:56          No. So

Speaker 1:          40:00          the, uh, um, the second part was, uh, was written in a hurry. And let me, let me show you in how much of a hurry in detail by quoting one Henry Sullivan who, uh, uh, in a, in a book called a grotesque purgatory, uh, writes the following, and I'm quoting and follow this closely. He says, part two of the key hot, they was begun in 16, 12, seven years after her on the stocks and well on its way by July 16, 13, about halfway about half complete by 20. July 16, 14. Then continued at breakneck speed in fall 16, 14. And finally completed by January or February 16, 15, a period of about two and a half years in all unquote, I will get returned to this, uh, uh, by using a quote from Manuel do wrong, but you can see the, uh, how does a solid one know this board from evidence, from documents and statements do. I said, well, there's another sense of worth about how the novel was developed. You will see that part too is it's quite, quite long.

Speaker 3:          41:23          No,

Speaker 1:          41:25          one of the best critics of our millionaire does, uh, the whole thing was stiffen Gilman, who was for many years a professor at Harvard. And, uh, he, um, he, he wrote an essay called the Apocrypha lucky hot. They're very much are worth reading, uh, uh, in which he, he has, uh, a memorable phrase. Uh, Gilman says that's advantage rather than confront our DNA that when she does to a certain extent, court prefers to encompass him in a web of irony, he says, said, avant this through a net of irony, a web of irony over, uh, his rival. You will see how he does that because actually I'm a Anita. His greatest triumph, his book didn't have much success, was to wind up as a character. We think don Quixote is fiction and having his characters incorporated into Tulum, keyholders fiction to add to the game of mirrors that Quixote already was in fact a critic.

Speaker 1:          42:37          Uh, and with enough time in their hands, critics and scholars will almost say anything. Uh, a critic claimed in fixed in in 1915 that, uh, the Apocrypha that the hotel had been written by Cervantes himself. Um, that's absurd. But, uh, at some level, uh, it makes sense because it's Arianna hadn't existed. Cervantes would have had to invent him in the way that he uses him in part two of the Quixote. Now if you want to read the most outlandish, uh, take on all this, you must read a story by the Argentine master Jorge Luis Borges, who wrote a story called Pierre Menard, author of the Quixote in which, uh, a French, uh, poet minors color and so forth, decides to write the Quixote again, but not a different Quixote, but the same key hot they word for word as sort of aunties had written it. A, it is a, is a dizzying theoretical meditation on all of these Games of authorship that Cervantes initiates himself in part one of the Quixote and continues in part two in a sense, the appearance of our [inaudible]. It's like a self fulfilling prophecy. If there was a CD, I met a bidding, Haley, who was supposed to have been the real author of the Quixote and is of course, a fictional author. Suddenly Cervantes finds himself with a real false author of the Quixote. So this is what the other [inaudible] book adds to the Quixote.

Speaker 1:          44:29          Now, the [inaudible] book, uh,

Speaker 1:          44:32          is tremendously boring. Uh, it is conceived within scholastic philosophy. Uh, the characters instead of engaging in dialogue, have long monologues that are, uh, really, uh, obnoxious, uh, uh, Don Quixote is not in love with. We'll see. There he is the, uh, the loving night sanctuary is a bit pornographic. Uh, and, uh, uh, it is, uh, in fact, uh, uh, a very dull a book that only those of us who are a set of and testers and cannot avoid doing. So, uh, read, um, so, so much about our [inaudible]. Uh, and now, uh, let's move on to part two. Uh, you have a treat, uh, in store it because in my view, part two is better than part one if that, if that is possible, although scholars argue back and forth about this. But I, I think that there is no, no question. Part two is a superior a book and is even much more complicated and complicated by the fact that characters in part to have read part one adding to the game of mirrors.

Speaker 1:          45:47          And you will find this in the very early chapters of part two. I'm going to read you now a few quotes again from Durang's set Avantis the uh, because they serve as a good uh, uh, introduction, uh, to part two because it is kind of a synthesis of, of what [inaudible] thinks or thought about the Quixote at this point. And you have some general ideas before embarking on reading the uh, part two of the hotel. These are quotes, he says the art of dialogue in Servantez reaches its peak in the second half of his novel. It is true. Second part, there is much more dialogue and not just between sanctuary. Don Quixote, those dialogues. And we enjoy so much and they're more here, but among many, uh, different characters with different points of view, different, different ways of speaking and, and, and so forth. Again, drunk. It is also in the second part when the interaction of the two main characters, the night and his choir reaches a climax, central Pansa becomes increasingly quick. So ticed and even a certain moments occupies the center of the stage. Having become temporarily the novels center character, there is an impressive trick. It is not done with mirrors. It is achieved through dialogue on quote, and this is true. You will see that sanctuary in various chapters that I'm not going to anticipate and ruin for you becomes the protagonist of the novel. Uh, and there is a back and forth between, uh, Don Quixote and sanctuary.

Speaker 2:          47:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:37          Again, [inaudible] human memory, the memory of the squire and his master ruminates upon the past, nothing that occurs in their travels is entirely finished. They will talk about what has happened to them and try to find a meaning to every obscure detail etched in their memory. Every possibility the future holds open will influence their present attitudes since the past. Keep on echoing upon the present and the future keeps on working its magic upon the minds of the two characters. Each moment of the present is made richer and more subtle by the interplay of past, present and future of quote to this, I might add that the presence of part one as a memory, uh, is, uh, an important one in part two and uh, a device, uh, of part two, uh, is that many episodes are in some way a rewriting of episodes of part one and rewriting that is usually much more complicated and elaborate. But you can see the kernel of the episode from part one in the episode in part two. This has to do this, this racist of course, philosophical issues about memory and about, uh, about the repetition of the past and all of that that we will be talking about when we reached those episodes.

Speaker 2:          49:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:15          The interaction between the individual and his environment is shown to be unique. It escapes logic and language because logic and language are systems of labels super imposed upon our experience. And Cervantes wants to free us from all labels by showing how much each individual is capable of interpreting his own facet of a multifaceted reality. Yeah. The, the, the, the, the presence of reality in its multifaceted ways. And there were even interpreting becomes much more complicated in part too because this guy says proliferate and uh, uh, a lot more of the action takes place, not in the open air but indoors where, uh, where, uh, charades can be organized and, and, and so forth.

Speaker 2:          50:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          50:07          Now the following quote, which is, uh, uh, a little long but takes us back to the composition of part two and I think we'll, I hope round out your cause, your, your knowledge of it as you, as you, uh, approach, uh, reading it [inaudible] goes, the sense of unreality is heightened throughout part two. When Don Quixote on Santo have to face their doubles, their reflection in the mirror, they meet people who have read part one or five or have heard about it. They have to react to what this readers of their previous adventures think about them. Even worse after chapter 36 we just wouldn't say Advantis finds out about the existence of Avaya Neda's book after chapter 36 they have to fight off another image of themselves. The Bogles image in the crooked mirror of Avaya Neda's fake second part, the false Kihatha doors. The end of 1614 Cervantes was working is what we went over, but now I'm going to repeat it in a different key.

Speaker 1:          51:13          Cervantes was working on chapter 36 [inaudible] second part are we gonna do this book appeared in October of the same year. Cervantes reacted by writing 38 chapters in seven months, uh, strenuous effort, which may have exhausted what was left over precarious health. This bureau, second part was the work of an unknown author of a young Nigga is obviously a pseudonym, is a pen name. We don't know who really have a, I was boats Advantis hard. One reputation was in danger until he could refute the piracy by issuing his own part too. He was also indignant at the lack of intelligence and sensitivity of his imitator. He wasn't even a bad imitator. If he had been a good imitator, he may have been flattered. He's anger is expressed through his main characters. Don Quixote on Santo have to face your ugly ghosts. They must convince the readers of Ypn, NATO's book that day are real characters are intruders trying to usurp their personality, their selves, their reality. It is a situation only Cervantes or Pirandello could have device. The illusion here is doing when she Pirandello a great Italian play, right of the 20th century who wrote a famous play calls six characters in search. Oh offer.

Speaker 1:          52:41          So this, this Cervantes characters are the other characters, Blair reality or functionality in a way, having read part one yourselves, you are like some of the characters in part two of the hotel and you are in the very, in a very similar situation as you go through that second part. Okay, we'll leave it there.
