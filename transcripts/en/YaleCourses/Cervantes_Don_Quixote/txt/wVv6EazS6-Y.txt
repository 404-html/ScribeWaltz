Speaker 1:          00:01          US, we approach the episode of, uh, Camacho's wedding. Uh, it should be readily apparent, uh, that it was the story of what's going to be a play. Uh, it has a beginning, a conflict or climax and a resolution, uh, given that it has a happy ending, uh, it's safe to assume that it was going to be a comedy. Actually, scholars of Ferritin around undiscovered, uh, evidence that indeed it was a play that Cervantes was planning to write, uh, and a set of antigens seems founding the Quixote, uh, a book where he could a total dump all of his work in progress. The, uh, the stories, uh, uh, some of which wound up of course it the book a exemplary stories. But some of the, uh, the stories in the book of course where, uh, uh, written independently on her actually circulated independently, uh, the novel as it's being developed in the cohort that will be a uninclusive kind of, uh, of, uh, of literary work, uh, with a loose format, uh, not following the strict rules of our literary forms.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Or John has a derived from the classical tradition where, uh, these, uh, liberties, uh, who are not available but the Quixote does, uh, allow, uh, for these kinds of incorporation of stories and have various texts. It is a, uh, a feature that the novel, uh, we'll continue to have. And that in the modern period of course, uh, will be, uh, exploited to the, to the very limits. Um, lenders also notice how these love story is a neatly integrated into the plot of the novel as opposed to the more than general way in which, uh, such stories were inserted in part to uh, here, uh, donkey hope they central are more or less involved in the developments and certainly no Quixote's involved in the outcome. Of course, given that this was going to be a play, there is a, a great deal of theatricality in the whole episode, which includes theater within the theater, uh, as these celebrations for the wedding take place.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Even nature has been artistically arranged so much so that the outdoors now has a roof. You may that when they enter the meadow where the celebration of the wedding is going to take place. Uh, it is noted that the trees have been arranged in such a way, uh, us to provide a canopy a that the sun can barely penetrate to reach the grass. Uh, that is his nature turned into architecture, us a US adware. Um, the play within the play, uh, is, uh, a way of underlining, uh, uh, that everything is theatrical, that there is no real action, uh, uh, that is not already theater, that his life is already theater in part two. And this is part of the theme of this in Ganja that I have been underlining for the past few lectures.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Let us also take notice of the abundance that prevails here and in the second part in general, in contrast with part one, whereas in, in, in part one, the characters eight frugally, uh, now sent Joe has so much food before him that he's scarcely knows what to do with it. Um, don't compare this with the very frugal meal, that donkey hope they had at that very first in where he ate a fish because it was a Friday abundance contrasted with the starkist want. It's typical of the aesthetics of the Baroque, this, uh, this, uh, clash and a abundance ties, uh, in with the notion of sensuality, uh, the sensuality of server antiques art that Auerbach spoke about in the essay that you have or red and that he says he is the hallmark of sort of antithesis work. The essential, the tangible in all its abundance turns into a simulacrum and reveals its opposite, which is quite literally death.

Speaker 1:          05:14          This is the, this, this in Gagnon aspect. So we have Santos speech about death being the devour of all, as I said, the overarching plot and the plot within the, uh, the work in this, uh, stories follows this pattern of in Ganja, Ganja. Now we may ask when we come to this episode of why our wedding so important in fiction, including film of course in the theater too, but him film, there are many, uh, films that you, uh, uh, I'm sure I can remember, uh, that uh, center on a wedding, weddings mark a moment of Social Union and renewal both of society and of our Matrix. They are at transition mark by 15, particularly by eating in fiction. Weddings tend to be conclusions. Uh, they married and lived happily ever after is common, uh, traditional ending two stories in the, in the, in the wedding celebrations, the, the world is consumed, uh, uh, in a way that leads to the consummation of, uh, of, of, of the, of, of the marriage.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Um, the story, I will see much more about this in a, in in a very short time, the story of Camacho's wedding, like the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, uh, which it is based. You see conjunction of love and death of arrows and Tinnitus or love that struggles against death for continuity and renewal. There are intimations of the death scene. Uh, uh, the culminating death theme, which is really not the, that scene, but, uh, uh, contrived or theatrical that scene. But there are intimations of the death scene in the calf that is impelled to be cooked, that our is find as they arrive at the wedding, a celebration, one good one grove. So see in that impaled calf escape goat, which is typical of feasts celebrations. Now Camacho is rich and powerful, like don't Fernando in part one. Uh, what basilio's abilities and skills prevail over social and economic forces. His, uh, uh, his, uh, abilities, uh, win the day. I'm there as much made of how many skills he has. He can play the guitar, he can, uh, he's an athlete. We later found out that he's quite an actor also. Uh, now the, the episode is a prose a pizza. Lamean

Speaker 2:          08:35          I think I'd better write this.

Speaker 1:          08:50          A poem or song in praise of the bride or groom or have both from the Greek Epi, uh, [inaudible] and [inaudible] chamber and a, uh, a versus a bit alarming is actually performed as part of the wedding. A celebration, if you remember what an elaborate one at that, uh, this episode of, of, of a wedding, uh, uh, with such celebrations, uh, he's, he's, he's common in the literature of the period most, the most prominent one is in the great poem by Louis. The gum Guerra, who's name I may not have mentioned before, who is the great, uh, by rock port. It is from him that you get the word in English, gum go ristic uh, something very baroque complicated and he, he's famous for many poems, but the most famous one is called the solely Dallas. And uh, in the Solidago this, there is quite a, an elaborate wedding, a ceremony, but it's described

Speaker 2:          10:13          okay.

Speaker 1:          10:14          It is, uh, uh, it's like a spring ritual, a celebration of nature's replenishment. Remember the park too vaguely begins sort of, uh, uh, in spring, but in the whole episode when wonders is nature corrected by art or dose, the nature prevail. I think the answer is Opo side art prevails. That art corrects niche. And this is again, one of the main themes in part to like eat healthy. Don't you hold these on this side a of Basilio [inaudible] Camacho. And in this the episode is very mindful of Marcella's and resourced almost in part one when don Quixote, again, it's on the side of, uh, of Marcella.

Speaker 2:          11:09          Uh,

Speaker 1:          11:09          perhaps this episode is the, is the kind of ending that demo say like resource episode should have had in, uh, in part one the, uh, the, the reminiscences of that episode also in the attempted or faked suicide in part one resource to us we saw had actually committed to site. Now the stories are version of the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, uh, which had been anticipated by lowering. So, uh, the Dan does sonnet on the topic during the episode. Uh, Diego Demi down does house his father's house, the man in green, uh, and it's mentioned directly by one of the students on the road, uh, to the, uh, to the wedding.

Speaker 1:          12:00          It is also acted out in the downside of lava. The spoken dance, the Peter Lamean during the wedding festivities. So the, the myths of period was from Tishbe. He hangs Haley over this episode. John Synagis writes, quote, the occurrence of the ceremony in a theater theater like implies that the wedding is what? One more active artifice. Therefore, when Basillio appears, we become caught up with the spectators, the wedding, they let the audience at the play where to Spencer's Esperando. They were waiting in suspense to see what would happen. The heroin, it star of the play has just stepped on stage and everyone is anxious to see what he will do. Synagogue ads comparing this episode, which is uh, uh, the only one on love on, on, on the second part with the current Daniel tale of the first part and he writes the following. This is a rather lengthy court, but I think a useful quote from this, uh, uh, John Finnegan, it goes, the final result of the action of commercials wedding is the confirmation of the propriety of romantic love and the rejection of the illegitimate claim on love by greed.

Speaker 1:          13:25          The same conclusion was provided by Cardinia tail. There are however important differences between the two stories. Cause then you're stale ends in an in to which the hand of fate had led the two couples. The Camacho wedding episode, however, ends in a stage the conclusion, the conclusion is brought about by basileus skill. The difference between these two endings reflect, reflect a significant difference between part one and part two in part one only don't be haughty on the priest acted as authors in the sense that they tried to impose fiction on reality. The role of art was of secondary concern to the other characters in part two. However, art and artifice are extremely important and a larger number of characters from central bouncer to the Duke and Duchess and of course, uh, Samsung Carrasco Act as authors by using fiction to impose their wills on the, on all the characters in connatural wedding Basilea access author because he is not content to let fate decide the end of the story.

Speaker 1:          14:41          Therefore he imposes his will on the other characters by using fiction to all to alter the course of the story away from its natural. And, um, quote, can you see also what he's also the act of this play that he has, uh, made up. But another way to look at the episode is to see it as a modern version of the beer must anticipate myth, which is clearly in the ground on a alumina's have just said over the story. The Pyramus and Thisbe story in Orbitz with the morphosis highlights the pagan theme of suicide, which Cervantes in his Catholic environment uses for dramatic effect, but ultimately avoids. Now, all of it, we all know who he was and I gave you some information in the law in the sheet that I passed around with a copy of this episode in the metamorphoses. He was a Roman poet of the, of the last dog osteon Augustan age.

Speaker 1:          15:50          He's known for his ours. I'm a Tortilla with someone called the most immoral work written by amount of genius. It's a love. Don't rush out now to get the book. Uh, but the metamorphosis is his most important work. Uh, which is a long narrative poem book, which recounts a legends in which the miraculous transformations of matter, uh, occur. In fact, the poem begins. My intention is to tell of bodies changed to different forms. And it begins with the change from chaos to customers, uh, and, uh, and goes on to the moment, uh, to Julio. Cesar been transformed into, into a star. So the Middle Ages took the Vietnam office is to be kind of a Pagan Bible like an old testament if you'll test them and tells the story of the, uh, of the, of the universe. So does the metamorphosis using the classical myths he's influenced, uh, on, uh, in the renaissance was a tremendous, and even in the, in the late Middle Ages, uh, he, he was kind of the, the sourness of myths that artists both, uh, painters, sculptures and writers, uh, youth, uh, very often, um, now, uh, in, in, in Spanish literature, he was a very influential, as he was, of course in English literature throughout the ages.

Speaker 1:          17:43          Um, he was, he, he, he is, he with virtual, uh, in importance as a classical author, uh, to be, uh, followed. Now they're deeper, more disturbing aspects in this story. Uh, uh, uh, in Cabarrus wording linking the flat deflowering blot and the connection between life and death thing, to which I will go in some detail. Love appears as a mock death to promote life. Violence and love are complicit because violence is the subtext of love. The issue here is of classical mythologies version of this, uh, uh, contrasted with, uh, uh, uh, Christian doctrine. The question for artists of the renaissance deeply interested in the classical world, uh, but living in a Christian one was what to do with the ancient gods.

Speaker 1:          18:50          Uh, the most common answer was allegory. The myths were seeing as moral allegories. Uh, they, uh, they told him moral tales. Um, but in the case of the episode of Camacho sweating, what's the seems to be proposing is a modern reenactment of an ancient recurring dilemma concerning love, uh, and using for that, the classical myth Pyramus and Thisbe basilio's arts are used here to steer the story away from its pagan ending, uh, suicide to a victory of love and Christian marriage. You have read the story in the handout that I gave you in the last class. The Pagan ending is turned into theater. If the representation into art, Don Quixote has referred earlier to marriage as an as an irreparable accident. It's something that, you know, something that sounds very funny to us today is to just using a scholastic terminology to refer to it. I'm always in the context of these debates about marriage that I will revisit today.

Speaker 1:          20:11          Basilio makes the accidental, the result of choice, his choice. The point is the skill and wilingness need to a virtuous result here. The whole of the second part of the Quixote is an apology for art, for the artificial, for the constructed, for the contrived, for art, helping nature attained good ends. After going through the process of disingenuous that I have been, uh, underlining in the past few classes, it is a way of turning the seat, which would normally lead to the solution went into a positive force that leads to a happy ending. As I said, by Celia skill prevail over, uh, uh, the economic forces, uh, the social and economic forces is his craftiness wins the day. Now what I claim, uh, is that is beneath all of that, the kind of sub story is subtext. Uh, this story is a rewriting of the last stories of part one that turn on on equal marriage and the that involve the issue of secret marriages, which as I said, we're a topic, uh, the hot topic of the day, which was taken up by the council of Trent.

Speaker 1:          21:35          I've been read Eliot, you know, now what the council of Trent was. I spoke about these issues when, uh, uh, when speaking about the episode in which Dorothea allows herself to be deflowered by Don Fernando. The difference here is the lurking precedence of classical myth. Typical, more typical of the Baroque in part one. These stories about all of this, uh, young people, uh, uh, seem to be drawn from, from contemporary legal archives, contemporary stories about conflicts involving social issues, states and legacies. Here the source is much more imposing. An ancient, the myth of period was on therapy, but true to the political character of part two. Uh, there is in addition, a protracted discussion of the issue of marriage by the characters. The issue of marriage was a political issue, not just a religious issue. It's impossible to separate the two other echoes of part one our Basilio's madness when he hears of credentials, cutaneous impending marriage, which recalls both resource Tamang Cardinia when they go mad.

Speaker 1:          23:01          In the case of Canadian, mostly we don't see it. The system will actually act it out. And of course the issue of suicide, uh, which evokes, uh, the system. Uh, this is another case I emphasize of rewriting episodes from part one so that we writings involve here both episodes in part one on classical myth, which is being rewritten. But there is a deeper take on marriage at the level of material transformations. The story of commercials. Wedding is about the issue of marriage as a sacrament, the transformation of matter for transcendental purposes. That of creating a new human life and how it is institutionalized in civil and Canon law. That is by society and religion. The law is based on prohibition. Thou shall not here the ban instituted by cutaneous parents once, uh, uh, she and Basilio have reached sexual maturity, which is what quite evident if you read the story, uh, there, uh, uh, prevision comes up when they are, uh, they have reached sexual maturity.

Speaker 1:          24:27          Uh, she has to be gone to menstruate and he's now capable of impregnating her. Her parents are reluctant to have her reproduce with an input impecunious Basilio who for all his skills as not profitable ones, but that stands also as to simply the prohibition. Thou shall not, as we saw when discussing the, uh, issue, uh, uh, regarding, uh, Doterra, a clandestine marriages, which is lurking here in the background because we must assume that they had been one between a Basilio and criteria that's in marriages could lead to polygamy. I mean, I could say to any girl that I was involved with, uh, Jess, yes, I will marry you. And B, then if the, if, if it took, I said where you could be married to several, uh, such, uh, several women and also how can avow hastily made in the heat of passion a yoke partners for life in what donkey hotel calls.

Speaker 1:          25:40          Again, using scholastic terminology, we MaxCDN t irreparably meaning something that cannot be taken back in the Catholic church who are going to take it back. That is how can such a, a cow can words uttered in this circumstances, uh, make a marriage, how can freewill be so easily surrendered? The council of Trent proclaim that the Church of horror, clandestine marriages, an order declared gene not to celebrate weddings. We thought published bands and the presence of witnesses. This was incorporated by Phillip the second into Spanish statutory law in 1564 and remained thus the foundation of marriage in Spain until the 19th century. The conflict is dealt with very subtly in this story.

Speaker 1:          26:38          Basilio is proficient in Canon and civil law and he puts it to good use. In trick to Merrick Italia. How does he do that? Well, he threatens to die without confession. You have to have to underline this because, uh, even if you are a Catholic, this is very difficult to conceive from are a modern perspective. So you want to die without confession. So what, go ahead be my guest, but bought by threatening to do that. Uh, he is accusing them of, uh, sending him irrevocably to hell because suicide is a mortal sin. And uh, and uh, uh, if he dies without confession, uh, in the conventional side, he's going to hell no matter what. Uh, this is how he convinced everyone. He is very, he knows canon law and he knows civil law. Uh, so you die without confession. If she will not give in, Eh, would condemn him to eternal damnation. Keith, Daddy, I'm the others would have done more harm to him this way. Then murdering him, murdering him will be nothing compared to eternal damnation. Then he has both terrier. I'm himself alter the words about free consent. That would legitimize the marriage before church and society. I'm sure you remember the episode in which he insists and the proper words, the legal words. I used a affirming, uh, uh, consent.

Speaker 1:          28:25          She confirms later her determination afterwards to dispel any doubt about her desires and make void any future claims to dissolve the marriage that is cheap. She confirms it afterwards. So it was so just in the spur of the moment, she confirms that she wants to marry a busted you or are, these are very carefully constructed episodes, uh, uh, to show, uh, basilio's a lawyerly skills. But as I am suggesting in this story, Sarah vantage probe deeper into the issue of marriage, uh, deeper than issues of the legal issues. He goes back to the, to marriage as a kind of transubstantiation the tress and dental metamorphoses of matter, the transformation of matter, the blending of bloods, literally that makes the union indivisible presumably.

Speaker 2:          29:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:23          In looking at the episode with this background in mind, it appears that Cervantes is favoring the clandestine, I do that area most of articulated

Speaker 1:          29:35          while at the same time, uh, having her on Basilea observe the rituals of, by the Council of Trent. It, it seems to be a middle course. Uh, the sacramental nature of marriage lurks in the subtext of the story through the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe. It is a tragic story, the myths of Pyramus and Thisbe in which a cruel fate befalls the young lovers because of a misinterpretation, although it could be read as an ad monetary tale about the recklessness of youth. The myth goes back to the conjunction of love and death at the moment when love ripens and is about to become regenerative, driven by desire. The young lovers are to meet at the tomb of knit Nina's where they die, not killed by the lioness, but by their own hands. The bloody veil can be seen as an image of the hymen rent in the act of love, that bloody event, uh, the renting of the hymen that also recalls the onset of menstruation.

Speaker 1:          30:42          That is the beginning of the capacity for reproduction, but also the recurrent death of a woman's ovum. The red of the trees. Fruit is both a symbol of resurrection and of death, as it recalls menstruation in, uh, in their recurring coloring. The Myth we reenacts the tragic human predicament symbolized by the spilling of blood at conception, birth and death, leaving open the possibility that the law here, the parents' disapproval, gun over comm or forestall the fatality of the situation. But the prohibition is also aligned to death because it is instrumental in bringing about the tragic ending in orbit. The conflict appears to resolve itself in beauty, the gorgeous red fruit of the tree. Instead of Antis. It goes further by way of contrast and comparison. We will, we will, uh, later see how Velasquez deals, whose class was class with classical myth in Cervantes. The Myth of pyramids on Tsp is given in shards fragments with, uh, a faint outline like a distant memory.

Speaker 1:          31:58          It looks forward stores Joyce, the Julissa's, uh, where these fragments appear more than backwards through the Middle Ages and the renaissance where the midst were more coherent. I am inclined to believe however that's Advantis had overt it's text in front of him or that he had a prodigious memory. For instance, when Basilio feigns being near death, his eyes are part of the act. If you remember, his eyes already turned in his head. He's playing, he's about to die. So he has his eyes turn his head, which recalls the moment when this B asks pyramids to answer, where, uh, I'm not going to read you the Latin because then I'm going to really sound like a priest saying mass. And, uh, but he heard the translation. She heard the name of this B, and he lifted his eyes with the weight of debt heavy upon them and saw her face and closed his eyes.

Speaker 1:          32:57          So the eyes, uh, the element, this is one of the shards that I say, uh, remain of the middle of my argument. My argument, uh, follows what I would like to call or what I like to call an itinerary of blood from the pregnant calf on the spit that sanctuary sees when they arrive at the wedding, which for tells of the sacrificial victim, the groom, which he replaces. It also recalls the violence at weddings, Romeo and Juliet being the most famous example in western literature. The violence, the blood announced just station and the spilling of more blood as the new human being. Uh, the most elemental purpose of marriage is produced. The consumption of the animals, the wine and the bread. Obvious Christian symbolism to, to consumer to consummate go together in a wedding celebration. As I said earlier, they consume the world around them, including the earth, through the wine.

Speaker 1:          33:58          It is a form again of transubstantiation. Transubstantiation is the, is the word for the Eucharist when the, when the body of Christ is transform into blood and wine it into bread and wine that is of transforming one substance into another through actions that involve both pleasure and violence. Hunting. Butch butchering, squashing the grapes and of course sex basilio's intervention. Postpones the blood could, would have shared in Camacho's bed substituted that for the fake blood that he has concealed these blood stains, his garment, the proxy blot suspends the real blood would seal the marriage. But I contend that there is another hidden blot that forestalls the consummation of the intended marriage between Camacho and criteria. And you don't have to follow me on this or, or, or, or, or, or, uh, be persuaded if you don't want to put it bluntly. I think that the is menstruating on her wedding day in the Spanish original it says [inaudible], I'll go this Colo Rita [inaudible] pass and us know we asked in component, but Aaliyah of any data, this was borders.

Speaker 1:          35:19          Jarvis, the ferric Italia looked a little pale location perhaps by want of rest the preceding night, which bright always employed in setting themselves off and dressing for their wedding day. Following this call, Florida in the Spanish not does not just mean Pale, a little pale, but to have lost once color because of an illness or a fright and components. It means to dress up of course, but also to recover from an illness. Why mentioned that she's Pale? I believe that the suggestion is that she's menstruating, menstruating menstruation is fraught with all kinds of prohibitions and lower in all cultures in hours going back all the way through the Old Testament. No menstruation in this case would have been a providential blood that would have impeded the consummation of Camacho's marriage. Postponing the terrios hi, menial or high menial blood and preserving it. Pro Basillio's bed. Keep telling us man, situation. Her regular, which is another word of saying, ah, menstruation in Spanish and it means rule simply rule.

Speaker 2:          36:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:33          Would it be a superior law inherent in the blood itself and determining the outcome of the conflict? Marriage is seen as ordained by God, part of the divine plan that supersedes customer law and overrides considerations of unequal social status. The process of marriage is embedded in blood itself. In the general transformation of matter. According to divine grace in the Bible, man and woman will become one flesh in marriage. You know, it's a pagan version. There is no salvation possible. The lover's fusion is only achieved as ashes in a funerary earn or in the beauty of a mulberry tree in bloom instead of one. This a form of justice have been made and there is every reason to believe that the commingling of broads will lead to regeneration. Do the birth of a new human being. This is the kind of conclusion that we did not find in part one, uh, where marriages are yet to occur. Accepting the tale about foolish curiosity where there is also a great deal of blood. If you remember, I think that, uh, uh, uh, in a deep sense said, Ron, this is true to, of it. And to the spirit of metamorphosis, Metta movement more the change of form, what has given you the Christian twist and translated into the present and Cervantes. The Myth is not retold with the didactic Sateri call or even a, or even aesthetic purpose. In fact, it is not so much retold as we cycled. It is not an Ovi Morley z.

Speaker 1:          38:33          Well read more highly say we're Joyce from 1340. There's a, there's a book by in French, by Pierre, which influenced the many, uh, writers, including Chaucer and into which 15 bookstore or chapters of the metamorphosis are turning into allegories. As I mentioned before, Maura allegories here, this is not, uh, uh, what sort of anthis does at all, either on the level of, uh, of marriage as a social institution and so forth or at that deeper level that I'm claiming, uh, uh, is total in this, in this, in this a sob story or subtext that I called the itinerary of blog. Now, in this use of myth, Cervantes, uh, resembles Velasquez. Um, so let us turn to Velasquez again. And uh, now we have to, uh, uh, doubts the lights or uh, but put the curtains down on, uh, Elaina is going to be good enough to be showing us some paintings by Velazquez that I used to want to discuss in this context. So if you wait a minute for the theatrical part of the presentation today to be prepared, I said, wow. All the way down, all the way now. Well where they are, he cannot go all the way down, but okay, that's good enough. And then we turn off the lights and I got to let my eyes adjust so that I can read my nuts.

Speaker 1:          40:23          Let's go to the [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          40:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:28          The Spanish philosopher, Jose Ortega, Iga sit who might have mentioned before, but I think that, uh, I want you to remember him as part of it. Can you see from this side? No.

Speaker 2:          40:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:07          Mentioned him before. He's the most important Spanish philosopher of the 20th century, known in this country, mostly for his book, the Revolution of the masses, but also, uh, he also should be read for many books, but one is the, the dehumanization of art, which is about the avant garde art. In any case, the Spanish philosopher Ortega, uh, claim that what Velasquez meant by mixing classical gods. We don't savory or ordinary characters from everyday reality is that there are no gods. I'm not dressing dental. Meaning if we take the gods to be the representation of the higher sense of things when seen in connection to each other, Velasquez, he says, is, I caught now or Tayga, an atheistic giant at colossal in pills. Man with his brush, he banishes the gods as if smacking them with a broom. I love the signally because you can think of the brush as a little broom as a smacking them with a broom in his back or now, which is this painting known in Spanish as Los Barrachos. The drunks in his back. I know that is not only no backers, but a rascal impersonating backers.

Speaker 2:          42:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:43          Baca now has nine figures, two of which seem to be dressed or rather Andress for a backing out and backing out back on us or feasts in honor of backers. The God of wine celebrated in the spring. And, and for, uh, these two guys who are near naked. The others are lusty peasants, roughly closed in contemporary dress. And with the same sort of casual, not post air that characterized the naturalistic genre scenes call in Spain bore the bonus, which is simply still lives in English and Spanish are called bull. They go on this, these paintings sought and achieve the effect of a casually chosen slice of life. But Baca Nile is carefully composed around the light flesh of the Bogles. Backhoes at the center, Jonathan Brown says, is one of the great experts on Velasquez. He wrote a book with Elliot. Oh, on Spanish architecture, uh,

Speaker 1:          44:03          that attempts to interpret the painting quote as a parody of the Olympian gods or what's a sermon on the evils of drink have failed. And instead Velasquez intended to represent backhoes as a giver of the gift of Wine, which freed man temporarily from the harsh unforgiving struggle of daily life. Deprived of the benefits in liquid, the bigger fines, no respite from the which in sober moments will be shared by all the company. This marvelous painting hangs or the Prado Museum and a, if you remember the worst by Auerbach about the supple plastic, uh, nature of set Avantis is art of the he's depiction of, of of things. I don't have an of sensuous. And you can see that there is, besides the connection I'm trying to establish here, uh, uh, uh, a kingship between Sylvana. This is art and that of a, of [inaudible]. And you can imagine these characters as appearing in episodes of the guilty. I'm sure. Look at this, uh, the, the face of stupor on this drunk, he has sort of, uh, uh, green, uh, of stupidity and uh, and drunkenness and the others, you know. Okay. This spinners last Elan Dennis was painted around 1657. It is, does a very, uh, late work, contemporaneous with Las Meninas and nearly as complex and as ambitious in it will ask us as combined two subjects, one from the classical mythology, um, and the other from his own time. It is a commonplace work seen as you can see.

Speaker 2:          46:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          46:19          There are in fact two stories from classical mythology combined in the picture, the fable of our acne and the story of Jupiter's rape of Europa. In the foreground we have the activities of tape, tapestry manufacturing as was done in the factories on the royal patronage in Madrid and in the alcove in the back. The classical tale of the weaver Arachni.

Speaker 2:          46:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:46          The scene takes place at a rock in a shop where as a great artist just visited by elegant ladies, the tapestry hanging on the back wall of the alcove, which is presumably an agonist work is the key to the relationship between the two, uh, scenes. It is a woven, a copy of Titian's the rape of Europa. Could you give me that painting?

Speaker 2:          47:14          Yes.

Speaker 1:          47:17          This is the actual painting by Titian, uh, the rape of Europa, which back to England Datas, which we find in the back.

Speaker 2:          47:28          Oops.

Speaker 1:          47:30          In that tapestry, the rape of Europa is one of the most celebrated of Jupiter's erotic adventures with, with mortal women. I, Rodney has challenged me nerve, a patroness of weavers and goddess of wisdom do a winning contest. It was called a drawl, but because her Agnes tapestry was judged to be the equal of Minerva's and further because it depicted such as candles act by her father, the God has punished Arachni by turning her into a spider. The story is also drawing from Ovid's metamorphoses book four, book six. I'm sorry. This is the reason we never really shown just during angrily.

Speaker 2:          48:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:19          Jonathan Brown again, believes that quote by inserting a quotation from this famous work, the rape of Europa into the composition Velasquez implies his belief in the nobility and trust in dental value of the art of painting in the spinners will ask us six to reconcile the artificial world of myth with a palpable world world of visual reality without sacrificing the decorum required for bye bye you the one and the various militude by the other that the courtroom by the classical myth and the various humility, the realism by the other, the contrast he goes on between the foreground, whereas 30 women toil, burdensome tasks and the refined atmosphere of the artists out the year. The scene in the back is perhaps we Alaska's way of implying is conviction about the distinction between craft and art. Well, this is fine. Uh, that's the end of the quote by John Brown, uh, on, at the time, uh, there was a raging dispute as to whether painters were artists or mere acquiescence. This may seem a strange to us, but there was,

Speaker 2:          49:33          yeah,

Speaker 1:          49:34          I don't, of course, Titian had been a favorite painter of jobs. The fifth reveal sanctuary and Phillip the second. So the painting is an homage to him and there is no doubt though by inserting Titian's painting into his Velasquez, he's putting himself at the same level. Well, there is a lot more to it. It seems to me as enough Meninas. There seems to be a revelation of the art of the act over testic creation, which in the painting has to do with Minerva and Arachni. But that taking the whole work, uh, in, in into consideration has to do with Velasquez. His own creation. Creation appears as a layered process that involves the real, this is the real either because art is a reflection of reality or because art illuminates reality, but also because reality on veils the artificiality of art in the spinners, we have paintings within paintings and the presence of in the foreground, uh, on depressant.

Speaker 1:          50:40          This is the present in the foreground, uh, uh, appears as a repetition of the classical past. But he said, but it is a repetition that is also a calm down. Can the present day spinners recall the myth of Arachni? It seems to me that what Velasquez is doing as sort of take, I said suggested about the backer. Now is it this diminishing the gods and also showing, uh, by showing me Nineveh's studio within the weaving shop, he showing the inner recesses of representation. It's back day stage tricks. Uh, I said where I see did I see showed in Las Meninas the whole painting is a disingenuous in other words is what I'm trying to say. What we take to be gods are like today's the spinners that weavers shop is no different from Minerva studio in both the deception of art are created to deceive man.

Speaker 1:          51:42          We see the contemporary weavers in relation to the classical fable and we see at the center of Alaska suspending painting a quotation from a masterpiece. It is again an infinitely receding Seaquist. It played of mirrors within this workshop of representation that we are being given here, which is like giving us a worst, a workshop of Engonnia. Therefore, by giving us the workshop is giving us, it is a desk in Gunyah. Now the process is similar to what's the advantage does in commercials wording episode and how the whole of the Keyhole, uh, an an an an an of the whole of the chaotic, uh, dealing with myth. They favor of pyramids and things we takes place in fabulous Babylon. Got Mattress wedding takes place in an insignificant village in Spain. What about senior dogs is to use the artist artistry of the fable to receive those in attendance, particularly Camacho on his friends, but also the Quixote Saint John, even the reader who does not know what is happening until the moment that the trick is revealed to bring the story to a climax and eventual resolution.

Speaker 1:          52:55          There is a mirroring, mirroring of myth and pressing reality and the elaboration of a deceit through artistry, acting, playing the role of the mythological, playing the role of a mythological pyramids on the, uh, Basillio pain, that role acting it out. It is both an in Ganja on Edison Gagnon making up the whole story. The backstage of representation is displayed as in Las Meninas and as we shall soon see in the episode involving master bedroom, he ness the buzz Avanti as puppeteer and most revealingly in the culminating episode in the whole of the, the, the, the, the one about Montesinos cave in which we are, which we are given the whole underpinning of donkey halters madness is actual subconscious now, whereas in part once Cervantes seems to be addressing the romances of chivalry and the picaresque as models and sources. In part two, he takes up the grand tradition of homer offered virtual and Dante, particularly in episodes. So just the Cave of Montesinos and the pageant in the forest. The more we'll be seeing soon, this is very significant. It seems to me that he now knows that he is in their league and that he has created a literary character that will endure like theirs and like the characters in classical mythology.
