Speaker 1:          00:01          What is the significance of the real date on Sanchez letter? One wonders, uh, I don't have a ready answer for it, but remember that it does have the real date. It is obviously the date. Once advantage is writing this part of the [inaudible], it may be a way of emphasizing, uh, the, the novel is dealing with current, uh, history and situating the novel chronologically in a specific way. Uh, this is why, uh, the letter a is given a date. It didn't have to have a date, but I think that that is the reason why, uh, I think, I think that's the best answer that I can give to the, uh, to the question of why that letter, what the significance, what that date on the letter and what the significance of of it is. Uh, but this is the sort of detail that I want you to look for. Remember, uh, my mantra details, details, details, literature is made of specific concrete details nor have obstructions like philosophy. And this is why it is important to remember to notice details and to base your interpretations on the details.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Now as we move closer to the end of the Quixote, I would like to make some general comments and revisit some of the themes that I have touched upon earlier as a way of summing up our reading of this great classic that we have been, uh, uh, reading all semester. In the last lecture I talked about the increasing presence of Virgil and have is an need and suggested that Cervantes is hinting of the significant responsibility that his protagonist is assuming, which is quite different from that of the ancient hero, but no less important to conquer himself, to come to grips and control his madness and to assimilate the, uh, his new one realization of the vanity of his dreams and the futility of his quest. His task is to bring himself to harmony with the world in which he lives full of imperfections and disappointments and to assure and to assume a resigned attitude towards it and prepare for his impending death.

Speaker 1:          02:47          If at the beginning of the semester, I caught it, Luke Arch George Lucas, actually Hungarian critic to the effect that the Quixote was the epic of a world abandoned by God. Don't be this epic task within the novel is to cope with such a world to conquer such a world. I said, wow, his is a very modern condition in that sense, but not necessarily a despairing one. This, I think is what the novel shows as the hero begins his return home. And this is why I'm asking you to try to finish it. Uh, don't get hopeless. Change is gradual. And it began with I think, DCNS enchantment by Sanshou, the shock of, uh, see, uh, these, uh, peasant woman, uh, as routine now. And it peaked I think during the, the, the dissent to the cave of Montesinos us. We, uh, as we mentioned, uh, I think that he will, he will display or he is displaying now a deepened kind of wisdom, nowhere more memorably than in the council.

Speaker 1:          04:13          He gives sanctuary and his, uh, as his squire is prepared to take over the government of the island of Barataria. You remember that episode when Gnocchi halted takes central aside and after telling him not to gloat, uh, about his great fortune, but to thank God that this happened to him without his really even, even trying evincing a somewhat, a little bit of a Mb, uh, we're all don Quixote here. He takes him aside to give him some, uh, some council. Um, this passage of the Kihatha is one of the more anthologized once in the, uh, Spanish speaking world. I know I'm a judge in Puerto Rico who has these pages framed in gold in his office and he shows him, shows him proudly to anyone who happens to be near, uh, uh, they are wonderful, uh, uh, uh, this wonderful advice that not be haughty. It gives sanctuary, uh, and, uh, there are obvious philosophical and literary sources and don't be hopeless wisdom. Um, and, uh, uh, there are also obvious critical statements that referred to the current situation in Spain and Pyre, particularly the council regarding the corruption of people in power and in government. These are Barb's or the situation, uh, the, at the, at the, uh, Spanish in a bureaucracy. Uh,

Speaker 2:          06:08          okay.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Donkey hottest, uh, advice, uh, how bookish sources, uh, but they also sound deeply felt and also as if they were a grounded in a experience. This is the, the, the knowledge of, uh, a mature man and look, the whole day is more than a mature man. He's an old man by the standards of the age. So, uh, he is an imposition to counsel Sandra who's younger. And of course, uh, his squire,

Speaker 2:          06:47          uh,

Speaker 1:          06:49          the counterparts to Don Quixote's wisdom are Sanchez proverbs, uh, which expressive folks who kind of cuteness and knowledge of humankind.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Uh,

Speaker 1:          07:05          and that's what we have seen in Saint Joe can spew proverbs, uh, of the drop of a hat. Proverbs, proverbs have been taken to be the accumulated wisdom of the ages, stored in the common memory of mankind and were of great interest to renaissance thinkers, uh, renaissance thinkers who were keenly, uh, attracted by language and the knowledge that it contained, uh, on, uh, both, uh, both as a system of communications that is language has grammar and also for the contents of, uh, the lore that it's stored not only Latin and Greek, the classics as the human is we're interested in, of course, as we know in the classics and in Latin and Greek and Hebrew. But, uh, also in, in the vernacular languages that were, uh, in which they were immersed. They were very, very interested in that. And in fact, uh, there is a whole science of the study of proverbs, uh, whose name is in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          08:12          I don't know if the word exists in English, but a mural here. They study of proverbs. Uh, there seem to be many more in Spanish than in English. Anyway. Uh, I, I feel that way, but probably because Spanish is my native language. But I remember a summer nights at the, uh, squaring Salamanca Beautiful Town Square in Salamanca sitting around with professors of language and see who could say more proverbs. And then also we invented the game that one would say the first part of a proverb and another would the second part of another one that had nothing to do with it. So it was a, it was a really, uh, great, uh, game of proverbs. Um, try it. It's fun. So, uh, what I'm saying is that provers are very much a part of the, of their language and they are a kind of a store house of wisdom and this is the counterpart of donkey is more bookish, uh, uh, kind of, of knowledge.

Speaker 1:          09:23          The interest in grammar of course was that, that, uh, it was thought that grammar and rec and rhetoric could reveal the very workings of the human mind. And this is where human is. We're interested in it. Um, so now in the end sanctuaries, wisdom is not going to be different from that of Don Quixote and it is certainly not inferior and in practice proves to be quite effective. Of course, Don Quixote's, uh, advice extends to Sanchez, uh, appearance, more of dress to clip his fingernails and to what, what, where on different occasions, how to have his wife behave so that you won't show that she's just depressant and all of that. That is the funny part of the, of the advice. But Saint Joe's knowledge, Santos wisdom is up to the, uh, to the task. Um, Sanchez acumen is sufficient for him to deal with the challenges of government as it is for him to face the challenges of his own life.

Speaker 1:          10:39          Sanctuary is endowed with natural reason. This is a medieval concept that I have mentioned before that courses through the renaissance and reaches the enlightenment where it will be instrumental in the elaboration of modern ideas about democracy. Ideas that we all share, uh, today. Uh, it is ultimately, as I have said several times a common Christian doctrine that we are all endowed by God with enough intelligence, uh, to make it in the world no matter what our station in life or level of education. But at the end of the episode on successful, through no fault of his own sanctuary ruse that he, that he was not born to be a governor. He says he accepts the social order, which was based in spite of what I've just said about natural reason was based strictly on the ideology that a personal social station was determined by God and that it was best or central says to stick to what you are and who the conditioning to which you were born.

Speaker 1:          11:52          Uh, this is, uh, uh, a conflictive a moment in the, in, in, in the novel. Uh, but the fact is that he has done very well as governor and only the deceptions of the Duke and his minions rob him of his real achievements, real achievements in this fictional world and what she accomplished them. We both remember now, uh, in connection to this, remember our box theory about the birth of realism on the Sediment Millie's that is the, the common, uh, discourse, uh, of Christianity. So it can see that all of this is, uh, is, is, is, is connected. Uh, but the contradiction of course, he said within the society which society that is crumbling. As I have been saying, uh, this distinctions is social distinctions are, are important. They're crumbling. Because look, the most clever fellow in this whole episode is the, is this toward who after all is a servant and sanctuary dose? Uh, very well as a governor, I said, governor, so, uh, this is the overall theme of today's class has to be that, that this, uh, the social structures, uh, are crumbling now. Uh, the, so we moved to the island of Barataria. Let us begin with, uh, by talking about the name in the, uh, in the original sanctuary. First to the island in Sula. Let me put it with this first more so you can see the accident.

Speaker 3:          13:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:38          W and lowercase in Sula. Now, of course, by this time, the word for Ireland in Spanish was already the current word, which is from the Latin and the Latin. When you had, uh, two consonants like that, the tendency in the romance languages was for the second one to absorb the first one. So the therefore from insulin you get east La, and in French you get Ila. Now that's a little bit of philology. Uh, so Sangio repeats in Sula, uh, oh, nowhere that it is an a cake word than for island. That donkey day uses because he has learned it. Reading the Romances of Chivalrous, something that you lose completely in the translation is the fact that donkey hot day, whenever the issue of chivalrous arises or of Deucey, Neha lapses into a kind of our cake Spanish. This is not, this is not done in the translation. Meaning he will say, uh,

Speaker 3:          14:59          oh,

Speaker 1:          15:03          for instance, fairly Moza for Eric Moser.

Speaker 3:          15:10          Yes.

Speaker 1:          15:15          Which is the, uh, west by then already the current Spanish word for beautiful it a Mossad. Did you want a little more energy comes from the Latin, from Pharma for Masa shapely. Totally. How the island of Formosa, uh, technology is fascinating. Uh, so we're never know. Quixote talks about you Roderick things. He, uh, he uses far bladder for a bladder because by the 16th century, the f the Latin, uh, had become a h and a silent h. Um, so Sandra uses in Sula, uh, as the one he wants to rule an insular island and he's using this archaic word. So in Sula Barataria because of this usage in the Quixote, the word insula has a currency in Spanish nowadays, even if famous journal in Madrid, a Insula, uh, after, uh, this archaic word uses we use by Don Quixote on Santo. No Barataria I can never find the Harris but artadia comes from Barato

Speaker 1:          16:52          but alto means cheap. So this will be cheap island. She piled on cheap island both because of its low cost and he's, and it's shoddy, fragile, fragile construction. It is like a stage set to perform the play that the Stuart has prepared. It is cheap. Then also in the sense that the island is not real. I think that a better translation if we were going to translate everything will be something like Chins. The island would be the name of it. Of course, Sandra has Sanjaya does not pierce through the name to realize that this is not a very uh, uh, promising name for his, for his kingdom to have to be ruling cheap island. He doesn't know exactly. He doesn't know at all what, what means, but that's it. This is what, what it means. But our body now let us begin by pointing out the sources of the Stuarts invention. The practice of making someone king for the day was common in carnival celebrations throughout Europe since the Middle Ages and further back to [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          18:18          Uh, the joke that he's, the humor was in seeing how a low class dolt would act out his role as a king or to have someone play the role of, uh, someone from the lower classes trying to act like a king. They could also be just a skit. But part of the carnival practice, uh, was to make somebody a king for the day. Uh, this involved in this [inaudible] and this kind of carnivals and inversion of roles. We have echoes of that, uh, in, uh, in, in today's secret societies here in, uh, fraternities when they have that day where, where the, the, the pledges are in charge of the brothers. All of those things that I'm sure you have heard about our atavistic retention. So this carnival type, uh, uh, of ritual where you make someone a king for a day. In fact, in the 1950s, there was a TV show called Queen for a day.

Speaker 1:          19:23          I don't know if you've ever heard of it, uh, in which a common housewife was crowned queen for the day in the show. And she got to to rule over people. And two a and two have anything she wanted and and, and so forth. Um, yeah, television incorporated, some of this, um, carnivalesque, uh, practices. Now the practice extends to other cultures beyond the western tradition besides, uh, the practice of making a stranger king and then deposing him is one so prevalent that Sir James Frazier, I've mentioned him before, but you've got to remember his name, Sir James Fraser, f, r, a. V. E. R, a devoted, uh, many pages of his classic, the Golden Bough, uh, to this, uh, to this practice. The idea was to punish the ruler for the perquisites that he enjoyed wellbeing king and for not having been able to solve problems such as droughts and other natural catastrophes. We'll see this later when I quote Freud.

Speaker 1:          20:43          So they're stored is basing his elaborate prank on a traditional routine. Though he does take it to an extreme. This is not just king for a day, but for several days. And, uh, I said it and it's consistent in this expansion and this exaggeration with the baroque character of part two. The point is that the whole thing is supposed to be a joke, uh, Santos expense and it is part of the merriment, the Duke and Duchess Palace. It is also a part of the Marymount for the participants in this whole charade. They are acting it out as if, as if this were a carnival. Uh, there are other, uh, traditional elements in the, uh, in the episode traditional, uh, um, act. They should all scenes, uh, for instance, the wanting, which sancocho passes judgment on several cases that come up before him. Uh, he said traditional one that goes back even to the Bible console him on me.

Speaker 1:          21:59          And, uh, and also in folk traditions, the traditions of riddles that rulers or wise men are supposed to, uh, to solve. Uh, the tradition of Oracle's, uh, back to the Greek, uh, cause the Greeks unsold Sanko solves several complicated cases. Every single one of them coming from folk tradition. Uh, but hilarious at the same time I bought Berkeley probably because of it. They are hilarious. Uh, for instance, central solves and kick a case involving an alleged rape. This is a very funny episode where the, the, uh, uh, the man is accused of having raped this woman. Uh, the man furthermore is the lowest of the lowest. So presumably this is, these are all people acting out. He's a, he's a hog herder pig keeper. I mean, this is the lowest I remember in the first part when the, the keeper of pigs arrives and, uh, even dimension of the word Wetico in Spanish, uh, has to be followed by, excuse me, work for pig.

Speaker 1:          23:18          Uh, and he's supposed to have forced himself on this, uh, on this woman. Uh, and, uh, uh, on Santo has to decide on, he has, remember this, he asked, uh, the, the man gave her a bag of money and, and uh, when she's leaving, he, let's take it from her. And she fights like, like, uh, an animal. So it was not to give up the money. And then he says, well, if you had defended yourself that it would have been no, no rate. But this is a case, remember, uh, that I mentioned this in, Eh,

Speaker 1:          24:00          when I talked about the, uh, the prisoner of sex is a case of four Nicasio simplex case of simple fornication. Uh, the, uh, inquisition and Spanish law had classified fornication, the inquisition in its laws and all that followed the scholastic practice of classifications. Very, are you still, are you still telic? So there was simple fornication and then qualified fornication of which there were several kinds depending on where the simple fornication is, is, is sex between two people who are on married and have different sex. And then complex, complex fornication comes when the people are of the same sex. One is married, uh, that both are married, but to other people and so forth. That's the, yeah. So this is a case of 40 of simplex. That sanctuary, the judge is passing, uh, uh, his, uh, sentence, uh, on it. It is one of the, uh, uh, traditional stories now. Then he has to, he's presented with a very complicated case, uh, about, uh, glad up. Better Lady now, Clara Clear Pedal Edema derived from peril, clear peril. She's quite apparel.

Speaker 1:          25:20          Remember, this is the, this is a young woman presumably in this completely made up story within the made up story. You know, the usual receiving sequence instead of Lantis, uh, who is half beautiful and have horrible. And if you turn to your page, uh, seven 69, uh, I say then the country man that this son of mine who is to be the bachelor of fell in love in the same village with a downsell called Collada [inaudible] daughter of our breast Pellegrino, a very rich farmer and his name of parallel going on these name of Pellegrino game. Not to them by lineal or any of the descent, but because of that race, all of that race are subject to the policy. And two men, the name, they call them parallel Ryans though to say the truth, the downsell is luck. Any oriental a peril and looked at on the right side seams the very flower of the field.

Speaker 1:          26:25          But on the left you start quite so fair for on that side. She wants an eye, which she lost by the small pox. And though the pits in her face are many on deep admirer, say they are not pits, but sid packers, we're in the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is so clean that to prevent the filing her face, she carries her nose so crooked up. But it seems to be flying from her mouth. And for all that she looks extremely well for. She has a large mouth and did. And did she not lock half a score or a docent and did she not like half a score or a dozen teeth and grinders, she might pass and make a figure among ladies of the best fashion. I say nothing of her lips and so on. Uh, central sees through all of this as something made up, uh, and refuses to, uh, for grantees.

Speaker 1:          27:16          But this is a very interesting figure because I've mentioned in the last class the figure of the monster who's made up of contrasting features of opposing features. In the case of three folding, it was the black robe on the Hawaii, a beard, black and white. And here it is extreme beauty on one half and on the other, this horrendous, uh, face for puck mark and lacking and I, and all of that. The, the two very opposites clashing in one a figure. This is in reference to the, this Baroque, uh, the brokenness of part two, but also to show, uh, Saint Josephs, uh, uh, sharp wit to see through, uh, this, uh, Prac that they're trying to play on him within the prank that he is already undergoing. If you compare Clara to Murray Torres, you see that Marie Darnell's is not that symmetrical, but it our will all be from the top down. Uh, and uh, whereas here we have a perfect, a perfect symmetry. I said, I have the door. Now you have to remember always, um, uh, keep insisting on the, this is all made up by the Stewart who is the author of this whole charade.

Speaker 1:          28:38          Now they just have the episode is given by the story himself. When he says in page seven, 90, 80, 81, I think, uh, uh, (790) 801-0780 eight, 81, uh, seven 80, 81, when he says my Lord Governors scores the Stuart speaks so well that I wanted to hear a man. So void of learning as your worship who I believe cannot, not so much as read, say such and so many things and all sorts and tensions and instructive and so far beyond all that could be expected from your worships former understanding by those who sent us and by us who are come hitter. But everyday producers, new things just turn into Ernest and jokers are joked upon. Uh, it is good to remember here and I'm going to repeat a quote from a, that American is Ruth Elsa far. That is very appropriate, uh, to uh, uh, at this point.

Speaker 1:          29:47          And I'll repeat it. She, she wrote all of part two is based on the mistaken assumption on the part of the would be all controlling character authors that they can deal with the fictional character. I maintain at the same time a distance, which allows them never to slip into that fictional world with which they plan to entertain themselves. Luxon zone. They are trapped from two directions. They are controlled to some extent from within their play by the very characters whom they intend to manipulate and from without, by an author of whom they are unaware, but who's will and whose hand or uh, that they do is contrived. And this is the case here of course, of the steward who is himself acknowledging that the, uh, things have turned out, uh, not quite the way that he had planned that he and the Duke and Duchess had had planted, which was of course to have a fun at the expense of central. But central turns out on the contrary, uh, to be, uh, quite a good, uh, uh, governor and so that they will start turned. This is another one of this inversions that are happening regularly in part two of the, uh, of the Quixote, uh, is also good to notice that, uh, the story is aware of, uh, of both of his, uh, construction of this whole episode and have, it's a sort of collapse

Speaker 1:          31:18          now in a larger sense. Uh, Barataria has to do with the breakdown of Aristocratic Authority and the emergence of the common man as a potential ruler. Sankyo proves to be wise beyond all expectations and in spite of all the pranks, uh, that he and his master endure as we've Globulin you. The episode that we discussed in the last class is dignity remains untouched and the markers are the ones who are, who are marked central became a good governor. This is the ironic result. It counter intuitive resolution that towards the designs of the Duke and Duchess and that under minds the authorial intentions of the steward who obviously wanted sanctuary to provide the humor but acting stupid.

Speaker 2:          32:14          And, uh,

Speaker 1:          32:16          this is in part, and this is something that I had not mentioned before, but uh, that uh, is easy to figure out this or miss readings of part one on the part of characters in part two, they assume that the characters are going act in a certain way by the way. They have interpreted part one and they have interpreted part one with Sandra as a buffoon. Saint Joe's, Joe's a comic character, uh, which is the way by that Avi Geneva interpreted a Saint Joe's. We uh, if we remember the class whenever you Neda, uh, so it's good to keep this in mind that these are miss reading. So on the part of the Stewart on the part of the Duke and Duchess who expect though Quixote on Saint Jo to act in a certain way. So these are, uh, mistakes, uh, in the reading.

Speaker 2:          33:18          Uh, no,

Speaker 1:          33:27          besides the folkloric sources that I have mentioned of Barbaria, uh, the background is also a literary and philosophical. Uh, it is a self contained society presumably to be well run. This is the humanistic theme of Utopia. Going back to Thomas Moore. You remember, I have been mentioning all along the names of important renaissance, uh, figures, uh, that, uh, but you must, uh, that you should remember,

Speaker 2:          34:13          uh,

Speaker 1:          34:17          for, is it easy for you? We just check it out. And your Wikipedia, uh, more was the author of Utopia, the book of the same name, which was published in 15, 16. Also Tommaso come Banella come Panella, uh, 1568, 1639 who published a city of the sun in 1602, which was also a utopia.

Speaker 2:          34:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:57          This is the idea that a perfect society can be established on this earth following a rational design. The concept goes back, of course, to Plato's republic and to all the treaties is that begin to appear in the renaissance about the art of government, including of course, Machiavelli's the prince that I have mentioned several times here.

Speaker 1:          35:28          This, the prince is salts in the background here because sanctuary is trying to act like the perfect prince, like the perfect ruler, and hence Machiavelli's the prince is in the background of this episode. So see how many important, uh, renaissance thinkers are behind, uh, uh, this in this episode. But what does it mean? I mean, you taught this week, you should teach your doctors, by the way, are the origin of modern political systems or the idea that that with the political system you can create or improve a society to America like a utopia is in the 18th century where particularly this is ideas will become a reality. And they have become, of course, as we know, nightmares in the 20th century. Some of these utopias of turned out to be quite the opposite, uh, to the point that you've had to have walls to keep the, uh, the people inside of them.

Speaker 1:          36:27          But so this is the idea, uh, that you can rationally create a perfect society. Uh, and uh, so what is it here in this episode of the Quixote? Is it a parody of this, uh, notions of Utopia? I mean, but at Aria is a mark utopia, of course, with a fake king and all is being, uh, an all it all ends in a, in a, in a great catastrophe. Uh, is it, is it a parody showing the futility of such attempts, but it could be, I think that the episode is important enough and given enough relevance in the book to invite interpretations of this kind

Speaker 3:          37:23          now.

Speaker 1:          37:25          Yeah. Being an island reflects other things. Three of them. For instance, one of the idea, one, the idea of self containment and self sufficiency of roundness as it were. And at one point it is referred to us [inaudible] round the island is round and islands tend to be self contained because of course they're surrounded by, by water. Uh, to I think about that also reflects the recently discovered islands of the Caribbean recently, you know, a late 15th century, early 16th century where the Spaniards, uh, attempted to create societies almost from the ground up, uh, in the, in Hispaniola, uh, in Cuba. Uh, and also the wished for, but never reached islands of the classical tradition. This, this word called,

Speaker 3:          38:27          okay,

Speaker 1:          38:34          I'm going to put it in English and the islands

Speaker 3:          38:36          and the, okay.

Speaker 1:          38:43          This way you get the name for until the, until it's comes from those before islands, islands, these were fugitive violence. There's islands that you saw in the distance and you were supposed to arrive at and they, uh, like the oasis in the desert as you came closer, they, they get, they got further and further away. But suggesting that this were Ireland said you wanted to reach on that where perhaps you would find utopia or an oasis or something. Of course, when this level, the island has the quality of elusiveness that one would associate with Atlantis. So you can see, uh, the depth of this episode and Becky Hilty, uh, by, by, by, by dint of the many sources, ideas and books that it has behind it. Now, Freud mentions this episode in totem and taboo and he's, he's taken this episode is very instructive. Now remember I mentioned I think in an earlier class that Freud was a devoted reader of Cervantes. And that as a, as an adolescent, he created a servant, this club with several friends to read Cervantes and discuss it and so forth. And they even give themselves names from characters in sort of some of the exemplary stories and all of that. Now,

Speaker 1:          40:07          as you can see, as you will see, uh, Freud interprets this episode, uh, by you sort of reducing it to his own system of course thinkers thing. To do that he examines fraud examiners the suffering king, the suffering a king get must undergo to pay for his exalted position in the traditions that I have already mentioned in Frasier, remember to Freud, this is played out chiefly in the hilarious scene where Santo is denied food. Uh, Freud is drawing an analogy between certain neurosis and the behavior of primitives, focusing on the ambivalent attitude towards kings and it's analogue in the relationship with children to their fathers.

Speaker 3:          40:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:58          People to the king, children to fathers. He says, I quote here, the importance of a particular person. It's extraordinarily heightened and his omnipotence is raised to the improbable in order to make it easier to attribute to him the responsibility for everything painful that happens to a patient. Savages really do not act differently towards their rulers when they ascribe to them power over rain and shine, wind and weather and then the throne or killed them. Because nature has disappointed their expectation of a good hunt or a ripe harvest. Of course you can see the of the father, the Omnipod and father, uh, on, on hence the, the, the, all of the theories Freud had about the oedipal, uh, uh, complex and all that. He goes on those also, the taboo ceremonial of kings is nominally an expression of the highest veneration because their relationship to the father is an ambiguous one of veneration and hostility and a means of guarding them.

Speaker 1:          42:01          Actually, it is the punishment for their elevation, the revenge which their subjects take upon them, the experiences which Cervantes makes sense. Japan central banks down the girl was governor, governor of his island have evidently made him recognize this interpretation of courtly ceremonial as the only correct one. It is very possible that this point would be corroborated if we could induce kings and rulers of today to express themselves from the point here. Freud is of course being ironic and we're going to ask kings and rulers today if they want to undergo this kind of process. Of course. Uh, then he goes on to make the, uh, unavoidable comparison with the Christian myth. He goes, why? The emotional attitude towards rulers, it should contain such a strong unconscious share of hostility is a very interesting problem. We have already referred to the infant towel father complex. We may add that an investigation of the early history of kingship would bring the decisive explanations.

Speaker 1:          43:04          Frasier sergers, a freshman who I mentioned has an impressive discussion of the theory that the first kings where strangers who after a short rain, we're destined to be sacrifice at solemn festivals. That's representatives of the DDT. But Frazier himself does not consider these facts all together. Convincing Christian myths are said to have been still influenced by the after effects of this evolution of kings. Okay. The idea of the laying of, of, of Jesus Christ, King of the Jews and so forth. Uh, but you can see how these illuminates what is going on with [inaudible] with, uh, with central bank said how Freud's take on this helpless, understand better the mechanism, the mechanisms. Now this is part of the traditional background. Uh, but also of course, the, the, the nightmare of finally getting what you crave and not being able to quite get your hands on it. You know, those wish fulfillment dreams where you have that Kate core, let's put it in those terms.

Speaker 1:          44:04          I'm not given an erotic twist, uh, that pie or something that you, that you want and that you're about to get and you don't quite get. Uh, but also the disappointment of achieving, uh, things, things are never quite that we imagine or desired. I mean B, but they say it's be careful what you wish because you may get it. And once you get it, it may turn out to be not exactly what you expected. And there is something of that here too. This is, this is the strong dissing Gagnon element of these episodes, uh, on this, uh, on this island. The, the scene that's so fascinated. Freud in which bear that or rescue they are widow. That's the name we might want to also unpack. This is the doctor. They're very funny doctor who keeps saying, no, no, no, you can't eat that. Oh No, no. God, that's the worst you can eat. No, no, no, no. You cannot eat that. Uh, but bed plus your man's hard heart. This [inaudible] you're treating me hard. You say in Spanish, uh, the I widow come be a last name, but aware of means omen urban model are Wedo it bad omen and he isn't [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          45:41          that's the name of the town who comes from it. You know what I mean? Is like keep you out is what it means. Keep you out. When I was a kid and you wanted to get rid of this kid, an adult will tell him, go see so and so and ask her to give you some 10 tier. Yeah. Keep you there. Uh, don't have to give you some 10. Yeah. Keep you there. So [inaudible] is more or less like a, like that this is quite a remarkable character. This, that this doctor, uh, this is a very more yeah, like seeing if you read them all. Yeah. In Malia, there is always this a hilarious criticism of doctors. We're always toying around with a huge animal, trying to give an enema to somebody. And, uh, that sort of thing or whenever the situation is, uh, is difficult, they begin declining Latin, uh, nouns and verbs because of course, the idea is to know Latin well, to be able to read the sources of, uh, uh, because, uh, medicine was at this point, it's still very scholastic based on all of this, on sources, on written sources, more than one experience, some overdubs and experience.

Speaker 1:          46:54          See, part of the Baroque is the clash between this scholastic traditional knowledge that does not stand up to actual experience. And this is why the critique of medicine is so important and so relevant. It's not just funny because it's hilarious. It's very, very, very funny. But it's also very significant because it reflects a condition of the time.

Speaker 2:          47:22          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          47:23          no, the n of Saint Joe's government, he's got strong topic as you know. Uh, and there's one episode in which like the fall from the horse, uh, with the Foa of course explodes. He may have been, uh, uh, injured. Um, now Barataria is also lack a laboratory experience on fiction unfiction making. How does one create a fictional world coherent within itself? All fictional novels or stories are the creation of a coherent world within itself. Uh, one that is round as it were, the fiction, uh, obviously gets out of hand of the steward. He cannot quite stand outside of it. Uh, uh, like a puppeteer. And this is parallels to, to master pier on his puppet show. Uh, and perfection of course, of this

Speaker 1:          48:32          fictional world cannot be, uh, quite achieved. And this is parallels to, of course Sylvana situation. Vis-A-Vie uh, the, uh, Nicky Haughty, uh, one way that I imagine it is, I mean, if this is the world of fiction, the Creator, uh, the story is here trying to control it, but he winds up here and once he is inside, he does not have the all encompassing perspective and he has all of the problems that the characters he has created have. So that is the, the this or the irony comes in and this is where, uh, we're, we're bought, on the other hand, this effort to create this self contained, coherent fiction anticipates what Macondo the fictional village in 100 years of solitude. Komala the fictional village in blue for Pedro Paramo. If you're not aware of this, uh, room for one room for the great Mexican writer and he's normal that I read it all.

Speaker 1:          49:49          Sell from the idea of you talked yet to also to the idea of creating a fictional world. You see, the connection is all behind the island of, uh, of party Barataria. Now, uh, we are going to talk, uh, next, uh, in the next class about LTC Laura, this mark Ddo Dido that I hope you, uh, uh, you are reading, uh, and also about doing your Rodriguez. This is the one whose daughter is impregnated and whose, uh, whose boyfriend refuses to marry her and they don't put pressure on him because he's the son of the person who lends money to the Duke and Duchess. Uh, this is that she's a very interesting character. She's the one who reveals the physical defects of the Dutcher's unwell, Dizzy Dora. What are the physical defects of this women? Uh, the Dodgers are sort of the beautiful hunters and all of that apparently has some sores in her legs that, uh, that, uh, which some liquid flows.

Speaker 1:          50:55          As you see, Laura has bad breath. This is beautiful, LTC Laura who sings, I don't know that, uh, during your Rodriguez with great, uh, resentments actually has a consol, the tired breath. Uh, so she has a, these are defects that we're not going to, we would not have found in the idealize women of part one and a. So this is significant about, uh, about, uh, [inaudible] Rodriguez and the things that Ge, uh, Ge, uh, reveals. But I want to finish by, uh, by talking about Don Quixote and sank to the pair because I came across two recent articles on the two of them as a pair that I want to sort of summarize, uh, for you. One is by Antonio carrying your Rodriguez. I emphasize the RS and the [inaudible] and Tonio.

Speaker 3:          52:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          52:08          Um, I'm [inaudible] talks about the influence of okay. Hotel on St Joe on modern modern comedy pairs a switch as Abbott and Costello, Oliver and hardy on even takes it all the way up to characters in Seinfeld. Uh, uh, a a a show. God, I have to confess, I have never in my life seen. Uh, but he has a picture here, uh, uh, of characters from that, uh, the show not apparently show a, a decided influenced from a Doki haughty and San Jo. He also gives the folkloric background of this pairs going back to the Middle Ages and projected projected then forward on to the present. I mean, I want to Costello, one is fat. Uh, the straight man who, uh, and then the, the, uh, you can see immediately the moment I mentioned that, yes, this is don Quixote and sanctuary in, in, in, in, in film. The other, uh, it's an article by my friend Edwin Williamson, who's a distinguished Oxford Hispanic, and it has to do with what it turns the power struggle between luxury hotel sanctuary, which is resolved ultimately in favor of the squire because Don Quixote's having to beg him to please let us give himself the lashes necessary to disenchant Lucy.

Speaker 1:          53:37          Now he mentions four episodes, the fooling hammers or no Quixote hits him over the head. Uh, and, uh, the enchanted [inaudible], Neha, when there is an inversion of, of roles and a sanctuary is now the one creating the, uh, evaluate, uh, kind of reality out of a normal everyday, uh, alive, uh, Merlin's prophecy when he states that it is Sandra who must give himself the lashes on his behind to disenchant Lucy now, which then makes donkey hotter dependent on sandwich. Uh, and, and finally a chapter that you, uh, an episode you may not have read yet in chapters 60. The fight between the two of them when a donkey hot Quixote tries to force central to give himself lashes and two takes his clothes off to, to give him the lashes. And Central wrestles don Quixote to the ground and puts his knee on his chest and says he will not do that.

Speaker 1:          54:43          Uh, Williamson gives an appropriately, uh, uh, political reading to this a power struggle. Uh, and, uh, which, which I agree. I think that he's a unduly harsh about the end when he, he sees that sanctuary is being totally cynical, even a donkey halters deathbed. I think that that Williams from when a little bit too far there, but I want to in conclusion today to read you read you his conclusion because it is very much in tune with what I have been saying about Barataria and the rice of the common man to a position of uh, government Cervantes. Moreover says Williamson was not aware of the wider political dimension of the power struggle that he had first Adam braided as far back as a fooling mills filling hammers episode in part one in the final crisis when the night has been forced to the ground by his squire Sanchez defiant assertion.

Speaker 1:          55:51          Are you domain Ami [inaudible] me Sr. I helped myself because I have my own master inevitably carries political resonances for eating plies, a conscious rejection of the traditional basis of authority and status and portents the emergence of a different world or world that's Advantis himself must have imagined with this quiet if not with dread, those at the heart of the Quixote. There is an intriguing irony. Instead of one test may well have started out on his adventure of writing with the purely literary aim of discrediting the Makena malformed dollar of that. You've all read romances, but by a series of logical steps arising from the interaction of master and servant, he was led to undermine the principle of hierarchy. That was the cornerstone of the ideology of his day. We would continue with this and other themes in that next class.
