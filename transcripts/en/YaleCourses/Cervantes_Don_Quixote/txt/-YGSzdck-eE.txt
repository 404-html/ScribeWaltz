Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah, I want to return briefly to this and Ganja because there may be some confusion caused by disillusionment. The English word used to translate the term which is an approximation. Uh, as, uh, all translations are, uh, busy illusion meant, uh, can mean in English disenchantment and disappointment words that have a very negative connotation, whereas this in Ganja does not quite have that connotation. Uh, at worse it could mean resignation. Meaning I was resigned to find out that such and such a person was not as good as I thought him or her to be. Uh, remember the quote from Otis Green that I, uh, read you in which the same ganja was a thought of us are, uh, the sumo boom boom or the ultimate good desired by the storage wise man, baroque disingenuous. It's, it's a positive condition at which the individual arrives after having shared the scales from his eyes, remember, uh, and learned of the deceitfulness of appearances of the mystifying allure of all that he has taken as being very valuable.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Everything that shines is not gold, is what the individual learns. Having gone through the process of in Ganja that is deceit and this and Ganja to put it in, in the simplest of terms. Uh, what I suggested more over is that the plot of the Quixote and that of some of these stories embedded in it. In this part too. Uh Hm. Go through a similar unfolding from and Ganja to this in Ganja. Uh, we will be following this development in the episodes that we will be dealing with during the rest of the semester, some of which other culminating episodes in the entire book, not only, uh, the second part, what the tire get haughty. Uh, so, but that was first turn our attention today, uh, to uh, uh, to critics whose essays you are reading this week in the case book. And this is, this is sort of the, uh, the, uh, the highlight or the high point I should say, of the casebook, these two essays by our back and Spitzer.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       Now we already saw, uh, our box main thesis, we Macy's his famous book. And, uh, that that thesis is about the Christian mixture of the sublime, uh, and uh, the low style in the New Testament. Uh, and how this led to the emergence and development of realism and eventually to the novel and to a book like the Quixote. This mixture of the sublime and the law style was a break away from the strict separation between high and low style. In the classical tradition, which our back, uh, derives, uh, this idea from Saint Augustine and the church fathers, the patristic tradition, our back labels settling more immediately. I put it on the board or humble sermo better humble discourse. This Christian response to the classical division of styles derived that division of styles derived from Aristotle and from Roman rhetorical theory. This mixture of the transcendent and the low style was exemplified by Christ's passion through which the drama of Man's everyday life assumes the most profound meaning.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       Life does not end in the brief span of worldly existence. Eternity is present in the passion as a message of hope. Our backs, uh, application of these theory, uh, in the, uh, to the Quixote leads him to the belief that the Quixote is essentially a funny book as you have read in the essay, uh, the enchanted Boosie Nair and interpretation, uh, for which our back was excoriated by his Hispanics, particularly Spanish ones for whom Nikki Haut. There was a very profound at untrusting dental book, although many we're motivated by a nationalistic interpretation of Cervantes whom they saw as the highest example of Spanish genius. And he's protagonist as the various representative of the fatherland. They will not entirely wrong in their reactions. What happened in Spain was that, uh, the key hot there was canonized, meaning turning to a classic in the, in the 18th century. Uh, and then by the early 19th century, during the romantic period, uh, it was assaulted us, the, the highest point of Spanish genius and the highest representative of the Spanish language in which the spirit of Spanish.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       And this was, uh, I was, uh, embedded and so forth. And, uh, it became, uh, this was a very nationalistic reading of the Quixote that prevailed and still prevails in some quarters. And, uh, so the people who held this view of the hotel of course were outraged by our box reading of the Quixote as essentially a funny book. Uh, they were not entirely wrong in their reactions. Um, he should be very clear to those of you reading the Quixote that there is a great deal that is very deep and serious in it, both about life in general and about literature, our backs analysis. However, it's very revealing of how the law style, particularly in St John, all the low class characters plays such a crucial role in the farcical episodes in the chaotic, besides we are not, uh, familiar in the modern period anymore with this separation of styles are high and low style or anything like that. And it very instructive to read our bag, uh, who was steeped in that, uh, uh, even when he goes astray, in my view, I was criticized by some Hispanics for having included that essay in the case book, by the way. Mostly because they had not been included.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       Our backs problem is that he cannot get out of his home, his scheme, which equals equates theory looseness with uh, only with tragedy. Don Quixote can be serious without being tragic. And in fact, this is one of its most important lessons and most innovative qualities. One of the most innovative qualities of the new literature that emerges in the wake of the Kiata to say that's an advantage. It's not deal with the serious issues of his time is pure nonsense. Uh, as we have seen, uh, do claim that the book is above all a farce is also nonsense besides a novel's worth should not be gauged by how faithfully represents reality. If such a thing can be gauged at all. Our back is wrong when he says that Don Quixote's it they fix, has no contact with reality and that it only causes confusion. On the contrary, he see fix served by contrast to clarify many things around him.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       But there are salvageable parts of our bags, essays, essay, which is why I included it in, in, in the casebook. Um, novel cough. On the other hand, the great Russian novelist has a horrible book on the Quixote, which was a series of lectures that he gave, uh, at Harvard and the, there, the book is interesting only because Nabokov wrote it, but he says really outrageous things. Like there is no reflection of this. Pain of the ranches is time in the Quixote. Nabo cough was a great writer, but not a great critic. Oviously I think that the first salvageable salvageable thing in our backs essay, his, uh, his reaction against romantic criticism and the tendency to over interpret whatever that means. Ultimately, uh, our back writes the finding his own position, the following you have in, in, in the case book page 58, four centuries. He says, especially since the romanticist many things have been read into him.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       He didn't Quixote which he interested want this, which he hardly for boated, let alone intended such transforming undescended interpretation. Interpretations are often fertile. A book like Don Quixote dissociate itself from its author's intention and lead a life of its own. Don Quixote shows a new face to every age which enjoys him. Jet, the historian whose task meaning himself, whose task it is to define the place of a given work in a historical continuity, most endeavor insofar as that is possible in so far as that is still possible to attain a clear understanding of what the book meant to its author and his contemporaries and court. Uh, this is the dream of the philology. And so the critics steeped in philology that they can actually get back to the meaning of the, of the, of the work in Eh, in the period in which was writing and, and, and to discern what the author's intentions, where we are not so sure anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       Peter Russell's book, Peter Russell was an English, uh, Hispanics of some note. His book is called Don Quixote as a funny book follows our back and it's among those who styled themselves as the hard school of Savantas criticism based mostly in England and, uh, who's hardness is mostly of the intellectual arteries in my view, just because the advantage is contemporary is found the book funny or just because of what's Advantis said about the comic. It is impoverishing to see the Quixote in this light, particularly when the comic is not defined. If the comic arises as it does in the quota from the toils of our mind out of sorts with the modern world, then it is a comic of the highest form of seriousness. Comedy can be very serious and profound and it is in the Houthi contemporaries. Often Ms. Reed works written, uh, in their time, obviously, and author's intentions are very, very difficult to ascertain.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       And I'll say a little bit more about that later. Spitzer, Leo Spitzer was another great critic of the German philological school. He to escape from Nazi Germany and proceeded our back in the chair at the University of eastern bull. Uh, Spitzer wound up at Johns Hopkins University, not on Yale, alas, like our back Spitzer was known to be irascible and belligerent in the defense of his points of view and road vicious reviews of the books with which he disagreed. Uh, for example, Steven Gilman's book on the Cell Astena, uh, was shredded by Spitzer in an angry, uh, review pitcher was more thoroughly grounded in philology and linguistics than our back. He was a, a philologist and a linguist and, uh, uh, spoke, uh, many modern languages and new practically all the classical ones. He was a very, very, very learned man and very brilliant. She picks her beliefs that one can get at the core of a work of literature by going from something marginal on the periphery, like a detail and pursuing and all the way to its center that a detail Caniff properly analyzed year.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       The comprehensive interpretation of the work, the geometric metaphors, periphery circle center are a beaten, a bit naive here. We use metaphors in writing theory and engraving criticism and his, uh, are a bit naive when we think about them. Uh, we learned to look for metaphors in criticism in, through the work of the great deconstruction is Paul the man who was a professor here at Yale. So the geometric metaphors are a bit naive, uh, as is spitzers emphases on discovering the personality of the author or his worldview. He's Weltanschauung to use the German word. He wants to get into the psychology of the author. These are approximations that Michelle Foodco, I think I mentioned him. He's a French philosopher. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       who's most famous book is liberal elite shows in English. The translator as the order of things. And the first three chapters, I don't Hispanic things, one on Velasquez Las Meninas, one of the grantees. And the very first the beginning is on board. Here's the Argentine writer. Um, these are approximations and Michel Foucault would argue that one limits the possible meanings of a work by reducing it to the alleged intention of its author. If you say these were the author's intentions, you create kind of a fence around a, uh, work on, uh, uh, there can be no meanings, uh, beyond what you assume those intentions, uh, to be. Uh, but I believe that what Spitzer is trying to find is, is the servant was what I call this advantage. We should him is a point of confluence between form and content that makes for a coherent overarching meaning. Since language is after all, the primary material of a literary work, I believe has pictures.

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       Work is a good lesson to critics who would leap too hasty interpretations without a detailed knowledge of the text. Now that language is the, is the primary material with literary work might seem obvious, but it is a very, uh, complicated a statement to make because one could say that paint is the, is the, uh, primary material of painting. And that doesn't get you very far in the case of, of, of, of language. It, I think that it, that it does not a far a spritzer would, uh, would believe, but I think that it does in the case of the, of the Quixote, she pitched her, accomplishes his task by meticulous work on Pollino Mattia. But if you have this words in your essay swamp, I'm not going to have to put them on, on, on the board. Uh, I know that there are jawbreakers Paulino, Manisha, multiple names and polio, etymology, multiple origins of words, meaning multiplicity of ne of names and multiplicity of word origins that are present in this scenes that he analyzes Spitzer equates the multiplicity implicit in these and the words to the perspective as inherent in the interplay of varied views in the novel by various characters, various characters, and various different point of view.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       And this is reflected in the, in the, in the multiplicity of ideologies and the multiplicity of names, uh, uh, given two characters and two things.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       The differences of opinion among the characters is evinced through the, uh, through the use of language. The key term in the novel is the Portmanteau Word Sanctuary uses to mediate in the dispute about the barbers basing the Buffy yellow or the basing helmet in English, but which he attempts to convey the conflicting points of view about the object. According to Webster, a Portmanteau word and, uh, James Joyce was famous for making them up, uh, is a word that he's a combination of two other words, inform and meaning, like the word Smug, which is a combination of smoke and fog. I bet you didn't know that. Smoke and fog give you smog and that is a Portmanteau word. Uh, Joyce use uses it uses them. Uh, um, in funny ways, a passenger in, in Joyce is the pass anchor, which in France, French means not yet. Of course a passenger is a bass core because he hasn't gotten there yet.

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       And this is the kind of thing that Joyce does. Um, so that's a Portmanteau word and embassy Gilmore basing helmet, his apartment to work. And you remember that Spitzer mixed quite a bit of that, uh, much spacer but Spitzer ru's behind it, mostly multiplicity that is [inaudible] the creator of this whole artistic machine. He stands over all the games of authorship and all of the ironies that is, you can, you can, uh, you can think of it, uh, uh, Serantes and then all of the pulling of Asia and all the bullying, the margin of that, but they are contained in this figure of Cervantes. The author who is the, who is the author of all the ironies and all of this against Cervantes. Spitzer argues is no relativist when it comes to morals. We saw this already and perspective is in an IRA, an irony are inherent in a Christian position, which is humble by definition, meaning I don't know enough, I will never know enough to behind Cervantes the creator. There is God whom Cervantes never denies so, so they will be gone above Cervantes.

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       Spitzer provides a convincing historical scheme during the Middle Ages. There is a correspondence between word and things, names and characters. And this is, uh, so in the readings of scripture in the renaissance, there is a word world, a world of words, to use my own portmanteau word at world of words, when connecting or leading to the next by my autonomy and a world book world made up of books like Alonzo [inaudible] was a result, becomes don Quixote. But inhabiting that book world was a world of books in the Baroque that is a phantasmagoria of words that are like dreams and reveal the deceit of the world, including that of language here in this world of the same gun. You know, it's where we find instead of on this particularly the Bantus have 16, 15. So, uh, I put these things on the board because I liked you to have clear ideas. So Middle Ages, renaissance and Baroque correspondence, word things, words, the words, and then words who are the seat full, uh, and uh, uh, uh, purveyors of [inaudible] and then leading to death and gardening.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       Now

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       I am very interested because, uh, I think it is useful for us as readers and US students of literature in the Cervantes according to our backend Spitzer. Uh, to me the most interesting part of our box essay is ultimately when he tries to define this Advantium low set of Valentino, which can be compared with spitzers effort to come to a similar overall view.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       Your theoreticians and critics can say that there is no such thing as [inaudible]. Uh, yet there is, there is a, you know, w w if you have read the Quixote and you know, literary history, you know, what is, what belongs to a sort of disadvantage world, uh, is a great writer, creates a world of, of his or her own is, is a set of plots, ideas, tropes, uh, that has some coherence and that can be identified if you have read Proust. Uh, you know what I mean? You read one boosting sentence, his long flowing sentences and you know, immediately you're reading, you read a symptoms by bore with these refined irony and you know, you're reading uh, a border borders or you read years later before the firing squad Colonel Aureliano when Dee, I was to remember that remote afternoon when his grandfather took him to who sea ice or I'm trying to, this is the beginning of 100 years of solitude.

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       And you know, now our buck in defining the Sylvanian begins by giving up. He says the peculiarly servanty and cannot be described in words because by giving up, but then he says, first of all, it is something spontaneously sensory if vigorous capacity for the vivid visualization of very different people in very, very situations for the vivid realization and expression of what thoughts into their minds, what emotional fill their hearts on, what words come to their lips. You have to remember that these quotes from our bar, uh, were originally written in German and German prose is very complicated and it shows in the translation later he says, and just a sensory is his capacity to run. This is to think up or hit upon and a new combinations of people and events. He's, I think he's right when he says something like that, he goes back, uh, our back goes back to the idea of the mat gentleman running into people.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       Uh, and he says, what attracted Cervantes was the possibility, uh, this formula offered for multifariousness and effects of perspective. The mixture of the fancy food and everyday elements in the subject is malleability elasticity, adaptability quote. He finally proclaims the following. This Advantium is an attitude and attitude towards the world and hence also toward the subject matter of his art in which bravery and equanimity play a major part together with a delight he takes in the multifariousness of his sensory play. There is in him a certain southern here, meaning southern European, not folk, Marion's south, you know, uh, there is an incidence, southern reticence and pride. This prevents him from taking the play very seriously. He looks at it, he shapes it. He finds a diverting. It is also intended to afford the reader refined intellectual diversity. On quote, he goes back over this. He says, the theme of the mad country gentleman who undertakes to revive night errand tree gay Cervantes and opportunity to present the world as play in that spirit of multiple perspective, non judging and even non questioning neutrality, which is a brave form of wisdom.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       There's something I think also, uh, quite perceptive there. That is the advantage is like a puppet master like a master, uh, in, in, in, in the episode Europe about the re, uh, and he presents all of these many different characters who, uh, in action and sort of stands back without passing judgment. Now Spitzer on the other hand, uh, uh, concludes the following. These beans are in our novel. Things are represented not for why they are in themselves, but only us. Things spoken about or thought about. And this involves breaking the narrative presentation into two points of view. There can be no certainty about the own broken reality of events. The only unquestionable true on which the reader may depend is the will of the artists who chose to break up a multivariant Vaillant reality into different perspectives. In other words, perspectivism suggests the existence of an archimedean principle.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       Something on which the whole thing rests, uh, outside the plot and archimedean principle outside the plot. He goes on and the are, Kennedy's must be sort of Anthony himself unquote. And one more quote and we may see instead of Andis two fold treatment of the problem of nicknames. Balino Mattia another example of this baroque attitude. What is true? What is a dream this time toward language, the language itself is not human language. Also a Vanitas Tattoo. Tattooing vanity of vanities. What I was saying about the, the Baroque languages, a phantasmagoria, this is the end of, of uh, Spitzer syntheses is his conclusion after this very thorough and brilliant analysis of, uh, of the novel. This is my view, uh, I have been expressing in our rhetoric, uh, this is my beautiful view both on our, uh, on our backend. Spitzer in the glorification of the author.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       Spitzer does not take into account Servantez errors. He's famous oversights, which we speak over floored creator, not God. Like in any sense, hence pushing the whole issue of point of view to the edge of the abbess of Matt [inaudible]. I'm sorry, of the abyss of madness since the final authority is, is, is flawed. Um, moreover, Cervantes placed so much with the author's lack of authority that one has finally to take him at face value and agree that not even he has authority. Uh, the final authority of the book that we read and I think this he would have agreed with, uh, and we have seen it in many in our readings of many passages. The same is true for our back. My answer as you will see in my essays is he ness cross idleness. Remember that he needs is a figure of the author and the figure of the modern author.

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       He has blown his book. He wants to make money from it. He's from the lower classes and he's cross eyed and this reveals that there is perspective is in from within an assumed single self. That is that this, this, this figure of the author here, uh, cannot be in possession of the truth because being cross eyed, I don't know if I can make him enough cross. I'd hear his view of reality is flawed and conflictive conflictive because there are two eyes, not a single point of view. And, and, and this author figure being cross eyed makes literally that he has that he's two ice means two different visions. We will talk about that when we talk about the puppet play, uh, that he needs the a Monte puts on here in part two. Um, so, uh, the author is multiple within himself, his eyes, a work independently of each other as it were. He is congenitally incapable of providing a single point of view. Now we turn to the assigned episodes, uh, in the Quixote as we turn to this episode's. Uh, let me remind you that I will be looking into how much each resembles an episode in part one to what extent these episodes are we writings of others that have already taken place in the first book. Also, we will see that running thread through these episodes is doubling the appearance of doubles, uh, of Don Quixote, of reflections of Oakley, Hopi.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       Uh, the first is the episode that is called in Jarvis, uh, the episode of the night of the looking glasses, which makes it very awkward for me to say because of course this is 18th century England English and the English say looking gloss for a mirror. And uh, so, uh, I say night of the looking glass is just to be consistent with the translation that you're reading this time around, but it's in Spanish color yellow. It looks at speckles night of the mirrors. Now this episode brings to mind that have the fight of Don Quixote with the Basque in part one because you do have an actual dual, the most significant episode. Uh, the most significant aspect of this episode is that in it, Don Quixote meets, meets his mirror image image and the feeds that mirror image. Carrasco has decided that the only way to subject Don Quixote is to meet him at his own level.

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       But mostly what he's doing is reenacting one in the way that donkey hope they reenacted. Oh, really? I'm still reenact the romances of chivalry. Don't hot. They will find a copy of himself model after his own mat inventions. A copy that is rich in details. Notice that don't see now here is gassing. They are they one Dalia Dalia means and the Lucia land of vandals. The vandals were one of the Germanic tribes, but uh, invaded the peninsula, uh, after the collapse or with the collapse of the Roman Empire. Carrasco Carrasco get up as at night errand is quite something he has outdone Gnocchi Haldane and here is a quote from page five 54 Loki Hartej viewed his antagonist and found he had his helmet on and the beaver down down so that he could not see his face, but he observe him to be as strong made man and not very tall over his armor. He wore it kind of circuit certitude or loose coat. Seemingly have the finest gold be sprinkled with sundry little moons of resplendent looking glass, which made the most gun and splendid show a great number of green, yellow and white feathers. Waved about his helmet on. Quote, this translation or the translation struggles a bit with the lunas. The word used in uh, four mirror in the original mou, Jazz Luna's their risk. This is a horse

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       which contains that word, uh, um, a most important suggestion in the passage La Luna, they lists backhoe is the reflecting part of the mirror, but lunar means moon of course, and moon leads to lunacy

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       do madness. Sandstone is the night of the moons. The night of lunacy denied of madness, which is quite appropriate because in trying to cure Doki hold this madness, he's acting like a madman, like a lunatic. The moon, of course, he's also the celestial body of reflected light, but excellence the same as the night of the looking glasses. Sound song in this getup is a reflection of don Quixote. Quixote came close enough to some song. He will be able to see himself reflected on the little as in the episode of the Parliament of death. Don Quixote has met in mirror image of his madness here. It's more than just a reflection that is reflected in the in the night of the most was acting like came and he's also reflected in his armor being reflected back from those little mirrors on his uh, on his costume. So you can see sent Joe has also met his double in domain CCL whose fault knows is a prodigious example of the grotesque, which is such a prevalent quality in part two.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       I quote scarcely had the clearness of the day given opportunity to see and distinguish objects when the first thing that presented itself to Sanchez eyes. What this choir of the woods knows, which was so large, that in almost over cha overshadowed his whole body in a word. It is said to have been of an excessive size hawked in the middle and full of warts and carbuncles of the color of mulberry and hanging two fingers breath below his mouth, the size, the color of the carbon carbuncles and the cooker. This so disfigured his face, that sanctuary at site, they're off being unto tremble hand and foot like a child in a fit and resolved within himself to take 200 cuffs before he's color should awaken to encounter that hub gobbling. I mean, he says he was, he, he may have thought that he'd had to fight this fellow us there two matches with Friday. He saying after seeing that knows I would never, never fight these monster.

Speaker 1:          00:37:27       Notice the exaggerated dimensions and other hideousness of the nose, which together with this being artificial and new features of part to Muddy Torres was naturally ugly and though her physical deformities were extreme, they were at least her own and not likely to inspire fear so much as repulsion, but here centuries moved to dread, which will happen often. Impart to fear is one of the emotions that we encounter once and again in part two and you can begin charting them from now on. Domestus yards. Nose is connected to the aesthetics of the Baroque, who's emblematic figure is the monster. The figure made up of disparate conflicting elements like the nose and contrived to cause admiration. The monster is made to be shown. And uh, and uh, this quality is embedded in the very etymology of the word monster. Monster had him in Latin. If Don Quixote has met him the night of the looking glasses, an image of his madness in Seattle central has met an image of his foolishness domain is like a carnival figure of the fool. And his costume is reminiscent of those of the actors in the wild. One of the parliament of death. His name is [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       domain of course is, is, is, is, is a form of Tomas, Tomas, okay. But Seattle at the time

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       meant a kind of trout. So to maybe in the past, his name means means I ate drought. If you stopped back and think of it, there are many names that mean something and you don't catch onto it until you think about it. But this is scholars have come up. I didn't define that Tomasa, chairman, I trout. Uh, now the fact that that domain is an image of, of, of Sanchez is foolishness. Foolishness is so much. So because domain is Sanchez neighbor, please eat with whom you this courses some things proper to squires and who's gluttony and other habits. He shares the dialogue about the contingency of meaning in language. A centering on ie whole there Buta or on is hilarious, but he speaks of a very modern conception of language. As spitter mentioned somewhere in this essay that is meaning is contingent in language. It is not fixed. It's shifting. And this is consistent with the view of the Middle Ages, renaissance and Baroque and the Baroque. This blue shiftiness of languages emphasize. Uh, so

Speaker 2:          00:40:36       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       in the dialogue of the squires, there is also a critique of the opera class as a frequent topic in part two that you might also chart as you read it. They particularly central do not accept the colts of Chinnery. That leads that lead to such a oh fights. Uh, central seems to be saying that it is the opera classes that start wars. So very deep critique. This is part of the political element, uh, of these second book of the 1615 Quixote. Uh, but also fits in with the semantics of the disingenuous because, uh, the accoutrements of the opera classes, they're luxuries are part of the seats that are own done by the same guy. No. As you will see as you move through the upper classes in the next few episodes. Now, what is the significance of all this doubling?

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Okay, hold them. It's double sanctions. Dobo I think that at the, at the deepest level, it means that the characters have met themselves and struggle each within himself to find meaning and identity or identity within meaning or a form of, of, of Weiss. Uh, self recognition, troubled self recognition. This is tied to the issue of self reflect society that we have been discussing since the beginning. If the renaissance mind with the mind of the renaissance, if I may use an abstraction, Sally's forth in search of the real world, which it tries to interpret control and use the baroque mind in that Sally in forth fines mostly itself, it finds its own inner workings. This, I equate to the God, don't your sweet Gogi Ergo soon I think therefore I am what you see. Ultimate truth that the car can find the card 1596, 1650, roughly contemporary a little later then of one. Yes. But it's, it is itself, it is a self recognizable jet. This figure in this images it need a further and further thought and reflection with the, with the emphasis on reflection on, on uh, like a mirror. It is appropriate then for these reasons that the characters should meet distorted images of their own selves or twisted reflections of themselves in their adventures. So Carrasco has falling into his own trap while Don Quixote on have an almost literally out of body experience seeing themselves outside of themselves and seeing themselves, how they would look to others.

Speaker 1:          00:43:54       This is particularly troubling to I think central, but also to look the haughty who as the novel progresses we'll find more such, uh, instances where a reflections of this guy and uh, undermine his, uh, his quest. So, so we move on to the episode of the Lions, uh, which is reminiscent of that of the galley slaves. In part one, the lions, like the prisoners are prisoners and they belonged to the king. They're are also under the supervision of the crown. Finding lions in the middle of Casteel is not a common occurrence, so their appearance is another instance of the real conspiring to add to don Quixote's madness by presenting him with beings and objects that are out of the ordinary, like the players in the cart, lions or object of a mule of objects of amusement, they'd been taken to court so they can be viewed by the people.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       Uh, amusement and display. They are fit for heroic action and Don Quixote does act with great courage only to be marked by the lion, but not only arts peacefully, but turns his hind quarters to the night. Ultimate insult theories him is no longer possible under these circumstances. It is a very cruel episode for donkey haughty, but together with the fight with the night of the looking glasses, these are two victories for Gnocchi, Quixote, which together with the knowledge that is now in a book are to his deluded sense of importance and of accomplishments. The characters around him conspired to increase this dilution, but the lions are real and could have killed him. Quixote and the others. Jorge Luis Borges from I have quoted so many times in this course. The Great Argentine writers says that, uh, uh, uh, courage is the one characteristic that is a constant from first from book one to book two, the courage of Don Quixote. And then he's also the constant from alone Sukarno to Don Quixote and back to Alonzo Kiano at the end of the book.

Speaker 1:          00:46:14       And so we come to the gentleman in green, the gentleman in the green writing coat, uh, in Don Diego de Miranda don't help healthy meats and other double, but an inverted one like a mirror image. Don't [inaudible] appears to read the Dolly go donkey hot. They would have been had he not read romances of chivalry turn mad and chosen to attempt to revive the age of Chimichurri. He is like the night of the looking glasses and other distorted reflection of [inaudible]. The one I repeat that he could have been don't. Leo is the image of what the French in the period called the [inaudible]. He is reasonably well off, reads devotional books, humps and lives, an honest, peaceful life at home. Don't be haughty. Mocks him slightly in the episode of the Lions when Don Diego prudently runs away and again as he takes his leave telling him that the, that he's not looking out, they says he's not given to leisure leisure like Don Diego.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       Diego is a kind of pre dra character. Uh, but he has a son who wants to be a port lowering. So they meet under, we have once again the postprandial conversation and one more time to discussion center centers in the relative merits of arms and letters. This is a repetition of that episode, but now you know what? Appointed house not in a dilapidated in and Don Quixote's has interlocutors who are or his intellectual level Lorens who is quite a good poet who reminds us of resource resource to more on Gardenia but does not take action as they did. Though Quixote reveals that he knows a great deal about poetry, but the outcome of the exchange is that Cheever re surpasses poetry. That arms are superior, who letters. This whole section seems to be, uh, in homage of Gfsi Lasso, the La Vega, the great Spanish board of the 16th century, whose name I've mentioned many times and who has become by this time, the model of Port Kertscher and soldier Garcia Lasso, uh, who lived in the first half of the 16th century, uh, died while attempting to scale the wall of the castle during a battle.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       Uh, in Charles if his army, they dropped a rock on him. He only lived 36 years, but his poetry changed the course of poetry in Spanish forever. Cervantes was quite devoted to him. The discussion turns to the issue of if report can be made or if he's born. And, uh, this again gives another example of Don Quixote's extensive readings, uh, other than, uh, rather than merely a books of chivalry. Uh, this is the library beyond the library that was burnt by the, by the priest and the barber and, and the women that don't get hurt. This house. And then we come to a, uh, uh, the last episode I'll be discussing today and which is a transition episode to go mattress wedding. This is the episode of the swordsman, the two sportsman who begin to argue about who's better. One is very, very strong and the other one is an expert, a scientist of, of, of, of fencing at this time, uh, since the advent of firearms and all of that fencing had become a sport and a not only a sport or a science, I were books written about trying to understand, uh, fencing in geometric mathematical terms and surrounded like to poke fun at this.

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       However, it is the scientific stories man who uh, who makes a fool out of the other one who is so strong that at the end when he's very angry, he takes his sword and throws it so far away that it takes a long time to get up there and pick it up. The point of this, uh, uh, uh, throw away episode it may seem is that uh, it shows that art triumphs over nature, that science triumphs over strength on the, the triumph of art over nature is a baroque topic that appears once and again throughout part two. And we are going to be talking about that in the next class when we talk about commercials wedding in relation to a painting by the Alaska is called the spinners last. Elon Elandra's. But now we have to turn on to conclude to our exemplary story, the glass graduate, which I hope that you, uh, uh, that you have written.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       We have gone over the 16, 13 exemplary stories book, how Cervantes published it because publishers became interested in his work after the success of the 1605 Quixote. Also, once he realized that he couldn't use the stories which he had a in the way he used an in part one because he had been so criticized and you have read about the criticisms as they appear at the beginning of part two. So, uh, I said one test who prided himself on being the first to ever write this kind of Noel and the Spanish language collected them in this wonderful book that would have given serve anthesis uh, a prominent place in the, uh, in, in the Canon even if he had not written the whole thing. Now the glass graduate good. He's one of the better known stories, famous for the very strange kind of madness that afflicts the protagonist.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       He believes himself to be made of glass and lives in constant fear of being broken. It is another example of Cervantes is profound interest in the workings of the human mind and in issues concerning knowledge and the ability to arrive at the truth. Tomas, he a very suggested suggestive sort of paranoia. It is an illness that has a [inaudible] air to it in Kafka's the metamorphosis. As you know, the protagonist, uh, becomes a roach. Tomas suffers mls that is expressed through fear of bodily harm or physical fragility. It is a way of feeling different than vulnerable that can be extended. It's extended to a general human condition, a form of alienation. I think this is the main reason why the story is so compelling. The idea of this madness that you feel yourself made of glass and therefore vulnerable and you would, you tried to establish a distance between you and and, and others who might break you or have or anything that was a tile falling off a roof.

Speaker 1:          00:53:31       My break you and taking laborious, uh, uh, uh, measures to protect, uh, you're very vulnerable, uh, uh, a body. Now the novel begins as if it were to be a compressed, kind of been doing for months. That's a German word for word of, of or novel of Education. Bill doing education building from us. But then it moves on to encompass Tomasa's entire life. It is not however, a biography, but it centers on two or three periods of his life, most particularly on the one during his illness. The plot is circular and a circularity is expressed through Tomas. Very last name. First. He's called [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:54:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       His last name is [inaudible], which means slice is a slice or not quite a circle, a fragment. It was fear, but when he, at the end, when he recovers from his illness and is in full command of his faculties, his last name becomes

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       Rueda, which means wheel. So he has been completed. We go back to Spitzer and his bully. No Meisha. Um, now during his illness, he is known as the [inaudible], which is the name of the story in Spanish, which means the license should delay at licentiate glass window. They call him graduate glass in the translation, but media, music glass window, a stained glass window or a glass display case. So this is what his name, his name's, uh, is again go back, we have to go back to Spitzer and names and things and so forth. Uh, there is something passive about Tomas except when he's ill, but on the whole things happen to him. He was found lying down under some trees by the young gentleman who take him to Salamanca using their, uh, in the their servant for eight years, but also acquires an education showing a remarkable intelligence.

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       Though he's only, this is only reported not dramatized until he's ill. He is always in a second plane. I said, we're as a soldier, he moves around trying to soak up as much experience and culture as possible. Tomas is then administer a poison by the spurned woman spraying the woman who is no quarterly damn soul border, notorious whore who falls in love with him. The poison queens preserve [inaudible] that she gives him is redolent with sexual connotations as in Latin, in the, in, in, in, in the classics. The memory Yoda in the original Latin, uh, was associated, uh, by way of resemblance with female sexual organs. This is how she lures him into eating it, but there is no hint of what makes him attractive to her other than perhaps is famous. A brilliant scholar. It seems like a whim that she falls in love with him.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       She disappears and that is as far as the erotic thing goes in the story, it disappears when ill Tabasco is placed and remarkable intelligence and wit being not only insightful in his observations but making these with pumps, sharp witticisms and clever circumlocutions. He's a regular like and he's like an oracle and he's consulted as such by people. There is a correlation between his illness and his insightfulness which seems to hinge on transparency since he believes himself to be made of glass. And if you go to page one 13, you will find a quote in which, uh, he says, uh, he, he, he challenges them to ask him questions that he will be able to answer for uh, uh, but because he was a man of glass rather than flesh, I'm quoting for since glass was a finance delegate substance, his mind to function more quickly and efficiently in that, in a conventional body, uh, which was made of a denser, an earthly or stuff. I mean his body would be denser and glass is transparent and so forth. This is a page one 13.

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       Uh, in other words, Tomas, mine makes transparent the world around him just as his body is presumably transparent. Transparency gives him access to the truth. But he's also said to be highly educated and intelligent. So He's into insightful. Does once he's ill, it's like an increase of these qualities or is it disconnected from it? It is not clear if, if it was the poison or the precarious condition in which he believes to be, that sharpens his wit. He is like the black man in the traditional story who can tell the emperor that he is naked because he has nothing to loose. Uh, because, uh, Tomas because with illness has become a sort of of freak. He has no reputation to protect. Uh, and so he pierces through all social convention and through hypocrisy and lies and tells the truth. Uh, he also, uh, in, uh, outlining the various virtues and defects, uh, of each of a profession or trade is following a traditional formula, a set, a set piece that became a skid in the theater to someone who tells well amongst do this and cobblers do that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       And that, that is behind this story. Now they, the black graduate has much in common with the Quixote and seems to dramatize the common debate, uh, in that book between arms and letters because it's both a soldier and his, uh, an a student, a brilliant student, and Salamanca last unit. Uh, but whereas don Quixote's mainly and reader of literature of Romances of children, we, above all, Tomas is a legal scholar whose mission is reaching the truth. His quest is more intellectual than literary. So in that sense, uh, he is not quite like Don Quixote. He is different, more philosophical if one could say, the ending seems to suggest as it is throughout the holder, the preeminence of arms over letters when he has to escape from Salamanca. Uh, and it goes back to Flanders and has a career in the army and ends his life, uh, owner ugly. Now will, we will be looking at other exemplary stories in the near future and you will be able to experience the variety of plots and narrative experiments that, uh, the book contains. And that I think is the reason for its being. For this story's being colleague exemplary. They are a collection of samples or examples of, uh, plots and stories.
