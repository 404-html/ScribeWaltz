Speaker 1:          00:02          So this is, um, the Corsen Cervantes, uh, Don Quixote. Uh, I am Roberto Gonzalez, each area, uh, from comparative literature and the Spanish Department. Uh, normally in Spanish. We go by the first of the two last names. So even though my email is robotical dot Echeverria uh, I am normally known if at all, uh, uh, Gonzales, officer Gonzalez, [inaudible], professor [inaudible], uh, just for your, uh, general, uh, information, uh, you will be getting tidbits about Spanish culture such as the one I've just given you throughout, uh, the course, even if this is not a culture class or a language class, but, uh, it is important to, for you to know them. You will also be getting a good deal about Spanish, uh, history, uh, both, uh, in the lectures and in the assigned readings and of course through the reading of the, uh, of the Quixote. Uh, you will also of course have to learn a few titles in, in Spanish works of Spanish literature that I will be mentioning, uh, and a and that you, uh, will, uh, uh, learn in the course of the, uh, uh, of the semester.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Uh, but that is to be expected, I guess. So in this course we are going to read together one of the on question master pieces of world literature, let alone the western Canon as defined by my friend Harold Bloom in his popular, uh, book, the western Canada where it appears, uh, at the very top of the list paired with a hamlet. The hot day is a book that will affect your lives, not just your understanding and enjoyment of literature. I can anticipate that, um, Vicky Hall is the first modern novel. I'd be talking a lot about the novel modern novel and it'll become clear as we move along because there are a, there is a confusion, uh, and novel in which according to Gabrielle Garcia Marquez the Nobel Prize, a Columbian novelist, uh, and novel where there is already everything that Novelis would attempt to do in the future. Until today, young Sigmund Freud formed a set of Advantis club with his friends.

Speaker 1:          02:55          And the Quixote was Jorge. Luis Borges has is obsession, bought his ass. You may know was the great, uh, Argentine writer, famous Yan, what? Uh, the late British scholar considered a donkey. Haut they one of four myths of a modern individualism, you call them. Uh, the other been Faust don't Huang and Robinson Crusoe in words by good to digital that Molina and Daniel Defoe. Uh, but this is not the most important thing about, uh, about the book. Uh, the Hartej has and has continued to be read by millions of readers in every imaginable language and we will be asking ourselves why, what is it that this book has that is so meaningful to so many? I myself have a, uh, answered the question in this fashion, in the introduction to the penguin classics edition that you, we will be using in this course. The penguin classics translation by [inaudible] Rada Rather Ford.

Speaker 1:          04:15          I say they're in that introduction. The following Miguel disadvantage subway, the subway that's a masterpiece has endured because it focuses on literatures for most appeal to become another, to leave at typically embattled self for another closer to one's desires and aspirations. This is why I don't be haughty has often been read as a children's book and continues to be read by or two children. Experience and lives, blows teachers our limits and erode the hope of living up to our dreams. But our hope never vanishes. It is the sows pith the flickering light of being the spiritual, the spiritual counterpart to our DNAs master code. When they hero regains his sanity at the end of part two, he dies as the last chances of living an imaginary life disappear. So most life itself, Don Quixote's, serene passing reflects this understanding. He knows that the dream of life is over.

Speaker 1:          05:34          And I said, neoplatonist and Christian, his only hope now is to find the true life after death. So much for my own cook, sorry, uh, for you reading the Quixote will be, uh, an event that you will always remember. And uh, Don Quixote on Saint Joe, his squire, uh, will become lifelong friends, uh, about whom you would think often. I can predict that safely. I think. So what is the Hopi and novel you will say? Well, first of all to hot, if it is a novel, is to Nols one published in 1605 and the other in 1615

Speaker 2:          06:27          yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:27          To gather, they are known as the key, much more about the title in a minute. And knowledgeable people refer to them as part one and part two or the 1605 Quixote and the 1615 Quixote. So the first thing to learn, and I like first things because I like to build on them from the ground up, is that the Quixote consists of two parts originally published separately, 10 years apart, 10 years apart. But what Cervantes wrote low considered the first modern novel was not an oval as we as we know them today, because novels did not exist as such. Yet novels developed in the wake of the Jihad. So Cervantes could not have set out to write a novel

Speaker 2:          07:27          in his time

Speaker 1:          07:29          than Toronto's his time. There were [inaudible] Valerie Romances, stories about night errands, a lot more about that in the very near future pastoral Rollbahn sis stories. How about fake shepherds?

Speaker 1:          07:46          Picaresque lives, uh, what we call today confusedly picaresque novels. And brief Novell lay or new vendor that is long short stories of which Advantis wrote quite a few on and very good ones. And we will read some here in this course to the modern novel would evolve from translations and imitations of the [inaudible], particularly in France and England and would attain its current form in the 18th century. I am very much a historian and I would like to for you to have a clear, uh, historical, chronological, uh, idea of the development of the novel and of surrenders his own career. So, uh, take note of this, uh, chronological, uh, clarifications that I give you now. What may you know about the chaotic, many of you I suppose come to this course and intrigued by the name of an author and the title of a book that you might have heard about, but not like most classes, classics, not many have actually read in its entirety, much less studied, uh, us with both classics.

Speaker 1:          09:08          Do you have probably heard so much about, uh, the key halted that it feels as if you had read it? Many have heard the songs from man of La Mancha, the impossible dream, the impossible dream and so forth. Uh, perhaps you haven't even seen the show is quite a good show by the way. I don't look down upon it. It is a version of the Quixote, uh, in an American, uh, mode. Very, very much an American mode, but a very good one. Uh, so many of you have, I've seen man of La Mancha have heard the songs. Uh, uh, maybe you have even read a comic book based on the, uh, on the novel. They are coming books based on, on, on, on an oval. Uh, others may have read it in a, in a, in a high school class, parts of it. Some of you may have read it in a course like directed studies, uh, in conjunction with other western classics such as the Odyssey, the need and the divine comedy.

Speaker 1:          10:13          Uh, whatever the case may be. Most of your probably puzzled by the, uh, uh, spelling and pronunciation of the protagonist's name and the title of the book. Let me clarify those. US At modest beginning the first step, having been to tell you that they can help these two novels. Now, the second step is to tell you about that. The name of the protagonist on how to pronounce it, on how we pronounce it in Spanish and how it's spelled and Hawaii, the way to pronounce it in modern Spanish is Quixote d hall day, no gliding of the, Oh, not Quixote, Quixote in Spanish. We don't glide the vows. They are short and crisp. Why then that vixen x in English.

Speaker 1:          11:08          The reason is that when the book was written in the last years of the 16th century and the first of the 17th the sound of theJ in Spanish was still in the process of moving from the show sound that it had thanks to the influence of Arabic and we'll worry about that later. Moving towards the aspirated of more in Spanish. That ash, that sound was then written with an x in this still to be codified spelling of the language more than European spending of modern European languages was not qualified until the 18th century. Uh, for instance, the word for soap in Spanish, many of you who know some Spanish note how boom, uh, what's written then with an x, and it was pronounced Chavon Mexico was pronounced mushy, Goh and up, and it was spelled with an x. That x that is still retains though in Spanish it is pronounced may Hiko never Mexico. Hence the, the English seeing an x in the middle of the title of their fantasies book.

Speaker 1:          12:30          The book was translated very early into English or Irish in 1605, the first translation appeared in 16, 11. That's six years. It's very fast in the 17th century. So the English team that acts mispronounced it quick salt with a sound that it never had in Spanish. That is why you have the x in English and the mispronunciation quick salt. You follow the history. Now the French, meanwhile hearing that she rendered it Keyshot, which is still the way they mispronounced it, the French call it don't keyshot. I will always say here he halted and hope that you will learn to do the same from now on the risk of sounding a little snobbish, uh, uh, two English speakers. But Yalies can sound snobbish if you, um, so now a few more basic, very basic facts about the title of the book. The title of a book or a painting is like the first interpretation by its author.

Speaker 1:          13:50          It is a sort of what we would call in literary criticism, a metal text, the text above the text. Sometimes though titles can be misleading, but they're always interesting and should be examined carefully. Making sure that you gain access to the full title of the first edition, not one that has been tampered with by editors or the reading public later. Uh, for instance, the, the Pickwick papers, the novel by Dickens was really called the posthumous papers of the Pickwick club. And it is interesting why it is called. So, um, now be careful also with the translations of titles. I will tell you later about some of the key hotels because translations of titles sometimes are very misleading novel by Aleppo. Uh, tarpon ta call and seagull. The last was translated as explosion in the cathedral, Wha Wha why? Uh, because the editors thought that the age of enlightenment would sound like a title of a textbook or something.

Speaker 1:          15:04          So that's the way that they translated it. So you don't have to be very careful if you're going to really read something carefully about the title. So you go to the real title. Now, the full, the full title of the first part of Don Quixote, remember published in 1605. I want to engrave that date on your mind is as follows, [inaudible] don Quixote, the line manager. You know that the youth was rendered as a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, perform the Latin. So in Henry also Evalgo Don Quixote Dela mantra. This is a reproduction of the actual title page of the first key. You are seeing it. Okay. We are fortunate enough to have a copy of that first edition at Beinecke library here at Yale. Um, what do you do?

Speaker 1:          16:08          Okay. All right. So, uh, let us go over those words one by one. I can assure you we're not going to go over every word in the book, one by one as I'm wanting to do with the title, or it would take the rest of our lives to finish reaching the Chiota together. So in Henny also does not mean here what exactly what it means today in Spanish. You know, uh, in Henry also means today something like a cute, witty, cute or inventive in 16, 11, covarruvias rights. Now it's a name that you're going to be hearing throughout the semester, and I'm going to put her on the board just the last name because it's very important.

Speaker 1:          17:07          Okay. He's name was save young, the Covarrubias your Roscoe. Uh, he was, uh, a lexicographer who published in 1611. The first dictionary of the Spanish language, the first dictionary of the Spanish language called Tesoro. The Lingua cast, the Yana or Hispaniola, the sorrows of the Castilian or Spanish a language. It's very convenient that go on. Ruby published that dictionary in 16, 11. Right in between the, uh, the, the two parts of the Kihatha 16, oh five, 16, 15, the dictionary comes in 16 hours, 1611. So Covarrubias gives us instead of anthis Spanish. So this is why it is, uh, so, uh, such an important book for the reading of, of, of, of, of is a don Quixote. Uh, the title itself is interesting because it shows that Castilian and Spanish, I wanted the same thing. I'll talk about that a little. Uh, uh, more later he writes about in Henio we commonly call in Kenya a natural force of the mind that inquires that which through reason and intelligence can be found through all sorts of sciences, disciplines, liberal and mechanical arts suddenly inventions and deceit.

Speaker 1:          18:38          Hence we call it, we call it engineer in [inaudible]. He who builds machines to fight off the enemy and to attack him in Henry also is he who has a subtle and sharp wit. So in Henry also in the title of a donkey, halt of the Quixote means heightened kind of what, or understanding one that verges on madness. Recalling what Plato said in the Republic about ports, sports being slightly bad in a few years before the publication of donkey Hartej of the Quixote, Eh, in the year 1575 within Cervantes is lifetime one, one day, not one corn out this one, uh, so many ones here, but one worked, they sung quant. You don't have to remember this name so much. And medical doctor publish a very important book called examine Dane Henio Spatola CNCS and of a very long title. Uh, it's uh, uh, which examined would be the translation of that, uh, uh, of that title, uh, uh, in, in which he studies different kinds of madness.

Speaker 1:          20:00          So examine the enhanced yours meant for what they, the sound one, uh, an examination of various kinds of madness of the kinder that covarrubias have mentioned. So this is to give you the, the, the, the, the context of the word in Henry, also in the title and in Henry also Evalgo lengthy hotel, a mantra. Now you got to go, it's a contraction of e hall, the Al Gore, which in Spanish means song of something. But of course, we are all sons or daughters of something. But what that meant was you are the son of someone of some distinction, uh, uh, a worth the lineage. Uh, and uh, uh, Covarrubias says it means the same as noble with an ancient pure lineage. That in other words, fewer of cast of origin, of ilk, of tradition, and he dialed go as you will discover reading. The first chapter of the book is a petty nobleman, someone belonging to the lower and the ability or aristocracy.

Speaker 1:          21:12          It is important here to note that said, this does not call donkey Horta here it Caballero at night. The novel is that the most basic level, the story of a petty nobleman who becomes by dint of his own self invention and night worthy of using the dome that is given in the title in 1615. However, in the second part of the cohort, and we will look at that title page when we come to it, uh, the, uh, don't get holidays called the Caballero, um, for a variety of reasons that I will explain, uh, at the proper time. Now, Don don is a form of address like Sir Sire, that not everyone had a right to do expect though Kihatha did not, or alone Suki handle the man who became Gnocchi Hall, not by virtue of his modest station in life, but he takes on the dome as part of this self invention.

Speaker 1:          22:19          You Dad, it goes, in other words, did not have the right to the dome. Dome of course, derives from the Latin. Domino's. Uh, sir, Lord Master, uh, your readings in Elliot, the, his, the imperial Spain, one of the books for the course will give you further, much further background on this. Now key hot day as you will learn reading the first chapters of the book too is said to be a derivation of Kihara jaw or cassava, something having to do with cheese or Kay Hannah, something having to do with complaint. Uh, [inaudible] or key Hannah could be it. He said that is the last name. Uh, one of them, he Hanoi is the last name of alone. Suki hell, the man who becomes Don Quixote, uh, the doll go who turns himself into and Quixote, uh, uh, these names, uh, echo those words mentioned before he [inaudible] the salar and so forth.

Speaker 1:          23:26          They are not very high sounding or ennobling words. Quite the contrary. I hope no one here has the last name. Kiana Organa. It happened to me in one of these classes as I was explaining this, that a Hispanic young woman in the class, uh, uh, how the last name Kianna and I had to profusely apologize, but I'm just trying to explain the title of the novel, but I am hoping that none of you is. Last name is Gal. Uh, now the ending OT OTE, suffix is a suffix that in Spanish always refers to something based or grotesque and sounds, it go from Gordon Lewis, [inaudible] granddaughter from ground. There is a hulking big guy. A Luxe felty from fail is an ugly cuss. So kihatha then was meant to sound a basing and ridiculous, particularly when pair with dumb, uh, with which it forms are kind of oxymoronic pair.

Speaker 1:          24:38          Don't be haughty. Dongs high son. Nicky hope this has all of this, uh, uh, negative connotations. It also has echoes of [inaudible], one of the night errands that, uh, uh, Don Quixote reads about. And it has also been discovered that it is the name of, uh, uh, of a part of the armor covering the leg. But the important, uh, uh, background is what I gave, uh, uh, before. Now Mine Cha Logmein Chai is a region in central Spain in because still that encompasses parts of the provinces of Toledo's, you Cuenca and Alba city. There are maps of Spain in the website. Uh, and geography is very important in that Quixote, particularly in part two. This is a novel that is very rooted in a given geography. Now, Lamont change flag, iris and monotonous. It's main product used to be serious and wine. But the important thing here is that it is not, or it was not until surrenders his work, a particularly desirable place to be from a Manchild, some in stain in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          25:58          Uh, it all sounds like a put down being from La Manchuria was like being from Bridgeport or buffalo or Brooklyn or podunk. Uh, uh, now of course this assault changed with the book and, uh, now, uh, the name has and the region has a poetic air and their theme parks in your mantra with windmills and all in Spain, you know, uh, of course. Uh, but, uh, that was, that was not what's the rent is intended when he had no, you know, they be from La Manchuria. Uh, it was to be, uh, uh, in contrast to other nights who came from more distinguished places. I am at least of, I'm at least the gala from Wales or pal. They Inglot Tara from England and then don't go the, you see, this is what it's supposed to be meant by the title. You wouldn't have suspected this if I hadn't told you because you're still under the influence of man of La Mancha.

Speaker 1:          27:12          Now the issue of Loki hotters spurious dumb is significant in broader historian, a broader historical sense. By the 16th century, the glory days of the nobility were long gone. Noble men were no longer much engaged in the military except that the highest ranks and never seeing actual combat wars were fought by professional armies. There was little chance for the nobility to exercise Marshall like activities, uh, which were left now to Josh and to hunting war became sports for the aristocracy. The nobility was on the whole, on a downturn in Spain because of politics policies initiated by the Catholic kings, Ferdinand and Isabella, to curtail the power of the accuracy of the aristocracy. Now, certain groups at the highest level of a cluster around the courts of the descendants of the Catholic kings just had a lot of power. But on the whole, the nobility is on the decline more noticeably.

Speaker 1:          28:20          So in La Manchuria which had a sparse population of EDL grows as opposed to northern regions of the peninsula. So for donkey halted to practice [inaudible] night, Aaron tree was a way of reviving the past, uh, of reliving a past of splendor and glory. Now only really available through reading that you, Albert Romances, uh, which portrayed the Medieval world, uh, when the aristocracy was truly involved in warfare or, uh, in, in sports such as hunting of which don't get hotter, was fond of you. As you will learn in the early chapters of the book, we will have much more on the [inaudible] side promised in the future. Now what about the language of the key holding? What language did a serve Vantis right? You say in Spanish? Yes, but we're in the 16th, 17th century. Uh, in the 16th century, Spain Spanish was undergoing its last significant linguistic revolution is last significant change.

Speaker 1:          29:31          And uh, at the time that the Quixote was written and published Pronoun Verb Forms, we're still in relative flux, but Cervantes Spanish does not sound do the modern Spanish ear as archaic and Arcane of Shakespearean English dose do modern English readers. Uh, I have a difficult time understanding Shakespeare on the stage. Sometimes with my American English, it does sound the Spanish have Cervantes though sound quaint and the book's fame gives Cervantes Spanish today a formal sound, but it did not have to its contemporaries for whom the book was not, of course, still the classic if read out loud, the Quixote is more comprehensible to current speakers of Spanish from Spain and Latin America than hamlet is to a modern British or American audience. But it, but what language was it that said this used? Well, he wrote in Castilian or Spanish, which are the same as we learn in covarrubias.

Speaker 1:          30:37          His title Americans have the mistaken notion that they speak the student in Spain and we don't know. And the rest of Latin America, it's the same. It's the same. It's the same language. Um, because the alien was the language of Casteel land of Castles. Because as the conquest, we will, you will learn what the reconquest is. That is the reconquest of Spain from the Moore's advanced in central Spain. Uh, as the, uh, US history conquest advanced castles were built to secure the territory's, hence Castille. Uh, and then Castille became, as you will read in Elliot, the, the, uh, the, uh, the most influential region, political and military above all of the peninsula. And with the, uh, with the unification of the peninsula under the Catholic kings, it tried to impose this language on the rest of Spain. Uh, so you know what the difference between the language and the dialect is a language is a dialect with an army.

Speaker 1:          31:49          So, uh, uh, language is, uh, uh, the language over a region with enough power to impose it on other people and become, uh, so, uh, there are the wear and our other languages in Spain, Catalan Galician basketball engine, but the Catholic kings and their descendants in post Castilian on the peninsula as much as they could and on the vast territories of the new world, what is today Latin America because of discovery and conquest were mainly Castilian projects. Spanish is more uniform as a result of these policies today than English is. So what is spoken in the Bronx, Mexico City and Madrid. Castilian would you Spanish is what's spoken. He's spoken in those places. So you can erase that, uh, American prejudice from your minds if you ever had it. Uh, it is a true, I mean, I had a colleague at Cornell, a very distinguished American medievalist who would ask me, in what language do you write your scholarship, Roberto?

Speaker 1:          33:11          I said, what do you mean in English and Spanish? He was worried that if I didn't write in English being a Latin America, I didn't have a cult, a language of culture in which I could write because he didn't think that in Latin America we had a language of culture. It's an American prejudice. Well, if Spanish was undergoing its last transformation in the 16th century, this was also a turbulent sanctuary for Spain in political, religious, social, and artistic terms, considered that in the 16th century, Spain settled the new world and beyond the Philippines and organize a vast imperial bureaucracy to rule it. Spain also control parts of Italy and the low countries and Spain itself was adjusting to the unification brought about by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella chief and could still hear from Aragon. They created the first modern state. By the way, you will, you will find in the Quixote characters come from various regions of Spain, uh, most memorably at the very beginning, a basket who speaks in broken Spanish.

Speaker 1:          34:22          Because even today, there are regions in Spain, as you know, if you've been to Spain where Spanish is really not the language spoken, uh, Galicia and the Basque country. And Catalonia and so forth. Now in the religious fears, pain became the defender of the Catholic Church, which was breaking up in the rest of Europe as the result of the reformation. Remember the reformation is a 16th century event. Spain was the bastion of Orthodox Catholicism and this affected tremendously it's political, social, and literary life. In 14, 92 of the Catholic kings expelled the Jews from Spain. Uh, and that in 1613, the Maurice goes the sentence of the Arabs who were still left. And, uh, uh, we will be speaking about that and they will be a distinct echoes of all of these movements and political events in the, in the normal, uh, one could say that the, the, the copies and only the first modern novel, but the first political novel in that it is much, it reflects very clearly political controversies of its, uh, of its time.

Speaker 1:          35:37          In the social domain, there was a significant population drain to the new world. The social mobility costs by the deliberate erosion of the aristocracy by a crown bent on centralization and control. You will find as you read the book, that the characters move through areas that are really the populated, uh, and this reflects this, this demographic reality. Uh, the new bureaucracy provided ways to attain wealth and power that threaten the status of the old and powerful aristocratic families as well as the traditional independence of provinces. And fifth dumps that dated back to the Middle Ages in the literary world. Spain's greatest splendor came at this moment, uh, in the, in the waning of the renaissance and the emergence or are off of new modern forms and joggers. The, the 16th century opened, uh, actually just before the 16th century in 1499 with the publication of [inaudible]. That's a word that you should learn here. Um, 1499 on was followed by with the emerge by the emergency of the picaresque in La. Sorry, your Miss [inaudible] was the first what we call a picaresque novels. Uh, 1554.

Speaker 2:          37:20          And uh,

Speaker 1:          37:26          they're emerge. What came to be known as the Spanish go media for the Spanish theater. W there were not all comedies, but it would call the compendia. And, uh, these were written by a low pay, the Vega and name that you might want to keep in mind because he was a very prolific writer who was also Cervantes rivals.

Speaker 2:          37:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:53          He may have written 700 place. How many of this change we were right there. You Sonia Lopez, right dose in a month. It's amazing. Uh, he was an amazing writer, a very powerful and a Cervantes, had a very tense relationship, uh, with him, um, import to the 16th century, so in Garcia, so that Rebecca, and then you will see in the book many times, and it's many followers. The late great blossoming of the Petrarchan tradition, you know, pay truck, uh, and the development, uh, from the Petrarchan, the powerful strain of mystical poetry, particularly in diverse of Saint John of the cross. Um, so this, the 16th and 17th centuries are what are called in Spanish literary history as the Golden Age. It was also the Golden Age in painting. If you have been to the Prado Museum in Madrid, you will see what I mean. We wouldn't be talking a great deal about, uh, Spanish painting here, particularly about Velasquez.

Speaker 1:          39:06          Now the hour, a little philological excursion about the title of the book already reveals a number of things about the hotel and about Spain. You may wonder Arabic, what about what the Arabs have to do with Spain? Well, the Arabs occupied Spain for eight centuries from seven 11. These are good dates to remember to 1492 when Granada fell. And that was the last bastion of Arab, uh, power in Spain. And it was taken by the Catholic Kings Verdun and, and Isabella. And, but the ire of left and intelligent, an indelible mark upon Spanish history and the Spanish language. It was not an occupation in the sense that we, in addition occupations in the modern period, uh, uh, historians speak of a Combi Valencia that is a living together of this Christian and Muslim cultures which involve fighting with each other, but fighting amongst Christians. And the Muslims are allied with Christians are going to let Muslims and so forth, but they were there for eight centuries.

Speaker 1:          40:15          And what could say that the Arabic component in the broadest sense is the main difference between Spain and the rest of Europe. The title of the book already alludes to that difference because of that x, but you will see it in many other ways as you read it. Um, now you can also glean from what I have said, that the Kihatha was translated very early into other European languages, which is, uh, uh, who just already, uh, mention, uh, 1611 for the, for the English and it went on to be translated in France. Uh, and, and so forth. Uh, that Quixote became very rapidly that first edition and 1605 and a European bestseller, uh, turning Cervantes who was, as you will read. And you, when you read from the, the assigned readings in the case book, uh, a minor figure, it suddenly into a great success.

Speaker 1:          41:12          Uh, it never brought him the financial rewards that he desperately needed, but it turned into a, into a success. Um, they say that at the beginning, in the early years that the hotel was bread almost universally as a funny book. It's obviously a misreading. It is much more than just a funny book. Now, let us turn now in the, in this, uh, uh, introduction, uh, to the basics. Do the title to the protagonist's name in English. Uh, all of you, no doubt I've read or heard the word quixotic and surely have a general notion or with meaning. Uh, someone who is a [inaudible] says the Oxford English dictionary is quote, an enthusiastic visionary person like Don Quixote or like don't quick soap. They way that they write it inspired by lofty and chivalrous cut, but also unrealizable ideas, uh, unquote. Hence, quixotic is quote to strive with lofty enthusiasm for visionary ideas.

Speaker 1:          42:19          How many authors or books, uh, or characters have entered common usage in this way? Actions or people can be done task Kafkaesque revelation, but are any of these as common as quixotic? Dan Task always refers to the inferno and conveys a sense of gloom, a fire burning sinners and all of that is done task. CAFCA ask describes a situation in which a labyrinth of forces appears to control your, your life and is applied mostly to do rock procees. Yale's bureaucracies becoming Kafkaesque. I can assure you of that revelation. Less common means uncontrollable appetites. Most the time, most of the time referring to gluttony, he had a revelation dinner, but you risk really sounding snobbish. If you say that you had a revelation dinner, uh, even if you're a Yalie, but not saying quixotic quixotic is really part of the common usage. Uh, if pressed, I bet anyone of you could give, uh, a TV guide, abstract of the book, even those who haven't read a word of it, it would go something like this.

Speaker 1:          43:46          I made this up. Middle aged man believes that he can become a knight errand. Like those he has read about in chivalric romances and takes to the road with sanctuary. A peasant had his choir to set the world are right. Software's many defeats but remained some bout. That's the whole novel right there in encapsulated and you can put that on a TV guy or something. I, I have, uh, uh, the fantasy that you can do that with any book, no matter how complicated, uh, try it, try it with the Bible, the Odyssey or something like that. But, uh, but I think that it was a chaotic, it works and that is what people have in their imaginations about the, the, the, the Jihad. Now, general knowledge of this kind is the aura that surrounds the classics. It can become a temptation not to read them. As a result, this sort of vague knowledge also has an undeniable influence on those who read them.

Speaker 1:          44:41          It is nearly impossible to read a classic innocently unless you are a complete illiterate. Um, besides, if, if you have read, uh, in some ways you have read Don Quixote. If you have read the adventures of Huckleberry Finn or if you have read madame Bovary or if you're a red, the cafcass metamorphosis because the influence of the Hilton, all of those works is so great that in a sense you have read it through them. Very few literary characters have these aura. I wonder hamlet of course, Faust, uh, remembering what a young watts said, king lear don't. One Oedipus come to mind. Uh, can you think of any others there? There, there are very few. There are a few within each literary tradition. For instance, a huckleberry Finn in the American, uh, context [inaudible] vaginal, but perhaps in France. Why is it a don Quixote has such currency as a kind of literary myth?

Speaker 1:          45:41          I think that there's hardly another secular book two, which we come with more preconceived notions and expectations. It is also one of the very few great works of world literature that is also a children's book. As I said in the paragraph on my introduction, I read it first. It was read to me as a children's book the first time that I, uh, now, uh, is it a kin to a modern in secular Bible, Miguel de Una Muno, the Spanish philosopher, uh, read Don Quixote as if it were a kind of secular Bible. And I have the feeling that my friend Harold Bloom does the same, uh, the kind of New Gospel, the Gospel for the modern age. Why not? You have to get something out of the cohort they relevant to your own lives, I think, or you're going to be wasting your time here. Believe me. Uh, I can't tell you what that is.

Speaker 1:          46:36          You'll have to find out for yourself. But, uh, why, uh, why can't it suggest something relevant to you or why has it for so many over so many years now I gave my explanation in my, uh, in that, uh, first paragraph to my introduction to the penguin classics. But let me give you a more detailed one now. Whatever other more subtle and specialized answers we give to this question throughout the semester, the only way to respond to it is to say that Don Quixote and bodies the most modern of predicaments, the individuals dissatisfaction with the world in which he lives and his struggle to make the world and his desire mesh. I mean this world, not our world yet to come a promised heaven. Why is this a modern predicament or crisis? Because the world is no longer a given. By the time Cervantes writes the western conception of the universe, uh, which was, uh, up to about the 16th century, largely based on a combination of Aristotle and the Bible.

Speaker 1:          47:47          That is to say scholasticism and the work of Aquinas has been proven faulty. Think of one major change. The first part of the Kihatha is published in 16 or five, barely over a hundred years after the discovery of America, the 113 to be exact. And the confirmation that the world is round, which proved beyond argument or doubt that much of the legacy of the ancient world and the Middle Ages was open to question. Think of a second major change. The reformation has challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and made political gains in many important European nations don't key hot. This is not a struggle between the individual and the gods. They fight against cosmic abstract forces us in Greek tragedy. It is not as in Dante human desire transformed into the yearning for us, a blind trust and dental vision casting a universe of perfect coherence, the machine of the world.

Speaker 1:          48:46          It is instead the struggle of an individual against the tractability of a world in which he lives the world redolent with imperfections of the, with the imperfections of the material coding the temporal flow that carries it further and further away from ideas. Does that seem to be two to exist only in the individual's mind? Uh, as hamlet says, the world is out of sorts and I'm here to make it right. This is what a Don Quixote, uh, says the novel says George Loukakis, the Great Hungarian critic is the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God, that novels, heroes, psychology is demonic. The objectivity of the novel is the mature man's knowledge that meaning can never quite penetrate reality, but that we thought meaning reality would disintegrate into the inessential into, into the nothingness of innocence. Reality. This is very abstract language of, uh, of, of, of, uh, of rue cashew was a neo Kantian.

Speaker 1:          49:53          Uh, but I think the important thing that you remember from that is the, that is a world abandoned by God. That is not a, it's not as a god centered world anymore as in Dante, uh, that that moves through. There are other, uh, uh, less abstract, uh, definitions of the Quixote global definitions that I am fond of. Uh, the one by Larry Nelson that I quote in my introduction to which, which goes in crudest terms, the formula of Don Quixote, maybe express as the pairing of with tall, thin idealist with a short fat realist and setting them off on a series of hazards in previous fiction, parents of characters who almost always been young friends or lovers. These new however simpler arrangement together with the Motif of bud literature influencing life constitutes a primal and influential glory for Cervantes, a curl airy, uh, issue to the question of individuals.

Speaker 1:          50:56          Mal adjustment to the world is another crucial modern concern. The perception of reality and the organization of that perception into something that we can be considered the truth. The way that modern criticism has labeled this in the Quixote's perspectivism. The interpretation of reality depends on the perspective of the individual, meaning in gross terms, that one's interpretation of the world is colored by one's background station in life, reading these tires and experience in general. There's a hilarious series of episodes when donkey hoped it takes the basing from a barber, puts it on his head and says that it is mom Breanna's helmet, a famous helmet from the epic tradition. And uh, uh, in one of the episodes in the, in the ensues a scholastic lag discussion about whether this thing is a basin or a helmet, uh, which is of course a funny, a reenactment of the, of the issue of perspective is in what Don Quixote, uh, is a helmet.

Speaker 1:          52:03          Others is a, is a barbarous basing. This is at the core of, of, of, of the book or the core of much of the humor in the book. This idea of the various perspectives don't be haughty, uh, sees giants and Sancho sees windmills on the clash, uh, repeats itself throughout, uh, the book. But this points to a very important issue in, in, in, in, at the beginnings of modern philosophy, having to do precisely with the perspective of the individual on our own, on reality and not, uh, not a perspective that has to be determined by received, uh, ideas. So, uh, this is, uh, these are some of the issues that will come up during the semester as we read the haughty. Please do the reading, uh, as I have a set it out in the, uh, uh, in the syllabus. The syllabus, as you know, is on a new website.

Speaker 1:          53:01          You can, uh, uh, downloaded from the website and there you will find a, uh, all of the, uh, uh, all of the readings in, in detail. I want to go over very briefly over that syllabus, although you don't, uh, a habit, uh, and also want to have you meet with the two tas so you can begin to try to set up meeting meetings for the, uh, uh, sections. Now let me go over the requirements for the course too, because I'm sure that you are eager to learn what the requirements. Uh, we'll be, uh, now at midterm and a take home final exam for two page papers. For years. I have been using this technique for papers, but each paper is only two pages, 500 words, no more and no less two pages because I want something crisp. And to the point, uh, an idea, I will give you the topics of the paper would, which you can devise your own particular topic, but just to, so you don't have to begin Vicki hotter the novel written by me.

Speaker 1:          54:20          This is a right to know you're writing for me and giving you, uh, what I hope to be as sharp original, uh, take on the topic that I give you so far of those. Um, and then, uh, you're required to come to class prepared to, we will have discussion after my lectures in the last 15 minutes of the class. Uh, and uh, you will, you are required to come to the sections as well where you will be graded on your performance, uh, in the, in, in, in intersection, the grade distribution. You will find that in the, in the syllabus is 40%. That's your papers, 20% of the midterm, 25 final exam, 15 attendance and so forth. You can get it. And uh, it's uh, rather, uh, conventional. Do you have any questions? Yes. The books are available at Barnes and noble and uh, under, uh, the number of the course.

Speaker 1:          55:17          And the books are a city. Uh, the transfer, the Delta in the translation, uh, the, uh, Imperial's pain and the case book that I edited with the criticism. Now there is also available a Spanish edition of the Kihatha. If you are going to read it in Spanish, it's the same one that is available for Spanish six 60. That is the graduate seminar. Uh, you can buy both if you want to play around with them. I have to say that I am not an entirely happy with Mr Rutherford's translation. Even though I wrote the introduction, I'm not happy with any of the translations. Um, uh, really, uh, is in a translation as good a smallest from the 18th century. And Rutherford, uh, what I wrote the introduction, uh, I had, uh, uh, a bitter exchange through the publisher because I want him to change a few things, but he's an Oxford professor who's very antiquated and, uh, um, uh, I hadn't changed, but I will, I will be pointing out the shortcomings of his translation as we move along.

Speaker 1:          56:30          Um, but I mean that's what we have to deal with because if you're going to read it in translation, do the translation. But Ed Grossman that it's also circulating a lot. It is my friend. Uh, it's a little bit better perhaps. Uh, but I liked this one because it has my introduction, which I think is better than Harold balloons for [inaudible]. It had, was a very dear friend of mine. So this is why I, I chose again to go with the rather for, uh, translation. Uh, so any other questions? The books are there. The uh, the website has all the information you could possibly want. My office hours are on Fridays from 10 to 12. Uh, I am not particularly fond of emails, um, because I don't want you to do at two in the morning, I have an email, a professor, one salary through about this idea that I have for a paper and don't expect that I'm going to answer the next day because I got a lot of emails.

Speaker 1:          57:26          And, uh, so, um, I am, I'm much more of a fund of a personal, uh, meeting. You come to my office and we talk about this. Okay. Uh, any other questions? Well, if not, uh, we are going to now pause so that you meet with Elena and Dina, uh, who are distinguished the students, uh, Elaina and Spanish and Portuguese and Dina and comparative literature. Um, Elena, as I said, he's from Maddy, Conte in Spain. Dina is from Russia, from Moscow itself. Oh, no, no. You are from somewhere in the back lands of, uh, of Russia. Uh, Siberia perhaps. So could you, uh, meet with them now? Um, tried to begin to set up a meeting because I know it's very complicated, so some games in touch. Okay.
