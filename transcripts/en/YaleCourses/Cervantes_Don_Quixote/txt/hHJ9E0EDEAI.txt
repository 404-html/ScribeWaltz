Speaker 1:          00:02          I said in my last lecture, and as you have already, I'm sure seen Vicky Haughty has, uh, two, uh, overarching plot. Uh, one is the story of the mad you [inaudible] go and his choir. Uh, and the story about the writing of the novel, the one about the insane don Quixote will acquire a coherence, uh, after the fight with the Caner us. Jarvis caused it in your translation because he and his choir will now be pursued by the holy brotherhood. I will explain what the Holy Brotherhood is and by the priest and the barber, uh, his neighbors, the priest and the barber wants to return along Suki Hanno to his home in that, uh, on named village in Lamont Chia, the episode about the lost manuscript and the search for the balance of the story the manuscript found and his translation follow themes mentioned in the prologue about the books, authorship.

Speaker 1:          01:24          You will also have noticed how, uh, Cervantes, uh, has a place with the division of the chapters. They seem to be arbitrary. Uh, they seem to be very whimsical. These are all winks at the reader, uh, telling him that this is a very artful, artificial and fictional work. Obviously, also, many of these divisions were made after the manuscript was, uh, was finished. Uh, scholars have worked on this and come to a conclusion, uh, in the context of the business, of finding the manuscript and the balance of the story and all of that. Uh, one could ask who is the second most important, uh, character in the Jihad? Is it Sanctu I think that it is the narrator, the narrator and his various, uh, agents, uh, who appear, uh, throughout the novel. Uh, that would be, uh, to my mind the second most important character in the Quixote.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Now, now in the, in this, uh, playing with the manuscript, uh, and, uh, the last manuscript and all of that Serantes is parodying the romances of chivalry where such devices, uh, appear, Oh, this manuscript of this novel was evolved from where it was written by some, uh, uh, sage and so forth. Uh, and Cervantes is parodying that remember a parody is a marking imitation of the style of a literary work or works, uh, ridiculing, uh, is stylistic practices by exaggerated mimicry. In that sense, a parody is both a criticism and an homage because it is a copy of something you said distorted copy, but it is still a copy. Uh, so the business of the unfinished manuscript and it's translation, uh, rekindles questions and issues that the narrator opened in the prologue, that product that we discussed a number of classes a ago. Uh, I will talk a little bit today about why all of these games of authorship, but that does sort of recapitulate how many texts are virtual texts we have so far.

Speaker 1:          04:09          We have the original texts that were supposedly written in Arabic by allying moreish historian called see there. I met, they've been in Haley. Um, the second is that text, uh, of the translation that the narrator pays for. Then if further text is the one that this narrator presumably, uh, corrects and, and, and, and copies and rewrites and comments upon them, their margins, as you will see in several episodes in, uh, in the future. Uh, but what about the manuscript up to chapter eight? And that narrator, uh, we have no idea how the narrator came about that manuscript so that, uh, uh, uh, the texts of the first eight chapters, we don't, it is not explained, uh, uh, where it came from. Now, this whole, uh, collection of manuscripts do not make a coherent system. Uh, you can reduce it to a coherent system. Just we have the first one, the second one, the third one.

Speaker 1:          05:30          It is all, it all remains a vague Ann and Ann Anne and mystery. And besides, uh, we know that the whole thing is a, a joke beginning with the name. See the I made, they've been in Haley, uh, or bedding. Hannah, what's bedding? Hannah eggplant or say I that is his last name is could be eggplant. So it is a joke. Um, no, why I Cervantes and his narrate or establishing this distance from their own text. How does this distancing Mesh with the authorial willfulness? We found in that first sentence when the narrator says, [inaudible] the name of which I purposely omit referring to the village in La Mantra where Don Quixote or Alonzo Kiano, uh, lives. It is as if this modern author said Avantis could not pass it his own existence. We thought radical reservations, self doubts. Uh, sometimes it's about himself as a creator. I have emphasized that this kind of ironic distancing a has echoes of Monta√±as self deprecate Tori, uh, irony.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Uh, also, uh, uh, echoes of Erasmus is a irony. I have only mentioned Erasmus in passing the great humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam who had many followers in Spain and who wrote a book that may be one of the sources of the cohort. They called in praise of folly, in praise of folly. It's a very, very ironic a book. They start praising folly. It is doing so in a mocking way, uh, but it is not sort of mocking way that you find in, uh, in, in, in Cervantes. Now, uh, it is as if a set of anthis we're removing the origin of the texts. We're leaving it, uh, in a, in a, in a sort of a, a, a cloud of mystery. And that this is part both of the irony and of the, uh, joke. Remember the quote from Luke Acts that I, uh, read in the first lecture about this first modern novel, uh, emerging at a time when the Christian God has abandoned the world.

Speaker 1:          08:08          You do not have the centeredness that you had in the divine comedy. If you have read Dante in the divine comedy, everything coheres because there is a cosmological system, uh, on a, uh, with the attendance symbolism provided by, by the Catholic Church, by Catholic doctrine. Uh, I'm so the self of Dante, the pilgrim, uh, is very much, even though he's also like don't be halted traveling, uh, within a coherent universe. And in fact, in the very middle of the divine comedy, the centered verse, the Central Verse of the divine comedy alludes to Dante. So Dante is at the center of this coherent universe. This is not the case in the Quixote. And these are for your games, uh, underscore that this is no longer the case. Uh, remember that this is, as I've been saying, a post Kapernick and world, a world in which the earth is no longer at the center.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Therefore, man, quote unquote, mankind is no longer at, uh, at the center. So, uh, uh, this is what is, uh, at stake as we were in all of these other games. Again, these are very serious issues, but Servon is always presents them, uh, uh, in a light humorous tone, which is part of the irony itself, the, the humor, the laughing at oneself, uh, and the laughing at others. So this is, uh, uh, uh, uh, very important, uh, element of, of, uh, of the Quixote, uh, and one that it has in common with a very famous painting by Diego Velasquez, Diego Velasquez, the Great Velazquez about whom most of you, most of, uh, most of heard, um, and that painting, Oh, uh, it's not very well represented. It's kind of blurry is last. Meninas they made the maidens of honor. Um, can we improve a little bit on the quality of that? Maybe if we, if we turn off the lights.

Speaker 2:          10:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:27          No, these are like, well that'll help too.

Speaker 2:          10:38          Is that a focus?

Speaker 1:          10:45          Is it better now? It's better, but it sort of, what could it be improved at all

Speaker 2:          10:50          here? So lends up,

Speaker 1:          11:00          oh, what is wild there? We can't do anything with it. Got me. So I have, um, I have brought both my pointer and a, if you will, excuse me, this little flashlight so I can look at my notes. A hoop he doesn't, uh, it's not distracting to you. Uh, as I have a perhaps mentioned before, I am a pilot and this is my, my pilots, a flashlight. Do you use it in the cabin and the cockpit? I'd make to look at charts and stuff like that. And I thought that I could improvise and use it for this. So now as you look at the painting and I apologize for the poor technology, uh, and uh, I, uh, promise that we will bring a better one the next time. Or maybe I'll make a copy of that. I can distribute, first of all, as you look at it, think of what I mentioned before about Albert is the pick Tuta uh, the, uh, treaties on perspective.

Speaker 1:          11:57          Remember that I talked about Leon, I'll Alberti Leon Battista Alberti 14, oh four, 14, 72 and Italian, uh, who wrote these treaties on perspective. He was an architect and wrote an architecture and I really encourage you to read this little tree. It's very brief, but it's very influential, uh, because he, uh, he, he, uh, he laid down the basis for perspective in, in painting. As you can see, we do have perspective here because of the relative size of the figures as they move away from the front. So I just want you to take that into account. Uh, now the, the, the relevance of Las Meninas working hard, they're essentially, uh, because of this issue of self reflexive putty in both works, that creator has been given a prominent place within the work and in both AFP or in their function as creators of the very work in question. That is bill [inaudible] and he is obviously in the act of painting.

Speaker 1:          13:11          I said, Vantis appears within the whole day in the act of writing the novel. Uh, now, uh, we look at Velasquez, he looks a little quizzical. We will speak a little bit more about his figure. Uh, and you can, uh, recall the words I've said this in the prologue. When he wrote, I often took pen in hand and as often laid it down, not knowing what to say. And once upon a time being in deep suspense with the paper before me, that pen behind my ear, my elbow on the table and my cheek on my hand thinking what I should say. And you can think of Velasquez, uh, poised in the, in a similar way, uh, as if thinking of what to paint next. And also actually comparing, uh, he's models who are speak about who the models are to what he is painting. But it's the same, uh, moment, uh, uh, of, uh, of of doubt that we have in, in, in, in, in, in, in, uh, uh, instead Avantis. It is kind of a visual aporia. Aporia is a rhetorical figure to express doubt. Uh, a p o r I a, uh, and a, a visual Aporia and that, uh, Belasco seems to be hesitating what the next brush stroke will be.

Speaker 1:          14:44          Now, uh, less money now seems to capture a moment and not a very significant moment. And that is significant in itself. How do we know that it's not a very significant moment? Well, there are certain gestures like this, a little girl, I just put her foot on the dog. Uh, these figures back here, if we could see them more clearly, you can see they're engaged in a trivial conversation. Uh, uh, the, the, the, the princess is being offered, I think a glass of water or something by, by this made and this man on in the back, uh, is about to leave the room. So it's an insignificant moment. There's a moment, uh, uh, like those inductee Horton, those many moments that are contingent, serendipitous, uh, things just happened. Uh, not, uh, in a sequence, but just caught like a snapshot. And that is what, uh, uh, is important about this, uh, uh, moment in which, uh, uh, Velasquez on his, uh, uh, all of these other people are in the painting are, uh, are caught up now of the painting.

Speaker 1:          15:53          We see only the back of the painting and we see the Easel, the pains, uh, the brush that he's received, the instruments to create the painting. And in fact, we are in Velasquez Studio, his workshop. So Velasquez is painting the inside of the workshop within which the work of art is being created as we are, as we read about the manuscript being copied, translated and so forth. Given the, the, the, the, the details about the composition and the creation of the novel that we are, uh, are reading this, this studio of, of Velasquez would be akin to Don Quixote's is library where he keeps the books of from which I, uh, he has, uh, uh, uh, that have turned him, uh, Matt. Now the other important element, perhaps the most is that the, the line between reality and fiction between life and art has been abolished. How saw, well, uh, who is the model of the painting?

Speaker 1:          17:08          Well, presumably the king and Queen who are reflected on the back on that mirror. But the models are truly ourselves as we position ourselves in front of the painting. In fact, the first time I saw this painting many years ago in 1969 to be exact, uh, it was, now it's in a large room and you can barely get to see the painting. There are so many, uh, uh, uh, tourists. We're looking at it and guides talking about it and so forth. But when I saw it in 1969 and the problem is museum, it was in a room. The painting is a much larger than what you see here. It was in a room, uh, that, uh, for itself. And, uh, the dimensions of the room and the way that the painting was, was, uh, uh, position. The moment you walked in, you walked into the painting, you became the model.

Speaker 1:          18:03          Uh, it was really a uncanny sensation that you had. And we really had the sense that you had walked into a painting and you had become the painters model. You have to become that which he was in the process of, of, of painting. Um, so, uh, here we are, become the model as there is a Belasco is within his own painting. He was, he was a genius, vain, a little lacy, uh, both boastful. He's wearing the, the cross I think is of Calatrava, one of the, uh, military orders. You didn't become a member of the Calatrava or just, uh, like that. So He's been boastful. Uh, and there he is. Uh, uh, now all of the, all of these self reflexive moves that we've seen in the heart, they are the same. Uh, here we see the painting. I see where, uh, from behind we, we, we see the preparation of the painting, but not the painting itself.

Speaker 1:          19:10          My late friend, several sort of Dewey said that the Las Meninas was within [inaudible], but backwards the same way that in the Arabic manuscript of the Quixote, presumably that Quixote is backwards because of course you write Arabic the other way. It's a little bit too clever perhaps, but you, uh, you get the idea that the painting is within the painting, but you're not seeing the painting. But how the painting is comes about. We also have the issue of, uh, the multiple perspectives. None of, none of them complete. That is, uh, Velasquez can see us, can see the model. He can't see the rest, the rest of the, of the, uh, of his studio. Uh, the, uh, the mind in the back is the one with the most complete view of the, because he can see the painting and he can see the models even deed the models are the king and queen.

Speaker 1:          20:13          So ironically it is not man. Who is it at that point? Uh, who has the most complete view? I say ironically because I detect a pun on the Alaska says a park in that a figure, uh, uh, because that in terms of perspective is more or less, but the plant, the fleet in French, the vanishing point, the boom to the food guy in Spanish. That is the point of the center and the depth, the depth of the, uh, that is the vanishing point. And ironically in that pump to the full guys in man about to leave various, I think the punt involved there, or perhaps I am being just too clever like my friend, I said, but the idea is that no one has a complete perspective. Everything. Everybody has a partial incomplete perspective, including the artist. And this is a fundamental, uh, because it makes for this, uh, Ironic, incomplete view. Uh, remember, uh, the greatest, uh, part of the irony in Cervantes is that we only have a partial view of this infinite world. Uh, this post Kapernick and now Galileo world, we're going to live who wrote around at the same time. And Galileo discovered the use of the tennis coach. He discovered the infinite spaces. So our perspective is always limited. So, so in the Meninas, the perspectives are all limited partial. And in that to, uh, the painting on the novel are alike.

Speaker 1:          22:05          Now, Galileo, I think I quoted him in an earlier lecture. If not, I'll call him again. And I said, the more we know, the less we know because he was just covering more stars, uh, more space on. He knew then that it would be impossible to get to know all of space. We're still in that situation, although we have improved our capacity now. So. So what, so what is the significance of, of all this? Uh, what I've just said, I mean the, the, the limits of human knowledge, the limits of self knowledge, uh, uh, and, uh, what else? We are the models. We are the models of the painting. And, uh, Ben last case has given himself a prominent position in a painting that should be the painting of the king and Queen. So he has usurped the place of the king and Queen. He has given himself a more prominent position.

Speaker 1:          23:10          He has as well as were erased them to put himself, uh, this is this ambivalent, uh, uh, uh, position of the, of the modern, uh, I writer and uh, or, or, or, or author or, or painter or artist, uh, about his own creative powers. But you know, he is, uh, he has put himself in the painting instead of those who should be the models that came. And furthermore, he has opened the space of the model so that we as we see the painting, uh, actually occupy the position of the king and Queen. This has all kinds of political implications. You see, the king and Queen had been removed and we who are commoners can occupy instead that position. So in that sense, this is a very revolutionary painting. This painting is saying, anybody can be king and queen by you're stepping in front of my painting, I'm becoming my model.

Speaker 1:          24:17          You will become king and queen for that moment. Remember there was a show called Queen for a day. You'll become queen for a day or a king for a day. Uh, uh, you understand? So there has been a displacement of power here, uh, in, in, in, in Velasquez, this painting by omitting the king and Queen or by relegating them to the back, uh, to a reflection. They're very kind of a blurry reflection, made more blurry by our poor company here, uh, uh, of the king. And Queen. So now, historically, if you will read your earlier, you will see that this reflects a real political situation in Spain, meaning that in fact, the power of the monarchy has been diminished in this painting is from 60 1656 remap Mary's later than Vicky hotter. But history did move that fast in the period. So you can 1605 Persky halter 60, 56, 50 years ago, give or take.

Speaker 1:          25:26          But by the 17th century, the Spanish monarchy has been weakened. Uh, it is in the, in the, uh, in in the hands of a valley. Those, uh, uh, uh, nobleman occupied positions of power and, and, and, and, and the Habsburgs were, uh, uh, very, uh, uh, this interested in, uh, in, in, in, in, in governance and more in, in luxury and all of that. But Alaska is painted, uh, the Habsburgs in some of those activities, hunting and stuff like that. But here in this painting, he has eliminated them from the position of power. He has placed himself at the center and it has allowed US commoners to occupy that position. So this insignificance of now that the panel, the most important parallels to, to this will come in part two of the Quixote. Uh, but I have, but I will anticipated here when sank [inaudible] he's made governor of a mark, uh, Highland, uh, uh, on, on, on central, uh, by the way it performs well as a ruler.

Speaker 1:          26:45          So he, the commoner has come to occupy it post deposition of Mueller. And this is something something similar to what is happening here in Las Meninas. So this is why this painting is so, uh, important, uh, uh, uh, in relation to the Quixote. But I also want you to, in anticipation a look at this figure here. Uh, the, uh, the kings of Spain. Like many others, including Astec emperors, kept, uh, freaks in their court for entertainment and for amusement midgets, people deformed and all of that. Of course, this is from our perspective, horrendous. But it was part, uh, it was practiced all over. And Bill, last case was fascinated by people who had a peculiar, uh, features, uh, irregular features. Uh, he painted, uh, midgets and, and, and so forth. And, uh, this is obviously a, a deformed, a woman. I think that she is important, uh, because Cervantes too was very much interested in depicting a strange individuals, individuals who are, are, are not beautiful, but who have been scarred by time, uh, on by life, uh, and by, uh, bad luck and so forth.

Speaker 1:          28:22          So when you get to the chapter in the inn and you read the descriptions of Marty tornness, the, uh, when she a prostitute, uh, who creates that whole fracas, uh, at night in the, in think of this, uh, of the face of this, uh, uh, uh, figure here, flat faced, deformed and so forth because it's another correspondence are very important. Correspondence between the Alaska says aesthetics and Sylvana stasis aesthetics. So, uh, so much for now for Las Meninas, we will go back to Alaska is later, uh, quite soon as a matter of fact to look, uh, at, uh, another one of his masterpieces. But for now, uh, so much for last many, now we will go back to having light.

Speaker 2:          29:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:24          Both artificial and a little bit of natural light.

Speaker 2:          29:34          Oops.

Speaker 1:          29:52          The one thing that I failed to mention is that as you noticed in looking at the painting, Velasquez has given himself unimportant position within the painting, but he's not a central position. He Easy Nano bleak position as it were a lateral position. Uh, this emphasizes this ambiguity of the power of creation of the modern author. And at the same time, the self doubt to self doubt, uh, that, uh, that, uh, the cell terrific reflectivity, uh, expresses, uh, so it is, it is, I think, noteworthy that he is on, on the side. I said we're, and the creator is looking, Eh, obliquely at the, uh, uh, of the, uh, the model, um, in the same way that said, Vantis says that he is father or stepfather of his work. Remember what he said in the 1605, uh, prologue that you, that we talked about in one of the first classes, the bleakness of, uh, of Alaska says position within the painting is similar to that.

Speaker 1:          31:15          We'll bleakness of whether he's father and stepfather on so forth. So, uh, we, uh, go back now, uh, uh, do the Quixote. Now after the episode with the scanner, the Wask, uh, when, uh, uh, Don Quixote, uh, dangerous. This man in this, in this fight, uh, uh, central is a very apprehensive. He is sure that they're now going to be pursued by the holy brotherhood. Uh, the, uh, they don't get held down. Sangio moving a whirl of alienation of madness on social ability on how cancer society deal with donkey halt. This is madness, uh, real society. Uh, now this issue is highlighted by the presence of civil law. Uh, indeed in the book central knows that they're being pursued by the center man, Dad, and who was the same tire man, dad or wholly brotherhood. This was a vigilante police force that the Catholic kings had created.

Speaker 1:          32:32          Ferdinand and Isabella, you remember your Elliot, uh, y remember that their greatest, uh, they invested a lot of effort in trying to unify the Spanish peninsula. But as I've mentioned, Spain is divided in several regions with different cultures and languages and exemptions from the law. Uh, where royal authority, just like the federal law in this country could not reach because of those assumptions that this, uh, that this regions had. Uh, therefore the Catholic kings created a police that could go through those regional boundaries and apprehend fugitives. The Holy Brotherhood was in charge of the roads because the roads were under the purview of the, uh, of the crown. Uh, and, uh, they were parallel to another institution that the Catholic kings created. That was also, uh, uh, they're also, uh, could, could, could, uh, police, uh, uh, all of the pinion. So like the holy inquisition, the acquisition code, police, uh, regions other than Castille, that is Galicia, the bass countries, uh, and so forth.

Speaker 1:          33:56          And so could the holy Brotherhood, the Holy Brotherhood were feared because they could, uh, not only apprehend you, but, uh, try you and execute you on the spot. And, uh, Sanchez that he already hears their arrows buzzing in his ears. Why? Because sanctuary is vulnerable to the holy brotherhood. Where asked Don Quixote, I send Evalgo feels that he is protected from the law. But so sanctuary is a one, if you will notice who insists that they are being pursued by the holy brotherhood and that they have a, they have to, uh, to hide in the, in the hills and, and, and so forth. Uh, the Holy Brotherhood, I sorry to give away the plot will eventually apprehend them, but let them go at the end of perk of part one. Um, now the, the members of the Bra Holly Brotherhood were just ordinary people who were, uh, engaged in this, uh, uh, in this police force.

Speaker 1:          34:58          So we moved out to the adventure with the goat hurts, uh, and the speech on, on, on, on the golden age. That is one of the more famous episodes of part one. Uh, now this is an episode like others in which a contrast is established between what Don Quixote has in his head from having read so many books and, uh, the real world around him. He thinks that these goat hurts are like shepherds of the classical, uh, tradition. And this is what makes him think of the Golden Age. When there is no mine or Lao, there is no private property, there is only a goodness and man lifts are one with nature. And he delivers his beautiful speech, which is filled with all kinds of cliches from the classical tradition to this quarter. So don't understand what he is talking about at all. But he, uh, what, what is the, uh, what is the, the connecting thread between that idealized reality?

Speaker 1:          36:12          Uh, he said that idealized world donkey, his head and the reality of this goat hertz who are, uh, uh, listening to this speech and not understanding a thing. Uh, that donkey hope is it say the one thing that connects the two, and it goes back to one of the points that I've made before is the goat herds. Kindness. They are kind, that is that which has not changed from those classical, idealized times. And the present is the kindness of people. And remember that I said that I serantes likes to depict, uh, people from the lowest classes, uh, being, uh, kind of, uh, to each other and to Don Quixote. They have not reacted to Doki Quixote's appearance, which is striking to say the least, uh, for this man to suddenly show up, dressed in armor, on speaking this way. And they have allowed him to, uh, to sit with them, to share their food and their drink.

Speaker 1:          37:16          And, uh, and uh, do we involve in their, in their life. So, so there is a sharp contrast, but also a commonality here. The, the people, the goat hurts or kind, uh, to Don Quixote and allow him to be, uh, what he wants even if they don't understand what it is that he is talking about. Uh, now this is the first of several post prandial speeches in the Quixote. This is the word, the, another one of these words that I'm going to, to teach you in this class so that you can be very pedantic Yalies in the, in the present and in the future. Postprandial simply means, uh, an after dinner speech. Uh, so, uh, what is the significance of this postprandial speeches on what do they have to do with the theme of Donkey Hotez, uh, speech? Well after dinner speeches, celebrate the defeat of the, of the world that is of animals and plants at the end of work.

Speaker 1:          38:30          And there haven't been turned plants and animals into food. Uh, here, uh, the, the eating some meat, they eat, drinking some wine, which is like the blood of the earth. They're passing the, the wine around and they are, uh, uh, enjoying the fruits of their labor. At the end of the day, they're celebrated the end of work and rest. Um, and there is a connection of course, between the eating and the talking and the speech, uh, oral activities, uh, both of pleasurable activities. Uh, so this is the connection between this postprandial speeches, between the food and the under speaking. Uh, others will be a, there will be much more Merriman and so forth, but this is, uh, a, a, a recurring scene in the, uh, in, in the Quixote. Um, there is a great deal about food in Don Quixote. Uh, and in some cases, food and language actually coalesce, uh, most, uh, memorably.

Speaker 1:          39:40          And, uh, when don Quixote on central vomit on each other after the episode of, of the sheep, uh, when they vomit on each other and it is a sin, I see food and language had become one and they have a dialogue, uh, between them. I vomited on you and you want me to me. And that is a form of, of dialogue. I know it's not a very palatable to think about that, especially if you just had lunch. But this is a, uh, this is the, the significance here of speech on food and uh, okay. And so, but the most significant part of course is the, it's this is the contrast between Doki halters, uh, uh, ideas and cliches about drawn from the classical tradition and the real, uh, everyday, uh, life of this goat hertz who also, uh, serve as a transition toward, uh, the Monticello.

Speaker 1:          40:39          Marcel Langley Saastr my episode in which the whole, uh, uh, theme of the pastoral, we'll be, uh, we'll be, uh, taken up, uh, out of, out of, we could say a higher literary level. The stakes are much higher and that you saw stonewall and Marcella episode because of course the death has occurred. Uh, and uh, there is a real, uh, a conflict. But so I think that the transition here is smoothed. The transition is made smoother by the figure of evolve who you have. I'm sure you remember, uh, who was the man with whom donkey hall to engage us in conversation about the nature of, uh, of, uh, of knighthood and, and, and so forth. And they all anticipate because it had been told by the goat hurts and so forth about this conflict involving the death of, uh, of the disaster. Most have really soft Domo. So we move to that episode in which the main theme appears to be that of freewill.

Speaker 1:          41:46          The theme of Freewill, uh, is the main thing, but an attendant and very important theme is also that again, of literature, literature and its effects. Because, uh, Marcella and resource are, uh, figures that are counterparts to donkey hottie in their relationship to literature because both Marcel angry source to more, but mostly Marcella want to play act and a literary role. She wants to be a shepherdess, uh, and take to, uh, to the hills. And of course resource Domo, uh, does the same to pursue her, uh, but also resource Domo. Uh, and in this he is also, uh, like Don Quixote is a reader and not only a reader, he's a student from the University of Salamanca and a former student, the graduate and a port. So the stakes here, as I say, I repeat, are much higher. And it is almost as if literature where on, uh, on on trial we can remember what the scene is consistent [inaudible] has committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          43:01          It is not said, uh, straight forwardly because suicide is mortal sin. And, and, and Savannah, this is writing in within the context of very Catholic Spain and he can't just ride it out directly that we source the more, uh, committed suicide. But the words used in the text desperado he became desperate. He was desperate all point out to the fact that he committed suicide. He committed suicide because Marcella spurned him. Uh, but what is amazing here is the very detailed socioeconomic context of the episode. In this sense, it's Mantis is anticipating ballsack the great 19th century French novelist who gave very, very specific details about the economic situation of his characters. And here we have that because we learned that Marcella Marcella is very rich. She has achieved the daughter of William, the rich who uh, her mother died giving birth to her and then William the rich, died and left Marcella, uh, uh, and trusted to an uncle, to a brother, I guess of his who's a priest.

Speaker 1:          44:25          Uh, and who, who will administer Harris date until she gets married. Women could not a whole property outright on the moment that you married the, uh, state would go Ooh, would pass over to her, uh, husband in the case of the resource to who is no longer a youth as we will meet later in the book. He's already 30 years old when he dies because when Gwen said, when lucky haughty leans over to look at the cadaver, he says, I saw a man of about 30. Uh, risotto is also, uh, uh, rich. He has inherited a great deal of, uh, of property in lands and animals and, and so forth. Uh, and uh, so it seems as if this were a perfect match. He is of noble, uh, lineage. She's not a, but this would not be an impediment and, uh, it would not bring down the, uh, the Linus said, where because a nobility is, was passed on in the Castilian laws by through the mail.

Speaker 1:          45:39          So it said renters or created a situation here for a, a, a perfect marriage in a small village, uh, this to rich, a young people would marry and, uh, create a larger, even a state. It could become even a my, your ass go. It worked that you will learn, uh, uh, about a little more later and entailed state. Uh, and, and so, uh, now what intervenes when intervenes is Marcella has a desires to become a shepherd to spurn all of her many suitors. Uh, Andy Resource, Tomas, uh, mad pursuit of her. You saw stonewall is a, a, um, a port. We learn that because his poem is read at the funeral. A typical Petrarchan concerning, uh, he's also the one who writes the outdoors, Sacramento Talis, the allegorical place on Corpus Christi Day. Uh, so he does a religious play, relates about the Eucharist. Uh, he said costs mammographer he can tell what the weather is going to be or the future and all of that. He said, kind of a budding Faust, uh, good to Faust in the 19th century in that, in that he can, he wants to foretell the future. He's madly in love. He supported, he has all of these qualities, all of these sort of demonic qualities that lead him, uh, to desperation and to a suicide.

Speaker 1:          47:22          In fact, uh, he is, uh, so much he wants to be so much in control that he has, uh, repaired his, his, his burial, uh, in such a way that it is almost like a play. Uh, he wants to be buried where he met Marcel and not in consecrated ground. All of these raise the eyebrows of the church in the town, and I rate her, says, uh, he has to, he's home a barrier. Uh, and funeral, it's going to be like an outdoor Sacramento, like one of these plays that he wrote and his body would be the main prop on the protagonist. So we see other characteristics of this character and meanwhile, uh, Marcella, uh, appearance on this at the funeral and delivers a very spirited defense of herself using very precise forensic rhetoric that is legal rhetoric and legal terms to defend herself. And they issue becomes who is right at the end.

Speaker 1:          48:30          Uh, the, the, the women characters instead of, and this are very active and one to take, uh, uh, destiny, they're investing in their own hands and not seller is a, an example. So one could say Mount Sinai is right and this is what Don Quixote determines dokey how to access a George. And he said, wait, because when she leaves in and runs into the hills, people want to pursue her and said, oh, no, no, no. He stands, I will defend her right to be free. She has a proven beyond any doubt that she has nothing to do. You had, you had no culpability whatsoever in the fate of a, of [inaudible] and such. You should be free. So is she right? Is She right? Or has Marcella also acted with some part selfishness by wanting to become a literary shepherdess to go around the woods and playing and being a shepherdess, not marrying these two have squandered their estates, have squandered his possibility?

Speaker 1:          49:31          Well, uh, it, it is not as clear as it would seem. Uh, the question I think, uh, remains open. The sauce, the more has died. He has killed himself. Uh, Marcella has sort of suffered a civil death, civil death in the sense that she has run into the woods, into the hills, into the thickest part of the hills, the, uh, uh, the Texas, and we don't know what's going to become a of her, they're separated from society playing this literary role. And so, uh, the, I think that the, the, uh, uh, the end of, of the, of the episode, uh, leaves us with a sense of ambiguity. We have to decide as we did in the undress episode before, but it's not as clear as a, as it seems. It also seems that the, that the, the episode is inviting us to, to consider the effects of literature that is literature has given Marcella and also [inaudible] the idea that absolute freedom is possible.

Speaker 1:          50:41          That you can live your dreams, that you can live out your desires. Uh, and obviously this is a dangerous, uh, this is a dangerous proposition which can lead to the kind of conflict that we have that we have here. Uh, remember the one passing judgment at the end is a madman. Don Quixote has passed judgment because in a way he is like Marcella and he defends Marcella's right to be, to be insane like him and to act out his. Now, this whole episode in away concludes on a very hilarious note, which is the next episode, the next episode in which they're going to the wheelchair. Marcella has escaped and they find a locals Aminos, which is a commonplace in literary, uh, art and literature. Uh, uh, a very, uh, pleasant place that he's a with grass, with shade, with water running, brook waking, a blessing sound and so forth.

Speaker 1:          51:48          And what do we have? What happens here? We have here the translation, sort of these amorous episode into, uh, into animal love. Uh, when board resy Nunca who doesn't seem to be a strong enough to harbor such desires, uh, meets a, uh, some mayors that are being also, uh, uh, but there to grace and, and have water by some, uh, uh, men from young. Was this a Galicians? We said we've met the now people from various regions in Spain. And what happens when, when, when borders in Anthea approaches and the mayors to us, the Texas, we communicate his desires through them. They meet him with hoops, they kicked him, and then there they are. Keepers come and beat the daylights out of border. She Nantais and a, and a don Quixote on central tried to intervene. And they are also beaten up by this, by this, by this people.

Speaker 1:          52:51          This is the, the conclusion in a way of the resource to mall and Marcella episode. But in a humorous, uh, Keith Serantes likes to work with this contrasts and with this transposition of something that was a very serious, and even sober in the softer one Marcel episode into, into this, uh, uh, a slapstick, a comedy episode of Poor Rocinante, uh, trying, uh, to seduce the mayor and being kicked viciously. So I think that this, the, the end of, of the, uh, of the, uh, uh, uh, uh, Marcel angry software might be sold. The last comment on it as it, as it were. Um, so now the night and he squire themselves are about to enter into the thick of a novel, uh, which will be a counterpoint between the Sierra Morina that is this hills into which they, they go fleeing from the holy brotherhood. And also because don't be hurt that wants to do penance for Lucinia a wilderness like the wanting, which Marcella was lost a counterpoint between that and one Palo Maca is in the, in where the freakers happened before with mandatory list and so forth. Uh, which will become a, a temple, a courthouse, uh, on where the, the, the complicated love stories in part one. And you will see how many complicated love stories and sue will be resolved in that, in, and, uh, so that is what we are going to move into in the next, uh, classes.
