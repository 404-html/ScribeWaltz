Speaker 1:          00:00:02       So we're going to talk today about two of the most significant episodes of part two of the Quixote. That'd be salts that mark a transition to, uh, that begin the sort of the down slope of the novel as it moves towards its conclusion. It is a protracted combination and finale consistent with the slower, more deliberate pace of part two. We will be meeting one character from part one who reappears. He ness the Pasa Monte under the guise of master puppeteer, uh, master Peter. And there will not only be repetitions of episodes from part one, but even repetitions of episodes from part two within part two. After the episodes that I will discuss today, three major new developments occur first or don Quixote will sometimes leave the center of the action to be replaced by sanctuary. Second, that both don Quixote and Sankyo become objects, the object of amusement for frivolous upperclass characters who have, who have read part one and three, that the protagonist would be surrounded by many more characters than before. The overarching theme of the novel continues to be this in Ganja as most of the action is staged by internal authors. Uh, it is an action that is highly theatrical and the props or backstage of the skits are reveal to the reader either during their performance or right after the first of the two important episodes is the one about don Quixote's descent into Montesinos cave. A truly remarkable to have the force and one of the most brilliant scenes in the western literary tradition.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       So Montesinos Cave. This is, uh, one of the principle episodes of part two and arguably of the entire work because it seems to engage the main literary topics and sources of the novel and also, uh, provides a rare glimpse into the inner workings of donkey hold. This subconscious, it is us as if we were looking behind the scenes of the cohort or allowed to see it reverse site. Uh, as we see the reverse side of that painting within, uh, Las Meninas that bellicose is working on, it is also as, as if we were allowed to dissect the, um, to dissect the protagonist while he's still alive.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       Then at first notice that this is an adventure that Don Quixote six, that he looks forward, not one that is imposed on him by chance. Like the encounters on the road or by other characters who are scripting is life. As we have seen. Sandstone Carrasco from the very beginning is trying to script hold Hotez life and there will be several other internal authors doing that. But this is not the case at all. Is An episode, uh, an adventure that don't Quixote, uh, once, uh, 200 take and he tells this scholar or the cousin, uh, that he wants to do so and asks how to get to want to see gnosis cave. It is also an episode that is a strictly, uh, Spanish, uh, and that seems to take Don Quixote into the depths of the Spanish soil. It is as if saying that these kinds of fabulous events, uh, also happen in Spain and in the present a law, as you will see, and I will speak about the sources of the episode, a descends into caves and so forth. And, uh, uh, but this is one, uh, that is based on us Spanish, uh, a tradition that is, people knew about Montesinos Cave and talked about it. They exist and don't be hot. They want it to go into them, decided that he had to have this, uh, adventure.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       One way to see the episode as flowing from Camacho's wedding, which is the big episode proceeding. It is true. It's connection with orbit. The cousin or scholar who is their guide is writing a Spanish of it and the explanation given about the reverse of Spain and their names is in the spirit of the metamorphosis. This scholar, uh, is, uh, another satire of a students and intellectuals, uh, uh, like the one that we have seen in the case of Sandstone Carrasco. This is even more extreme. This is a really ridiculous, a scholar who, uh, is trying to find out who had the first cold in history, if you remember. Uh, and, uh, so I also said that in part two of the Quixote Cervantes seems to be signaling as his sources, homer Virgil of it. And as we shall see, Dante as if claiming that his work is they're worthy successor, that he's in their league as it were.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       In common parlance, I will speak about Virgil when we get to meet LTC Dora, the character that you will meet and find very amusing who is a version of Dido. Now these descending to the cave has antecedents in the Odyssey, the need and the divine comedy of course. Uh, although there are also sources in Valerie Grumman insists this is an very and adventure on a higher literary level. This is not just going back to episodes in the chivalric romances, but homer, Virgil, Dante, uh, there are of course also traditional stories about going into caves in all cultures. Uh, and in all literatures. If you have read your American literature, you see that in Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn and so forth. There are episodes where the characters go into, into caves. But here, I think the, the sources are those that I mentioned, uh, going down into the cave has of course, deep psychological resonances having to do with Don Quixote's sexuality and come competently, uh, his fear of death.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       As he enters the cave, he has to walk away at the brambles covering the entrance in actions that are symbolic or reminiscent over deflowering. And the black birds that fly away in freight are clear in dimensions. Intimations of death. They are bad omens. They have a kind of a Hitchcock like air to beat. I mean, to modern readers, they, uh, I'm sure remind you of that very frightening. Hitchcock film, the birds what donkey haughty experiences in the cave is a dream. And of course these alliances with dream literature, this is clear by his being asleep when it's pulled back up. And from the story he tells about falling asleep when he sits down on the coiled up rope within the cave, don't get help. He says that he wakes up from that sleep, but it is obvious that he awakens within the dream. Now this is a dream within a dream. Uh, another, uh, mirror effect. What the dream allows is for the untrammeled emergence of Don Quixote's deepest fears in the form of stories related to his fantasies or drawn from his fantasies. It is as if he had been administered a drug, a drug, a truth serum, or us if he had relaxed on the psychoanalyst's couch and allowed himself to free associate

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       the story of good and dark. Then Burma is drone from the Corolla Carolingian cycle. Remember that I mentioned the various cycles of what you violated, Romances and the epics and the Carol Legion is from Charlie Maine and so forth. They're drawn from the Charlie Carolingian cycle and seems to have embedded not only, uh, the fear of death, but the fear of castration. Uh, all the characters except for Merlin are from the balance of the Carolingian and Arthurian Cycle. King Arthur Charlemagne, the characters are supposed to be dead and everyone is in the morning. And the procession is a, is a kind of a mournful procession as like a barrier dude underneath his body in the story has his heart removed and sent it to Bill Irma as a symbol of his undying love. This is the original story. He's, he asked when he died, who have this heart removed and sent to his beloved here, his castrated cadaver acid, where appears as the statue of grazing his own tomb and able to speak.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       But the voracity of the story is compromised or grotesquely guaranteed by Montesinos inclination that he has had to salt the heart so that it would so that they will not rot and begin to smell. This destroys the fantasy. I mean, if this great hero have is how has his heart center, his beloved one, never thinks that this heart will be subject to the laws of nature. I mean, this is fantasy world, but here, uh, that fantasy is destroyed. And the story, the voracity of the story, in other words, can be guaranteed. But the fact that they have to salt it so that it won't fill, that it won't rot a natural laws threaten the story's very similitude. A jerk beef heart is not the same as the heart that symbolizes love, courage and masculinity and me sir, the heart of course, all of these connotations.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       Uh, so if you think of it as being made of Jerky, beef, all of that, uh, all of those connotations are destroyed or become grotesque. Although time is flexible within episode, it effects on Flesh, our present that is invested in other aspects. I say that the time is flexible. Who was in the episode because how long was Gnocchi halted down the scholar and San Jose? An hour at most he says three days and then there is the issue of how long ago the stories occurred hundreds of years ago. Yet these characters are, are, are there. So a time within the, within the story is, is flexible as time tends to be, as we know in dreams, we know now from modern stories and dreams that that stories that seem to take a long time actually take a few seconds. In a dream, but a under that is this, this, this compression that Freud talks about, about her dream compressive stories in very short time. This is intimated here and that, uh, uh, look, the hottest has been there for three days and say, oh, we're only an hour. But the effect of time on flesh is, is, is evident.

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       Now these detail of the effect of time on flesh, uh, uh, reveal some key holders own doubts about the legitimacy of the chivalric legends. I mean, remember this is the story he himself is telling. Uh, so, uh, if he, if, if a story comes up in his subconscious subconsciousness because he, he's, he has doubts about the legitimacy of this, of the, uh, of the true legends, their stories, those of that you've got Rick legends violate natural laws. Hence they are fantastic as other characters have been telling him all along. And all of this seems to have had an effect on him.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       Now, don't be haughty is recognized as a great night, a constant that began when with sandstone care, Roscoe's revelation, that of the existence of part one a. And this is something that will happen over and again in part two that he is recognized as a great night. But in this case by characters who succeed, whose own existence is very, very doubtful and that he himself will doubt from now on by asking others anxiously. Like, am I supposed the roast master Peter's monkey? If what happened in the cave was real and by insisting that sanctuary believed that it was real striking deals with him, I'd believe that if you believe the cave of dizziness we shows and he's not that sure about.

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       So, uh, their recognition that is the recognition of his being a great night by these characters is, is Harley, uh, an assurance I am underlining this, this doubts that the stories reveal his own, uh, his own fantasies. But the most disturbing part of the story is the appearance of do scenario in the guise of the ugly winch that central tried to make him believe was his lady. This is a, okay, we know from Freud Freud's great booked interpretation of dreams that was published in 1900, uh, that we talked about the remains of the day. How a dream picks up elements from, from the previous day. And May it incorporates it into stories. And this is sort of the remains of the day. Uh, now the appearance of this wench convinced the sanctuary. The Don Quixote is insane because he was the author of that charade. But it also shows to what extent that episode of the three, uh, peasant women, uh, has shaken donkey halters own beliefs and probed deep into the sources of his own desires for [inaudible] and, oh, he's invention of Gucci man, this person [inaudible] who smells of raw garlic, if you can remember, uh, she smelled of sweat in Sanchez earlier story about her when you said, I got next to her and she smelled a little bit because she was pitching the hay or whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       Uh, this, this person [inaudible] I think this close to them. Key holders own real desire for, I don't sell or install the original Lucy, Neha. It seems to be the repressed desire for a vulgar, physically strong, sexually aggressive younger woman who is the very opposite is the fact that the is the core relative opposite of his idealization of her. The more vulgar this woman of his, of his desires is, the more idealized she will become in his fantasy. Also, uh, when he asked for a loan by her in this hilarious, hilarious part of the story. The last thing you imagine if we do female asking for a loan from be hot though, uh, which is going to be backed up by the way, the guarantee is a, is an intimate, uh, um, uh, uh, an inner garment of Deucey nails. This is a very elaborate, uh, underskirts of sorts. It's going to be the guarantees. I mean, these things are highly sexualized, but donkey hot, the short two realities, a g one six, but he has only four left to give her.

Speaker 2:          00:17:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       Uh, this is a clear of his deep and repress. Fear of sexual inadequacy. Couldn't be clearer. You don't have to be Freud. Uh, which may be the source of his heroic fantasies is old feel sexually inadequate. So he goes to imagine himself a young, vigorous night who can go and fight and seduce maintenance. So Saint Joe's invention in the episode of the enchanted we'll see now has dug deep into donkey halters dreads and into the source of his fantasies. In this topsy turvy world of the cave, there are eerie images of death. Also, I already mentioned the black birds at the mouth of the cave dude Undark. This cadaver posing as a statue on its own sarcophagus is the areas of the mall and the uncanny just it's, it's an inversion. The statue on a sarcophagus presumably represents the body of the dead person within it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       I'm sure you have been to European cathedrals where you go and you find all of this sarcophagi guy and you'll see on top the statue of the recumbent statue of the person within it, kings and all of that. We're usually like this with their hands like this, and they have their swords near the and all that. I find that eerie enough to begin with. But I'm in any case here, uh, the statue, uh, uh, uh, here, however the cadaver is the statue, nature has replaced art or has become art. Uh, you understand, instead of having a representation, you have literally the cadaver on top of the sarcophagus. But let us not forget that we are dealing here with death and also in the realm of temporality. If you remember that dude on dark, his heart was assaulted so that he would not smell. How can they cadaver replaced the statue and not rot?

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       Like it's hard. Art has been taken over by death to this is what the intonation is. Nothing, not even art is immune from death. In this world of the cave, there may be a pun, a ghoulish pun and bedded here. Sarcophagus comes from the Greek circles, flesh and fog line to eat this, our cover covetous, literally eats flesh the flesh of the dead body that it contains. But here, the dead body has escaped to become its own statue is a very baroque image. We will meet who will find a another, a sarcophagus, uh, that we will be discussing in the course of the next few chapters. Now their stories and images Montesinos cave highlight the central topic of part two deaths in Ganja. This in Ganja as we have seen, can mean the destruction of all illusions. Where Gnocchi haughty comes to after emerging from the cave, he declares in what is a classic expression of, of this and Ganja, and this is the quote for give you friends. He tells, he tells the scholar and central for having brought me away from the most pleasing and charming life on site that ever mortal saw or lived in short. I am now thoroughly satisfied that all the enjoyments of this life pass away like a shadow or a dream and fade away like the flower of the field. Oh, on happy Montesinos all desperately wounded. [inaudible] or unfortunate Belaroma oh, weeping. What the honor and the unlucky daughters or Rivera whose water show what floods of tears stream from your fair eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       He says a bit later, quote, I awakened and found myself. I knew not by what means in the midst of the finest pleasant test and most delightful meadow that nature could create all of the most pregnant fancy imagine unquote, this is the locals Aminos of Renaissance, uh, uh, pastoral literature that I have mentioned before. Remember the locals on Menos into which, uh, uh, Rocinante wonders and falls in love with the mayors and all of that. Uh, it is, it is a topic of renaissance literature as the most pleasant of places. And this is where he, where he lands a person would be where he has, uh, his, his dream, the same Gagnon was, I've been saying means to peel away the illusion that dilution. It is a form of self analysis of recognition comparable to the one in today's terms achieved through psychoanalysis. Loki Quixote seems to have dived into his own subconscious.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       Is this a regresses at Ulta Room? An atavistic returned to the wound as a Latin way of saying it. Return to the womb progress was Altarum is an atavistic return to the womb. I mean there's, uh, we're trying to get back into the mother's room, uh, uh, seeking solace and refuge. A donkey. Houghton descent, as we have seen, makes him look harshly upon himself. It does not completely shake his beliefs or dispel his madness, but it is a serious blow. And from now on, he will act saner. How can it have been pressurable? However, only if one thinks that once in the cave, he was at least in the living presence of his fictions, this was pleasurable and that the disillusionment, uh, became repressed as he experienced it. When he met, when he met all of these elements that threatened his exists illusions, we repress them immediately.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       And that, uh, as we tend to repress on unpleasant experiences, uh, that he was not aware of, we readers are that what he experienced threatened his beliefs. So when he comes, he comes back with doubts but are not, uh, conscious, uh, doubts. Now, everything seems to converge in the scene of the casinos gave Toki hottest believe in the authenticity of the romances of chivalry and the reality of what he sees when he sees windmills. For instance, uh, uh, our, our question, the topics of courtly love of the courtly love tradition, which had filtered into the romances of chivalry Tombow through literally session by there being put through the requirements of natural law. I already alluded several times, would undoubtedly salted heart. The LERMA for her part may have looked under the weather because she had her menstrual period. No, not really. It is explained because the problem was that she is Menopausal, uh, real time and it's p and a and withered periodic bodily functions. A and aging and decay have crept into the world of fiction contained in the cave. No harsher way to dispel the ideal. The ideal is of a renaissance beauty than to imagine her menstruating or going through menopause. We need that. She's already aged. Imagine body cellies venuses with those problems.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       Is it girl task?

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       Uh, it, it's brilliant. However,

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       To subject these idealizations to temporality and temporality here means that their age or they software, the menstrual period. Why would do Sydney, I need a loan. He said that need or necessity is everywhere. It had been passing the world of magic. You seem they did by needs and physical laws and uh, and, and, and what ensues are a grotesque images?

Speaker 2:          00:26:25       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       no. The, there, there are many literary antecedents of the Cave of Montesinos episode. And I have already mentioned homer, Virgil and Dante. But the originality of the happy salt is not so much the descent into the cave as that it reveals donkey halters subconscious. This is Savannah. This is way of showing us the night's mind from within unencumbered, by recent as such. It is, it seems to me a better device than the soliloquy in Shakespeare or in Calderon, which are parallel devices to show what a character, uh, what a character's thoughts are to be or not to be and so forth. And in called their own imam, he settled. Let me the, this is from the life is a dream. Uh, also, uh, it is also more modern, unacceptable. This device in Atlantis to contemporary readers. It seems to me because no one goes around delivering soliloquies that are perfectly structured. Rhetorically. I don't. I have you, I'm sure you haven't heard any of your friends going around, uh, delivering soliloquies that are so poetically well, uh, will rot.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       But telling a dream is a common activity. Uh, not only to Flaco analysts may tell your dreams to your friends in the episode. There is a group task combination of fantasy and not just reality, but the possible all having to do with the decay of human flesh. But as I have suggested, isn't this also a tale of castration fear? These are the repressed the figures in donkey, this mind Peter Dunn, who was a very good, uh, Hispanic, the Britain the British has punished who taught for many years at the end of his career at Wesleyan University nearby, rolled the following in a very good article on this episode. Uh, actually Peter Don wrote this article in Spanish and I'm translating him into English. These are the Baroque in versions that you can get in this course to. This is what Peter Dunn said in my own translation into English. What is observed in the Cave of Montesinos episode is Cook's autism.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       From the insight he looks at himself in the mirror of his madness who are comedy and spectator merge and the enchanter and the enchanted coalesce far from offering us an image of eternity. Montesinos his cave constitutes a frozen temporality, Loki hot. They will have to return to his own bed and dream the dream of death. So alone Saki, Hanno can awaken purged of his dreams and ready to contemplate himself without theater in the mirror of eternity. This is anticipating the death of our own SOC econo. Uh, at the end of the book, Anthony Cascara d an American Hispanic links the episode to the dream argument in the guard and make quite a few valuable observations about don Quixote as a whole, particularly about the tire debate about the relationship between reality and fantasy. He says, I see his engagement as with problems of skepticism and epistemology and more specifically with the use of fiction as a mode of knowledge of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       His response to skepticism and two, its compliment epistemology is to reject the epistemology while remaining anti skeptical. But this is only another way of saying that its purpose is to affirm the role of fiction in our relationship to the world, which it might further be said. It's an affirmation of the role of fiction in the task of philosophy. Cervantes shows that we relate to the world, including the world of our own experiences in ways other than what the epistemologist called knowledge. And that all we know of the world cannot be characterized in terms of certainty. So Vantis we'll do include the imagination and dreams within the range of valid human experience within what we call the world in the broadest sense. Free of the cabinets of recent points. This up in short Cascara the tends to be done to philosophical in short, that stories, that literature are a form of knowledge on a method of approaching knowledge of the world and of ourselves and a way to understand both the worlds and the workings of our own minds.

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       Now, psychoanalysis knows this and this is the reason why Freud availed himself of figures like the Oedipus, a myth to name mental processes and force a Freud acknowledged that his sources, uh, in the development and invention or psychoanalysis, I see, he was really the inventor of it were literary on that he learned more from literature than from the 19th century science that preceded him. So the point is that these stories in, in Montesinos cave show that stories are valid ways of approaching knowledge, knowledge of the world, and knowledge of our own minds. And this is what this episode I think suggests brilliantly, uh, and, uh, independently. And also of course within the structure, within the structure of the, uh, uh, of the novel so much for the time being, uh, uh, for the episode of what they've seen us with cave a to which we will probably have to allude a number of times, uh, in the, uh, in succeeding lectures.

Speaker 1:          00:32:28       And we move now to the second, uh, important episode that I want to discuss today. And that is a master Peter's puppet show. No, I uh, uh, I have made a crude a drawing on the, uh, on the blackboard that will help me, uh, explain, uh, the, uh, uh, the episode. Uh, it is a sketchy, I understand it is more Picasso's and Velasquez, let's put it that way. Uh, but you can recognize some of the figures that of course, as soon as the bus, I'm Auntie, that is the speaker, the boy who speaks about this don Quixote. That is sanctuary. And then the rest of the audience, uh, on, of course the puppet show, uh, as best as I could render it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       Now

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       the reappearance of [inaudible] to establish a second creek continuitive with part one other than essential, the women of Donkey Hilda's house, the priest and the barber. He nest is the only character for part one from part one who comes back in part two. If before he ness was a rogue picaresque author and [inaudible] remember, uh, uh, material among the author of Guzman. Farace. Do you remember that? I said in that episode of the Galley Slaves, when he says he has written his life is, is a matter of [inaudible] it before he knows what a rogue picaresque author [inaudible], he is now a master Peter and miniature playwright, a Lopey the Vega in miniature, remember Lopez [inaudible] enemy and the great Spanish play right? The period.

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       As both a and Lopi, he nest stands for the modern author who's not an Aristocrat or a cleric and has to earn a living from his craft. Nope. Like to put the, the Vega and his last name to pretend that he was aristocratic and he made up fables about his family and all of that. But uh, he was not,

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       he nest also stands for him for Cervantes himself. And the whole episode is like a laboratory for fiction who carry out experiments about fiction. I said, run. This tends to do when we have seen he, Nancy's Wiley, does not represent respect literary tradition or rules and shows the limitations imposed by the medium of literature. Like the imagine friend of the 1605 prologue. Remember the imagined friend whom said, Avantis says, comes to visit him and helps him write the prologue. Please. Modern author does not have a confession, a conventional or deep classical education and has to rely on Compendia and books are familiar quotations for his area district. Uh, Lopa was known for this, for, to get his information here and there and pretend that he had read a lot. He read a lot, but, uh, not in the way that humanists had read a great deal and he made it up the way that the, the friend tells of in the prologue. We just go and get this book and Darren then just make a list of sources in alphabetical order. And that's, that's the way, uh, these modern authors upbringing now he, Naz has now one I covered, this is why I have, well actually I have the wrong, I covered. Um, it's supposed to be the left eye that is covered. So to be true to him, who we uncovered is I uncover these are the left die.

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       He has one cover, presumably the one that pulled in when he and made him cross out because he knows that this is a distinctive trait that is dangerous for him to display. He can be spotted, described and nabbed by the Holly Brotherhood. So he has to disguise himself. He's why he has to cover his sort of his signature, his body signature, which is that he's crossed eyed, like having a prominent scar or something. Remember the description of him Quixote that the uh, the trooper reads or when he's about to arrest him. Uh, towards the end of Clark one, he has a description, so I description of he ness. We'll probably begin by saying he is crossed height. So he has to cover that. I uh, to be, uh, to be safe. He, he nest is a fugitive from justice. Remember he is one of the Galley slaves that Don Quixote set free.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       Uh, so whatever other crimes he committed to make him be a guy in his life. He is also, he has also escaped. Hence, I quote, I had forgot to tell you, this is from the book that this same master Peter had his left eye and almost half his cheek covered with a patch of green. Tough ETA is signed, that something else, all that side of his face. That's from the text of the key hot day but being one eyed as it were, even if it is faked suggests fresh restrictions that impeach or his art because of his limited perception of reality. I am sort of glossing over it. My article in the case book that you have read presumably by now this deformity also makes him look furtive. Dangerous, sneaky and of course aesthetically interesting like the characters in part one and those in Belasco his paintings, he is no renaissance idealized model of a man or low, it is said several times that he's a Galanta and good looking man, but he's cross light.

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       but being uh, yeah, uh, before he, before he nets converging site access, distorted reality, we have gone over this now he lacks depth perception which is very suggestive to the show that he will stage at the end.

Speaker 2:          00:39:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       Ironically, by eliminating one eye, he, Nancy's overcoming the problem of non converging sidelines. It is a radical way of doing so, but now he lacks a perspective. Remember that the binocular, bye [inaudible], sorry. By O'Connor a site you'll see with two eyes. Therefore you have the potentially a double vision. And they are because of this, they are in some cultures a dts that overcome this. By having a PDL I, which is an I in the middle of the forehead that sort of serves to mediate between this, uh, this, uh, uh, so, uh, in the case of Jimenez, he is by eliminating this eye to have only one eye and therefore only one vision. Uh, whereas before, as a cross eyed, he's, he's, he's, uh, access, did not meet, uh, uh, there was supposed to meet here but they don't quite meet and therefore he, he, he saw it in a distorted way. But now with only one eye, as we know, he loves, he loses, uh, uh, depth.

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       Now, the whole episode of the Puppet Theater is besides yet another critique of Lopa the Vega, a protractor experiment on all of my nieces like that of the Princess Mikami corner. And not just in literary terms, they're also in, in pictorial terms, but as a critique of Lopez said, run this again, harps upon the carelessness with which Lopei use history to write his place. Remember the episode with a Canon of Tolo where there was a protractor discussion and critique of low pay for just grabbing historical elements, pell mell without being very faithful to, uh, history when donkey hot protests in the middle of the, of the show that it is wrong to have more ringing bells instead of kettle drums. Master Peter Answers with what contemporaries were. Contemporaries were sure. Surely not to miss an allusion to Lopez away.

Speaker 1:          00:41:55       It says Senjada Donkey Hartej says, uh, he nest it. But someone from within the, uh, the public theater do not criticize upon trifles nor expect that perfection, which is not B to be found in these matters. Are there not a thousand comedies acting almost everywhere full of us, many improprieties and blunders. And yet they run their career with great success and are listened to not only with applause but with admiration. Gabori and let folks talk. He thought he's now addressing the boy. Go on boy and let folks talk for soy filling my bag. I can note if rep, if I represent more improprieties than there are in the sun. Now this is clear and I'll loosen it. A little bit of us could be made. I remember that [inaudible] May, uh, as I mentioned before, may have been a follower and a defender of Lobelia. And again, this is why he wrote his, his uh, in his bro look such insulting comments about this.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       Now I said laboratory of my meets just they show that mindset better and he's assistant put on is of a conceptual complicity worthy. They'll ask us, have left Meninas under spinners, which you'll have seen here to begin with. We have the performance of the puppets is not enough in itself and that mastered Pieter's figures and props require a supplemental oral commentary or narrative executed by his assistant. This is the assistant, I put a little balloon here as in comic books because this is what he's saying. First you feel me? I'll be allowed to use his convention from, uh, from comics. So he needs the supplemental narrative by the, uh, uh, through her man. What's the word? The period. Um, but the visual and verbal representations do not harmonize properly on both donkey Horton, he ness how to admonish the boy, uh, who is the authors supplementary voice over, he's like a voice over in the film, but it is the seeds, the voiceover and the film images didn't quite niche.

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       It is a dual performance of the author's invention that is the author of invention, which is, he knows here is manifested in two ways, um, which has manifested visually and orally at the same time, hoping that they will compliment each other, but they do not measure satisfactorily. Uh, see if there were an inherent flaw in the recital that reflects the awkwardness of the theatrical routine. Very awkward to represent the stories with this, uh, material objects that are ribbons that represent human beings. So what we have here is a very flawed combination of the oral and the visual trying to combine to produce, uh, uh, a performance is satisfactory performance to, to, to to produce me Macy's representation and it you say critique of me, basis and representation. This is what I'm trying to say. Don't hottest corrections to the boy. Correction to the boy is significantly made in the language of geometry as applied to painting. Doki holders is here, Gnocchi hotel said in a loud voice boy, boy on with your story in a straight line and leave your curves. I'm trans versales for Tacoma. The truth of a fact there is often need of proof upon proof. Oh cool.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       What could seem like a mirror rhetorical display on the part of the night is on the contrary of surprising propriety in the context of the episode because the whole effect of the puppet show depends on a visual tone. Palais lay, yeah. Is a French expression for the trick. Trump la, you use it in English. [inaudible] is a word, an old word in Spanish it's the same thing. [inaudible] we don't use it anymore in Spanish. If the French word most of the time, uh, but it's based on the visual compilation or a visual trick based on perspective. Exactly the way that a painting is organized according to geometrical rules and produce the effect of mass and depth.

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       I hope you follow this. You're magical rules. In the painting we've talked about, uh, the, the book by Alberti, uh, produce the effect of mass and, and depth by distance. Master Peter Himself, by the way, agrees with Don Quixote and his admonition to the boy also appeals to the language of geometry and painting. Boy, none of your flourishes, but do what you're gentle. The gentleman bitch you for that is the surest way flourishes is DBU host or drawings in the original Loki Houghton, he needs his word. Where does it say more than they know a common occurrence instead of one. As we have seen many times, the puppet shows effect. It's very similitude is based on a question of proportions and perspective and has a great deal to do with a straight line that don Quixote demands that the boy not radar follow with or without much success.

Speaker 1:          00:47:28       It's a metaphor of to apply straight line to how a story unfolds and narrative unfolds. Uh, uh, the narrative straight line and the straight line that can be drawn from the spectators to the show are related, but it's, this is the straight line that the spectators, uh, from the spectators to the show as they look at it. And I'm relating that to the straight line in the story that Don Quixote refers to when he admonishes the boy, if the spectators looked directly at the theater to engage in it's fantasy, they have to disregard that are such a short distance. Human figures, horses and buildings should appear so small as if they were much further away. Perspective has to be assumed and it's, uh, uh, uh, uh, as if different geometric relations between the public and the tiny actors obtained as if, as if the geometric physical relations between the spectators on the show where we're different than they are because they're so close.

Speaker 1:          00:48:46       The narrator goes through curves and transverse souls as [inaudible] calls them to achieve the illusion of simultaneous action taking place and to hold the spectators attention and approval in the same way that the theater has to abuse the rules of geometry to stage the action abusive, the rules of geometry to stage the action in what is presumably a lot greater territory, but it is compressed on the stage. Uh, and, and the proportion between the various elements about the various, the actors on the horses and all of that is cost. They're not follow, he knows cannot vary the figures, dimensions as they come closer or further away from the public. They are the dimensions are it given that cannot be changed. These whole ensemble of virtual lines like those in Velasquez is painting, hold up the fiction and it's preps at the same time in front of the audience, the audience, your hindsight where both of the fixture, I didn't have the props that are there to make up the fiction is what I'm trying to say. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       Velasquez paintings to sustain the illusion that narrate or not only avails himself figuratively of the, of the geometric figures, but also of the rhetoric of vicious repeating the Anaphora like a sun. Anaphora is a rhetorical figure when you repeated work or a turnoff race. Let us not forget that the letters not for good as an owner or rater will repeat something like that. That is an Anaphora. And here the, the the language of visions in medieval literature. Use this figure and the boy says, pray, observe, see him. Now turn your eyes door. Now behold, did you not see behold, now observe that what he's really telling them we all have these reputations is but don't actually see, but don't actually see what is really happening. Overlook it. To be able to, uh, accept the fiction within the very illusion of a show. We have a kind of mirror duplication of the problem of perspective and vanishing point. Remember that I talked about vanishing point in Las Meninas about that gentleman who's at the very end who is literally leaving and vanishing. So that would seem to be a pawn. There it, this becomes a literal, when, uh, uh, mainly Sandra, I'm Dongo Pharaohs who I on the same horse and gallop desperately running away from the Moore's doors. La Linea, the Franzia towards the line dividing France from Spain, the border. So if they are in the horse here, they're moving towards the back of the stage. Doors are vanishing point. So this is literalized here, the vanishing point in the fiction that is being depicted in the story.

Speaker 2:          00:51:49       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       Now all these tricks managed to confuse Gnocchi hotel of course, who predictably lunges tours the action to participate in it caught in a net of rhetorical under your magical figures that have blinded him, not letting him see the difference in size between his own body and those of his enemies. He has lost the sense of proportion and this is what encourages him other than his madness, of course, to participate in the action. This is, by the way, this scene of Don Quixote, uh, launching onto this, onto the, onto the, uh, the stage is one is the one that Orson Welles used in his, attempted a film on Becky Haughty. Orson Welles never finished his Quixote, but there are parts that he filmed and uh, I spoke about them in a symposium on nursing wards here a couple of years ago. Um, got to see some of them. And this is one of them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       And what he has, the scene takes place in a movie, a movie that has been shown. Our doors actually declined from the stage and flashes of the screen, uh, in this, uh, in this, uh, modern adaptation of this famous scene. I think that's a rant. This, uh, project himself in Hyannis Master Peter as author of modern fictions as he had already done in the galley slaves episode in part one. Do not overlook that. Cervantes was also a main like, uh, uh, um, he missed his, a cross EIT and Cervantes, as you remember, had a leash on his left arm that he could use. He Nas mattered. Peter is struggling with the hardships of authorship as it were by adjusting his ability to perceive reality, hence to represent it, making himself one I'd mastered. Peter Manages to prevent the problems created by his gross eyedness. Remember that with two eyes, let alone their being cost.

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       There are two visions which may or may not coincide, but we certainly will not if he's crossed eyed. We have gone over this. This is the cost of, is not being able to foresee and ending to his autobiography. Remember he says, how can my but autobiography we finished in my life is not. You could see, you could project that as, as, as a problem of vision to if, if autobiography goes this way and life that way and you have a vision that doesn't allow for a, uh, um, a coincidence of the two, uh, that, uh, infinitely receding, uh, end of the, of the, of the fiction or infinity, the end of his life could be seen as part of his, uh, uh, problems, uh, problems with his eyes. Um, uh, with only one eye. However, master Peter, Peter would be able to look straight through only one visual axis.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       But this is not a happy solution either to compensate for his loss of one half of the visual field. He must look sideways. If he, if he has his eyes covered, he has to look sideways to skew in his head. They cannot achieve a harmonious vision and he makes himself more awkward. And uh, an interesting, uh, Hennessy cannot represent reality properly with only one eye master. Peter cannot create a perspective that would correspond to reason to follow our Burtis treaties. In on painting that I mentioned, he's reading of literary tradition. He's also a skew like the tilt of his head. We also know that with only one eye he would also news his depth perception, which will disasters. They affect his capacity to create perspective. He's rewriting of the municipality Cindra and Gay Pharaoh stories fraught with errors like Lopa the Vegas place, which Don Quixote tries to correct us.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       We sold only that ideal reader alone. So who instead of writing romances of chivalry, tried to act one out, can see straight in the lucid nights of his library and perceive fixtures that are harmonious and very similar within themselves and to himself. Donkey halting the darkness of one pal is in, by slashing the Wineskins, makes the various fictional levels converged and resolve the conflicting stories. It is the ability to fuse all those non converging levels of fiction that makes it Ranta switch. A great modern author who's fictions will not destroy themselves from within as he Nessus does here. Cervantes is a, is a happy cross eyedness because the various lines do not feel in his imaginative world yet here in some way to him, the origin of vision is always already a double vision with irony being congenital to it with representation depending on it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       I like to see this whole episode of Master, uh, Peters puppet show as an allegory of the whole of the Quixote which surrounded the author hidden, uh, inside there. Um, uh, but outside it's fiction which he controls through strings with the voice projected by an agent, a CD. I met Dave Haley or his translators whom we cannot quite control either. The story itself like that of merely Sandra and guy pharaohs is drawn from literary tradition but distorted and rearranged as needed. And the public. We, the readers drawn into this fiction are drawn into this friction but not completely aware as we are of the artifice of the whole construct. I am moved, uh, romantic that I am we Cervantes identification with Inez, the fugitive from justice roaming through Spain's struggling to make a living with this facts, fiction making contraption. Now Cervantes wraps up this take on modern literature and his labors in the brilliant scene that closest the episode of master beater's puppet show, the one in which aided by central on the innkeeper, Don Quixote compensates the puppeteer for the figurines that he has smashed.

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       The value of which broken piece depends on his or her relative importance in the fiction, not on its material value based on the stuff of which it is made. Plus the workmanship. Charlemagne is worth a great deal because of who he is in this story. For instance, the real and the fictional worlds cut through each other here. Real money is being paid in restitution for damages, but the amount of the compensation is figured on fictional values. You understand what I mean? I mean a slave or a or a peasant or a servant would not. A figure in even if it's beautiful and big would not cost as much as that of the king. What's Advantis seems to be underlining here is the value of fictional characters as creations by their author. How much would I don't Quixote or essential be worth to Cervantes how much a hamlet to Shakespeare, how much would it take to compensate Garcia Marquez for Colonel Aureliano when Dhea or [inaudible] for a Pierre Menard, these are fictional entities, but now they have a real monetary value in a world in which literature is becoming a commodity without ceasing to be at the same time, one of the great expressions of the human spirit that this scene is reminiscent of the one in part one we're a torsion when restitutions are made to the barber who's based in, has been taken to the innkeeper for expenses and damages and marriage vows are exchange to make up for Fernando's this honest behavior toward the repair.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       It is a miniaturised scene of restitutions, a small scale repetition of that scene in part one to me, it is as if Savannah Savannah's we're boasting or how many ways you can rewrite rewrite episodes in part two and he is certainly a master puppeteer himself.
