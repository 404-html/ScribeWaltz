Speaker 1:          00:01          I, um, I want you to ponder over the next few days, uh, what is commemorated on October 7th, the next October 7th, which will be next Wednesday. Get bonus points for your midterm. If you, if you know it right off the top of your head already, you can, uh, you can tell me if not, think about it and, uh, you may come up with it. There's something very relevant to this, uh, course and, uh, I can see that my tas, the graduate students are also puzzled by it. Uh, you can, you can go home and Google it and, uh, and maybe it'll come up, but, uh, um, we'll talk about it on Tuesday, which would be the eve of the anniversary of you was okay. Um, we are going to talk today, uh, uh, mostly, but not exclusively about the novel of the curious impertinent as you can anticipate by the various triangles on, uh, on the board. Um, said Avantis was criticized in his time for the inclusion of this novel in part one of the key halting.

Speaker 1:          01:44          He answered, he answered his critics through. He's characters who speak about that criticism. Uh, chiefly a character, a character called Sung, Sung Carrasco whom you will meet, uh, when you begin reading part two very soon. And, uh, he also talks about it in the prologue to part two, and, uh, he said Advantis refrained from inserting any novels like this in part two. So, uh, he took the criticism to heart. Um, as I said in my last lecture, Cervantes was trying to combine the sequential kind of plot of that you Valerie romance one adventure after another, uh, with the collection of stories in the style of Boccaccio a book. Got Joe. I have him I think before, but uh, if not, uh,

Speaker 2:          03:08          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:09          But Capture Giovanni Boccaccio 13, 13, 13, 1375. If you're a literature major, you should know, uh, Boccaccio or to know at least about Boccaccio culture. He's, uh, his work, his famous work is called the camera on

Speaker 1:          03:39          now. Not that, that evaluate romances, uh, didn't have convoluted plots, but the insertion of a novel like this was not one of its features. It is known. That said, Avantis contemplated the publication of a collection of stories to be called Semanas. They'll haredim weeks at the garden and he did publish in 16, 13, the collection of stories that you have and from which you will read called the exemplary novels, no way less, uh, him Pladis this collection, as you will discover, does not have an overarching fiction involving character narrators leaving the city fleeing the plague and gathering to tell stories as in the, the camera on the overarching fiction into the camera on is that all of these young people leave the city because there is a plague they gather in a pleasant place and they each tell a story every day. And uh, that is the overarching fiction of the, the camera on the exemplaries novels of Cervantes did, does not have such an overarching fiction is just a collection of stories by Miguel.

Speaker 1:          05:03          Listen, run tests with a prologue and so forth, uh, weeks in the garden or [inaudible] does sound as it would have had that kind of applaud meaning overarching plot, meaning that characters would get together in a garden until, uh, stories. The point is that in, in, uh, India, Quixote part one, uh, Cervantes is attempting to mesh these two forms of narrative. As I said, uh, the result may seem awkward, uh, but it is mostly really very innovative and it leads to the creation of the modern novel with this very loose structure, which this kind of in Thurston is, uh, is possible. Now we saw how those commingling stories about Fernando [inaudible] and Lucinda, uh, hallow stories are correlated. And my colleague from the Department of Comparative Literature, David Quint calls it interlacing how the stories are interconnected. In a fairly recent book on Sarah on this. And I proposed that their structure, the overall structure, all of these stories with his cuts, faults and gaps was like a representation of human memory, human memory of bunk, which fiction depends and on which the very makeup of the creative self of the author is based memory.

Speaker 1:          06:54          As we will see, uh, today and in the next class, uh, the final resolution of the conflicts in those stories is a narrative to the force, the very devil boast of artistry on the part of Savantas. But the novel of the curious impertinent does stick out as being very different and apparently only tenuously related to the main plot and to the other stories from twitch differs. Why is the story inserted here in the whole day? You could say, is it, is it padding, it's Amanda's patting his novel or does it have something to do with the intercalated stories that we have been discussing and that are about to be resolved? First, let us go over how Cervantes does justify the inclusion of the novel. At the most elementary level.

Speaker 1:          08:04          The innkeeper one Palmetto reveals that he keeps a suitcase. Somebody left with some papers and that he owns a number of chief Valerie Romances. This is a second suitcase we find the first was kind of which the character's found rotted in the middle of the Seattle La Morena and it also contained writing contained gardenias manuscripts and poems and some shirts and most importantly for sanctuary. So money and discussion ensues involving the innkeeper, his wife and daughter and under priest about the value of those books that you Valerie Romances. This is a return to the scrutiny of the books episode earlier.

Speaker 3:          08:58          Hm.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Um, the scrutiny of the books, in fact, it's mentioned by the, uh, by the characters. The breeze wants to burn that you've all read romances. I see. Did we don Quixote's but the innkeeper, we'll have none of it. One Paloma, as he says, he's not mad. He's not insane. He knows that what those books relate happened a long time ago. Not In the present as don Quixote does. He knows that it is not applicable to the present in a day. In addition, he maintains the romances of jewelry, provide entertainment. When at harvest time the workers gather around at the end of the day and someone reads out loud from one of them. The tradition of reading out loud goes back to the middle ages and the convents and monasteries and a n and rituals of, of, of, of, of, of that, uh, uh, kind in an in such institutions.

Speaker 3:          10:01          MMM.

Speaker 1:          10:05          He says that it provides a soulless and on rest and relaxation. At the end of of of work, the ink keeper's wife and daughter, uh, for their part are fond of the, of the love scenes and they talk particularly the daughter about the love scenes that move her so much.

Speaker 3:          10:26          Uh,

Speaker 1:          10:28          one Palo Banca defense, the voracity of the chivalric romances saying that these books are published with the approval of the crowns councils have the stamp of the Crown Council. How could the crown allow books of lies to be published? Of course he has a very primitive notion about printed books and, and, and so forth. He is corrected by others, the priests mostly, but to no avail. He still sticks to his guns, but no books are birthed because books are not Bert.

Speaker 1:          11:10          They will be soon another scene with a character who is the Canon of Toledo. You will learn what the Canon of polio or what it can on is when we get to that part in which the romances of chivalry will again be discussed, uh, but at a theoretical level, uh, by, by very well educated and well read characters like the priests, the Kingdom of [inaudible] and Don Quixote and so forth. But here, Savannah seems to be emphasizing that the romances of chilvery do have a function in society. They Fernie's relaxation Buhler people. It is foolish to take Cervantes at his word when he says that he has written the Quixote to demolish and banish romances of jewelry. There are people who still take him at face value on that, but in fact, the Quixote as we go parodies is both a critique on an Amish, the romances of chivalry, and it is perhaps the last of the romances of chivalry.

Speaker 1:          12:24          So, uh, uh, oh, we must not take, I don't think so. Run this seriously when he says that he wrote the book simply to, to do away with the romances of children. Remember what I've, what I said before that by his time essentially the fashion, uh, uh, uh, of publishing them anyway, uh, had ended, but they continue to be read at least if we take the Quixote, uh, uh, evidence of, uh, of there being read by the common people. Now, then the innkeeper speaks about the papers in the suitcase and main choose the story, the novel of the curious impertinent, which he says had been approvingly red in it had also been read out loud

Speaker 3:          13:11          at the inn.

Speaker 1:          13:14          It is in manuscript form much literature including Cervantes, his own stories, uh, still circulated in manuscript even after the development of the printing press. A sprinting was complicated and expensive. So you must not assume that once printing became available, literature did not circulate in manuscript form anymore. It did. And, uh, some of, uh, uh, set of anthesis work, uh, segregated in that in such fashion. Some of the stories that were later included in the exemplary novels, a book had been circulating in, in this form. This is then another self referential moment in the 80s. To me clear. That's advantage. It is a himself who left that suitcase there with the, with the manuscript instead of anthis is again winking at the reader. And this is me who left this suitcase here.

Speaker 3:          14:27          Ah,

Speaker 1:          14:28          it is clear too that he has found a way to publish the story by inserting it here in the Quixote. Uh, that doesn't mean that it just padding the novel, uh, the long short story, the novella or move well in the manner of, uh, Boccaccio was a form with which Cervantes felt very comfortable as you will discover what you read the stories. And as you have already discovered in this integrated stories that he, this sort of long short story is a form that's Advantis a favorite.

Speaker 2:          15:04          Now

Speaker 1:          15:06          let us not miss the irony, which is easy to miss. We have to read carefully. Remember, read for details. That is the, the, the irony that it is the priest who reads out loud, the novel of the, uh, curious, impertinent, this perverse twist. The love story is told in the voice over representative of the church. This priest is a very, um, a complicated character as you were just covering. He invents Duvall with Romances, uh, and uh, he's uh, uh, uh, out in the fields such as using a don Quixote. And, uh, uh, it is, uh, do me a very ironic that you have the priest reading this, uh, uh, this story, Cervantes loaves, this, uh, ironic games. It is the priest who at the end those a critique of the story and asked permission to have it copied later Cervantes. This is engaging here in some, some, some self criticism but also in some self praise having one of his characters praise the story with some reservation, but the prisons it this breeze just as we have already learned this also literary critic I've rediscovered in the episode of the scrutiny of the books.

Speaker 2:          16:36          No,

Speaker 1:          16:37          the novel of the curious in pregnant is the most blatantly literary story contained in the whole day, the most artful and obviously derived from literary sources. The action is set in Florence and in a vaguely defined past. It is a time and place of fictions, not depressant, uh, uh, in which, uh, the Quixote takes place. It is drawn from a known Italian sources and written in the style of Walcott Geo whom you now know and Ben law bail bundle.

Speaker 1:          17:39          This course is under the ages of the literature major that is comparative literature. So you are getting quite a bit of Italian literature here, which is inevitable. Uh, Mateo been below 1485, 1561 who was one of the great short, short story writers already of the 16th Century, uh, uh, much red throughout Europe. And in fact, one of his stories inspired, uh, Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare as you know, was very fond of reading Italian literature. In fact, the novel of the curious impertinent, essentially drawn from audio stores. Orlando Furioso. I have mentioned Ariosto several times, but I will mention him again now.

Speaker 2:          18:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:39          His famous poem is Orlando for yours or [inaudible] 1474, 1533. And the Orlando of food, he also was published in 15, 16 then 15, 21 and 1532. It is a mock epic as I've mentioned before. Uh, uh, it's a mock epic poem that's Advantis much admired and, uh, as we should know by now. So we have here these three Italian authors, uh, that, uh, that Avantis, uh, was indebted to. Um, other, uh, more distant sources have been found. But Ariosto is the abuse one when very distant source, uh, of the story of a king who wanted to put his wife to the test and, and had somebody seduce her and so forth. The same story, but that is very remote. And, uh, uh, the most obvious source is a fragment from, uh, the Orlando Foodie. Also, I underscore again, a set of anthesis indebtedness to it through the two Italian Renaissance Literature, uh, as he was also two Italian renaissance art. As I mentioned in my, in my last lecture. Remember, you have been reading the case book and your introduction in Toronto. I spent a good deal of time in Italy, which had been of course the center of the, of the, of the renaissance.

Speaker 1:          20:18          Now, the novel of the curious impertinent has been variously interpreted, but the most apt analysis the most, uh, how could I say, um, a current or, uh, analysis, uh, the most accepted is the one by her ne Jeeva as you are now we have a French,

Speaker 2:          20:43          no.

Speaker 1:          20:50          Do you allow was a French professor who taught in the United States nearly all of his life. His most famous book was called in the original most songs romantic very day. It romanesco known in English as deceit, desire, and the novel, the original, the first publication was 1961. Your asshole theory revolves around the concept of triangular or mimetic desire. This desire is both external, what it applies to a novel and it's sources, the, the previous books that it imitates and internal when it applies to the protagonists, love relations. And in fact you are, will claim that all novels contained the current level. Knowles is this kind of memetic triangular desire and his book contains analysis of famous novels in the European tradition, like madame Bovary who shall in wild and so forth. I recommend, uh, his book. Now the story of I should run this. Then all of the curious impertinent is crucial to the development of Gerard's theory and indeed it made having spired.

Speaker 1:          22:13          His theory is that important. Gerard rights and this is, I know it's a little dense quotation translated from French into a little awkward English. I'll read it very slowly. Uh, so that you can follow it. He says the existence of the novel of the curious impertinent in the key Hartej cause always intrigued critics. The question arises whether the short story is compatible with the novel. The unity of the masterpiece seems somewhat compromised. It is this unity which I revealed by our journey through novelistic literature, his journey in the book through novelistic literature in which he shows her this triangular desire exists in all its not having begun with sort of Antici begins his book. We serantes we returned to Cervantes and ascertain that this novelists genius has grasped the extreme forms of imitated desire nor small distance separates this advantage of donkey, haughty and disadvantages of Ansel motions.

Speaker 1:          23:18          All the novels we have considered in this chapter as they show that the distance is not in Superbowl. Since all the novelists are linked to each other. The simultaneous presence of external and internal mediation in the same work seems to us to confirm the unity of novelistic literature and in turn, the unity of this literature confirms dot of [inaudible]. One is proved by the other, just as one proves that the earth is round by going around it. The creative force of Cervantes is so great that it has exerted effortlessly that he has been exerted effortlessly throughout the whole novelistic space. All the ideas of the western novel are precedent in German Don Quixote. I keep, I continue reading Gerard and the idea of these ideas, the idea who central role is constantly being confirmed. The basic idea from which one can rediscover everything is triangular desire. That's the end of the court. I am sure this sounds very strange and obscure to you. Uh, if you haven't heard about it before, but I tell you, once you understand it, you may glean something useful about your love life. I said that reading the Quixote would provide lessons for living. When I was a graduate student, this book was the rage and everyone was interpreting his or her love relationships in terms of triangular desire. Um, so you don't have to make any confessions at the end of the course, but you might, uh, uh, uh, if you want to tell me if this has helped you in any way, understand your life.

Speaker 2:          25:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:06          For Gerard, desire is never spontaneous. It's never a spontaneous one to one relationship, but mediated one desires a man or woman because he or she is desired by another. It is dark, presume desire by the mediator that makes her or him attractive. I say presume because then the mediators desire most yet have another, a mediator to exist as such. And then there will be a sort of an endless series of mediations, but we are focusing on one triangle at a time. Jealousy, in other words, is a requirement for desire for love. You can now think of all the novels you have reading with jealousy plays such an important role. Post full of jealous characters.

Speaker 2:          26:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:01          Hence imitation of the mediator, the one of whom one is jealous is of the essence because of the belief that she or he is loved by the object of our desire. If you followed done, this is the mimetic part of desire, which may lead to the, uh, to desire for the mediator in the guise of desire for the original object of desire. That is you love so much the mediator that you wind up loving the mediator, not loving the person that you began. You thought you began to love it. You will see some of that in the novel, the curious impertinent

Speaker 1:          26:45          in the context of the novel of the cooters. In pertinent, it works like this. We begin here. Um, you have, uh, your, uh, uh, your handout for easy reference. Uh, Anselmo cannot love really Kamila until he gets low Tario to love her. This is the gist of this man's twist desire that, uh, and, and, and why he must put her to the test. So, and sell more loves Camilla, but once, but loteria is inserted as the mediator. Then eventually when Notario loves Camilla, uh, he does. So in second triangle because she has loved Anselmo before. So we have these two triangles, uh, now this story may will reveal a hidden sub story of the kind. Uh, we, uh, have been finding when characters tell stories and the story may very well be and it has been, uh, um, uh, proposed a homosexual love between the two friends using Camila as the mediator, the certain, the third triangle and sell more, uh, really loves little patio, uh, using Camilla ask the mediator.

Speaker 1:          28:19          And last way, Gomez way w e y Nicole, last way, Gomes has written a very rare swift persuasive article, not only about that relationship between the two, but also showing that Ansel, most illnesses, uh, both physical or psychosomatic, uh, are feminine in the Medicine of the time, uh, to underscore the nature of the relationship between these two. So I hope that you're understanding all of this and uh, I hope it's not ruining your love life, uh, uh, and uh, uh, or your life in general by realizing how complicated love can be. Now, this structure sheds light on the intertwined stories that we have been discussing. And this is why I have, uh, these, uh, other triangles here on the, on the board, on, on your handout. Uh, uh, whereas, uh, where we have that, uh, this Fernando, uh, Gardenia Lucinda Triangle in which Fernando loves Lucinda really because she is Cardenas a girl, uh, or it's going to be his, his girl eventually, and I suggested this in another class. There is also, uh, there are, there are intimations of a homoerotic relationship here between Fernando on Cardinia. Now for the non goal when it comes to the [inaudible], Fernando loses interest in Doterra once he has processed her because there is no mediation. But he marries her once. She appears at the end defended by Carl venue. So once got a Daniel appears, I said potential, uh, uh, mediator, uh, Fernando, uh, goes ahead and Mary's the pair.

Speaker 1:          30:30          Now a donkey halters mediations, other romances of chivalry and his heroes, particularly the [inaudible], the governor whom he imitates. I see. You also imitates Orlando, the Orlando also the object of his love to see. Now I said projection of the loves of those famous lovers. Oriana in the case of where Mardis Angelica and the case of Orlando, which is why he desires her and in the way inventor from their own constructions of her. And uh, we will see her transformation, uh, as the novel progresses, which are a remarkable, especially in part two. Now, the novel of the curious impertinent is that holds up a mirror, the mirror of literature to the young people involved in love stories that are about to culminate in marriage. It provides a contrast to the comedy like ending of the stories of Fernando, Little Gardenia and Lucinda. The novel of the curious in pertinent is not so much an admonition though it is that to us a lesson about the complexities of love and how no permanent stability can be achieved, particularly not by marriage.

Speaker 1:          31:54          It is also a wink at the reader. I think a wake up call, I mean, can anyone, you will see one who does soon, but can anyone really believe in the sincerity and the sincerity of the permanence of don't Fernando's conversion? Is it likely that Fernando will be a faithful husband? What about Lucinda? She was tempted ones by money and status and could be again, literature teachers through pleasure, a very harsh lesson. Ultimately the novel of the curious impertinent is about, in my view, the death instinct, concealed within desire co evil with it, with love. It is what Freud called the death drive. There is no stability where there is desire that their affection of a social erotic situation of Anselmo, Camilla and Lotoja. We Send me Raj and an invitation to tragedy. This is an even harsher lesson about the human condition. What the priest says at the end is that he finds that the story well written but he cannot believe, uh, that the author has not, uh, has not shown a real situation because her husband would never do that. Uh, that maybe young people, uh, in love before marriage, um, uh, ward but not husband. What he's saying they are is something that is a given in old golden age, Spanish literature and they're given is that everything that happens before marriage is the stuff of comedy and everything that happens after marriage is to stuff of tragedy.

Speaker 1:          33:48          This is not a lesson to be taken too seriously, but it's something to be a pondered. Um, and I think that this is what the priest notices. He notices that, that this, this to him would not be possible for a, uh, uh, a husband to, to, to do this, uh, subject his wife to this sort of, of tests. But then if it were among people not married yet, it may in May we made me, of course a marriage is usually the ending of a comedy. Comedy's tend to end in marriage because marriage is a return to stability. And in, in, in theater, uh, comedy is a return to an order that has been upset where our strategy does not return, uh, to order. So this is what the literary side of that, uh, would be whether it is applicable or not to life. It is for everyone, each one of us to, uh, to discover. So now we move to the ending of all of these stories are the, uh, [inaudible]. Fernando accepts Dorothea after everyone pleads with him and a good deal of services about the concept of [inaudible] from [inaudible]. She pleads her case, uh, with us. March verbus Marcella did in an earlier episode and with a very, um, thorough knowledge of Castilian, uh, law.

Speaker 3:          35:39          MMM.

Speaker 1:          35:44          You see, she is lacking either via Dorothea nobility, but it Albia is passed on through the male line, not the female line. As we've mentioned here before, this is what she underscores in her own defense. Uh, [inaudible] house. He's Lucinda who has the either but not the wealth Dorothea has. Um, so there is, I mentioned in the earlier crass sort of crisscrossing here, a mirror image of the, of the two women, uh, that is, uh, has no, uh, nobility but has money and Lucinda has very little money, but she has a nobility and so forth. Lucinda, by the way, in the midst of all this had been kidnapped from a convent. Uh, I'm brought to the in, in what, in what turns out to be a side story, not told in detail. These stories could be, could be extended. I didn't feed item if you pursued every one of them, but remember seen the, uh, had been kidnapped and she's, she's brought back for this, uh, ending.

Speaker 1:          36:52          Have you heard of red or whom I mentioned in the last class, and I mentioned him here again with the respect and uh, sometimes we'll disagree with good old Javier who is very, was retired now, very competent critic. Uh, and uh, also I should say a very catholic Craig as you will read, as you would understand from what I read here, that's, there's no sin in that. Uh, have you had eto interprets in this way? The Battle of the Wineskins, uh, that leads to the resolution of the conflict. He also has a kind of symbolic sexual symbolic interpretation of the whole thing, but it's good to hear it, uh, to, uh, to, uh, corrected a little bit, but learn from it. He says the meaning of the battle against the wineskins is now clear. He has been exposed. You're leading. Don Quixote is in a state of the nation since he's really possessed by an intense dream and acting with closed eyes.

Speaker 1:          38:01          Thanks to super impose wineskins which he saw in his room when he went to bed to be the giant panda Filando and to behead him, he cuts the head around and pierces the body. The wine flow floods the room on fills the end with smell. Don Quixote has destroyed an erect penis. This is what good. All right. Um, has filled in with the smell of wine. Donkey hot the has certainly cut down the power of lost. I'm still putting this blood transform into wine. Most certainly be taken as a sacramental symbol, a symbol of the mysterious power of the night against the anaerobes, pestilence, metaphorically. The courage and courtesy of Don Quixote have a vanquish. The arrogance, cruelty, and lost of Don Fernando. It is true of donkey halter is wrong. That is, adventures have created havoc and morally, his motivation is mixed, but it is also an undeniable that he's courageous, truthful, and chased.

Speaker 1:          38:58          His foolishness brings him blows and ridicule, but his greatness makes him a worth. The instrument of providence and rental goes on. We see clearly that the spiritual move movement has been completed by don't. Fernando's descend from lost and pride to a Christian humility and fraternity, but which he races his victims to the level of his affection and now reunited in love. A common embraces possible. The giant is dead and the true man, the Christian gentleman has replaced him, but which powers have brought about the conversion has, has it been the beauty that tears the truths of Dorothea the priests or situation? They certainly all have a part in it, but the texts leaves no doubt that all these elements together, together we're talking [inaudible] have been the instruments of providence with a capital p while men and women, he goes on, I'd been acting through the impulse of their passions, which brought them to the labyrinth of the Sierra Morina.

Speaker 1:          40:04          Not a reference has been made by say wanted to Savantas to heavens will, but as soon as Cardenio meets Doterra and installed at Don, Fernando did not take Lucy [inaudible] with him. He expresses hope that heaven has decreed their salvation from that moment on their destinies began to escape from the darkness and confusion of the elaborate at the end, the locals of social reunion. And consequently of the transition from wildness to civilization. Lucinda having been released by Don Fernando in the scene, justice gripe exclaims his clothing, Lucinda observe how heaven by unusual and to us hidden ways has brought me into the presence of my true husband and well, you know, buy a thousand Dearborn experiences that death alone. Can you face him out of my memory goes on immediately. And in the long scene of reconciliation, all the participants claim that they're meeting in the end is not accidental, but on the contrary, the work of provenance, of course, the question to be considered is the conflicts would have been solved without the intervention of Gnocchi.

Speaker 1:          41:11          Chaotic. Uh, which I will speak about in a minute. I think that, uh, that he was the agent of course. Uh, in any case, a little winds up his article, uh, which ultimately deals with the whole issue of marriage, which is so important and they can halt. And so important in the 16th century and about whom, uh, the likes of Erasmus on Bvs wrote as he quotes them. And, and the Council of Trent, which is taking place as you know, from reading, uh, earlier, uh, discussed that. We will talk about this again in part when we talk about part two about marriages and all of that because he hasn't said marriages are the core of social stability and social, uh, on transitions in, in, in, in, in, in, in society. The way that society, uh, renews itself. So it's, it's, it's crucial. So this is what a retro rights and it's important because he is bringing in first the, the neoplatonic notion of notions of love derived from the courtly love tradition that I think I've spoken about, uh, against a sort of a movement in Spanish society and in 16th Century Society and philosophy in general to two or more bourgeois, uh, sense of marriage.

Speaker 1:          42:27          Uh, uh, you remember, I think I've spoken about the Courtney love tradition according to of tradition, which is one of the great, uh, uh, uh, uh, can I say, uh, uh, spiritual revolutions in the West is the, the idea that the woman, uh, had to be adored at a distance. The law love could not be consummated. It usually the love [inaudible] a woman who was unattainable, preferably married and, uh, the lower paid homage to the woman and so forth. Uh, we still hear the echoes of the, of the, of the courtroom off tradition in modern poetry, in Ooda, on Octavio Paz and the great modern, uh, points. Uh, Doki hotter is a courtly lover in that sense, an agent, uh, out of fashion, a Courtney lover. But that's, that is what inspires a, his love for Lucy. Now, neoplatonism of course, was at the core of these, uh, uh, uh, uh, Courtney love traditionalist.

Speaker 1:          43:33          Okay. So [inaudible] says the following. Now that I think I have placed this in the in its ideological context against a sentimental and neoplatonic tradition which made a woman a goddess, Cervantes takes the side of the conjugal love presented by Erasmus and Vvs Erasmus of Rotterdam. I will speak more about him following classes. It was a very important 16th century humanist and so what's Bibi's which allows my not only do enjoy the legitimate pleasure of the sexual union, but to help each other to fight against the inevitable weakness and imperfection of the human condition. By emphasizing the social civilizing aspects of marriage, Cervantes was closer to the new doctrines of reform then to the renaissance ideals of love. Indeed with he said he's thinking of patriarch, got to see last two on the ports that I have mentioned before. Indeed with his attacks on the pastoral and by the story of El Kudos in pertinent to the curio.

Speaker 1:          44:39          Then all of curation pertinent Cervantes is precisely marking his distance from the Gregory Socratic tradition of the renaissance and joining the new to a great extent, Bourgeois Christianity, which descended to the south of Europe from the low countries in opposition to [inaudible] marine billionaires. These are the that you heroes so that you've all read romances. The Nouveau, you are a lover. It's not a knife, but a Christian gentlemen, such love as we have seen has two elements. It is Christian and the activity of providence and the priest show the role that God and his church play in, in its growth, but it's also jumped in mentally. Both got Denny on. Don't Fernando become through love, not only Christians, but Christian gentlemen. Core three love brings the night to madness, but Christian Love saves him. Such a rescue is metaphorically expressed in our story by the great classical myth of the labyrinth lost in the wilderness of this, yet at the Morena, their lives twisted into the integrate mace of the librarians on the brink of being devoured by the mentor of lost the madness.

Speaker 1:          45:44          Cardinia, Lucinda Rotarian Fernando are finally rescued by don't keyholders courageous battle and bear the civilizing force of an Erasmian church. Divine providence in fact, has provided us a Rodney the saving. So that that's the end of her, of the court, which I hope now you can understand given the background that I gave you about all of these sounds fine. And it is instructive, particularly the references to harass me most and to beers, uh, until we take into account the hilarious convolutions and the mixture of madness, dreams and lies that bring about the resolution of the conflict. The conflict has been solved by don't get hold this intervention. Uh, but how can such a ridiculous figure and be the instrument of providence with a capital p? They have been solved by donkey health, this agency because they are truly worldly conflicts involving tensions of a world in social flux where the older values to say the values of the, uh, of the, of the, uh, the renaissance, the values of quarterly love, uh, no longer hold sway, don't get halted and bodies the mixture of values in transition so he can mediate in the various conflicts and solve them.

Speaker 1:          46:59          He would not have been able to do so if we had been a real night, nor had he been an ordinary man of his time. But to say this, it's not to do justice to the multilayer plots on raveling in these episodes. I am mostly struck by sort of anthis inventiveness by the wild. You're disciplined imagination at play, which cannot I think be reduced to this a providential a scheme that, that, that have you had, uh, offers don't, Fernando is the one level [inaudible] the giant, remember the rhyme, fair to Nando, bong, Daffy Langdon, the figure of fun. Now, Philando though invented at Hawk by the priest is presented as an effective factor in the outcome of the conflicts are denied the Weiss and Princess [inaudible] Macona although not real and grotesque don't real in relation to the fiction of the normal. This whole ensemble exists and performs on a level not unlike that of the characters who invented them or who invented this whole ensemble ensemble.

Speaker 1:          48:18          There story of Panda Filando is like a dream version, a recognizable distortion of Doterra's real conflict. If you remember when we went over it, the story of the story of Panda Filando is like a dream version. Uh, uh, I, I repeat, uh, off of total territorial conflict. Remember again, the hidden meaning of Mikko Macona over which I will go again if her name that is an illusion to mimicry to representation. To me, Macy's do the very process by which she was invented. Those Mikami Kona not in a way represent representation itself. I mean she is the representation itself taking place before our eyes are all these inventions of characters by other characters similar to Cervantes invention of his own characters in the hotel. And this is what this whole thing is telling us. This is what is truly Dennis sling, about the resolution of all these conflicts that they do unravel at every level.

Speaker 1:          49:20          Sort of simultaneously that is to say, and this is, uh, the, uh, what you have on the back of your triangles. And I have here on the, on the, on, on the board, uh, the all these levels, the donkey holders dream, which is ducky holdup on the Philando. And we can we go now, he caught the, the head off of the giant. He thinks in the dream they met a fictional creation by the priest. That story the priest invents and Amico Macona then, uh, performs, uh, meaning Dorothea Doki, Hotifa, Philando becoming, going up in actually all these characters in that, in that novel that the priest and, and, and Dorothea invent. And then there is the fiction of the novel, which is Donkey Horton on Fernando, a little terror and so forth. All of those levels sort of collapse together and are, the conflicts are resolved by Don Quixote, uh, slaying the slang, the, the giant that is occurring, uh, bursting poor.

Speaker 1:          50:20          One Paloma is wine skins to his horror. Um, it is a stroke of genius that the process of restitution will be motivated by Don Quixote's nightmare, which comes to interrupt the reading of the novel of the curious in pregnant or the point incidentally near the end, which is when it's about to unravel. When that Novelis about doing robbed, another case of these interruptions in the dream don't be healthy. Completes the story of Princess Mikami Corner. That is Doterra's predicament translated into the language of chivalry. Like Don Quixote psychotic delusion. Remember about, uh, uh, uh, about, uh, uh, queen Massima having had an affair with this surgeon, uh, which was, uh, his version of Lucinda in the flower by the Fernando. Um, now these version of the testing Burgerville true to the name, she assumes it's a grotesque parody of her story. I go back to what you said.

Speaker 1:          51:20          Remember that Mikko Means Monkey Mikami colonize the twice monkey with an argumentative like that. Remember the [inaudible] that I mentioned, Segundo Second Dome from second. Second Dong is a big second, uh, grand too. Delong in Spanish, uh, low marks for alarm marks and so forth. Mikko me come is, it is an augmented if involved there McCormick. Uh, remember monkey see monkey do and all of that. It's in the back. She said big blown up. Distorted copy of [inaudible]. This is what Mikko. Mikko Nice. The ending of [inaudible] story in that register is what breaks off the reading. As I mentioned of the novel of the curious. In pertinent, that story will be resumed and comes to it's very tragic ending. While those of Cardenio Leucine, that latte under Fernando, we'll have it purely comic one happy endings, as I mentioned with marriages are typical of the, of comedy. This is yet another intersection of the two stories here with the accent on section and crossing on cutting.

Speaker 1:          52:28          The ending of the novel of the curious in pertinent reveals his artificial literary quality when the reading is concluded. And as I've mentioned that the, the, the priest, uh, uh, uh, uh, remarks, uh, uh, as I said that it doesn't sound, it doesn't sound right for a husband to have done some that it's not good me, Macy's. Uh, and then there follow the court like scene of reconciliations, uh, uh, between the various, among the various, uh, couples and restitutions made including restitution to the barber who's based in, was uh, uh, you, you haven't gotten there, but you will see that there is this their steers of restitutions to all the characters who have been injured or damaged in some, uh, or harmed in some, in some way. Uh, the, the, the in becomes like a court of law where these institutions are, uh, are made now, uh, I want to quote, have yet in a positive light.

Speaker 1:          53:32          Now, uh, and, uh, he, he's, he's right in the sense that the values are church changing and there is sort of an emerging bourgeois sense. It is true. He says that neoplatonism associated with the tradition of course we love was still the accepted poetic and artistic Vigo four h four aristocratic sentiment. But through the influence of Christian humanism and as an expression of the strength of the new use, the bureau can patients with secular life and above all marriage replaced the stylized conventions of chivalry and the austere ideals of monasticism. This, this may be true, particularly if we take into account all of the economic and legal background that I have given you about the relationship between these characters. The, the fact that Fernando is, they say, well, I'm Dong a and a, and it's not going to inherit a much of a, of the state, which makes him very anxious.

Speaker 1:          54:28          Uh, uh, the fact that [inaudible] runs the farm and, and, and has money and all of that. Uh, it does give the impression that, that there is a kind of bourgeois sense of, of marriage and stability that is replacing the old ideals of the neoplatonic, uh, idea of, uh, contained in this aristocratic versions of love in the poetic traditions. The idea, uh, also seems to be that, uh, to cure the characters in the real world, uh, of the fiction where they live, they also have to be cured in their dreams and inventions. Uh, which is one of the overall plot strands now being resolved in the karate. He's the only one missing here. I mean, everyone is going to be sort of cured of his or her dreams, hallucinations. Uh, uh, uh, and so forth. Uh, but don Quixote still has not, but they have to be cured of those hallucinations as well as, uh, uh, their situation has to, has to be stabilized in social terms.

Speaker 1:          55:39          The priest, uh, the barber and the rest of the characters engaged don Quixote at his level of madness in part because they are also mad in their own ways. You have to realize, uh, this, uh, what are the priests and the Barbara doing traipsing all over Spain after the night? Uh, remember what I said before about the priest is a very strange priest who's a reader of romances of chivalry. Uh, what has become of the priest duties at the church or the barbarous customers? Uh, we, we ask they to have left normal lives as sanctuary has. He left his wife and children to engage in an insane quest after an insane man. The point is that mental life is made up of levels that mirror and his toward each other, and the literature appears to emerge from this interplay. The creative mind of the author is capable of reflecting or expressing the multilayered essence of that mental life after the captive, stale about which we'll be talking in the next, uh, class. Fascinating, very entertaining. Coptic style based on said Rhonda for his own life. The priests and the barber and the others will send Don Quixote home. They will cage him and sent him home and a return that will still engage them in further, uh, adventures. Uh, the end of part one is near and we will get to it next week.
