1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,410
What is the significance of the
real date on Sanchez letter?

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,570
One wonders,
uh,

3
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:12,450
I don't have a ready answer for it,

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:17,280
but remember that it does have the
real date. It is obviously the date.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,380
Once advantage is writing
this part of the [inaudible],

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,090
it may be a way of emphasizing, uh, the,

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,630
the novel is dealing with current,
uh,

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,660
history and situating the novel
chronologically in a specific way.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,480
Uh, this is why, uh, the
letter a is given a date.

10
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:46,050
It didn't have to have a date,
but I think that that is the reason why,

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,290
uh, I think, I think that's the best
answer that I can give to the, uh,

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,050
to the question of why that letter,
what the significance,

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,310
what that date on the letter and
what the significance of of it is.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,380
Uh, but this is the sort of detail
that I want you to look for.

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,180
Remember, uh, my mantra
details, details, details,

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,480
literature is made of specific concrete
details nor have obstructions like

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,074
philosophy.

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,230
And this is why it is
important to remember to notice
details and to base your

19
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,590
interpretations on the details.

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,520
Now as we move closer to
the end of the Quixote,

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,350
I would like to make some general comments
and revisit some of the themes that I

22
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:43,671
have touched upon earlier as a way of
summing up our reading of this great

23
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,290
classic that we have been,
uh, uh, reading all semester.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,760
In the last lecture I talked about the
increasing presence of Virgil and have is

25
00:01:56,131 --> 00:02:00,540
an need and suggested that Cervantes
is hinting of the significant

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,470
responsibility that his
protagonist is assuming,

27
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,250
which is quite different from
that of the ancient hero,

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,350
but no less important
to conquer himself,

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,380
to come to grips and control his
madness and to assimilate the,

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,170
uh,

31
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,170
his new one realization of the vanity
of his dreams and the futility of his

32
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,574
quest.

33
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,110
His task is to bring himself to harmony
with the world in which he lives full of

34
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:40,041
imperfections and disappointments and
to assure and to assume a resigned

35
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,940
attitude towards it and prepare
for his impending death.

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,810
If at the beginning of the semester,
I caught it, Luke Arch George Lucas,

37
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:56,730
actually Hungarian critic to the effect
that the Quixote was the epic of a world

38
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,960
abandoned by God.

39
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,950
Don't be this epic task within the novel
is to cope with such a world to conquer

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,310
such a world. I said, wow,

41
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,870
his is a very modern
condition in that sense,

42
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:17,530
but not necessarily a despairing one.

43
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,331
This,

44
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:24,331
I think is what the novel shows as
the hero begins his return home.

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,290
And this is why I'm asking
you to try to finish it. Uh,

46
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,200
don't get hopeless. Change is
gradual. And it began with I think,

47
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,340
DCNS enchantment by Sanshou,

48
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,720
the shock of, uh, see, uh, these,

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,100
uh, peasant woman, uh, as routine now.

50
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,850
And it peaked I think during the,
the,

51
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,310
the dissent to the cave
of Montesinos us. We, uh,

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,420
as we mentioned, uh, I think that he will,

53
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,450
he will display or he is displaying
now a deepened kind of wisdom,

54
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,540
nowhere more memorably
than in the council.

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,710
He gives sanctuary and his,
uh,

56
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,060
as his squire is prepared to take
over the government of the island of

57
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:22,714
Barataria.

58
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
You remember that episode when Gnocchi
halted takes central aside and after

59
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:34,450
telling him not to gloat,
uh, about his great fortune,

60
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:38,830
but to thank God that this happened
to him without his really even,

61
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,820
even trying
evincing a somewhat,

62
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,340
a little bit of a Mb, uh,
we're all don Quixote here.

63
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,790
He takes him aside to give
him some, uh, some council.

64
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,253
Um,

65
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,140
this passage of the Kihatha is one
of the more anthologized once in the,

66
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,170
uh,
Spanish speaking world.

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,040
I know I'm a judge in Puerto Rico who
has these pages framed in gold in his

68
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,100
office and he shows him,

69
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,100
shows him proudly to anyone
who happens to be near, uh,

70
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,230
uh, they are wonderful, uh, uh, uh,

71
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,460
this wonderful advice that not be
haughty. It gives sanctuary, uh,

72
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,290
and,
uh,

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
there are obvious philosophical and
literary sources and don't be hopeless

74
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,890
wisdom. Um, and, uh,

75
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,563
uh,

76
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,840
there are also obvious critical
statements that referred to the current

77
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,160
situation in Spain and Pyre,

78
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,310
particularly the council regarding the
corruption of people in power and in

79
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:01,700
government. These are Barb's or
the situation, uh, the, at the,

80
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,170
at the, uh, Spanish in a bureaucracy.

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,273
Uh,

82
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,490
okay.

83
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,900
Donkey hottest, uh, advice, uh,

84
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,140
how bookish sources,
uh,

85
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,190
but they also sound deeply felt and
also as if they were a grounded in a

86
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,000
experience. This is the,
the, the knowledge of, uh,

87
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,420
a mature man and look,
the whole day is more than a mature man.

88
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:37,590
He's an old man by the
standards of the age. So, uh,

89
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,130
he is an imposition to
counsel Sandra who's younger.

90
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,630
And of course, uh, his squire,

91
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,203
uh,

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,260
the counterparts to Don Quixote's
wisdom are Sanchez proverbs,

93
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,293
uh,

94
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,360
which expressive folks who kind of
cuteness and knowledge of humankind.

95
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,863
Uh,

96
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,480
and that's what we have seen in
Saint Joe can spew proverbs, uh,

97
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:13,000
of the drop of a hat.
Proverbs,

98
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,120
proverbs have been taken to be the
accumulated wisdom of the ages,

99
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,600
stored in the common memory of mankind
and were of great interest to renaissance

100
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,520
thinkers,
uh,

101
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,030
renaissance thinkers who were keenly,
uh,

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,800
attracted by language and the
knowledge that it contained,

103
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,410
uh, on, uh, both, uh,

104
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,440
both as a system of communications that
is language has grammar and also for the

105
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,250
contents of,
uh,

106
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,000
the lore that it's stored
not only Latin and Greek,

107
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,790
the classics as the human is
we're interested in, of course,

108
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,870
as we know in the classics and
in Latin and Greek and Hebrew.

109
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,270
But, uh, also in, in the
vernacular languages that were, uh,

110
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,420
in which they were immersed.
They were very, very interested
in that. And in fact,

111
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,920
uh, there is a whole science
of the study of proverbs, uh,

112
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,420
whose name
is in Spanish.

113
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't know if the
word exists in English,

114
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,500
but a mural here.
They study of proverbs.

115
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,050
Uh, there seem to be many more
in Spanish than in English.

116
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,790
Anyway. Uh, I, I feel that way,

117
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,910
but probably because Spanish
is my native language.

118
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,790
But I remember a summer nights at the,
uh,

119
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,760
squaring Salamanca Beautiful Town
Square in Salamanca sitting around with

120
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:49,260
professors of language and see
who could say more proverbs.

121
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,220
And then also we invented the game
that one would say the first part of a

122
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:58,020
proverb and another would the second part
of another one that had nothing to do

123
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:02,770
with it. So it was a, it
was a really, uh, great, uh,

124
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,300
game of proverbs. Um, try it.

125
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,270
It's fun. So, uh, what I'm saying is
that provers are very much a part of the,

126
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,560
of their language and they are a kind of
a store house of wisdom and this is the

127
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,940
counterpart of donkey is more bookish,
uh,

128
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,530
uh, kind of, of knowledge. The
interest in grammar of course was that,

129
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,580
that,
uh,

130
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,580
it was thought that grammar and rec and
rhetoric could reveal the very workings

131
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:37,110
of the human mind. And this is where
human is. We're interested in it.

132
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,203
Um,

133
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,540
so now in the end sanctuaries,

134
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,550
wisdom is not going to be different from
that of Don Quixote and it is certainly

135
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:57,651
not inferior and in practice
proves to be quite effective.

136
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,740
Of course, Don Quixote's, uh,
advice extends to Sanchez, uh,

137
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,601
appearance,

138
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:08,601
more of dress to clip his
fingernails and to what,

139
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,980
what,
where on different occasions,

140
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,200
how to have his wife behave so that you
won't show that she's just depressant

141
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,190
and all of that. That is the
funny part of the, of the advice.

142
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,050
But Saint Joe's knowledge,
Santos wisdom is up to the, uh,

143
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,900
to the task.
Um,

144
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Sanchez acumen is sufficient for him to
deal with the challenges of government

145
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,080
as it is for him to face the
challenges of his own life.

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,840
Sanctuary is endowed with natural reason.

147
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,190
This is a medieval concept that I have
mentioned before that courses through the

148
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:54,471
renaissance and reaches the enlightenment
where it will be instrumental in the

149
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:59,310
elaboration of modern
ideas about democracy.

150
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,100
Ideas that we all share, uh, today. Uh,

151
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,960
it is ultimately,

152
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,700
as I have said several times a common
Christian doctrine that we are all endowed

153
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:14,620
by God with enough intelligence,
uh,

154
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,220
to make it in the world no matter
what our station in life or level of

155
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,870
education. But at the end of
the episode on successful,

156
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:28,080
through no fault of his
own sanctuary ruse that he,

157
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,510
that he was not born to be a governor.

158
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:33,720
He says he accepts the social order,

159
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,810
which was based in spite of what I've
just said about natural reason was based

160
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,090
strictly on the ideology that a personal
social station was determined by God

161
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,490
and that it was best or central says
to stick to what you are and who the

162
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,340
conditioning to which you were
born. Uh, this is, uh, uh,

163
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,210
a conflictive a moment in
the, in, in, in the novel.

164
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,463
Uh,

165
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,960
but the fact is that he has done very
well as governor and only the deceptions

166
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,890
of the Duke and his minions rob
him of his real achievements,

167
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,390
real achievements in this fictional
world and what she accomplished them.

168
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,470
We both remember now, uh,
in connection to this,

169
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,740
remember our box theory about the birth
of realism on the Sediment Millie's that

170
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:30,100
is the, the common, uh,
discourse, uh, of Christianity.

171
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,810
So it can see that all of this
is, uh, is, is, is, is connected.

172
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,180
Uh,
but the contradiction of course,

173
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,780
he said within the society
which society that is crumbling.

174
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:45,760
As I have been saying, uh, this
distinctions is social distinctions are,

175
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,430
are important. They're
crumbling. Because look,

176
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:51,880
the most clever fellow in
this whole episode is the,

177
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,970
is this toward who after all is
a servant and sanctuary dose?

178
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,670
Uh, very well as a governor,
I said, governor, so, uh,

179
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,390
this is the overall theme of today's
class has to be that, that this, uh,

180
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,140
the social structures, uh, are crumbling

181
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,220
now. Uh, the, so we moved
to the island of Barataria.

182
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,430
Let us begin with, uh,
by talking about the name

183
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,200
in the, uh, in the original sanctuary.

184
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:32,630
First to the island
in Sula.

185
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,480
Let me put it with this first
more so you can see the accident.

186
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,430
Okay.

187
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,510
W and lowercase in Sula.
Now, of course, by this time,

188
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,520
the word for Ireland in Spanish was
already the current word, which is

189
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,580
from the Latin and the Latin. When
you had, uh, two consonants like that,

190
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,230
the tendency in the romance languages was
for the second one to absorb the first

191
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:06,100
one. So the therefore from insulin you
get east La, and in French you get Ila.

192
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,560
Now that's a little bit of philology.
Uh,

193
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,230
so Sangio repeats in Sula, uh, oh,

194
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,260
nowhere that it is an a
cake word than for island.

195
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,160
That donkey day uses
because he has learned it.

196
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,270
Reading the Romances of Chivalrous,

197
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,330
something that you lose completely in
the translation is the fact that donkey

198
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:40,404
hot day,

199
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,800
whenever the issue of
chivalrous arises or of Deucey,

200
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,330
Neha lapses into a kind
of our cake Spanish.

201
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,750
This is not,
this is not done in the translation.

202
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,780
Meaning he will say,
uh,

203
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,153
oh,

204
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,590
for instance,
fairly Moza for Eric Moser.

205
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,233
Yes.

206
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,420
Which is the,
uh,

207
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,500
west by then already the current
Spanish word for beautiful

208
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,380
it a Mossad. Did you want a little
more energy comes from the Latin,

209
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,880
from Pharma for Masa shapely.
Totally.

210
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:34,790
How the island of Formosa,
uh,

211
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,000
technology is fascinating.
Uh, so we're never know.

212
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:42,880
Quixote talks about you Roderick things.
He,

213
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:43,510
uh,

214
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,510
he uses far bladder for a bladder
because by the 16th century,

215
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,300
the f the Latin, uh, had
become a h and a silent h.

216
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,960
Um,
so

217
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,400
Sandra uses in Sula,
uh,

218
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,620
as the one he wants to rule an insular
island and he's using this archaic word.

219
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,620
So in Sula Barataria because
of this usage in the Quixote,

220
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,740
the word insula has a
currency in Spanish nowadays,

221
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:25,450
even if famous journal in Madrid,
a Insula,

222
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,130
uh, after, uh, this archaic word
uses we use by Don Quixote on Santo.

223
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,430
No
Barataria

224
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,890
I can never find the Harris
but artadia comes from Barato

225
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,420
but alto
means cheap.

226
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,790
So this will be cheap island.

227
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,820
She piled on cheap island both
because of its low cost and he's,

228
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,420
and it's shoddy, fragile,
fragile construction.

229
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,440
It is like a stage set to perform the
play that the Stuart has prepared.

230
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,130
It is cheap. Then also in the
sense that the island is not real.

231
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,830
I think that a better translation if we
were going to translate everything will

232
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:31,850
be something like Chins. The island
would be the name of it. Of course,

233
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:36,851
Sandra has Sanjaya does not pierce through
the name to realize that this is not

234
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:40,940
a very uh, uh, promising name for his,

235
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,620
for his kingdom to have to be ruling
cheap island. He doesn't know exactly.

236
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,610
He doesn't know at all what,
what means, but that's it.
This is what, what it means.

237
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,720
But our body

238
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,440
now let us begin by pointing out the
sources of the Stuarts invention.

239
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,680
The practice of making someone king
for the day was common in carnival

240
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:13,681
celebrations throughout Europe since
the Middle Ages and further back to

241
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,790
[inaudible].
Uh,

242
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,680
the joke that he's,

243
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:24,681
the humor was in seeing how a low class
dolt would act out his role as a king

244
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,190
or to have someone play the role of,
uh,

245
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,750
someone from the lower classes
trying to act like a king.

246
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,200
They could also be just a skit.

247
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,530
But part of the carnival practice,
uh,

248
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,600
was to make somebody a king for the day.
Uh,

249
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,430
this involved in this [inaudible] and
this kind of carnivals and inversion of

250
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:55,200
roles. We have echoes
of that, uh, in, uh, in,

251
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,520
in today's secret societies here in,
uh,

252
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,840
fraternities when they have
that day where, where the, the,

253
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,690
the pledges are in charge of the brothers.

254
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,350
All of those things that I'm sure you
have heard about our atavistic retention.

255
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,760
So this carnival type, uh, uh,

256
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,450
of ritual where you make
someone a king for a day.

257
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:21,150
In fact,
in the 1950s,

258
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,550
there was a TV show
called Queen for a day.

259
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,300
I don't know if you've ever heard of it,
uh,

260
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,990
in which a common housewife was
crowned queen for the day in the show.

261
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:37,140
And she got to to rule over people.

262
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,640
And two a and two have anything
she wanted and and, and so forth.

263
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,380
Um, yeah, television incorporated,
some of this, um, carnivalesque,

264
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,510
uh,
practices.

265
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,930
Now the practice extends to other cultures
beyond the western tradition besides,

266
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,850
uh,

267
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,850
the practice of making a stranger king
and then deposing him is one so prevalent

268
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,070
that Sir James Frazier,
I've mentioned him before,

269
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:12,060
but you've got to remember his
name, Sir James Fraser, f, r, a.

270
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:15,750
V. E. R, a devoted,

271
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,550
uh, many pages of his
classic, the Golden Bough,

272
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,020
uh, to this, uh, to this practice.

273
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,670
The idea was to punish the ruler for the
perquisites that he enjoyed wellbeing

274
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,830
king and for not having been able to
solve problems such as droughts and other

275
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:41,820
natural catastrophes.
We'll see this later when I quote Freud.

276
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,830
So they're stored is basing his
elaborate prank on a traditional routine.

277
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,280
Though he does take it
to an extreme.

278
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,440
This is not just king for a day,
but for several days. And, uh,

279
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,150
I said it and it's consistent in this
expansion and this exaggeration with the

280
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:05,950
baroque character of part two.

281
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,200
The point is that the whole thing
is supposed to be a joke, uh,

282
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:15,430
Santos expense and it is
part of the merriment,

283
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
the Duke and Duchess Palace.

284
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,600
It is also a part of the Marymount for
the participants in this whole charade.

285
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,080
They are acting it out as if,
as if this were a carnival.

286
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,210
Uh, there are other, uh,

287
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,860
traditional elements in the,
uh,

288
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,850
in the episode traditional, uh, um, act.

289
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,760
They should all scenes, uh,
for instance, the wanting,

290
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:50,761
which sancocho passes judgment on
several cases that come up before him.

291
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,900
Uh, he said traditional one
that goes back even to the Bible

292
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,610
console him on me. And, uh,

293
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,980
and also in folk traditions,

294
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,820
the traditions of riddles that
rulers or wise men are supposed to,

295
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,910
uh, to solve. Uh, the
tradition of Oracle's,

296
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,530
uh, back to the Greek, uh,

297
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,430
cause the Greeks unsold Sanko
solves several complicated cases.

298
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,480
Every single one of them
coming from folk tradition. Uh,

299
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,420
but hilarious at the same time I
bought Berkeley probably because of it.

300
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:36,100
They are hilarious. Uh, for instance,

301
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:39,760
central solves and kick a case
involving an alleged rape.

302
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,700
This is a very funny episode where the,
the,

303
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:47,710
uh,
uh,

304
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,170
the man is accused of
having raped this woman. Uh,

305
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,250
the man furthermore is
the lowest of the lowest.

306
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,270
So presumably this is, these are
all people acting out. He's a,

307
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,230
he's a hog herder pig keeper.
I mean,

308
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:08,590
this is the lowest I remember
in the first part when the,

309
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,080
the keeper of pigs arrives and,
uh,

310
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,820
even dimension of the word
Wetico in Spanish, uh, has
to be followed by, excuse me,

311
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,820
work for pig.
Uh,

312
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,930
and he's supposed to have forced
himself on this, uh, on this woman.

313
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,570
Uh, and, uh, uh,

314
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,250
on Santo has to decide
on, he has, remember this,

315
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,990
he asked, uh, the, the man
gave her a bag of money and,

316
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,300
and uh, when she's leaving,
he, let's take it from her.
And she fights like, like, uh,

317
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,020
an animal. So it was not to give up
the money. And then he says, well,

318
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:47,780
if you had defended yourself that
it would have been no, no rate.

319
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:52,210
But this is a case, remember,
uh, that I mentioned this in,

320
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,793
Eh,

321
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,290
when I talked about the,
uh,

322
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:07,291
the prisoner of sex is a case of
four Nicasio simplex case of simple

323
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:10,070
fornication. Uh, the, uh,

324
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,600
inquisition and Spanish law
had classified fornication,

325
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,890
the inquisition in its laws and all
that followed the scholastic practice of

326
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,740
classifications. Very, are you
still, are you still telic?

327
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,730
So there was simple fornication and then
qualified fornication of which there

328
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:28,910
were several kinds depending on
where the simple fornication is, is,

329
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,280
is sex between two people who are
on married and have different sex.

330
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,550
And then complex,

331
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,820
complex fornication comes when the people
are of the same sex. One is married,

332
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,780
uh, that both are married, but to other
people and so forth. That's the, yeah.

333
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:48,620
So this is a case of 40 of simplex. That
sanctuary, the judge is passing, uh,

334
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,770
uh, his, uh, sentence, uh,
on it. It is one of the, uh,

335
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,930
uh, traditional stories now.

336
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,170
Then he has to,

337
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,970
he's presented with a
very complicated case, uh,

338
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
about, uh, glad up. Better Lady now,

339
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,480
Clara Clear Pedal Edema derived
from peril, clear peril.

340
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,370
She's quite apparel.
Remember, this is the,

341
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,170
this is a young woman presumably in
this completely made up story within the

342
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:31,170
made up story. You know, the usual
receiving sequence instead of Lantis, uh,

343
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,920
who is half beautiful and have horrible.

344
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,320
And if you turn to your
page, uh, seven 69,

345
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,843
uh,

346
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,850
I say then the country man that this
son of mine who is to be the bachelor of

347
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:53,531
fell in love in the same village with
a downsell called Collada [inaudible]

348
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,410
daughter of our breast Pellegrino,

349
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,130
a very rich farmer and his name of
parallel going on these name of Pellegrino

350
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,150
game. Not to them by lineal or any of
the descent, but because of that race,

351
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,620
all of that race are subject to
the policy. And two men, the name,

352
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:13,730
they call them parallel Ryans
though to say the truth,

353
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:14,630
the downsell is luck.

354
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Any oriental a peril and looked at on
the right side seams the very flower of

355
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,110
the field.

356
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,050
But on the left you start quite so fair
for on that side. She wants an eye,

357
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,440
which she lost by the small pox.

358
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,450
And though the pits in her face are many
on deep admirer, say they are not pits,

359
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:42,740
but sid packers, we're in the
hearts of her lovers are buried.

360
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,410
She is so clean that to
prevent the filing her face,

361
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,380
she carries her nose so crooked up.

362
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,320
But it seems to be flying from her mouth.

363
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,450
And for all that she looks extremely
well for. She has a large mouth and did.

364
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,790
And did she not lock half a score or a
docent and did she not like half a score

365
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,560
or a dozen teeth and grinders,

366
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,800
she might pass and make a figure
among ladies of the best fashion.

367
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,740
I say nothing of her lips and so on.
Uh,

368
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,370
central sees through all of this as
something made up, uh, and refuses to, uh,

369
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,020
for grantees.

370
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,490
But this is a very interesting figure
because I've mentioned in the last class

371
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,520
the figure of the monster who's made
up of contrasting features of opposing

372
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:30,710
features. In the case of three folding,
it was the black robe on the Hawaii,

373
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,460
a beard,
black and white.

374
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And here it is extreme beauty
on one half and on the other,

375
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:43,860
this horrendous, uh, face for puck mark
and lacking and I, and all of that.

376
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,750
The, the two very opposites
clashing in one a figure.

377
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,490
This is in reference to the, this
Baroque, uh, the brokenness of part two,

378
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,170
but also to show, uh,
Saint Josephs, uh, uh,

379
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,290
sharp wit to see through, uh, this, uh,

380
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,550
Prac that they're trying to play on
him within the prank that he is already

381
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,820
undergoing.
If you compare Clara to Murray Torres,

382
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,640
you see that Marie Darnell's
is not that symmetrical,

383
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:18,660
but it our will all be from the top down.
Uh,

384
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,980
and uh,
whereas here we have a perfect,

385
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,250
a perfect symmetry. I
said, I have the door.

386
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,260
Now you have to remember always,
um, uh, keep insisting on the,

387
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,280
this is all made up by the Stewart who
is the author of this whole charade.

388
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:42,000
Now they just have the episode
is given by the story himself.

389
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,790
When he says in page seven, 90, 80,

390
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,310
81, I think, uh, uh,

391
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:55,140
(790) 801-0780 eight, 81, uh,

392
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,930
seven 80,
81,

393
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,500
when he says my Lord Governors scores the
Stuart speaks so well that I wanted to

394
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:10,180
hear a man. So void of learning as
your worship who I believe cannot,

395
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,520
not so much as read,

396
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,760
say such and so many things and all
sorts and tensions and instructive and so

397
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:22,800
far beyond all that could be expected
from your worships former understanding by

398
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:26,370
those who sent us and by
us who are come hitter.

399
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,820
But everyday producers,

400
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,900
new things just turn into Ernest
and jokers are joked upon.

401
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,760
Uh,

402
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,070
it is good to remember here and
I'm going to repeat a quote from a,

403
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,670
that American is Ruth Elsa far.
That is very appropriate, uh,

404
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,590
to uh, uh, at this point.
And I'll repeat it. She,

405
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,640
she wrote all of part two is based on the
mistaken assumption on the part of the

406
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:59,680
would be all controlling character authors
that they can deal with the fictional

407
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,560
character.
I maintain at the same time a distance,

408
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:07,561
which allows them never to slip into
that fictional world with which they plan

409
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:12,220
to entertain themselves. Luxon zone.
They are trapped from two directions.

410
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,600
They are controlled to some extent from
within their play by the very characters

411
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:19,360
whom they intend to
manipulate and from without,

412
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,020
by an author of whom they are unaware,

413
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,540
but who's will and whose hand or uh,

414
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,410
that they do is contrived.
And this is the case here of course,

415
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,480
of the steward who is himself
acknowledging that the, uh,

416
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,060
things have turned out,
uh,

417
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,190
not quite the way that he had planned
that he and the Duke and Duchess had had

418
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,750
planted, which was of course to have
a fun at the expense of central.

419
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:48,610
But central turns out on the
contrary, uh, to be, uh, quite a good,

420
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,530
uh,
uh,

421
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,860
governor and so that
they will start turned.

422
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,040
This is another one of this inversions
that are happening regularly in part two

423
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,830
of the, uh, of the Quixote, uh,

424
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,800
is also good to notice that,
uh,

425
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,330
the story is aware of,
uh, of both of his, uh,

426
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,520
construction of this whole episode
and have, it's a sort of collapse

427
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,030
now in a larger sense.
Uh,

428
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Barataria has to do with the
breakdown of Aristocratic Authority

429
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,280
and the emergence of the common
man as a potential ruler.

430
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:38,930
Sankyo proves to be wise
beyond all expectations and
in spite of all the pranks,

431
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,740
uh,

432
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,890
that he and his master
endure as we've Globulin you.

433
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,020
The episode that we discussed in the last
class is dignity remains untouched and

434
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:53,460
the markers are the ones who are,

435
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,810
who are marked central
became a good governor.

436
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:59,550
This is the ironic result.

437
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:04,440
It counter intuitive resolution
that towards the designs
of the Duke and Duchess

438
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,510
and that under minds the authorial
intentions of the steward who obviously

439
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,720
wanted sanctuary to provide
the humor but acting stupid.

440
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,473
And,
uh,

441
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,890
this is in part, and this is something
that I had not mentioned before,

442
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,580
but uh,
that uh,

443
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:30,010
is easy to figure out this or miss
readings of part one on the part of

444
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,590
characters in part two,

445
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:40,060
they assume that the characters are
going act in a certain way by the way.

446
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:46,331
They have interpreted part one and they
have interpreted part one with Sandra as

447
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:52,690
a buffoon. Saint Joe's,
Joe's a comic character, uh,

448
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,730
which is the way by that Avi
Geneva interpreted a Saint Joe's.

449
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,480
We uh, if we remember the
class whenever you Neda, uh,

450
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,820
so it's good to keep this in
mind that these are miss reading.

451
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,660
So on the part of the Stewart on the
part of the Duke and Duchess who expect

452
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,460
though Quixote on Saint Jo to act
in a certain way. So these are, uh,

453
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,470
mistakes, uh, in the reading.

454
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,543
Uh,

455
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,843
no,

456
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,600
besides the folkloric sources
that I have mentioned of Barbaria,

457
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,633
uh,

458
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,040
the background is also a
literary and philosophical.

459
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,450
Uh,

460
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:45,450
it is a self contained society
presumably to be well run.

461
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,230
This is the humanistic theme of Utopia.

462
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,020
Going back to Thomas Moore.
You remember,

463
00:33:56,021 --> 00:34:01,021
I have been mentioning all along
the names of important renaissance,

464
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,450
uh, figures, uh, that, uh,

465
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,260
but you must, uh, that
you should remember,

466
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,993
uh,

467
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:22,200
for, is it easy for you?
We just check it out.

468
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:25,140
And your Wikipedia,
uh,

469
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,790
more was the author of Utopia,
the book of the same name,

470
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,100
which was published in 15,
16.

471
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Also Tommaso come Banella

472
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,810
come Panella, uh, 1568,

473
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:53,980
1639 who published a
city of the sun in 1602,

474
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:55,600
which was also a utopia.

475
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,740
Okay.

476
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,740
This is the idea that a perfect society
can be established on this earth

477
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,010
following a rational design.

478
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,910
The concept goes back,
of course,

479
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:17,911
to Plato's republic and to all the
treaties is that begin to appear in the

480
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:21,280
renaissance about the art of government,
including of course,

481
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:24,280
Machiavelli's the prince that I
have mentioned several times here.

482
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,903
This,

483
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,680
the prince is salts in the background
here because sanctuary is trying to act

484
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:35,530
like the perfect prince,
like the perfect ruler,

485
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,500
and hence Machiavelli's the prince
is in the background of this episode.

486
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,970
So see how many important,
uh,

487
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,150
renaissance thinkers are behind, uh, uh,

488
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,530
this in this episode. But
what does it mean? I mean,

489
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,940
you taught this week, you should
teach your doctors, by the way,

490
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,970
are the origin of modern political
systems or the idea that that with the

491
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:04,971
political system you can create or improve
a society to America like a utopia is

492
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,330
in the 18th century where particularly
this is ideas will become a reality.

493
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,740
And they have become, of course, as we
know, nightmares in the 20th century.

494
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,640
Some of these utopias of turned
out to be quite the opposite,

495
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,630
uh, to the point that you've had
to have walls to keep the, uh,

496
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,820
the people inside of them.
But so this is the idea, uh,

497
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,520
that you can rationally
create a perfect society.

498
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,700
Uh,
and uh,

499
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,550
so what is it here in this
episode of the Quixote?

500
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,350
Is it a parody of this,
uh, notions of Utopia?

501
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,220
I mean, but at Aria is a
mark utopia, of course,

502
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,700
with a fake king and all is being,
uh, an all it all ends in a,

503
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,550
in a, in a great catastrophe. Uh,

504
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,770
is it,

505
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,390
is it a parody showing the
futility of such attempts,

506
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,370
but it could be,

507
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,670
I think that the episode is important
enough and given enough relevance in the

508
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:21,000
book to invite
interpretations of this kind

509
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,353
now.

510
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:30,140
Yeah. Being an island reflects other
things. Three of them. For instance,

511
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,660
one of the idea,
one,

512
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:37,400
the idea of self containment and self
sufficiency of roundness as it were.

513
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,760
And at one point it is referred to us
[inaudible] round the island is round and

514
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:47,360
islands tend to be self contained
because of course they're surrounded by,

515
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,210
by water.
Uh,

516
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:56,110
to I think about that also reflects
the recently discovered islands of the

517
00:37:56,571 --> 00:38:00,920
Caribbean recently, you
know, a late 15th century,

518
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:04,730
early 16th century where the Spaniards,
uh,

519
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:09,410
attempted to create societies
almost from the ground up,

520
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:14,740
uh, in the, in Hispaniola, uh,

521
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,510
in Cuba.
Uh,

522
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,500
and also the wished for,

523
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:26,370
but never reached islands of
the classical tradition. This,

524
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,560
this word called,

525
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,523
okay,

526
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,040
I'm going to put it in
English and the islands

527
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,940
and the,

528
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,303
okay.

529
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,380
This way you get the name for until the,

530
00:38:46,381 --> 00:38:50,940
until it's comes from those
before islands, islands,
these were fugitive violence.

531
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,710
There's islands that you
saw in the distance and you
were supposed to arrive at

532
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,030
and they, uh, like the oasis in the
desert as you came closer, they,

533
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,790
they get,
they got further and further away.

534
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:08,030
But suggesting that this were Ireland
said you wanted to reach on that where

535
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,300
perhaps you would find utopia
or an oasis or something.

536
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,640
Of course,
when this level,

537
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:19,860
the island has the quality of elusiveness
that one would associate with Atlantis.

538
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,890
So you can see,
uh,

539
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,930
the depth of this episode
and Becky Hilty, uh, by, by,

540
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,060
by,
by dint of the many sources,

541
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,660
ideas and books that it has behind it.

542
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,420
Now,

543
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Freud mentions this episode
in totem and taboo and he's,

544
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,060
he's taken this episode
is very instructive.

545
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,350
Now remember I mentioned I think in an
earlier class that Freud was a devoted

546
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:53,690
reader of Cervantes. And that as a, as
an adolescent, he created a servant,

547
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,350
this club with several friends to read
Cervantes and discuss it and so forth.

548
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:01,830
And they even give themselves names
from characters in sort of some of the

549
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:06,360
exemplary stories and all of that.
Now,

550
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,940
as you can see, as you will see, uh,

551
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,480
Freud interprets this episode,
uh,

552
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,740
by you sort of reducing it
to his own system of course
thinkers thing. To do that

553
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,120
he examines fraud examiners
the suffering king,

554
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,580
the suffering a king get must undergo
to pay for his exalted position in the

555
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:32,630
traditions that I have already
mentioned in Frasier, remember to Freud,

556
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:37,631
this is played out chiefly
in the hilarious scene
where Santo is denied food.

557
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,080
Uh,

558
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,460
Freud is drawing an analogy between
certain neurosis and the behavior of

559
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:49,294
primitives,

560
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,250
focusing on the ambivalent attitude
towards kings and it's analogue in the

561
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,530
relationship with
children to their fathers.

562
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,603
Okay.

563
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,500
People to the king, children to
fathers. He says, I quote here,

564
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,570
the importance of a particular person.

565
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:09,280
It's extraordinarily heightened and his
omnipotence is raised to the improbable

566
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:14,110
in order to make it easier to attribute
to him the responsibility for everything

567
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:16,120
painful that happens to a patient.

568
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,950
Savages really do not act differently
towards their rulers when they ascribe to

569
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:23,110
them power over rain and shine,

570
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:26,200
wind and weather and then
the throne or killed them.

571
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:30,370
Because nature has disappointed their
expectation of a good hunt or a ripe

572
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,060
harvest. Of course you can see the of
the father, the Omnipod and father,

573
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,750
uh, on, on hence the, the, the,

574
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,190
all of the theories Freud had
about the oedipal, uh, uh,

575
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,640
complex and all that.
He goes on those also,

576
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:51,641
the taboo ceremonial of kings is
nominally an expression of the highest

577
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:56,900
veneration because their relationship
to the father is an ambiguous one of

578
00:41:56,901 --> 00:42:01,340
veneration and hostility and
a means of guarding them.

579
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,760
Actually,
it is the punishment for their elevation,

580
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:07,190
the revenge which their
subjects take upon them,

581
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,280
the experiences which
Cervantes makes sense.

582
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:13,460
Japan central banks down
the girl was governor,

583
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,520
governor of his island have evidently
made him recognize this interpretation of

584
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,470
courtly ceremonial as
the only correct one.

585
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,710
It is very possible that this point
would be corroborated if we could induce

586
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,470
kings and rulers of today to express
themselves from the point here.

587
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:34,490
Freud is of course being ironic and we're
going to ask kings and rulers today if

588
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:39,320
they want to undergo this kind
of process. Of course. Uh,

589
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:44,420
then he goes on to make the,
uh, unavoidable comparison
with the Christian myth.

590
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:48,500
He goes, why? The emotional
attitude towards rulers,

591
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:53,000
it should contain such a strong
unconscious share of hostility is a very

592
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:57,740
interesting problem. We
have already referred to the
infant towel father complex.

593
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,570
We may add that an investigation of the
early history of kingship would bring

594
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:05,820
the decisive explanations.
Frasier sergers,

595
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,950
a freshman who I mentioned
has an impressive discussion
of the theory that the

596
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,400
first kings where strangers
who after a short rain,

597
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:16,370
we're destined to be
sacrifice at solemn festivals.

598
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,530
That's representatives of the DDT.

599
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,740
But Frazier himself does not
consider these facts all together.

600
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:26,741
Convincing Christian myths are said to
have been still influenced by the after

601
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,910
effects of this evolution of kings.
Okay. The idea of the laying of, of,

602
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:35,540
of Jesus Christ, King of
the Jews and so forth. Uh,

603
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,060
but you can see how these illuminates what
is going on with [inaudible] with, uh,

604
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,820
with central bank said how
Freud's take on this helpless,

605
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,250
understand better the mechanism,
the mechanisms.

606
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,270
Now this is part of the
traditional background. Uh,

607
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,570
but also of course, the, the,

608
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,460
the nightmare of finally getting what
you crave and not being able to quite get

609
00:43:58,461 --> 00:43:59,450
your hands on it.
You know,

610
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:03,260
those wish fulfillment dreams
where you have that Kate core,

611
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,540
let's put it in those terms. I'm
not given an erotic twist, uh,

612
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,750
that pie or something that you,

613
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,760
that you want and that you're about
to get and you don't quite get. Uh,

614
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,020
but also the disappointment
of achieving, uh, things,

615
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:21,680
things are never quite that we
imagine or desired. I mean B,

616
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,740
but they say it's be careful what
you wish because you may get it.

617
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,300
And once you get it, it may turn out
to be not exactly what you expected.

618
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,070
And there is something of that here too.
This is,

619
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,110
this is the strong dissing Gagnon
element of these episodes, uh,

620
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,850
on this, uh, on this island. The,

621
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,560
the scene that's so fascinated.

622
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:47,680
Freud in which bear that
or rescue they are widow.

623
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,470
That's the name we might want to
also unpack. This is the doctor.

624
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:56,380
They're very funny doctor who
keeps saying, no, no, no, you
can't eat that. Oh No, no.

625
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,810
God, that's the worst you can eat. No,
no, no, no. You cannot eat that. Uh,

626
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,403
but bed

627
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,340
plus your man's hard heart.

628
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,730
This [inaudible] you're treating me hard.

629
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,070
You say in Spanish, uh, the I widow

630
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,830
come be a last name,
but aware of means omen

631
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,050
urban model are Wedo it bad omen

632
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,260
and he isn't [inaudible]

633
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,050
that's the name of the town who
comes from it. You know what I mean?

634
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,970
Is like keep you out is what it means.
Keep you out.

635
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:54,080
When I was a kid and you
wanted to get rid of this kid,

636
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,110
an adult will tell him,

637
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,500
go see so and so and ask her
to give you some 10 tier. Yeah.

638
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,100
Keep you there. Uh, don't have to give
you some 10. Yeah. Keep you there.

639
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,230
So [inaudible] is more or less like a,

640
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:15,440
like that this is quite a remarkable
character. This, that this doctor, uh,

641
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,970
this is a very more yeah, like seeing
if you read them all. Yeah. In Malia,

642
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
there is always this a
hilarious criticism of doctors.

643
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,220
We're always toying
around with a huge animal,

644
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:30,530
trying to give an enema
to somebody. And, uh,

645
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,120
that sort of thing or whenever the
situation is, uh, is difficult,

646
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:40,250
they begin declining Latin, uh,
nouns and verbs because of course,

647
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:45,050
the idea is to know Latin well, to be able
to read the sources of, uh, uh, because,

648
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,550
uh, medicine was at this point, it's still
very scholastic based on all of this,

649
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,880
on sources, on written sources,
more than one experience,

650
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:54,830
some overdubs and experience.
See,

651
00:46:54,831 --> 00:46:59,831
part of the Baroque is the clash between
this scholastic traditional knowledge

652
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:05,360
that does not stand up
to actual experience.

653
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,390
And this is why the critique of medicine
is so important and so relevant.

654
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:14,660
It's not just funny because it's
hilarious. It's very, very, very funny.

655
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,960
But it's also very significant because
it reflects a condition of the time.

656
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,943
Yeah,

657
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,590
no,
the n of Saint Joe's government,

658
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,540
he's got strong topic as you know.
Uh,

659
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,640
and there's one episode in which
like the fall from the horse, uh,

660
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,430
with the Foa of course explodes.
He may have been, uh, uh,

661
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,830
injured.
Um,

662
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:47,670
now Barataria is also lack a
laboratory experience on fiction

663
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,070
unfiction making.

664
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,820
How does one create a fictional
world coherent within itself?

665
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,980
All fictional novels or stories are
the creation of a coherent world within

666
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:10,540
itself. Uh, one that is round as it were,

667
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,670
the fiction, uh, obviously gets
out of hand of the steward.

668
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,680
He cannot quite stand outside
of it. Uh, uh, like a puppeteer.

669
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,220
And this is parallels to,

670
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,300
to master pier on his puppet show.
Uh,

671
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,120
and perfection of course,
of this

672
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,660
fictional world cannot
be, uh, quite achieved.

673
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,640
And this is parallels to, of course
Sylvana situation. Vis-A-Vie uh, the,

674
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:45,330
uh, Nicky Haughty, uh, one way
that I imagine it is, I mean,

675
00:48:45,331 --> 00:48:49,590
if this is the world of fiction,
the Creator,

676
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,590
uh,
the story is here trying to control it,

677
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,430
but he winds up here
and once he is inside,

678
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,200
he does not have the all encompassing
perspective and he has all of the problems

679
00:49:04,201 --> 00:49:08,430
that the characters he has created have.
So that is the,

680
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,250
the this or the irony comes in and
this is where, uh, we're, we're bought,

681
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,093
on the other hand,

682
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,300
this effort to create this self contained,

683
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:23,330
coherent fiction anticipates what Macondo
the fictional village in 100 years of

684
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:28,290
solitude.

685
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:33,290
Komala the fictional village
in blue for Pedro Paramo.

686
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,370
If you're not aware of this,
uh,

687
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,150
room for one room for
the great Mexican writer

688
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,730
and he's normal that I read it all.

689
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,360
Sell from the idea of you talked yet to
also to the idea of creating a fictional

690
00:49:53,361 --> 00:49:57,940
world. You see, the connection
is all behind the island of, uh,

691
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,380
of party Barataria. Now, uh,

692
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,270
we are going to talk, uh, next, uh,

693
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,820
in the next class about LTC Laura,

694
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:15,680
this mark Ddo Dido that I hope
you, uh, uh, you are reading,

695
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,920
uh,
and also about doing your Rodriguez.

696
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:23,630
This is the one whose daughter
is impregnated and whose,

697
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,770
uh,

698
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,270
whose boyfriend refuses to marry her and
they don't put pressure on him because

699
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:34,160
he's the son of the person who lends
money to the Duke and Duchess. Uh,

700
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,440
this is that she's a very
interesting character.

701
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:40,190
She's the one who reveals the physical
defects of the Dutcher's unwell,

702
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,720
Dizzy Dora. What are the physical
defects of this women? Uh,

703
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,440
the Dodgers are sort of the beautiful
hunters and all of that apparently has

704
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:52,160
some sores in her legs that, uh, that, uh,

705
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:53,990
which some liquid flows.

706
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,690
As you see,
Laura has bad breath.

707
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,190
This is beautiful, LTC Laura who
sings, I don't know that, uh,

708
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,880
during your Rodriguez with great,
uh, resentments actually has

709
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,290
a consol, the tired
breath. Uh, so she has a,

710
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,060
these are defects that we're not going to,

711
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:21,590
we would not have found in the
idealize women of part one and a.

712
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:26,360
So this is significant
about, uh, about, uh,

713
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,220
[inaudible] Rodriguez and the
things that Ge, uh, Ge, uh, reveals.

714
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,710
But I want to finish by,
uh,

715
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,980
by talking about Don Quixote and sank
to the pair because I came across two

716
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:47,321
recent articles on the two of them as a
pair that I want to sort of summarize,

717
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:53,780
uh, for you. One is by Antonio
carrying your Rodriguez.

718
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,220
I emphasize the RS and
the [inaudible] and Tonio.

719
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:07,923
Okay.

720
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,620
Um, I'm [inaudible] talks
about the influence of okay.

721
00:52:13,621 --> 00:52:18,621
Hotel on St Joe on modern modern comedy
pairs a switch as Abbott and Costello,

722
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,200
Oliver and hardy

723
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:28,530
on even takes it all the way
up to characters in Seinfeld.

724
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:34,080
Uh, uh, a a a show.
God, I have to confess,

725
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,470
I have never in my life seen.
Uh,

726
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,340
but he has a picture here, uh, uh,

727
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:43,220
of characters from that,
uh,

728
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,350
the show not apparently show a,

729
00:52:46,351 --> 00:52:50,670
a decided influenced from
a Doki haughty and San Jo.

730
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,940
He also gives the folkloric background
of this pairs going back to the Middle

731
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,120
Ages and projected projected then
forward on to the present. I mean,

732
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,390
I want to Costello, one is fat.
Uh, the straight man who, uh,

733
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:08,520
and then the, the, uh, you
can see immediately the
moment I mentioned that, yes,

734
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,510
this is don Quixote and sanctuary
in, in, in, in, in film.

735
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,360
The other, uh, it's an article
by my friend Edwin Williamson,

736
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,770
who's a distinguished Oxford Hispanic,

737
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:25,970
and it has to do with what it turns
the power struggle between luxury hotel

738
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,843
sanctuary,

739
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:32,030
which is resolved ultimately in favor of
the squire because Don Quixote's having

740
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:37,910
to beg him to please let us give himself
the lashes necessary to disenchant Lucy.

741
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,100
Now he mentions four episodes,

742
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,100
the fooling hammers or no
Quixote hits him over the head.

743
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,310
Uh, and, uh, the enchanted
[inaudible], Neha,

744
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,530
when there is an inversion of,

745
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:58,590
of roles and a sanctuary is
now the one creating the,

746
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:00,250
uh, evaluate, uh,

747
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,800
kind of reality out of a
normal everyday, uh, alive,

748
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,083
uh,

749
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,460
Merlin's prophecy when he states that
it is Sandra who must give himself the

750
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:15,570
lashes on his behind
to disenchant Lucy now,

751
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,430
which then makes donkey
hotter dependent on sandwich.

752
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:24,900
Uh, and, and finally a chapter that you,

753
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:28,260
uh, an episode you may not
have read yet in chapters 60.

754
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:31,800
The fight between the two of them when
a donkey hot Quixote tries to force

755
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:35,160
central to give himself lashes
and two takes his clothes off to,

756
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:36,300
to give him the lashes.

757
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:40,800
And Central wrestles don Quixote to the
ground and puts his knee on his chest

758
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:43,760
and says he will not do that.
Uh,

759
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:49,570
Williamson gives an appropriately, uh, uh,

760
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,780
political reading to this a
power struggle. Uh, and, uh,

761
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,250
which,
which I agree.

762
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:01,251
I think that he's a unduly
harsh about the end when he,

763
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:06,570
he sees that sanctuary is being totally
cynical, even a donkey halters deathbed.

764
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:09,960
I think that that Williams from
when a little bit too far there,

765
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:14,990
but I want to in conclusion today to read
you read you his conclusion because it

766
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:21,891
is very much in tune with what I have
been saying about Barataria and the rice

767
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:26,640
of the common man to a position of uh,

768
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,030
government Cervantes.

769
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:34,070
Moreover says Williamson was not aware
of the wider political dimension of the

770
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:40,440
power struggle that he had first Adam
braided as far back as a fooling mills

771
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,800
filling hammers episode in part one in
the final crisis when the night has been

772
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:51,501
forced to the ground by his
squire Sanchez defiant assertion.

773
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,170
Are you domain Ami [inaudible] me Sr.

774
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,150
I helped myself because I have my own
master inevitably carries political

775
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:02,970
resonances for eating plies,

776
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:08,210
a conscious rejection of the traditional
basis of authority and status and

777
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:13,401
portents the emergence of a different
world or world that's Advantis himself

778
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:18,990
must have imagined with this
quiet if not with dread,

779
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,620
those at the heart of the Quixote.
There is an intriguing irony.

780
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:28,600
Instead of one test may well have started
out on his adventure of writing with

781
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:33,601
the purely literary aim of discrediting
the Makena malformed dollar of that.

782
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:34,870
You've all read romances,

783
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,340
but by a series of logical steps arising
from the interaction of master and

784
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:44,230
servant, he was led to undermine
the principle of hierarchy.

785
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,460
That was the cornerstone
of the ideology of his day.

786
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,480
We would continue with this and
other themes in that next class.
