1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,010
So we're going to talk today about two
of the most significant episodes of part

2
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,980
two of the Quixote.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,530
That'd be salts that mark a transition to,
uh,

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,570
that begin the sort of the down slope
of the novel as it moves towards its

5
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:22,974
conclusion.

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,310
It is a protracted combination and
finale consistent with the slower,

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,150
more deliberate pace of part two.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,640
We will be meeting one character
from part one who reappears.

9
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:43,140
He ness the Pasa Monte under
the guise of master puppeteer,

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,060
uh,
master Peter.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,690
And there will not only be
repetitions of episodes from part one,

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,950
but even repetitions of episodes
from part two within part two.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,380
After the episodes that
I will discuss today,

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,030
three major new developments occur

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,800
first or don Quixote will sometimes
leave the center of the action to be

16
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,620
replaced by sanctuary.
Second,

17
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,830
that both don Quixote and
Sankyo become objects,

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,660
the object of amusement for frivolous
upperclass characters who have,

19
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,870
who have read part one and three,

20
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:32,460
that the protagonist would be surrounded
by many more characters than before.

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,930
The overarching theme of
the novel continues to be
this in Ganja as most of the

22
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:44,610
action is staged by internal authors.

23
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:45,990
Uh,

24
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,990
it is an action that is highly theatrical
and the props or backstage of the

25
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:56,481
skits are reveal to the reader either
during their performance or right after

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,920
the first of the two important episodes
is the one about don Quixote's descent

27
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,440
into Montesinos cave.

28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,350
A truly remarkable to have the force and
one of the most brilliant scenes in the

29
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:17,910
western literary tradition.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,670
So Montesinos Cave. This is, uh,

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,800
one of the principle episodes of part
two and arguably of the entire work

32
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,610
because it seems to engage
the main literary topics
and sources of the novel and

33
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,630
also,
uh,

34
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,470
provides a rare glimpse into the
inner workings of donkey hold.

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,620
This subconscious,

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,520
it is us as if we were looking behind the
scenes of the cohort or allowed to see

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,140
it reverse site.
Uh,

38
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,650
as we see the reverse side
of that painting within, uh,

39
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,430
Las Meninas that bellicose is working on,
it is also as,

40
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,830
as if we were allowed to dissect the,
um,

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,610
to dissect the protagonist
while he's still alive.

42
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,990
Then at first notice that this is
an adventure that Don Quixote six,

43
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:28,870
that he looks forward,
not one that is imposed on him by chance.

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Like the encounters on the road or by
other characters who are scripting is

45
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:35,500
life.
As we have seen.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,390
Sandstone Carrasco from the very beginning
is trying to script hold Hotez life

47
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,720
and there will be several other
internal authors doing that.

48
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,000
But this is not the case
at all. Is An episode, uh,

49
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,120
an adventure that don't
Quixote, uh, once, uh,

50
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,120
200 take and he tells this
scholar or the cousin, uh,

51
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,170
that he wants to do so and asks how
to get to want to see gnosis cave.

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,190
It is also an episode that
is a strictly, uh, Spanish,

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,590
uh,

54
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,430
and that seems to take Don Quixote
into the depths of the Spanish soil.

55
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,340
It is as if saying that these
kinds of fabulous events, uh,

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,620
also happen in Spain and
in the present a law,

57
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:26,200
as you will see, and I will speak
about the sources of the episode,

58
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,650
a descends into caves and so forth.
And, uh, uh, but this is one, uh,

59
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,000
that is based on us Spanish,
uh,

60
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,300
a tradition that is,

61
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:40,420
people knew about Montesinos
Cave and talked about it.

62
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,350
They exist and don't be hot.
They want it to go into them,

63
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,740
decided that he had to
have this, uh, adventure.

64
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,230
One way to see the episode as
flowing from Camacho's wedding,

65
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,140
which is the big episode proceeding.
It is true. It's connection with orbit.

66
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,830
The cousin or scholar who is their
guide is writing a Spanish of it and the

67
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:13,051
explanation given about the reverse of
Spain and their names is in the spirit of

68
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:17,170
the metamorphosis. This
scholar, uh, is, uh,

69
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:22,060
another satire of a
students and intellectuals,

70
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,800
uh,
uh,

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,730
like the one that we have seen in
the case of Sandstone Carrasco.

72
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,510
This is even more extreme.
This is a really ridiculous,

73
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,930
a scholar who,
uh,

74
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,540
is trying to find out who had
the first cold in history,

75
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,580
if you remember.
Uh,

76
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,750
and, uh, so I also said that in part two

77
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,800
of the Quixote Cervantes seems
to be signaling as his sources,

78
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,040
homer Virgil of it.

79
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,120
And as we shall see,

80
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Dante as if claiming that his
work is they're worthy successor,

81
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,140
that he's in their league as it were.
In common parlance,

82
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,780
I will speak about Virgil
when we get to meet LTC Dora,

83
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,770
the character that you will meet and find
very amusing who is a version of Dido.

84
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,950
Now these descending to the cave
has antecedents in the Odyssey,

85
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:32,570
the need and the divine comedy of course.
Uh,

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
although there are also sources in Valerie
Grumman insists this is an very and

87
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,570
adventure on a higher literary level.

88
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,270
This is not just going back to
episodes in the chivalric romances,

89
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:51,140
but homer, Virgil, Dante,

90
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,630
uh,

91
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,890
there are of course also traditional
stories about going into caves in all

92
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,580
cultures. Uh, and in all literatures.

93
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,040
If you have read your American literature,

94
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,910
you see that in Tom Sawyer and
huckleberry Finn and so forth.

95
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:12,830
There are episodes where the characters
go into, into caves. But here,

96
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,390
I think the, the sources are
those that I mentioned, uh,

97
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,690
going down into the cave has of course,

98
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:25,691
deep psychological resonances having to
do with Don Quixote's sexuality and come

99
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,320
competently, uh, his fear of death.

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,830
As he enters the cave,

101
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,020
he has to walk away at the brambles
covering the entrance in actions that are

102
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,960
symbolic or reminiscent over deflowering.

103
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,640
And the black birds that fly away
in freight are clear in dimensions.

104
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,420
Intimations of death.
They are bad omens.

105
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,240
They have a kind of a Hitchcock like
air to beat. I mean, to modern readers,

106
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,160
they, uh, I'm sure remind
you of that very frightening.

107
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,840
Hitchcock film,
the birds

108
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,400
what donkey haughty experiences
in the cave is a dream.

109
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,420
And of course these alliances
with dream literature,

110
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,830
this is clear by his being
asleep when it's pulled back up.

111
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,860
And from the story he tells about falling
asleep when he sits down on the coiled

112
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:34,130
up rope within the cave,
don't get help.

113
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,680
He says that he wakes up from that sleep,

114
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,620
but it is obvious that he
awakens within the dream.

115
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:45,590
Now this is a dream within a dream.
Uh, another, uh, mirror effect.

116
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
What the dream allows is for
the untrammeled emergence
of Don Quixote's deepest

117
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220
fears in the form of stories related
to his fantasies or drawn from his

118
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,160
fantasies.

119
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,140
It is as if he had been
administered a drug, a drug,

120
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,190
a truth serum,

121
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,610
or us if he had relaxed on
the psychoanalyst's couch
and allowed himself to free

122
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,894
associate

123
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,650
the story of good and dark.

124
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Then Burma is drone from the
Corolla Carolingian cycle.

125
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,620
Remember that I mentioned the
various cycles of what you violated,

126
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:36,310
Romances and the epics and the Carol
Legion is from Charlie Maine and so forth.

127
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,880
They're drawn from the Charlie Carolingian
cycle and seems to have embedded not

128
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,810
only, uh, the fear of death,
but the fear of castration.

129
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,381
Uh,

130
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:52,240
all the characters except for Merlin are
from the balance of the Carolingian and

131
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:56,080
Arthurian Cycle.
King Arthur Charlemagne,

132
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,370
the characters are supposed to be
dead and everyone is in the morning.

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,260
And the procession is a,

134
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:10,261
is a kind of a mournful procession as
like a barrier dude underneath his body in

135
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:16,090
the story has his heart removed and
sent it to Bill Irma as a symbol of his

136
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,970
undying love. This is
the original story. He's,

137
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:21,280
he asked when he died,

138
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,050
who have this heart removed
and sent to his beloved here,

139
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,060
his castrated cadaver acid,

140
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,090
where appears as the statue of grazing
his own tomb and able to speak.

141
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,530
But the voracity of the story is
compromised or grotesquely guaranteed by

142
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:49,041
Montesinos inclination that he has had
to salt the heart so that it would so

143
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:51,810
that they will not rot and begin to smell.

144
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,400
This destroys the fantasy.
I mean,

145
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:00,030
if this great hero have is
how has his heart center,

146
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:01,410
his beloved one,

147
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:06,060
never thinks that this heart will
be subject to the laws of nature.

148
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,250
I mean, this is fantasy
world, but here, uh,

149
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,770
that fantasy is destroyed. And the
story, the voracity of the story,

150
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,060
in other words,
can be guaranteed.

151
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:19,680
But the fact that they have to salt it
so that it won't fill, that it won't rot

152
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,160
a natural laws threaten the
story's very similitude.

153
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,870
A jerk beef heart is not the same
as the heart that symbolizes love,

154
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:34,860
courage and masculinity and me sir,
the heart of course,

155
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,310
all of these connotations.
Uh,

156
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,570
so if you think of it as being made
of Jerky, beef, all of that, uh,

157
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,850
all of those connotations are
destroyed or become grotesque.

158
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,920
Although time is flexible within episode,

159
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,320
it effects on Flesh,

160
00:11:56,321 --> 00:12:00,010
our present that is
invested in other aspects.

161
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,530
I say that the time is flexible.

162
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,550
Who was in the episode because how long
was Gnocchi halted down the scholar and

163
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:08,824
San Jose?

164
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,830
An hour at most he says three days and
then there is the issue of how long ago

165
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:19,930
the stories occurred
hundreds of years ago.

166
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,680
Yet these characters are, are, are there.

167
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,930
So a time within the,
within the story is,

168
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,770
is flexible as time tends to be,
as we know in dreams,

169
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,040
we know now from modern stories and dreams
that that stories that seem to take a

170
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,930
long time actually take a few seconds.
In a dream,

171
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,150
but a under that is this, this, this
compression that Freud talks about,

172
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,120
about her dream compressive
stories in very short time.

173
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,330
This is intimated here
and that, uh, uh, look,

174
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,260
the hottest has been there for three
days and say, oh, we're only an hour.

175
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,050
But the effect of time on flesh is,
is,

176
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,290
is evident.

177
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,950
Now these detail of the
effect of time on flesh, uh,

178
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,100
uh,

179
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,800
reveal some key holders own doubts
about the legitimacy of the chivalric

180
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,030
legends. I mean, remember this is
the story he himself is telling.

181
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,040
Uh, so, uh, if he, if,

182
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,320
if a story comes up in his subconscious
subconsciousness because he, he's,

183
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:28,930
he has doubts about the
legitimacy of this, of the, uh,

184
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:32,530
of the true legends,
their stories,

185
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:35,410
those of that you've got Rick
legends violate natural laws.

186
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,690
Hence they are fantastic
as other characters have
been telling him all along.

187
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,860
And all of this seems to
have had an effect on him.

188
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,600
Now, don't be haughty is
recognized as a great night,

189
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,460
a constant that began when with
sandstone care, Roscoe's revelation,

190
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:57,560
that of the existence of part one a.

191
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,880
And this is something that will happen
over and again in part two that he is

192
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,820
recognized as a great night. But in
this case by characters who succeed,

193
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,730
whose own existence is very,

194
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:11,731
very doubtful and that he himself will
doubt from now on by asking others

195
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,590
anxiously. Like, am I supposed
the roast master Peter's monkey?

196
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,160
If what happened in the cave was real
and by insisting that sanctuary believed

197
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:27,490
that it was real
striking deals with him,

198
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,920
I'd believe that if you believe the cave
of dizziness we shows and he's not that

199
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,410
sure about. So, uh,

200
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,020
their recognition that is the recognition
of his being a great night by these

201
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:43,990
characters is, is Harley, uh, an assurance

202
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,980
I am underlining this,
this doubts that the stories reveal

203
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,310
his own, uh, his own fantasies.

204
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,690
But the most disturbing part of the
story is the appearance of do scenario in

205
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,220
the guise of the ugly winch that central
tried to make him believe was his lady.

206
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,320
This is a,
okay,

207
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,360
we know from Freud Freud's great booked
interpretation of dreams that was

208
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,570
published in 1900,
uh,

209
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,670
that we talked about the remains of the
day. How a dream picks up elements from,

210
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,210
from the previous day.
And May it incorporates it into stories.

211
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,380
And this is sort of the
remains of the day. Uh,

212
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,100
now the appearance of this
wench convinced the sanctuary.

213
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:42,500
The Don Quixote is insane because
he was the author of that charade.

214
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,050
But it also shows to what extent
that episode of the three, uh,

215
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,730
peasant women,
uh,

216
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,840
has shaken donkey halters own beliefs
and probed deep into the sources of his

217
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:02,210
own desires for [inaudible] and,
oh,

218
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,060
he's invention of Gucci man,

219
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,040
this person [inaudible] who smells
of raw garlic, if you can remember,

220
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,370
uh,

221
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,370
she smelled of sweat in Sanchez
earlier story about her when you said,

222
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,280
I got next to her and she smelled a little
bit because she was pitching the hay

223
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,010
or whatever it was. Uh, this,

224
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,100
this person [inaudible] I
think this close to them.

225
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,230
Key holders own real desire for,

226
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,620
I don't sell or install the original Lucy,
Neha.

227
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,320
It seems to be the repressed desire
for a vulgar, physically strong,

228
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:44,321
sexually aggressive younger woman who is
the very opposite is the fact that the

229
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,860
is the core relative opposite
of his idealization of her.

230
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,270
The more vulgar this woman of his,
of his desires is,

231
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,930
the more idealized she
will become in his fantasy.

232
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,440
Also,
uh,

233
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,100
when he asked for a loan
by her in this hilarious,

234
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,540
hilarious part of the story.

235
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,990
The last thing you imagine if we do female
asking for a loan from be hot though,

236
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,880
uh,

237
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,190
which is going to be backed up by the way,
the guarantee is a, is an intimate, uh,

238
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,580
um, uh, uh, an inner garment
of Deucey nails. This is a very

239
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,650
elaborate, uh, underskirts of sorts.
It's going to be the guarantees. I mean,

240
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:40,540
these things are highly sexualized, but
donkey hot, the short two realities,

241
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,850
a g one six,
but he has only four left to give her.

242
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,680
Okay.

243
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,270
Uh,
this is a clear of his deep and repress.

244
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,780
Fear of sexual inadequacy.
Couldn't be clearer.

245
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,160
You don't have to be Freud.
Uh,

246
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,490
which may be the source of his heroic
fantasies is old feel sexually inadequate.

247
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,340
So he goes to imagine himself a young,

248
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:12,210
vigorous night who can go and
fight and seduce maintenance.

249
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,890
So Saint Joe's invention in the episode
of the enchanted we'll see now has dug

250
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,280
deep into donkey halters dreads and
into the source of his fantasies.

251
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,260
In this topsy turvy world of the cave,

252
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,860
there are eerie images of death.
Also,

253
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,810
I already mentioned the black birds
at the mouth of the cave dude Undark.

254
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,920
This cadaver posing as a statue on its
own sarcophagus is the areas of the mall

255
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:49,560
and the uncanny just it's,
it's an inversion.

256
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,600
The statue on a sarcophagus presumably
represents the body of the dead person

257
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,434
within it.

258
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,210
I'm sure you have been to
European cathedrals where
you go and you find all of

259
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:05,211
this sarcophagi guy and you'll see on
top the statue of the recumbent statue of

260
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,930
the person within it,
kings and all of that.

261
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,880
We're usually like this
with their hands like this,

262
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,700
and they have their swords
near the and all that.

263
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,010
I find that eerie enough to begin with.
But I'm in any case here, uh, the statue,

264
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,670
uh, uh, uh, here,

265
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,890
however the cadaver is the statue,

266
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,050
nature has replaced art or has become art.

267
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,040
Uh, you understand, instead
of having a representation,

268
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,550
you have literally the cadaver
on top of the sarcophagus.

269
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,510
But let us not forget that we are dealing
here with death and also in the realm

270
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:48,450
of temporality.
If you remember that dude on dark,

271
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:52,140
his heart was assaulted so
that he would not smell.

272
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,680
How can they cadaver replaced
the statue and not rot?

273
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,020
Like it's hard.

274
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,840
Art has been taken over by death
to this is what the intonation is.

275
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,760
Nothing, not even art is immune from
death. In this world of the cave,

276
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,490
there may be a pun,
a ghoulish pun and bedded here.

277
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,660
Sarcophagus comes from the Greek circles,

278
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,620
flesh and fog line to eat this,
our cover covetous,

279
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,870
literally eats flesh the flesh of
the dead body that it contains.

280
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,650
But here,

281
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,650
the dead body has escaped to become
its own statue is a very baroque image.

282
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,400
We will meet who will find a
another, a sarcophagus, uh,

283
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:43,530
that we will be discussing in the
course of the next few chapters.

284
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Now their stories and images Montesinos
cave highlight the central topic of part

285
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:55,390
two deaths in Ganja.
This in Ganja as we have seen,

286
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,670
can mean the destruction of all illusions.

287
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,890
Where Gnocchi haughty comes to
after emerging from the cave,

288
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,450
he declares in what is a classic
expression of, of this and Ganja,

289
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,660
and this is the quote for
give you friends. He tells,

290
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,850
he tells the scholar and central for
having brought me away from the most

291
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:23,251
pleasing and charming life on site
that ever mortal saw or lived in short.

292
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:29,851
I am now thoroughly satisfied that all
the enjoyments of this life pass away

293
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,630
like a shadow or a dream and fade
away like the flower of the field.

294
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,370
Oh, on happy Montesinos
all desperately wounded.

295
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,410
[inaudible] or unfortunate Belaroma oh,
weeping.

296
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:49,411
What the honor and the unlucky daughters
or Rivera whose water show what floods

297
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:53,740
of tears stream from your fair eyes.

298
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,580
He says a bit later, quote,
I awakened and found myself.

299
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:05,440
I knew not by what means in the midst
of the finest pleasant test and most

300
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:09,970
delightful meadow that nature could
create all of the most pregnant fancy

301
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:14,420
imagine unquote, this is the
locals Aminos of Renaissance, uh,

302
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,590
uh, pastoral literature that
I have mentioned before.

303
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,250
Remember the locals on
Menos into which, uh, uh,

304
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,910
Rocinante wonders and falls in love with
the mayors and all of that. Uh, it is,

305
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,940
it is a topic of renaissance literature
as the most pleasant of places.

306
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,430
And this is where he, where he lands
a person would be where he has,

307
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,640
uh, his, his dream, the same Gagnon was,

308
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:43,090
I've been saying means to peel
away the illusion that dilution.

309
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,340
It is a form of self analysis
of recognition comparable
to the one in today's

310
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:51,040
terms achieved through psychoanalysis.

311
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,320
Loki Quixote seems to have
dived into his own subconscious.

312
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,840
Is this a regresses at Ulta Room?

313
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,320
An atavistic returned to the
wound as a Latin way of saying it.

314
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,370
Return to the womb progress was Altarum
is an atavistic return to the womb.

315
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,480
I mean there's, uh, we're trying
to get back into the mother's room,

316
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,470
uh, uh, seeking solace and refuge.

317
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,310
A donkey. Houghton
descent, as we have seen,

318
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,190
makes him look harshly upon himself.

319
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,560
It does not completely shake his
beliefs or dispel his madness,

320
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:33,550
but it is a serious blow.
And from now on,

321
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:38,230
he will act saner.
How can it have been pressurable?

322
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:42,820
However,
only if one thinks that once in the cave,

323
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,100
he was at least in the living
presence of his fictions,

324
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,000
this was pleasurable and
that the disillusionment, uh,

325
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,640
became repressed as he experienced it.
When he met,

326
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,530
when he met all of these elements
that threatened his exists illusions,

327
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:00,190
we repress them immediately. And that, uh,

328
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,370
as we tend to repress on
unpleasant experiences, uh,

329
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,870
that he was not aware of,

330
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:10,871
we readers are that what he
experienced threatened his beliefs.

331
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,760
So when he comes, he comes back
with doubts but are not, uh,

332
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,050
conscious, uh, doubts. Now,

333
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:26,051
everything seems to converge in the
scene of the casinos gave Toki hottest

334
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:31,261
believe in the authenticity
of the romances of chivalry
and the reality of what

335
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:36,270
he sees when he sees windmills.
For instance, uh, uh, our,

336
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,113
our question,

337
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,570
the topics of courtly love of
the courtly love tradition,

338
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,020
which had filtered into the romances
of chivalry Tombow through literally

339
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:50,450
session by there being put through
the requirements of natural law.

340
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,190
I already alluded several times,
would undoubtedly salted heart.

341
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,890
The LERMA for her part may have looked
under the weather because she had her

342
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:05,780
menstrual period. No, not really.

343
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:09,260
It is explained because the
problem was that she is Menopausal,

344
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,803
uh,

345
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,080
real time and it's p and a and
withered periodic bodily functions.

346
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,200
A and aging and decay have crept into
the world of fiction contained in the

347
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:28,700
cave.
No harsher way to dispel the ideal.

348
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,760
The ideal is of a renaissance beauty
than to imagine her menstruating or going

349
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:37,880
through menopause. We need
that. She's already aged.

350
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,600
Imagine body cellies
venuses with those problems.

351
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,790
Is it girl task?

352
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,980
Uh, it, it's brilliant. However,

353
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,110
mmm.

354
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:59,120
To subject these idealizations
to temporality and
temporality here means that

355
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,240
their age or they software,
the menstrual period.

356
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,120
Why would do Sydney,
I need a loan.

357
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,520
He said that need or
necessity is everywhere.

358
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:15,150
It had been passing the world of magic.

359
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,410
You seem they did by needs and
physical laws and uh, and, and,

360
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,800
and what ensues are a grotesque images?

361
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,193
MMM,

362
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,590
no. The, there,

363
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,180
there are many literary antecedents
of the Cave of Montesinos episode.

364
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:34,580
And I have already mentioned homer,
Virgil and Dante.

365
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,180
But the originality of the happy salt
is not so much the descent into the cave

366
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,950
as that it reveals donkey halters
subconscious. This is Savannah.

367
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,830
This is way of showing us the night's
mind from within unencumbered,

368
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,670
by recent as such.
It is,

369
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,660
it seems to me a better device than the
soliloquy in Shakespeare or in Calderon,

370
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,020
which are parallel devices
to show what a character, uh,

371
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:09,021
what a character's thoughts are
to be or not to be and so forth.

372
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,770
And in called their own
imam, he settled. Let me the,

373
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,140
this is from the life is
a dream. Uh, also, uh,

374
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,830
it is also more modern,
unacceptable.

375
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,310
This device in Atlantis
to contemporary readers.

376
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:26,940
It seems to me because no one goes
around delivering soliloquies that are

377
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,350
perfectly structured.
Rhetorically. I don't. I have you,

378
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm sure you haven't heard any
of your friends going around, uh,

379
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,090
delivering soliloquies that
are so poetically well, uh,

380
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,323
will rot.

381
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,310
But telling a dream is a common activity.
Uh,

382
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,360
not only to Flaco analysts may
tell your dreams to your friends

383
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,011
in the episode.

384
00:27:56,011 --> 00:27:59,820
There is a group task combination
of fantasy and not just reality,

385
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:04,380
but the possible all having to
do with the decay of human flesh.

386
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,960
But as I have suggested,
isn't this also a tale of castration fear?

387
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,490
These are the repressed the
figures in donkey, this mind

388
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,090
Peter Dunn, who was a
very good, uh, Hispanic,

389
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,250
the Britain the British has punished who
taught for many years at the end of his

390
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,530
career at Wesleyan University nearby,

391
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,090
rolled the following in a very
good article on this episode.

392
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,093
Uh,

393
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,130
actually Peter Don wrote this article
in Spanish and I'm translating him into

394
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:38,064
English.

395
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,350
These are the Baroque in versions
that you can get in this course to.

396
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,850
This is what Peter Dunn said in
my own translation into English.

397
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,690
What is observed in the Cave of
Montesinos episode is Cook's autism.

398
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,750
From the insight he looks at himself in
the mirror of his madness who are comedy

399
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,760
and spectator merge and the enchanter
and the enchanted coalesce far from

400
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:09,330
offering us an image of eternity.

401
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,470
Montesinos his cave constitutes
a frozen temporality,

402
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,461
Loki hot.

403
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:19,461
They will have to return to his own
bed and dream the dream of death.

404
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,780
So alone Saki,

405
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,780
Hanno can awaken purged of his dreams
and ready to contemplate himself without

406
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:30,210
theater in the mirror of eternity.

407
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,530
This is anticipating the death
of our own SOC econo. Uh,

408
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,300
at the end of the book,

409
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,070
Anthony Cascara d an American Hispanic
links the episode to the dream argument

410
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:48,721
in the guard and make quite a few valuable
observations about don Quixote as a

411
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,834
whole,

412
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,980
particularly about the tire debate about
the relationship between reality and

413
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:57,370
fantasy.
He says,

414
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I see his engagement as with problems
of skepticism and epistemology and more

415
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:08,551
specifically with the use of fiction
as a mode of knowledge of the world.

416
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,980
His response to skepticism and two,

417
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:16,981
its compliment epistemology is to reject
the epistemology while remaining anti

418
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:17,920
skeptical.

419
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,980
But this is only another way of saying
that its purpose is to affirm the role of

420
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:27,340
fiction in our relationship to the world,
which it might further be said.

421
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:31,120
It's an affirmation of the role of
fiction in the task of philosophy.

422
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,090
Cervantes shows that
we relate to the world,

423
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:38,860
including the world of our own
experiences in ways other than what the

424
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:40,900
epistemologist called knowledge.

425
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,150
And that all we know of the world cannot
be characterized in terms of certainty.

426
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,500
So Vantis we'll do include the imagination
and dreams within the range of valid

427
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:56,080
human experience within what we call
the world in the broadest sense.

428
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,540
Free of the cabinets of recent points.

429
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:03,570
This up in short Cascara the tends
to be done to philosophical in short,

430
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,160
that stories,

431
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,910
that literature are a form of knowledge
on a method of approaching knowledge of

432
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:17,230
the world and of ourselves and a way
to understand both the worlds and the

433
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:19,870
workings of our own minds.
Now,

434
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,930
psychoanalysis knows this and this is
the reason why Freud availed himself of

435
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,760
figures like the Oedipus,

436
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,330
a myth to name mental processes and force
a Freud acknowledged that his sources,

437
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,830
uh, in the development and
invention or psychoanalysis, I see,

438
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,630
he was really the inventor of it were
literary on that he learned more from

439
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:47,680
literature than from the 19th
century science that preceded him.

440
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,770
So the point is that these stories in,

441
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:56,050
in Montesinos cave show that stories
are valid ways of approaching knowledge,

442
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,030
knowledge of the world,
and knowledge of our own minds.

443
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,200
And this is what this episode I
think suggests brilliantly, uh,

444
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,940
and, uh, independently. And also
of course within the structure,

445
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,000
within the structure of the, uh, uh,

446
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:17,480
of the novel so much for
the time being, uh, uh,

447
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,000
for the episode of what they've seen us
with cave a to which we will probably

448
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,990
have to allude a number
of times, uh, in the, uh,

449
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,280
in succeeding lectures.
And we move now to the second,

450
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,320
uh, important episode that
I want to discuss today.

451
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,130
And that is a master Peter's puppet show.

452
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,480
No, I uh, uh,

453
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,490
I have made a crude a drawing on the,
uh,

454
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,980
on the blackboard that will
help me, uh, explain, uh, the,

455
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:56,300
uh, uh, the episode. Uh, it is a sketchy,

456
00:32:56,301 --> 00:33:00,740
I understand it is more Picasso's
and Velasquez, let's put it that way.

457
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,810
Uh, but you can recognize
some of the figures that of
course, as soon as the bus,

458
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:09,290
I'm Auntie,
that is the speaker,

459
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,820
the boy who speaks about this don Quixote.
That is sanctuary.

460
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:18,090
And then the rest of the audience,
uh, on, of course the puppet show, uh,

461
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,510
as best as I could render it.

462
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,993
Now

463
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:30,030
the reappearance of [inaudible] to
establish a second creek continuitive with

464
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:33,810
part one
other than essential,

465
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,650
the women of Donkey Hilda's house,
the priest and the barber.

466
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:42,651
He nest is the only character for part
one from part one who comes back in part

467
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,123
two.

468
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:51,390
If before he ness was a rogue picaresque
author and [inaudible] remember,

469
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,160
uh, uh, material among the
author of Guzman. Farace.

470
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,450
Do you remember that? I said in
that episode of the Galley Slaves,

471
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:10,020
when he says he has written his life is,

472
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,080
is a matter of [inaudible] it before
he knows what a rogue picaresque author

473
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,133
[inaudible],

474
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,560
he is now a master Peter
and miniature playwright,

475
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,700
a Lopey the Vega in miniature,

476
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:30,890
remember Lopez [inaudible] enemy
and the great Spanish play right?

477
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,403
The period.

478
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,443
Okay.

479
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,700
As both a and Lopi,

480
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,780
he nest stands for the modern author who's
not an Aristocrat or a cleric and has

481
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:56,500
to earn a living from his craft.

482
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,510
Nope.
Like to put the,

483
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:05,220
the Vega and his last name to pretend
that he was aristocratic and he made up

484
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:09,840
fables about his family and all
of that. But uh, he was not,

485
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,503
uh,

486
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,830
he nest also stands for
him for Cervantes himself.

487
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,340
And the whole episode is like a laboratory
for fiction who carry out experiments

488
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:29,710
about fiction. I said, run. This
tends to do when we have seen he,

489
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,880
Nancy's Wiley,

490
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,420
does not represent respect
literary tradition or rules
and shows the limitations

491
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,560
imposed by the medium of literature.

492
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,730
Like the imagine friend
of the 1605 prologue.

493
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,030
Remember the imagined friend whom said,
Avantis says,

494
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:51,120
comes to visit him and helps
him write the prologue.

495
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,590
Please.
Modern author does not have a confession,

496
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,670
a conventional or deep classical
education and has to rely on Compendia and

497
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:07,290
books are familiar quotations
for his area district. Uh,

498
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,410
Lopa was known for this,
for,

499
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,360
to get his information here and there
and pretend that he had read a lot.

500
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,400
He read a lot, but, uh,

501
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,820
not in the way that humanists had read
a great deal and he made it up the way

502
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:28,590
that the,
the friend tells of in the prologue.

503
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,640
We just go and get this book and Darren
then just make a list of sources in

504
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:37,620
alphabetical order. And that's, that's the
way, uh, these modern authors upbringing

505
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,730
now he, Naz has now one I
covered, this is why I have,

506
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,190
well actually I have the
wrong, I covered. Um,

507
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,870
it's supposed to be the left eye that
is covered. So to be true to him,

508
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,000
who we uncovered is I uncover these are

509
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,443
the left die.

510
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,770
He has one cover,

511
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:07,771
presumably the one that pulled in when
he and made him cross out because he

512
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:16,131
knows that this is a distinctive trait
that is dangerous for him to display.

513
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,600
He can be spotted, described and
nabbed by the Holly Brotherhood.

514
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,460
So he has to disguise himself.

515
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:27,960
He's why he has to cover his sort of
his signature, his body signature,

516
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:31,950
which is that he's crossed eyed,
like having a prominent scar or something.

517
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,510
Remember the description
of him Quixote that the uh,

518
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,760
the trooper reads or when
he's about to arrest him. Uh,

519
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,370
towards the end of Clark one, he has a
description, so I description of he ness.

520
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,540
We'll probably begin by saying he is
crossed height. So he has to cover that.

521
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:53,520
I uh, to be, uh, to be safe.

522
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,210
He,
he nest is a fugitive from justice.

523
00:37:57,211 --> 00:38:02,130
Remember he is one of the Galley
slaves that Don Quixote set free.

524
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,870
Uh,

525
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:08,850
so whatever other crimes he committed
to make him be a guy in his life.

526
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,530
He is also, he has also escaped. Hence,

527
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,260
I quote,
I had forgot to tell you,

528
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,500
this is from the book that this same
master Peter had his left eye and almost

529
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,980
half his cheek covered with a patch
of green. Tough ETA is signed,

530
00:38:25,981 --> 00:38:28,950
that something else,
all that side of his face.

531
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,550
That's from the text of the key hot
day but being one eyed as it were,

532
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,320
even if it is faked suggests
fresh restrictions that
impeach or his art because

533
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,360
of his limited perception of reality.

534
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,480
I am sort of glossing over it.

535
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,740
My article in the case book that
you have read presumably by now

536
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,460
this deformity also
makes him look furtive.

537
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,571
Dangerous,

538
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:03,571
sneaky and of course
aesthetically interesting like
the characters in part one

539
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,410
and those in Belasco his paintings,
he is no

540
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,360
renaissance idealized
model of a man or low,

541
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:17,260
it is said several times that he's
a Galanta and good looking man,

542
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,430
but he's cross light.

543
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,600
Yeah,

544
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,190
but being uh, yeah, uh, before he,

545
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:29,480
before he nets converging site access,
distorted reality,

546
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,660
we have gone over this now he lacks depth
perception which is very suggestive to

547
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,300
the show that he will stage at the end.

548
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:39,950
Okay.

549
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,230
Ironically, by eliminating one eye, he,

550
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:46,100
Nancy's overcoming the problem
of non converging sidelines.

551
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,270
It is a radical way of doing so,
but now he lacks a perspective.

552
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:54,800
Remember that the binocular,
bye [inaudible], sorry.

553
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,610
By O'Connor a site
you'll see with two eyes.

554
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,700
Therefore you have the
potentially a double vision.

555
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,890
And they are because of this,

556
00:40:03,891 --> 00:40:08,891
they are in some cultures
a dts that overcome this.

557
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:10,580
By having a PDL I,

558
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:15,260
which is an I in the middle of the
forehead that sort of serves to mediate

559
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,910
between this, uh, this, uh, uh, so,

560
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,100
uh,
in the case of Jimenez,

561
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:27,220
he is by eliminating this eye to have
only one eye and therefore only one

562
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:33,380
vision. Uh, whereas before,

563
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:39,230
as a cross eyed, he's, he's,
he's, uh, access, did not meet,

564
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,180
uh,
uh,

565
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,260
there was supposed to meet here but they
don't quite meet and therefore he, he,

566
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,160
he saw it in a distorted way. But now
with only one eye, as we know, he loves,

567
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:54,140
he loses, uh, uh, depth. Now,

568
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:59,170
the whole episode of the Puppet Theater
is besides yet another critique of Lopa

569
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,343
the Vega,

570
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,400
a protractor experiment on all of my
nieces like that of the Princess Mikami

571
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,780
corner. And not just in literary terms,
they're also in, in pictorial terms,

572
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,500
but as a critique of Lopez said,
run this again,

573
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,420
harps upon the carelessness with which
Lopei use history to write his place.

574
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,950
Remember the episode with a Canon
of Tolo where there was a protractor

575
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:29,900
discussion and critique of low pay
for just grabbing historical elements,

576
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:32,870
pell mell without being very faithful to,
uh,

577
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,610
history when donkey hot
protests in the middle of the,

578
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,820
of the show that it is wrong to have more
ringing bells instead of kettle drums.

579
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,740
Master Peter Answers with
what contemporaries were.

580
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:53,480
Contemporaries were sure. Surely not
to miss an allusion to Lopez away.

581
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,750
It says Senjada Donkey Hartej says,
uh,

582
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,630
he nest it. But someone
from within the, uh,

583
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:08,740
the public theater do not criticize
upon trifles nor expect that perfection,

584
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,430
which is not B to be
found in these matters.

585
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:18,320
Are there not a thousand comedies
acting almost everywhere full of us,

586
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:20,330
many improprieties and blunders.

587
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:25,331
And yet they run their career with great
success and are listened to not only

588
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:30,320
with applause but with admiration.
Gabori and let folks talk.

589
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,720
He thought he's now addressing the boy.

590
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,880
Go on boy and let folks
talk for soy filling my bag.

591
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:42,470
I can note if rep, if I represent more
improprieties than there are in the sun.

592
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,180
Now this is clear and I'll loosen it.
A little bit of us could be made.

593
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:50,900
I remember that [inaudible]
May, uh, as I mentioned before,

594
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,760
may have been a follower and a
defender of Lobelia. And again,

595
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,540
this is why he wrote his,
his uh,

596
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,460
in his bro look such
insulting comments about this.

597
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,480
Now I said laboratory of my meets just
they show that mindset better and he's

598
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:10,100
assistant put on is of a conceptual
complicity worthy. They'll ask us,

599
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:13,490
have left Meninas under spinners,

600
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,280
which you'll have seen here to begin with.

601
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:21,340
We have the performance of the puppets
is not enough in itself and that mastered

602
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:27,511
Pieter's figures and props require a
supplemental oral commentary or narrative

603
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:32,180
executed by his assistant.
This is the assistant,

604
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,320
I put a little balloon here as in comic
books because this is what he's saying.

605
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,420
First you feel me? I'll be allowed to
use his convention from, uh, from comics.

606
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,970
So he needs the supplemental
narrative by the, uh, uh,

607
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,950
through her man. What's
the word? The period. Um,

608
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,140
but the visual and verbal representations
do not harmonize properly on both

609
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:01,340
donkey Horton, he ness how
to admonish the boy, uh,

610
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,310
who is the authors
supplementary voice over,

611
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,760
he's like a voice over in the film,
but it is the seeds,

612
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:12,470
the voiceover and the film
images didn't quite niche.

613
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:17,150
It is a dual performance of the
author's invention that is the author of

614
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:21,650
invention, which is, he knows
here is manifested in two ways,

615
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,533
um,

616
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,250
which has manifested visually
and orally at the same time,

617
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,680
hoping that they will
compliment each other,

618
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,340
but they do not measure satisfactorily.
Uh,

619
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,500
see if there were an inherent flaw in
the recital that reflects the awkwardness

620
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,240
of the theatrical routine. Very awkward
to represent the stories with this,

621
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,980
uh, material objects that are
ribbons that represent human beings.

622
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,730
So what we have here is a very flawed
combination of the oral and the visual

623
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:59,940
trying to combine to produce, uh, uh,

624
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,630
a performance is satisfactory
performance to, to,

625
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,650
to to produce me Macy's representation
and it you say critique of me,

626
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:10,530
basis and representation.
This is what I'm trying to say.

627
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,530
Don't hottest corrections to the boy.

628
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:18,531
Correction to the boy is significantly
made in the language of geometry as

629
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:23,550
applied to painting.
Doki holders is here,

630
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:25,500
Gnocchi hotel said in a loud voice boy,

631
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:30,080
boy on with your story in a
straight line and leave your curves.

632
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:32,280
I'm trans versales for Tacoma.

633
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,920
The truth of a fact there is often
need of proof upon proof. Oh cool.

634
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:43,690
What could seem like a mirror rhetorical
display on the part of the night is on

635
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:48,691
the contrary of surprising propriety in
the context of the episode because the

636
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:52,900
whole effect of the puppet
show depends on a visual tone.

637
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,570
Palais lay, yeah. Is a French
expression for the trick. Trump la,

638
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,320
you use it in English.
[inaudible] is a word,

639
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,270
an old word in Spanish
it's the same thing.

640
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,500
[inaudible] we don't use
it anymore in Spanish.

641
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,190
If the French word most of the time,
uh,

642
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,540
but it's based on the visual compilation
or a visual trick based on perspective.

643
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,220
Exactly the way that a
painting is organized according
to geometrical rules and

644
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:23,550
produce the effect of mass and depth.

645
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,833
Okay.

646
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:31,090
I hope you follow this. You're magical
rules. In the painting we've talked about,

647
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,690
uh, the, the book by Alberti, uh,

648
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,230
produce the effect of mass and,

649
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,100
and depth by distance.
Master Peter Himself,

650
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,300
by the way,

651
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:48,610
agrees with Don Quixote and his
admonition to the boy also appeals to the

652
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:53,500
language of geometry and painting.
Boy, none of your flourishes,

653
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,090
but do what you're gentle.

654
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,980
The gentleman bitch you for that is the
surest way flourishes is DBU host or

655
00:46:59,981 --> 00:47:04,060
drawings in the original Loki Houghton,
he needs his word.

656
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,870
Where does it say more than they know
a common occurrence instead of one.

657
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,690
As we have seen many times,

658
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,620
the puppet shows effect.

659
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:19,650
It's very similitude is
based on a question of
proportions and perspective and

660
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:25,000
has a great deal to do with a straight
line that don Quixote demands that the

661
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,750
boy not radar follow with
or without much success.

662
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,160
It's a metaphor of to apply
straight line to how a story unfolds

663
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,310
and narrative unfolds. Uh, uh,

664
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,830
the narrative straight line and the
straight line that can be drawn from the

665
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:48,750
spectators to the show are related,
but it's,

666
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,450
this is the straight
line that the spectators,

667
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,340
uh, from the spectators to
the show as they look at it.

668
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,600
And I'm relating that to the straight
line in the story that Don Quixote refers

669
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:04,510
to when he admonishes the boy,

670
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,510
if the spectators looked directly at
the theater to engage in it's fantasy,

671
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,820
they have to disregard that are such
a short distance. Human figures,

672
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:20,821
horses and buildings should appear so
small as if they were much further away.

673
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,310
Perspective has to be
assumed and it's, uh, uh,

674
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:28,890
uh,
uh,

675
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,730
as if different geometric relations
between the public and the tiny actors

676
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:35,420
obtained as if,

677
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,470
as if the geometric physical relations
between the spectators on the show where

678
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,560
we're different than they
are because they're so close.

679
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:51,030
The narrator goes through curves and
transverse souls as [inaudible] calls them

680
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:57,661
to achieve the illusion of simultaneous
action taking place and to hold the

681
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:03,931
spectators attention and approval in the
same way that the theater has to abuse

682
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:08,360
the rules of geometry to
stage the action abusive,

683
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,440
the rules of geometry to stage the action
in what is presumably a lot greater

684
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,730
territory, but it is compressed
on the stage. Uh, and,

685
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,390
and the proportion between the
various elements about the various,

686
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,600
the actors on the horses and all of
that is cost. They're not follow,

687
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,590
he knows cannot vary the figures,

688
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:33,160
dimensions as they come closer
or further away from the public.

689
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,640
They are the dimensions are it
given that cannot be changed.

690
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:41,860
These whole ensemble of virtual lines
like those in Velasquez is painting,

691
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,570
hold up the fiction and it's preps at
the same time in front of the audience,

692
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:48,470
the audience,
your hindsight where both of the fixture,

693
00:49:48,471 --> 00:49:52,840
I didn't have the props that are there
to make up the fiction is what I'm trying

694
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:53,430
to say.
[inaudible]

695
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:58,430
Velasquez paintings to sustain the
illusion that narrate or not only avails

696
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:02,950
himself figuratively of the,
of the geometric figures,

697
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,400
but also of the rhetoric of vicious
repeating the Anaphora like a sun.

698
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,010
Anaphora is a rhetorical figure when

699
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,020
you repeated work or a turnoff race.

700
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Let us not forget that the letters not
for good as an owner or rater will repeat

701
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:26,020
something like that.
That is an Anaphora.

702
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:32,000
And here the, the the language of
visions in medieval literature.

703
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:36,380
Use this figure and the
boy says, pray, observe,

704
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,430
see him. Now turn your
eyes door. Now behold,

705
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,110
did you not see behold,

706
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:47,250
now observe that what he's really telling
them we all have these reputations is

707
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,850
but don't actually see, but don't
actually see what is really happening.

708
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,860
Overlook it. To be able to, uh,

709
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,230
accept the fiction within
the very illusion of a show.

710
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:05,120
We have a kind of mirror duplication of
the problem of perspective and vanishing

711
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:05,481
point.

712
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:09,980
Remember that I talked about vanishing
point in Las Meninas about that gentleman

713
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:13,790
who's at the very end who is
literally leaving and vanishing.

714
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:18,410
So that would seem to be a pawn. There it,

715
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,740
this becomes a literal,
when, uh, uh, mainly Sandra,

716
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:26,741
I'm Dongo Pharaohs who I on the same
horse and gallop desperately running away

717
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:29,810
from the Moore's doors.
La Linea,

718
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:34,340
the Franzia towards the line dividing
France from Spain, the border.

719
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,560
So if they are in the horse here, they're
moving towards the back of the stage.

720
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,100
Doors are vanishing point.
So this is literalized here,

721
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:47,570
the vanishing point in the fiction
that is being depicted in the story.

722
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,293
Okay?

723
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,870
Now all these tricks managed to
confuse Gnocchi hotel of course,

724
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,500
who predictably lunges tours the action
to participate in it caught in a net of

725
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:06,070
rhetorical under your magical
figures that have blinded him,

726
00:52:06,071 --> 00:52:10,760
not letting him see the difference in
size between his own body and those of his

727
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:11,450
enemies.

728
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,450
He has lost the sense of proportion and
this is what encourages him other than

729
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:24,200
his madness, of course, to participate
in the action. This is, by the way,

730
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:29,120
this scene of Don Quixote, uh, launching
onto this, onto the, onto the, uh,

731
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,860
the stage is one is the one
that Orson Welles used in his,

732
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,590
attempted a film on Becky Haughty.

733
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,590
Orson Welles never finished his Quixote,

734
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,690
but there are parts that he filmed and uh,

735
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,420
I spoke about them in a symposium on
nursing wards here a couple of years ago.

736
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,930
Um, got to see some of them. And
this is one of them. And what he has,

737
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:55,940
the scene takes place in a movie,
a movie that has been shown.

738
00:52:55,941 --> 00:53:00,830
Our doors actually declined from the
stage and flashes of the screen, uh,

739
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,140
in this, uh, in this, uh, modern
adaptation of this famous scene.

740
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,540
I think that's a rant. This, uh,

741
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:12,580
project himself in Hyannis Master Peter
as author of modern fictions as he had

742
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:16,790
already done in the galley
slaves episode in part one.

743
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,210
Do not overlook that.

744
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:25,200
Cervantes was also a main like, uh, uh,

745
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:29,670
um, he missed his, a
cross EIT and Cervantes,

746
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,160
as you remember,
had a

747
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,610
leash on his left arm that he could use.
He Nas mattered.

748
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:41,620
Peter is struggling with the hardships
of authorship as it were by adjusting his

749
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:45,300
ability to perceive reality,
hence to represent it,

750
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,820
making himself one I'd mastered.

751
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:51,600
Peter Manages to prevent the problems
created by his gross eyedness.

752
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,440
Remember that with two eyes,
let alone their being cost.

753
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,410
There are two visions which
may or may not coincide,

754
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,190
but we certainly will not if he's
crossed eyed. We have gone over this.

755
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,720
This is the cost of,

756
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:07,950
is not being able to foresee and ending
to his autobiography. Remember he says,

757
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:11,820
how can my but autobiography we finished
in my life is not. You could see,

758
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:15,530
you could project that as, as,
as a problem of vision to if,

759
00:54:15,531 --> 00:54:20,531
if autobiography goes this way and life
that way and you have a vision that

760
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:25,560
doesn't allow for a, uh, um,
a coincidence of the two,

761
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,970
uh, that, uh, infinitely receding, uh,

762
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,320
end of the, of the, of
the fiction or infinity,

763
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,170
the end of his life could be seen
as part of his, uh, uh, problems,

764
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,740
uh, problems with his eyes. Um,

765
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,890
uh, with only one eye.
However, master Peter,

766
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,610
Peter would be able to look straight
through only one visual axis.

767
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:56,070
But this is not a happy solution either
to compensate for his loss of one half

768
00:54:56,071 --> 00:55:00,630
of the visual field. He
must look sideways. If he,

769
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,940
if he has his eyes covered, he has
to look sideways to skew in his head.

770
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:10,230
They cannot achieve a harmonious vision
and he makes himself more awkward.

771
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,830
And uh, an interesting, uh,

772
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:18,540
Hennessy cannot represent reality
properly with only one eye master.

773
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:23,790
Peter cannot create a perspective that
would correspond to reason to follow our

774
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:28,230
Burtis treaties.
In on painting that I mentioned,

775
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,830
he's reading of literary tradition. He's
also a skew like the tilt of his head.

776
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,420
We also know that with only one eye he
would also news his depth perception,

777
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,930
which will disasters. They affect
his capacity to create perspective.

778
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,820
He's rewriting of the municipality Cindra
and Gay Pharaoh stories fraught with

779
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:51,960
errors like Lopa the Vegas place,
which Don Quixote tries to correct us.

780
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,200
We sold only that ideal reader alone.

781
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:59,400
So who instead of writing
romances of chivalry,

782
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,870
tried to act one out,

783
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,820
can see straight in the lucid nights of
his library and perceive fixtures that

784
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:10,800
are harmonious and very similar
within themselves and to himself.

785
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,050
Donkey halting the darkness of one
pal is in, by slashing the Wineskins,

786
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,670
makes the various fictional
levels converged and resolve
the conflicting stories.

787
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:26,590
It is the ability to fuse all those non
converging levels of fiction that makes

788
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:27,290
it Ranta switch.

789
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:32,290
A great modern author who's fictions will
not destroy themselves from within as

790
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:35,890
he Nessus does here.
Cervantes is a,

791
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:41,100
is a happy cross eyedness because
the various lines do not feel in his

792
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:45,370
imaginative world yet
here in some way to him,

793
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,550
the origin of vision is always already
a double vision with irony being

794
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,980
congenital to it with
representation depending on it.

795
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,110
I like to see this whole
episode of Master, uh,

796
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,720
Peters puppet show as an allegory of the
whole of the Quixote which surrounded

797
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:10,330
the author hidden, uh, inside there.

798
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,880
Um,
uh,

799
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,750
but outside it's fiction which he
controls through strings with the voice

800
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:19,600
projected by an agent,
a CD.

801
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:24,040
I met Dave Haley or his translators
whom we cannot quite control either.

802
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,420
The story itself like that of merely
Sandra and guy pharaohs is drawn from

803
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:33,400
literary tradition but distorted and
rearranged as needed. And the public. We,

804
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,180
the readers drawn into this fiction
are drawn into this friction but not

805
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:41,440
completely aware as we are of the
artifice of the whole construct.

806
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,060
I am moved,
uh,

807
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,950
romantic that I am we Cervantes
identification with Inez,

808
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,420
the fugitive from justice roaming through
Spain's struggling to make a living

809
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:55,510
with this facts,
fiction making contraption.

810
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:01,860
Now Cervantes wraps up this take on
modern literature and his labors in the

811
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:06,820
brilliant scene that closest the
episode of master beater's puppet show,

812
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,720
the one in which aided by
central on the innkeeper,

813
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:14,920
Don Quixote compensates the puppeteer
for the figurines that he has smashed.

814
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,820
The value of which broken piece depends
on his or her relative importance in the

815
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:21,724
fiction,

816
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:26,140
not on its material value based
on the stuff of which it is made.

817
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,670
Plus the workmanship.

818
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,020
Charlemagne is worth a great deal
because of who he is in this story.

819
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:36,610
For instance, the real and the fictional
worlds cut through each other here.

820
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:41,470
Real money is being paid
in restitution for damages,

821
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:46,150
but the amount of the compensation
is figured on fictional values.

822
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,140
You understand what I mean?

823
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,730
I mean a slave or a or a
peasant or a servant would not.

824
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,380
A figure in even if it's beautiful and
big would not cost as much as that of the

825
00:58:56,381 --> 00:59:01,360
king. What's Advantis seems to be
underlining here is the value of fictional

826
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:04,360
characters as creations by their author.

827
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:09,250
How much would I don't Quixote or
essential be worth to Cervantes how much a

828
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:10,510
hamlet to Shakespeare,

829
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:15,760
how much would it take to compensate
Garcia Marquez for Colonel Aureliano when

830
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:20,710
Dhea or [inaudible] for a Pierre Menard,
these are fictional entities,

831
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:26,380
but now they have a real monetary
value in a world in which literature is

832
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:30,980
becoming a commodity without
ceasing to be at the same time,

833
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:35,981
one of the great expressions of the human
spirit that this scene is reminiscent

834
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,440
of the one in part one we're a torsion
when restitutions are made to the barber

835
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:43,731
who's based in,

836
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:48,731
has been taken to the innkeeper for
expenses and damages and marriage vows are

837
00:59:50,051 --> 00:59:53,830
exchange to make up for Fernando's
this honest behavior toward the repair.

838
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,910
It is a miniaturised
scene of restitutions,

839
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,100
a small scale repetition of
that scene in part one to me,

840
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:08,741
it is as if Savannah Savannah's we're
boasting or how many ways you can rewrite

841
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,760
rewrite episodes in part two and he is
certainly a master puppeteer himself.
