1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,030
There are three issues that
I want to bring up. Uh,

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,110
as I begin today's lecture that will
determine my general themes today,

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,400
improvisation,

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,090
the international dimension that the
fiction of the novel acquirers and the

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,090
influence of art or,
or of literature on reality.

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,790
Those are the general topics
as,

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,730
as we move to the
conclusion of the Quixote,

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,390
the issue of how to bring the novel to
a close most have loomed large in serve

9
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,840
anthesis mind.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,550
The plot of a novel is repetitive more
than sequential with the vague quest of

11
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:53,721
the protagonist to revive the age of
chivalry and concretely to participate in

12
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:58,470
the joust and said,
I've also as goals, uh,

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,460
but there is no obvious or impending goal.

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,590
Uh, do the character's wonderings. Uh,

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,290
although one could argue with Williamson,

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,530
the critic I mentioned in the last
lecture that the disenchantment of Deucey

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Neha is the main purpose of Don Quixote
and essential set by Merlin's prophecy

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,840
and involving the 30,000 lashes that
sanctuary most applied to his bottom.

19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,950
And the interplay between the two about
accomplishing that goal of is enchanting

20
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,360
Lucinia.
Uh,

21
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,870
yet even this is no clear mission,

22
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,750
who's accomplishment would
bring the novel to an end.

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,520
Uh,
why did Gutierrez disenchanted?

24
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,730
How could she be disenchanted?
What would that mean?

25
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,850
Would she ended donkey healthy then Mary,

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,910
this is not mentioned by the
protagonist nor his marriage.

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,000
Normally a desired end to courtly love.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,390
Love itself is the,

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,710
is the purpose of Courtney
love the love of Luff. Um,

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,500
it is overused that the only and the
possible would be the death of Don Quixote

31
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,750
making his life the shape of the
fiction though which life would be the

32
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,310
question? Is it the life
of our loan Suki high? No,

33
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,350
the Bidalgo who went mad
and became donkey haughty,

34
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,730
but about his early life and family.
We know next to nothing.

35
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,140
We only know about his knees.

36
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,800
Then later we learned that the
niece was the daughter of a sister,

37
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,710
but we really don't know
anything about his life or easy.

38
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,600
The life invented, uh, by donkey haughty.

39
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,860
The would be night errand.
Uh,

40
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,180
would that be the life that comes
to an end to close the novel?

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,233
Yeah.

42
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,080
Improvisation. I have been
saying all along since two room,

43
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:21,081
the plot of the Quixote serendipitous
actions provoked by chancing counters on

44
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:26,811
the road and by characters who pop up
in the second part wanting to script the

45
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:32,250
knights life or it meets at
least episodes of the night life.

46
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,830
What role will improvisation
play in the ending of the novel

47
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,160
then you said confluence. Oh, we will.

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,520
We will be talking about that or we'll
be seeing about that in the next few

49
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:50,590
lectures on us.
We come to the very end of the novel and,

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,640
and discuss that there is a confluence
of actual geography with current

51
00:03:56,401 --> 00:04:00,400
historical events. Uh, flip,

52
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,660
just the expulsion of the Maurice Course,

53
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,210
bringing in Catalonia and the Turkish
and Huguenots ministers in the final

54
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:13,980
episodes of the Quixote.
These events,

55
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,300
the returners us to the beginning of part
two and the discussions of donkey hot,

56
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,410
a ducky hope.
This house about some of them,

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,500
particularly the Turkish threat.

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Okay.

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,220
This is a form of, of closure
to this return to those, uh,

60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
discussions at the beginning of part two.

61
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,560
The novel acquires an international
dimension announced by Don Quixote.

62
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,570
The priests don't Sandstone Carrasco
talking about the Turkish threat in the

63
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:49,140
early chapters.
I see Don Quixote.

64
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:52,680
We're going after all to
try to resolve that issue.

65
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,200
But notice the concurrence of
real geographical settings.

66
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,290
We spoke of the Ebro River and now we
have Barcelona with historical actions.

67
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:09,790
We have, uh, uh, today,
uh, Elena apple juice.

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,970
And I produced the

69
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,830
slightly primitive map of, uh, of Spain.

70
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,900
But I think that it is clear enough to
give you a notion of what I'm talking

71
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:22,620
about.

72
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,600
But of course you have a real map of
Spain in the website that you can,

73
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,720
uh, you can see on your own. Um,

74
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,660
I wouldn't be a alluding to it.
Uh,

75
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,000
so we have seen the able to
river Barcelona we have now,

76
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,030
uh, and we now we'll see
historical actions, uh, involving,

77
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,770
uh, that region. Um,

78
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,230
now the,

79
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,020
none of the historical actuals that,
uh,

80
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,140
appear in the hotel.
By historical,

81
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,480
I mean current historical events.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,020
Okay.

83
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,660
None is more current and pressing

84
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,920
than the expulsion of the Maurice goes,

85
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,270
which is taking place as sort of amp.
This is writing

86
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,980
part two.

87
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,620
The topic of the expulsion centers on the
character of early [inaudible] day and

88
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,454
his family,

89
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,750
he is one of the principal new characters,

90
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,940
uh, in part to the international
dimension of the novel,

91
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,920
allows Advantis to introduce fresh carrots
of characters who are different from

92
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:47,921
those mainly Castilian ones that he
has presented so far though as we know.

93
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,610
And I'll talk about it again,
not exclusively Castilian

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,530
that's the second of the broad topics.

95
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:02,180
And the third is the one
about art influence reality.

96
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,660
In several of the of these
episodes that I will be discussing,

97
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,880
particularly the one involving
two fellows, but also in others,

98
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,530
there seems to be at decided influence
of art on reality and a coalescence of

99
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:20,531
the two by which one could
say that reality or the real
is improved by art as we

100
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:26,690
have already seen in other episodes
before. But we'd have some, uh,

101
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,890
today or where that seems
to be, uh, the main topic.

102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,433
Yeah.

103
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,400
Now, uh, let us begin with ricotta.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,890
Uh,

105
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,080
one could say that this
story is a rewriting of the
captives tail from part one

106
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,620
with a ricotta whose name is Anna Feliks.

107
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,160
That'd be talking about
his name and let me know,

108
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,430
recalled the name given to his daughter.

109
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,320
Her name is Anna.

110
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,260
She will be the Aida of this
rewriting and Pedro Gregorio.

111
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,210
Her suitor would be the captive.

112
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,690
But I mean this is,

113
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,223
well these are,

114
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,820
these two episodes are very
different at the same time,

115
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,060
the one of the captive and the
one involving, he caught it,

116
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,690
or at least the record,

117
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,930
the episode is much richer in some
respects under the captives episode is,

118
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,680
it's quite elaborate

119
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,060
in these last few chapters of the Quixote.

120
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,810
Cervantes appears to be offering many
possible variations of narrative fiction

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,720
or some of the narrative,
uh,

122
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,270
modes available to him at that moment.

123
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,583
Uh,

124
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,170
did he go and his family provides the
opportunity for Emini Novella Morris or

125
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,580
more mortgage novel

126
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,780
and Noella Mariska is a
tale about the love of a,

127
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,760
between a Christian Young
man and a morrish young woman
with all the predictable

128
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,090
obstacles.
The best known of these,

129
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:51,830
the whalers Maurice because is called
after its prototype. Prototype.

130
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,760
Dentists' mean?

131
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,390
Uh Huh.

132
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,080
And this novel is embedded in
Degooseman Guzman. They'll farace.

133
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,360
I won't put the name on the board
because you've heard it many,

134
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,720
many times during the semester.
The,

135
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:16,810
all the other fictional mode in this,

136
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:21,811
a kind of smorgasbord of narratives
is the Byzantine Romance,

137
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,340
the Byzantine Romance,

138
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,450
which entailed drawn out adventures
over vast geographical areas,

139
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,330
adventures of lovers seeking to
find each other and suffering.

140
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:45,331
Abductions chipped rex and being lost
in strange lands only to find when they

141
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:50,050
finally meet that unbeknownst to them,
unbeknownst to them,

142
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,150
they are brother and sister
and cannot marry. This is a,

143
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,800
it's a kind of, uh, Ma, uh, of
romance Britain at the time.

144
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,690
A very convoluted,
hence Byzantine.

145
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,120
Uh,

146
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,440
now Cervantes was writing such a romance
as he raised to finish the Quixote.

147
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,160
It's called law.
Strava hosts see lists.

148
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,190
He see his moon though the trials of
pedasil lists and see he's Mukunda.

149
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,523
Okay.

150
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,960
We will be revisiting this when we
talk about the prologue to that work.

151
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,280
Uh, which are Avantis thought would be the
culmination of his life, of his career,

152
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
but he was, he was wrong. Uh,

153
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,000
a very interesting idea that I,

154
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,850
if criticism has taken it up would be
to study the influence of the writing of

155
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:02,620
the trials of Perseus and see his
Miranda on part two of the Quixote.

156
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,750
As these were books that
[inaudible] worked on all
the same time towards the end

157
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:08,584
of his life,

158
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,870
he's rushing to finish the Quixote and
rushing to also finish the trials of

159
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,890
[inaudible]. And it will be interesting
to see how much one influences the other.

160
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,060
But here I said, we mentioned
it a little bit. Uh, he,

161
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,530
they influence is,
is obvious.

162
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,620
Ana and Pedro's abduction by the Turks
and their c journey and rescue are like a

163
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:36,871
small scale Byzantine romance that
is played out in front of the port of

164
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:40,570
Barcelona. This is like a
Byzantine romance in a nutshell.

165
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,910
They are abducted by the
Turks. They're going away, uh,

166
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,330
they finally meet and uh,
there is no ending to it. Uh,

167
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,800
uh, because you said Maurice God, she
cannot come back to Spain and all of that.

168
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,700
But that is a kind of a
little Byzantine Romance. He,

169
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:02,290
Larry US tidbit, if you have
already read this in this story,

170
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:07,291
is that Anna eager to protect pedal
from their abductors and Pedro is a very

171
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,960
beautiful young man,

172
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,380
dresses him as a woman to make
him less attractive to the Turkish

173
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,000
copters.

174
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,450
It is a comic dig at the
Turks whose alleged sexual
proclivities we're notorious

175
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,630
and are even mentioned in good
old [inaudible] is Tesoro.

176
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,740
In the entry on the Turks there is a
not so veiled allusion to this very

177
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:50,090
practice. Dot. Cervantes
is alluding to in a very,

178
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,700
uh,
I think comical way.

179
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,340
It is kind of a transvestite.

180
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,260
It isn't to the second power or
something like that to somebody.

181
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Why Advantis wanted to provide this
smorgasbord of narrative possibilities at

182
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:15,450
the end is a mystery to me.
One answer is that,

183
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,020
uh,

184
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,020
other than just a boast of artistic
mastery is that he's consciously seeking

185
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:26,271
variety in his work and he is aware and
has been since part one that for all the

186
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:33,480
possibilities of his newly found hero
donkey hold this adventures good,

187
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:38,481
become monotonous and decided to include
this technical extravagant extravaganza

188
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:40,500
as a kind of overture or something.

189
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,490
This accumulation of narratives is also
a sort of a closure by accumulation,

190
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:50,240
what could say. But, uh,

191
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,820
US get back to recording first,
let us consider the name.

192
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,363
Click coating.

193
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,830
Grieco means rich in Spanish being rich.
Rico

194
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,530
can be all day.

195
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,313
Okay.

196
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,970
Is that now we've been tative Indian
ending that increases something.

197
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:21,430
Remember that I mentioned this
at the beginning of the course.

198
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,783
Okay.

199
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,510
goto.is a big fat. So no,

200
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,300
uh, so Ricotti is, uh,

201
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,360
me and said he's very
rich, which, which he is

202
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,780
though some claim.

203
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:46,040
Some critics claimed that hidden names
derives from his being from the value of

204
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,070
Ricotta Evalyn [inaudible] name.
But I, I don't buy that. That is,

205
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:53,860
I think a little bit, uh, to uh, Ooh,

206
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,870
tangential. It's obvious that he's
recorded because he's very rich and, uh,

207
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,090
we know that about that because he talks
about the treasure that he has buried,

208
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,220
um,

209
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,250
now was really caught the Cervantes
passes judgment on a current event,

210
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,150
one that is taking place as
he writes the book there.

211
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,790
Maurice costs where it's spelled in 1609,

212
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,680
it's bullshit.

213
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,310
Well, the whole process lasted
several years. So remember,

214
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,620
these are the years when he is writing
this book. If you read your Elliot,

215
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,650
you will know that a long debate
proceeded the expulsion as there were many

216
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,730
people against it,
mostly for economic reasons

217
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,101
there Maurice,

218
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:54,101
because we're an integral part of the
economy of several regions of Spain and

219
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:55,910
had some clout in the government.

220
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,970
Your expulsion as you have learned in
earlier cost ruin in some areas of Spain

221
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,390
as the expulsion of the Jews in
1492 had also brought about, uh,

222
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,840
all kinds of dire consequences
to the, to, to Spain.

223
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,090
But he's a confluence,

224
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:19,091
a coalescence of the text of the fiction
with current history that we had not

225
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:24,281
seen before in part one or even part to
marine any other fiction anywhere with

226
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,580
the possible exception of the goose man,
they al Farace.

227
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,570
But there it is not as explicit.
Um,

228
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,670
the events that are mentioned are
not as dramatic and as current as the

229
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:44,440
expulsion of the Maurice costs.
Now this,

230
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,810
the fact that the story will
eventually remain on finished.

231
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Remember they have to put a petition to
Madrid to have Anna Felix a pardon for

232
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,360
returning to the peninsula.
She,

233
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,650
she faced with the possibility of uh,

234
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,480
of being sent back or even
of being executed. Uh,

235
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,410
now the fact that the store
would be remains unfinished
leads me to think that's

236
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:15,411
an advantage is considering considering
here how closure can be brought about in

237
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,960
the story that blends with ongoing time.

238
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,340
How can you bring closure to a story
that deals with something that is in the

239
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:25,230
process of happening?

240
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,500
How can fictional time offer closure to
stop something that is happening in real

241
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,330
time?
If you do that,

242
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,890
a closure will be a way of
fictionalizing what is real

243
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
by giving it a,
an artistic shape.

244
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,850
So this is a theoretical issue that
I'm sure was a in Cervantes is mine.

245
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,570
And if you remember in part one,

246
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:53,690
the very last of the stories
is also left unfinished.

247
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,550
I will take this up again as we
consider the consider the ending of the,

248
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,070
uh,
of the novel.

249
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,630
But what is the meaning of all of this

250
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,810
business of current events in, in,
in terms of surveys as his opinion

251
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,350
about the expulsion of the Maurice Course?
This has been,

252
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:22,370
as you can imagine,

253
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,790
a hotly debated issue with presentism
play a heavy role in the debate.

254
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:34,010
Presenteeism is a way of
alluding to a form of criticism,

255
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,010
a bit of literature or,
uh,

256
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:39,410
an interpretation of history
that favors depressant.

257
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,530
You interpret the past in
terms of the precedent, uh,

258
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,880
or you project the present into the past.
Of course,

259
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:50,360
the issue is whether one can
completely avoid this ever.

260
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,310
But there are some critics and some
historians who exercise this, uh,

261
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,520
to the point where it's, it, it
is, uh, uh, obvious that it's the,

262
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,270
that is not right.

263
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,810
And a lot of presentism has played a
role in this debate about what is the

264
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,370
advantage really favored or not.
The expulsion of them are east coast,

265
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,600
all of these colored by
all of the 20th century,

266
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:18,470
particularly debates about minorities
on their roles and so forth.

267
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,020
In other words,

268
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,020
some critics want to make this into a
contemporary and having a spouse views or

269
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,790
modern liberal thinker.

270
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,163
Okay.

271
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,860
Uh,

272
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Cervantes is obviously appalled or the
expulsion of those Maurice Ngos who were

273
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,100
obviously part of the
fabric of the country,

274
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,750
those who have truly converted,
but I think he gets,

275
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:49,060
he tries to give it balance,
a balanced view of the whole thing.

276
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,420
Obviously worried about an internal enemy
to the state given the international

277
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,430
situation.

278
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,900
It is possible and it has been mentioned
that he was also worried about himself.

279
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,690
Uh, if you express an opinion,
obviously opposed to that of the crown,

280
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,180
but think of this,

281
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,290
Morocco is a barely across
the Strait of Gibraltar.

282
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,963
Yeah.

283
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,380
I'm sure that most of you know
that area of the, of the world.

284
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,450
If you have seen Casablanca, which is
not there, but nearly not nearly enough,

285
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,110
but I don't know where the young
people like you have seen that classic.

286
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,710
But in any way, you know, this
is the Strait of Gibraltar,

287
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,580
Spain and Morocco is here.

288
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,970
So Morocco was in the hands of Nms of
Spain of the same race and religion as

289
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,950
their Maurice costs.
In other words,

290
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,750
as opposed to the Jews who
had been expelled in 1492,

291
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,890
the Maurice goes,
had an international projection.

292
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,760
They potential international projection.

293
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,480
They could be allied with foreign
enemies and become a fifth column within

294
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:11,480
Spain. Fifth column is
red. You say about how, uh,

295
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
a group of individuals who are against a
government but living within the state,

296
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,860
within the niche.

297
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,000
There Maurice goes as the episode
of the captive in part one.

298
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,523
Uh,

299
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:31,530
the Maurice goes a allude
with their presence to one
of the central myth for the

300
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:36,190
constitution of modern Spain after
the unification of the country under

301
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,720
Ferdinand and Isabella,

302
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,320
the reconquest meaning the recovery of
Spanish territory from Morris Control,

303
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,030
which culminated with a fall of Granola
in 1492. What do you mean by this?

304
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:53,770
Is that the Maurice
Coast? Uh, we're a, uh,

305
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,640
uh,
with a very presence,

306
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,380
recalled the presence of the
Morse in Spain or two 1492.

307
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,240
And the Reconquista,

308
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:08,370
the reconquest that becomes sort of a
central patriotic myths that helps paint

309
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,350
together. So, uh, uh,

310
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,690
so the Maurice goes or expelled in 1609,

311
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:18,691
appealing to people's fears dumped the
reconquest could be undone and hence her,

312
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,210
the whole country would collapse.
This is ridiculous of course,

313
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,800
but governments do tend to, uh, to uh,

314
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,240
motivate the populace with such fierce,

315
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,820
particularly totalitarian
governments, uh, do that. Uh,

316
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,940
Hitler, uh, did, uh, in Cuba.

317
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,870
Fidel Castro has been how's bring the
impending invasion of the Yankees for 50

318
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:51,590
years? It has never come
to keep the people aroused.

319
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,320
And this is what is happening
in the span of this moment.

320
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,040
The Maurice Course called somehow unleash
a counter or conquest and bring the

321
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:05,090
whole country down.
Now,

322
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,960
in terms of the part of our protagonists,

323
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,020
Loki Hotel on central,

324
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:17,021
the relevant thing is that here we
observed central making difficult and

325
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,880
delicate moral decision

326
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,830
with respect to recording the decision
is whether to help him and he is in need.

327
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,900
And they got, they also offers
him a very substantial, uh,

328
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,830
material reward or tool for law,

329
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,670
for Sandra to be loyal to the
king by obeying his edicts.

330
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,053
Okay.

331
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,210
Sanchez, uh, memories by the way, uh,

332
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,290
play a part in the episode episode.

333
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,760
He recalls crying when he got his family,

334
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,790
left his town and reveals that
Anna Feliks has Pedrog ago.

335
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,390
Greg, you in my, your ass go as his
suitor. Am I your escorts or word?

336
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:09,070
You already know? Private ordering
audio is not only a Christian Young man,

337
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:12,040
but a very well to do Christian Young man.

338
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,430
Okay.

339
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,440
Sandra chooses a middle ground.

340
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,270
He will not help regarded
dig up the treasure,

341
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,320
but he will keep silent about record
this illegal return to Spain and his plan

342
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,950
to take the money out of the country,
which is also illegal.

343
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,660
There were heavy sanctions against taking
money out of the country because with

344
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:41,250
the expulsion, uh, as always happens
when, when, when, when a certain,

345
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:43,830
certain people are expelled from the
country and they'd take the richest,

346
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,700
this affects the economy of the country,
uh, tremendously. So there were,

347
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,480
there were, there were
laws against, uh, the, the,

348
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,350
the Briscoes taking their wealth
with them too. So record tay is,

349
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,550
is guilty of,

350
00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:02,551
of two crimes having returned and
also planning to take money out of the

351
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:08,400
country. Sanctuary, uh, makes,

352
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,460
uh, a very, uh, difficult, uh,

353
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,820
decision because he
himself is taking a risk.

354
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,340
If it is learned that he
has not, uh, uh, uh, uh,

355
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,120
report it, you, this
return, he could be, uh,

356
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,240
also held responsible.

357
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Now we've got the himself is a complex
character and he's one of the few figures

358
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:37,410
not marked at all in any way in the book.
By complex,

359
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:42,411
I mean that he's caught in conflicting
dilemmas and is able to weigh different

360
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,400
of view.
He is comparable to a hemo Morrato.

361
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,460
So riders father in part
one, but here this is a, uh,

362
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,510
more, uh, this is
expanded, uh, because Eh,

363
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,900
he's, he's, he's wife is
converted to Christianity.

364
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,980
His daughter was born into Christianity.
He has not quite converted.

365
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,910
He is in a very difficult, uh, situation

366
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:10,880
three.

367
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Got The sense that he's not against
the edict of banishment of expulsion.

368
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,920
You understand the reasons
of state behind it,

369
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,080
but laments that even those Maurice
Co's who have joined the main stream of

370
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,360
society,
even converting to Christianity,

371
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:32,361
are paying for the actions of those who
are seditious and with whom he does not

372
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:33,984
agree.

373
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,240
Santo confesses to his neighbor
in passing and just marvelous,

374
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,410
uh, postprandial, uh, or, uh, uh,

375
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,820
exchange they have after he and the
German beggars and all of that get drunk

376
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,970
with their wine and eat and so forth.
Uh,

377
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,920
Santiago confesses his travails as a
governor announced to the ability for the

378
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:56,950
position and Rick [inaudible],

379
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,530
who is clearly better
educated than Antonio.

380
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,930
Uh, and, and,

381
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,940
and can tell that the whole thing had to
be a hoax does not press the matter in

382
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,260
this recorded this place,

383
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:15,261
a deeper human understanding and four
barrels for the shortcomings of another

384
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,850
human being's Saint Joe's ignorance.

385
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:22,540
So it is a very subtle touch
on the part of [inaudible].

386
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,190
There's a certain neighborly complicity
by which the figures of Saint John

387
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,680
recorded around the house
filled out.

388
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,990
This choir is growing intellectually
and spiritually. Uh, the normal, uh,

389
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,570
uh, progresses. And
Rick got the, as I said,

390
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,650
uh, it's, uh, it's a very, uh,

391
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,860
complex and well rounded character
who goes through a very dramatic,

392
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,150
uh,
process here.

393
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,540
My friend did distinguished a Puerto
Rican scholar, Lusail Lopez Bharath.

394
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,333
Okay.

395
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,660
Professor at the University of
Puerto Rico has written eloquently.

396
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:18,600
He's an Arab east,

397
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,240
has written eloquently about the Maurice
goes on the literature they produced.

398
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,240
Learning about it may
help us understand better,

399
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,460
regardless plight as depicted
by surveying this in the hotel.

400
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,730
I'm referring to a,
uh,

401
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,490
a study by Lopez Barel and title.

402
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,670
What image did the Maurice goes
have of themselves to rights?

403
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:49,260
If I were to symbolize the fundamental
in image of themselves or the Spanish

404
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,900
Mariko's had, I believe that
the epithet used by [inaudible],

405
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,000
she's writing about,
uh,

406
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:02,100
the episode used by man what would be
the most appropriate criers or we purse

407
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,900
when Maurice goes being deposed
by the authorities cried.

408
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,650
Instead of rewriting elegant
passages from their literature,

409
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,060
they were determined to preserve for
posterity a faithful image of themselves

410
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:20,950
and how they reacted before the historical
crisis that was coming upon them.

411
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,270
Then she adds,

412
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,580
and this is precisely what Maurice call
literature is about because there was a

413
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:28,450
Maurisco literature.

414
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,910
It constitutes a literary monument to
the collect collective effort to preserve

415
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:34,810
at all costs,

416
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,280
Islamic identity mortally wounded
in the Spain of the golden age.

417
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,260
It was an enormous effort because the
basic elements of Islamic culture,

418
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,760
the language, proper names, distinctive
dress, religious ceremonies,

419
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:53,850
even the Zumba dance had been strictly
forbidden by numerous official decrees

420
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,580
issued all along the 16th century
or code she yards finally,

421
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,870
but these very same Maurice course
divided in the deepest recesses of their

422
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:10,720
souls found themselves
before a new dilemma.

423
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,060
When Phillip the third
decreed against them,

424
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:18,061
the order of expulsion in 1609 they had
not been allowed to become bona fide the

425
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:20,530
Spaniards in their country of origin,

426
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,990
but they did not have time either to
become authentic Muslims during the first

427
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:28,060
decades of their exile in Barbary,

428
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,710
the Maurisco community went through two
different processes of assimilation.

429
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,190
Their Islamic identity had been torn
from them forcibly in the span of a 16th

430
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:39,520
and 17th centuries.

431
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,690
And when they finally in Marist in the
process of assimilating themselves to

432
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:48,250
official Spanish, they were forced by
circumstances to begin another process.

433
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,660
Now, the opposite, one of
cultural assimilation. Encore,

434
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,390
in other words,
as you have read here,

435
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,990
when they went back to
their countries of origin,

436
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,680
what countries of origin there were from
Spain, they found that they were not, uh,

437
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,120
uh,

438
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,120
accepted in the Muslims communities
where they thought that they would be,

439
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,930
uh, uh, welcomed and where they would
be able to blend themselves into the,

440
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,260
into the mainstream. No,
they were exiles again, uh,

441
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,330
within their own people. They
were in a no man's land. Uh,

442
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,700
culturally speaking,

443
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:28,960
this is the drama that recorded
and his family is living through.

444
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,750
And [inaudible] is mentioning here.

445
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,330
In short,

446
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,380
what's Advantis accomplishes in the
episodes involving ricotta is to provide a

447
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:43,381
view the vision of the
effects of political decisions
made with concern for the

448
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:49,241
nation as a whole on the people that
are affected by those decisions.

449
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,070
The normal is not a treatise on political
philosophy nor is that a commentary on

450
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:56,390
government policies.

451
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:01,630
It is a medium through
which the particular can be
perceived in the lives of

452
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:06,710
specific people.
Of course,

453
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,220
what's advantage is dealing with here
is an issue that has affected that

454
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:16,221
humanity since time in memorial and that
would continue to affect it until the

455
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:17,840
president til today,

456
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,640
until the issues that we're
facing in this country today,

457
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,920
it is the presence of minorities within
a body politics and how a state can deal

458
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:32,840
with them without endangering its
own existence. More broadly speaking,

459
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,140
the issue is how nations and states
define themselves negatively as that which

460
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:43,331
they are not and try to wage wars against
real or perceived enemies and cleanse

461
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:50,291
their own population of potential internal
enemies that maybe accomplishes of

462
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,830
external ones.

463
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,570
This seems to be a content in human
history and one can see its manifestations

464
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,510
in the bible and classical literature.

465
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:05,050
The modern history of abuses provoked
by these tendencies is long and shameful

466
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:10,601
from the expulsion of the Jews from
Spain in 1492 to the extermination of

467
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,250
millions of the,
by the Nazi regime in Germany,

468
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,920
in the Spain that we are studying.

469
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:19,580
It was not only their Maurice course
that did not fit within the homogeneous

470
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:20,600
body of the nation.

471
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,110
Gypsies convert souls and the people in
regions such as Catalonia and Galicia

472
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:30,110
who were out of sorts with
the Castilian driven state,

473
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,710
Catalonia Galicia of here.
Uh,

474
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,220
we have seen through the
chaotic characters from other
provinces like the bask,

475
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,480
the Galicians,
the historians.

476
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,700
Spain is a country divided against
itself and continues to be.

477
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:51,170
So if not Google Eta the
Basque terrorist group,

478
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,160
the basket terrorist group that uh,

479
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,690
whose activities center all over
it. But I mean they are in both, uh,

480
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,920
uh, uh, uh, Spain on, uh, um, France,

481
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,553
uh,

482
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,040
because that's where Basque people live
and have lived there since the beginning

483
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:16,040
of time. They have no idea
where their baskets came from.

484
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,170
Their language is not in the European,
they have no idea where it came from. A,

485
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:25,150
so they are separate. It's uh, on, on,

486
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,310
on the extreme group,

487
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:32,311
the terrorist group ETA is
a fearful fearsome to both
the Spanish and the French

488
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:35,450
state.
Uh,

489
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,410
Cervantes Hot Bay is the first substantial
work of fiction that dramatizes this

490
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,740
conflict.
And the regard,

491
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:48,741
the story is the most dramatic from
the point of view of literature.

492
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:53,190
The thing to keep in mind is that the
conflict involving the expulsion of the

493
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:57,300
Maurice Cosi seen in its particulars,
not in general terms.

494
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,860
And that is poignancy is due to the
believability of the characters,

495
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,060
especially recorded,
but also in the tenderness,

496
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:10,290
the neighborly solidarity
that he and to display.

497
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:16,010
These are human qualities and emotions
that are beyond political policies.

498
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,230
And the novel will from now on,
always be about them.

499
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,780
This particular,
not the general theories,

500
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,853
so,

501
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,340
so much for recording and Anna
Feliks for the time being,

502
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:34,590
we may have to return to them,

503
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,230
but now little fall into
the pit with central. Uh,

504
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,200
I, uh, uh, I assume that
you have read, uh, this, uh,

505
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,110
wonderful, uh, chapter, uh,

506
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,430
in which central falls into a pit,
uh,

507
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,550
which is a symmetrical episode
two, the Montesinos Cave, uh,

508
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,000
uh, adventure, uh, of
his master Don Quixote.

509
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,630
There is an internal parallel by means
of which Cervantes parodies himself

510
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,010
within part two.

511
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:12,540
I had told you their episodes in part
two that are repetitions of episodes

512
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,370
within part two. This episode is a
parody of them Montesinos Kate Cave,

513
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,670
which was itself a parody of several
ci Valerie episodes as well as,

514
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,820
uh, others. Uh, that'd be
salting homer virgin on Plato.

515
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,380
These lifts sanctuary kind
of equality with his master.

516
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,730
It is a funny one, but nevertheless,
it is any quality with this master.

517
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,710
It is to be noted.
However,

518
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:42,711
the central falls into the pit cave
after losing his island fall of Troy,

519
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,510
uh, an ess as dissent. Uh,

520
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,850
there is a kind of pattern here.

521
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,560
I have a series of quotes
here that I want to gloss,

522
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,150
uh, from, uh,

523
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:02,190
an excellent article written jointly by
Raymond McCurdy and Alfred Rodriguez.

524
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,160
And,
uh,

525
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,160
I will quote them and glossed them
as I did with the Lopez burnout as an

526
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:15,810
internal parallel. They say the
series of actions that we study,

527
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,520
meaning the fall into the pit, uh,
have exceptional characteristics.

528
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,780
It is in the first place,

529
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:26,781
the most prominent example
of the deliberate parallelism
that largely structures

530
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,254
that Quixote,

531
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,890
the parallel in which the
obvious resemblance that
strikes one is the set for

532
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,610
common subterranean stay.

533
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,690
He's talking about the cave in Montesinos
in this parallelism, the parallelism.

534
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,390
He quotes, they quote one
Marasco who says m. I. R. S. Oh,

535
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,910
we notice the correspondence,

536
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:53,911
the striking parallelism of cycles
in part two and Chapman of Dulcinea,

537
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:59,530
like the loss of Troy, the sent
to Montesinos Cave. Uh, this,

538
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,760
the infernal descent of a
[inaudible] central banks are losers,

539
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,770
is loss of Troy falls into a deep and
very dark pit in third oldest sent.

540
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,250
So you can see that they have all,

541
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:12,160
they have noticed this
parallelisms in great detail.

542
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,480
They add the parallel that
we're studying by offering it,

543
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,510
offering a curious parody of a parody
becomes a mirror that reflects the entire,

544
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,550
that reflects their advantages entire
creative process because this is a parody

545
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:35,590
of a parody,
the parody of Cervantes himself.

546
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,593
Okay.

547
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:47,850
Cervantes. They say producers in
with a central Pantheon adventure.

548
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,540
Now you can make central
bank sign an adjective,

549
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,140
at least for the reader who picks up
all the hints thrown by the novelist and

550
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,560
innovative. And at the same time
Snyder re parity double pouty.

551
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,650
By doing this,
the great novel is touches on purpose.

552
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:08,651
The aesthetic limits of his own artistic
procedure for would appear to be the

553
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:10,640
limit of parodic creation,

554
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:15,641
a limit insurmountable and innovative
self parody that is more over at parody of

555
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:17,630
a parody.

556
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,630
This is the reaching deep into that series
of images that are repeated deep into

557
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:25,341
that mirror.

558
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:29,870
We see each other in the barber shop as
a little boy when you're reflecting over

559
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:31,820
and over and over and over
and over and over and over.

560
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,020
Now we also notice now, uh, having
abandoning Mokodean [inaudible],

561
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,510
uh,
that this episode,

562
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,830
it involves this in Ganja.
We just,

563
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,900
which makes sense to even more reflective.

564
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,380
And he no longer yearns for the island.
Uh,

565
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,300
he values more his service and
his attachment to Don Quixote.

566
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,990
He yearns for the intimacy
of their relationship.

567
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,950
Now they are then because doc,

568
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,600
you hope they fines Saint Joe because he
has gone out to practice for this joust

569
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,640
he's encounter,
he's supposed to have.

570
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:19,010
And by chance a hero Saint
Joseph's laments, uh,

571
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,160
and that encounter is going to be the
one to restore Donya Rodriguez daughter's

572
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,840
honor by having the young
man, uh, uh, uh, uh,

573
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,890
who promised to marry her and,
and uh,

574
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,950
compromise their honor.
Uh, go ahead and marry her.

575
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,830
So here we have,

576
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,890
we go to that third of the topics
I had mentioned in an instance,

577
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,960
an instance of art influence in life.

578
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,220
The prank organized by the Duke and
his minions brings about the possible

579
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:54,221
marriage of the young woman to the young
man who plays the role of her strange

580
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:57,890
fiance because it is no longer
the real fiance who's involved,

581
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,740
but it's someone who's
playing the strange fiance.

582
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,260
These adventure will turn out like the
loft conflicts of part one that don

583
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:10,220
Quixote salts, except that here
the fiction is turned into reality.

584
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,150
Whereas in the Doterra
Fernando Panda Philando affair,

585
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:19,100
the giant is only symbolically slain
fiction and reality are no longer separate

586
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:21,530
in part to their part
and parcel of each other.

587
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,260
Fiction does not simply reflect
reality. It affects, affects it,

588
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,110
it affects it.

589
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,830
Fiction and reality appear to be
one and the same or in other words,

590
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,410
reality is nature improved by art.

591
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,180
In the episode we have again in marriage
where social mobility is involved

592
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,570
[inaudible] Rodriguez,

593
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,520
his daughter was going to
marry up economically because
he's young man was alive,

594
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,050
but the groom's proxy Tostinos
isn't me or servant a lackey.

595
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:54,550
She however concludes that is better to
marry the not at all and accepts him in

596
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:57,820
a,
in a gesture of,

597
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,660
of pragmatism that is
completely at odds and funny,

598
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:06,110
but it's completely at all through all
of the notions of idealized love that we

599
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,220
have here. She sees that the
better to get married, uh,

600
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,060
done not to be married at all in a
situation in which you used. And in the,

601
00:43:13,061 --> 00:43:17,300
in the context in which she finds herself,
that is an echo here.

602
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,170
I find that a very
funny one, suddenly, uh,

603
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,000
about the fights about to begin and this,
this,

604
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:28,001
this proxy a groom looks at the woman
on falls in love with her and said,

605
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,080
oh, I don't want to fight. I surrender.

606
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:36,230
I'll marry her. And in the end
she says, okay, I'll marry him,

607
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:41,300
buried him that nobody and a,
and this is what it's funny.

608
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:44,510
So the fiction becomes the reality
that is the fiction, whatever.

609
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,710
It's very obvious that it's an
echo here of Camacho's wedding.

610
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,241
So in a sense,

611
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:55,190
the 70 is also repetition of it
let be sold in part to like, uh,

612
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,070
Sanchez for,
uh,

613
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,590
in the cave of Montesinos adventure.

614
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:07,010
But the point is that fiction has improved
reality and this is a theme that is

615
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,250
repeated in the next two episodes,
or at least cost very briefly,

616
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:11,660
but they are very significant.

617
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:18,010
The first and most commented about is
when they find this images of [inaudible]

618
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,690
Rick saints covered
with sheets on the road.

619
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,000
These episodes just remind people of
the one towards the end of part one.

620
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,830
When the penitents carry an image of the
virgin remembering the procession and

621
00:44:30,831 --> 00:44:35,340
don't Quixote takes her to
be a lady in distress here,

622
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,170
us with the actors in the wire
of death episode and uh, uh,

623
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,760
he makes look here that makes no
mistakes. Uh, actually he does a, uh,

624
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,780
quite an area died. Uh, uh,

625
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,710
a study of the image of a
Saint George don't get halted,

626
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:57,711
knows that these are
representations clinics have
seen in this episode echoes of

627
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:03,501
the debates involving erass mutants
and those was Protestant [inaudible]

628
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,010
leanings about images and other devout
representations in this episode.

629
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:10,160
If you've read in the
earlier and you know, uh,

630
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,050
there was a whole debate about whether
they should be religious images in the

631
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:15,330
churches are not, of course, uh,

632
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,860
the f the faction in favor of religious
images, obviously one in Spain.

633
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,900
Uh, but there was a debate.
It involve Erasmus too. Uh,

634
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,020
but the point is that reality here
appears to have turned into art.

635
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,540
What he finds on the road are already
representations of the saints are artistic

636
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:38,070
images of the saints there.
They're out there.

637
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,020
The second episode,
which I find most charming,

638
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,640
he's going to be sad when Don Quixote is
caught in a net in a green net that was

639
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:52,830
set there among the trees to
capture birds by this, uh,

640
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,880
by these young ladies playing
a being shepherded, says,

641
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,100
and getting ready to perform
an echoed by Gfsi Lasso.

642
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,810
That port I've mentioned so
many times in the semester,

643
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:08,670
and that I hope you remember his name. A
cloth is pastoral pawns. They're about,

644
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,400
they're about to stage one of
them. They have learned, uh,

645
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:15,020
the lines and all of that.
She says, and Oh, Quixote, uh,

646
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,900
valves to stand in the middle of the
road and defend them for however long it

647
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,920
takes. And, and, uh, so
reality again, appears as art.

648
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,210
Young women dressed,
as shepherds says about to stage a,

649
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,270
an heck log by the Great Garcia lastro.
Notice that guns last one sport.

650
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,890
It has to become a part
of common discourse.

651
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,640
It has improved common everyday discourse
is young ladies want to represent his

652
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:43,650
poetry.
Gutsy Lasso.

653
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,000
Remember 1501 1536 only
35 years you lived.

654
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,620
But when he's spoke, his poetry
was published in 1543 posthumously.

655
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:56,930
It changed poetry written in Spanish,

656
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:01,560
Spanish language forever until today.
That's how important he was.

657
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:06,320
But notice that his poetry
has been incorporated into
everyday life by this. Uh,

658
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,680
so we conclude by talking
about rocky generic.

659
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,790
Rock agnostic is a Catalan bandit who
really existed and lack the Maurice cause.

660
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:24,510
He brings out an international
dimension to the novel.

661
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,690
Bringing the edge of this
kind was coming in Catalonia.

662
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,010
There were bands of brigans like this,

663
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,800
which the crown felt
that it had to put down,

664
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:37,360
not only because they were outlaws,

665
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:42,390
but because they could become a
competences of the French Huguenots.

666
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,050
Now notice again the map we have here.

667
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:52,660
Now location of the Maurice Course.
We had the threat of the, uh, of,

668
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,550
of Muslims across the,

669
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,700
the Strait of Gibraltar here.

670
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,250
Catalonians right next to France.

671
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,240
And in some ways it's
more French and Spanish,

672
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:08,050
certainly more French than Castilian
and the language and all of that, uh,

673
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,720
and has been very successful.
Just like the Basques

674
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,350
do the two today,
the Catalans,

675
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,360
the Catalans think that
they have their own culture,

676
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:19,210
that you have their own nation,
many of them do and so forth and so on.

677
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,060
And this and this,
or this band,

678
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:27,061
it's like a rock could be in
cahoots with a French Huguenot.

679
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,220
You're going not where
the French Protestants,

680
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,750
you get notes where the French
Protestants with the Calvinist background,

681
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,350
uh,
who believed in the,

682
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:43,380
they good attain salvation without the
intervention of the church who believed

683
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:48,010
in reading and interpreting scripture
directly. Typically the things that these,

684
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,940
the, the Catholic church rejected
violently, especially from Spain.

685
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,890
So Huguenots were dangerous also,

686
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,950
Spain and France and France had been
at all throughout the 16th century.

687
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,590
So the French were no
friends of the Spaniards.

688
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:08,720
And so the Spanish crowd feared this,
uh,

689
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:13,560
Catalan bandage because they, they
could be agents of the French Huguenot.

690
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,060
Remember what I said about states
defining themselves negative,

691
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,340
what they are not or the Spanish
crown was not was Protestant for sure,

692
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,680
or not French and not muscling,

693
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,140
but rocky. He not, he's a
compelling attractive figure.

694
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Cervantes was fascinated by the
autonomous world of the bandit and by his

695
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:41,110
chivalry abandoned lack.

696
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,860
Croaky invents himself on
the margins of the law.

697
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,720
There is something romantic
of aunt Lola in rocky.

698
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,690
He anticipates the bandit figures
who are heroes in 19th century,

699
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,470
uh, normals, John Paul,
Joan and all of the dollars.

700
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Ginardis a kind of Catalan Robin Hood who
rubs the rich and helps those in need.

701
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,240
He's Lawler's except within the
very strict laws of his band.

702
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,100
I you saw how strict they are.
One of his,

703
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,170
one of his associates
questions to division of the
booty and he'd be heads him.

704
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,270
Um, in this respect, rocker
is like money, Paul, the you,

705
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,410
uh, and his brotherhood and
bring Canadian quarterly. Yo.

706
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:31,411
His band is an anti utopia that counter
society as self enclosed world built

707
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,090
from within itself

708
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,150
is goodness possible
within an outlaw society.

709
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,390
Goodness always appears,
possibly. Serratus.

710
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,770
Remember Buddy Doremus
who is good to others,

711
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,790
she's kind to century and also reliable
within the practices of her profession.

712
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,870
Perhaps not about trade, even if her
profession is being a prostitute,

713
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,100
but she delivers,

714
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,280
he's Canard and new exemplar of the
heroic that's advantage can never stop

715
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,230
dreaming about you see
an exemplary manner.

716
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:16,330
Arms as opposed to amount of letters
is Dennard donkey Hotez counterpart.

717
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,410
Is he not a modern night errand of sorts

718
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,720
is, isn't this what makes him
attractive to Don Quixote?

719
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,380
Notice that the tricky treat
each other with respect.

720
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,040
That donkey haughty knows about the
existence of Ragnarok and rocky NART seems

721
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:41,201
to have read or heard about part one of
the Quixote because he also knows about

722
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:46,130
a donkey hoppy. So, uh,

723
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:51,410
there is a kind of self recognition
parallel to the one we find in the episode

724
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:56,270
with Cardinia.
We're Gnocchi hold defines Gardenia.

725
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,500
And they have that meeting where they
looked at each other having the uncanny

726
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,180
feeling that they,
they know each other.

727
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,530
And here we're not
guilty meets rock in art.

728
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,280
We have the same kind of recognition
of mutual recognition. And,

729
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,260
and, and I know you because
I know myself kind of.

730
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,960
So that is rocky nerd who makes possible
donkey holders entry into Barcelona

731
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:28,630
because this bandaid is in touch and has
influence with the important people in

732
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:34,170
the city of Barcelona. So, uh, uh,

733
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,930
Doki holder gets it the kind of safe
conduct from the band to enter the great

734
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,560
city of Barcelona,
but not before.

735
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,440
We cannot conclude without mentioning an
episode within the episodes of rock or

736
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:52,070
you're not. And it's not about Claudia
heroin, Nema, Claudia. Hey, don't EMA.

737
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:58,670
Claudia had only man in Claudia had
on him. And we have yet another story,

738
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:03,790
another love story with a lady in
distress because her lover seems to not be

739
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:08,210
willing to marry her because there
is a class disparity or something.

740
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,160
But Claudia had only my takes
drastic action by killing her fiance.

741
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,880
Don't be sending who's a potential don't
Fernando who or in his death row swears

742
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,330
that he has been the
victim of, of, of, uh,

743
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,690
of rumors that he has not unfaithful
to cloud your heroin. In my,

744
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:32,340
to late Claudia had only
mom took care of him. Uh,

745
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,490
uh, this is the one of these, uh,

746
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,730
instead of Antin 17 women
characters who, who, uh, who, uh,

747
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,680
wants to, uh, to take her
destiny into her own hands,

748
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,600
she goes to a little too
far here. Perhaps, uh, uh,

749
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:55,470
it is a piece of the bullous they come
at you because of the death scene,

750
00:53:55,830 --> 00:54:00,240
but with a different and
very tragic ending here.

751
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:06,270
Uncharacteristically tragedy
occurs before marriage,

752
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,920
which is unusual tragedies in
the golden age and Golding,

753
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:14,280
each Spanish literature tend
to happen after a marriage.

754
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,690
And we don't know if it is just another
instance of Cervantes taking episodes

755
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:23,691
from part one where we even within part
two and taking them one step further

756
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,170
in the next class will
be taken about are uh,

757
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,490
talking about our protagonist
arrival in Barcelona,

758
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,970
also about [inaudible] spurious Quixote,
which by now has appearance.

759
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:42,960
Cervantes knows about it. And
which resurfaces in the, in the,

760
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:46,650
in the, in the scene of their
visit to the printing shop.

761
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,910
And also we will talk about Doki
holders, final defeat. But I want,

762
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:55,590
I want you to take, uh, uh,
to pay special attention,

763
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,110
uh, to LTC Laura's dream.
I'll teach you Dora,

764
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,450
is this, this, uh, uh, very, uh, uh,

765
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,550
active young lady with
an active imagination and
proclivity to acting and all of

766
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:15,360
that who has a marvelous dream,

767
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,330
uh, in, in, in one of
the episodes when, uh,

768
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,790
Don Quixote and Saint Joe go back
to the Duke and Duchess Paris.

769
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,520
And, uh, it's a, it's an episode,

770
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:31,970
her dream in which the whole issue
of books will resurface again.
