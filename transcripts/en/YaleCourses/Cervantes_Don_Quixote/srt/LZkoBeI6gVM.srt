1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,690
I want to begin by,
uh, taking up some, uh,

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,470
general questions,
uh,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,670
concerning the Quixote matters,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,950
such as the difference
between romance and novel.

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:20,220
Because I know from the last
lecture that you must, uh,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,740
be confused and it's good to know it

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,800
other matters which are what,

8
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,690
what is it she Valerie romance because
you hear a lot about it and I'm sure and

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:35,010
that very few people know,
why don't you vote or romance was,

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,680
uh, and uh, who were the,

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,603
uh,

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Spanish precursors of Cervantes because I,

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,590
I want to as much as possible,

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,050
although in English to give you a said
Vantis in his own sauce as it were,

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,910
that is within the Spanish tradition
as well as the European but also with,

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,240
but within the Spanish tradition,
uh,

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,970
I do that to counter
versions of the Quixote, uh,

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,370
taught here at Yale in the
English department and uh, uh,

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,940
and directed studies and
so forth valuable courses,

20
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,920
but in which surrounds this is seen only
in the context of Western literature.

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,590
So this is why I want to give,

22
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:27,170
you sort of answered this as much
as possible in his own salsa.

23
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,400
I said were in its own sauce.

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,300
Now I will begin by, uh, continuing, uh,

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,480
on the issue of what
one, why the Quixote, Eh,

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,160
has continued to be, uh, to be read.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,630
Why it has had such common currency.

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,380
I just learned yesterday that
the detainees in one animal,

29
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,620
uh, Cuba, uh, ask for the
Quixote, first of all,

30
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,050
uh, of all the books or
they want to read. Now,

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,500
I have offered the most common
of answers about Hawaii.

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,390
The Quixote is so current,
the least a specialized,

33
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,020
the one that I assume a general readers
would understand about wanting to be all

34
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,000
there and so forth that I
spoke about in the last class.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,560
But Doki Haka is notoriously about
literature covering the entire range of

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,703
about,

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,290
first and foremost is about the effect
that literature has on its readers.

38
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,730
Don't Quixote goes mad because
he reads too much literature.

39
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,630
Literature fiction allows
us to rehearse in private.

40
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,170
Our most secret desires are effecting
our lives as if these desires come true.

41
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,200
Uh, it's like dreams,
dreams of the same effect.

42
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,730
This is its allure, the allure of
literature. And also it's danger.

43
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,750
We can live lives other than ours,

44
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,751
full of adventures on Trammell by
society's constraints and by our own

45
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,550
limitations.

46
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,500
Does doing that purchase of those desires,
uh,

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,140
or does it induce more desires,
uh,

48
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,220
and induce the desire to close the
gap between desire and reality.

49
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,330
But the hotter is also in addition
about the creation of literature,

50
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,120
the relationship each text has with this,

51
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:54,010
with previous texts as well as
about questions of Literary John,

52
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,844
Huh.

53
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,630
The Quixote appears at the end of
the renaissance when improvements,

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,870
uh,

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,490
of the printing press that created
a mass readership sorta speak mass

56
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,950
readership, nothing compared
to what we have today. Uh,

57
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,210
a mass readership for the first time in
history and when the discovery analysis

58
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,360
and imitation of classical TVCs,
uh,

59
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,450
on poetics had brought to
the four questions about
content and form as well as

60
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,430
of ethics,
public and private.

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,190
As you know, the renaissance,
uh, involved, uh,

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,150
or renaissance humanists were
interested in the classics,

63
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,810
in reading the classics
in the original, in, um,

64
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,740
in editing the classics
to make them available.

65
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,490
What is secular literature good for?

66
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,480
What is good literature?

67
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,340
How do new ideas about reading and
writing affect the interpretation of

68
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,383
scripture

69
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,290
is secular literature in the vernacular,
a danger to faith,

70
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,010
religious faith,
leaky hot,

71
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,470
the is full of writers and readers.

72
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:19,390
You will meet them as you read
the book of books, Stories, poems,

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,350
and of people,
young and old affected by literature.

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,380
You would meet some very early Marcel
[inaudible] customer [inaudible].

75
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,533
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:36,030
Now in this vein about Don Quixote
and the issue of literature is the

77
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:42,010
originality of the donkey hotel story.

78
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,230
The fact that it does not belong
to any known tradition or cycle,

79
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,570
be it from the pastoral or
Chavarria or chivalry cycles.

80
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,660
Uh, not to mention, uh,

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,570
popular narratives or even mythology
that is don Quixote is not based on a

82
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,960
classical myth or, or a traditional, uh,

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,580
story handed down orally.
Techie.

84
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:11,490
Hotter is a new story.
Uh, Indiana servant.

85
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,100
This boasts that it is new.

86
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,080
It is no small accomplishment to set out,

87
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:22,340
to write a narrative without precedents
to make of individual invention.

88
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,910
They're fundamental
factor of a literary work.

89
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,470
The divine comedy.
Tell us an original story.

90
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:34,130
Yet it is based on received
popular and cultural traditions,

91
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,230
the sense to hell,

92
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,650
a sense to heaven and it
calls and incorporates many
stories from biblical and

93
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,390
classical traditions that
they can run by Boccaccio.

94
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Some of you may have read it retells
tales drawn from many popular and cultural

95
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,120
sources to their same goes for of course,

96
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:04,121
for the pastoral and the
chivalric romances about
which I will be speaking soon.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But the story of a man who
goes mad because he reads
too much has only one known

98
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:15,020
source and it is so trifling
as as to be dismissed.

99
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,590
Although the fact that it
exists is of some importance.

100
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,103
Uh,

101
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,300
the very act of invention on sort of
antithesis part is an important modern

102
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:31,721
component of the work invention is
the hallmark of modern literature.

103
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,620
Now, how could such a revolutionary
work up here in Spain?

104
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,620
I'm sorry to make this assumption,
but your conception of Spain cannot be,

105
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,640
but the result of the black legend.
What is the black legend?

106
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:54,230
The black legend is the bad
press that Spain's enemies,

107
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:59,660
uh, disseminated beginning
in the 16th century.

108
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:04,661
About the mistreatment of the Indians
out about Spain's backwardness and

109
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:10,580
brutality, uh, and, and, and,
and so forth. Uh, your images,

110
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,690
the inquisition,

111
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,720
religious intolerance as certain
primitiveness and backwardness.

112
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,650
This is all embedded in the
English language. You're going to,

113
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,880
you cannot escape it.

114
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,020
It is full of what we call factoids,
things that are almost true but not quite.

115
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,130
We call factoids derisively of course.

116
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,620
Yet during the 16th and 17th centuries,

117
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,590
Spain Produce Serantes Velasquez,

118
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,800
the character of don't Huang
the picaresque or figures,

119
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,760
uh, authors or kinds of writing that
are at the core of the modern western

120
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:57,390
tradition. How could
that be? So the key hot,

121
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,660
they aided by Elliot Imperial's pain,
which you are,

122
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:05,661
I hope dutifully reading will help
dispel these perceptions as well as my

123
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:11,280
comments in the course.
Now,

124
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,310
let me clarify as much as possible the
confusion about terms such as novel and

125
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,350
Romance,

126
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,920
that confusion that is augmented by the
fact that they don't quite coincide with

127
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,180
their cognates in Spanish.

128
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:31,930
Cognates are a words in two different
languages at sound, the same, uh,

129
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,750
but then sometimes, uh, are not
the same, uh, uh, in meaning.

130
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,170
So romance is a term derived
from the name Rome of course,

131
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,110
meaning that originally these were works
written in the languages derive from

132
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,310
Latin, that is French, Spanish, Italian,

133
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,810
Portuguese and so forth.

134
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:02,811
So those are the importance that those
begin with the Webster's definition for

135
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,803
romance.

136
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,080
It says originally along narrative
inverse or pros written in one of the

137
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,670
romantic dialects.
It says in Webster's,

138
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,080
remember what I said about
language and dialect.

139
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:18,000
The language is a dialect with an army,
meaning that,

140
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,420
uh,

141
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,430
people who speak a certain dialect become
powerful enough and imposed it on the

142
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,600
rest of the population.

143
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,600
So originally a written in one of the
romance dialects about the adventures of

144
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:34,671
nights and other to evaluate heroes to
a fictitious tail dealing not so much

145
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:39,480
with everyday life, us with extraordinary
adventures or mysterious events.

146
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,420
That's the western definition of romance.

147
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,640
A popular dictionary of literary
terms gives the following,

148
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,250
uh,
for Romance Romance,

149
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:55,251
a fictional story in verse or prose
that relates improbable adventures of

150
00:10:55,681 --> 00:11:00,681
idealized characters in some remote or
enchanted setting or more generally a

151
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:04,890
tendency in fiction
opposed to that of realism.

152
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,740
Uncle.
Now etymologies are fun,

153
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,150
but they don't always clarify what a
word means in the present. And in fact,

154
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:17,720
sometimes words works.
Uh,

155
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,120
the tamales work against
such a clarification.

156
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,530
How many know, or how useful
is it to know that candidate?

157
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,240
The word candidate, for example,
derives from the Latin word,

158
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,980
can be reduced for Hawaii,

159
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,540
doesn't help you in the present to know
that at all helped you be pedantic if

160
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,060
you tell somebody or if you
bring it up in, uh, in that, uh,

161
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,310
in that party that I always mention
here at which a Yaley can be pedantic by

162
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:52,260
saying candid derives from Kunduz
in Latin, which means what?

163
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,633
Um,

164
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,950
or that is a very tough guys story
that you've told me in any case,

165
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,500
uh, in, in this case, knowing
that the term romance,

166
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,030
the rise from Rome and that, um, that it,

167
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,720
that it indicates that these stories
were written in the romance languages.

168
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,750
It does provide a historical insight.

169
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,470
Romances emerged after the breakup of the
Roman Empire during the Middle Ages as

170
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:30,091
the various national languages
are quiet individual identities.

171
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,010
So it,

172
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,390
so we have now a historical
period that the etymology,

173
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,330
romance gifts,
so in English romance beans,

174
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:47,331
a story with the linear plot and on
changing characters want to be sold to

175
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:52,180
follows another. And the heroes
and heroines remain the same.

176
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,270
This is the reason,
uh,

177
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,070
romances of chivalry are cold romances.

178
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,430
The romance form is
preferred by popular fiction.

179
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,720
And by works with an ideological
indoctrination purpose,

180
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,260
they are easy to follow
and their moral is clear.

181
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,410
Many cartoons, for instance, uh,

182
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,880
have the form of a romance cartoons,

183
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,530
comic books, novels. On the other hand,

184
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,390
our works in which there is a
clash between the characters,

185
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,780
the protagonist,
and the settings in which they move.

186
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:36,990
Remember the quotation from
Luke acts in my earlier lecture,

187
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,233
uh,

188
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,420
and in which the characters evolve as
the result of the actions in which they

189
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:52,270
are involved.
Characters and the romances don't change.

190
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:56,860
They're always heroic and so forth.
Characters in the novels do change,

191
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,420
uh, evolve, uh, uh,
because of, of the actual,

192
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,620
now,

193
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Vicky is the first such a case of this
clash between the protagonists on his,

194
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,720
uh, uh, uh, setting. Uh, uh,

195
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,220
although an argument can be made in favor
of the picaresque on a work that I'll

196
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:21,250
be mentioning today. Again, I
mentioned it in the last class,

197
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,860
last Ellis Celestina already, uh, uh,

198
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,910
has that clash between protagonist and
setting and there's change and characters

199
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:34,630
evolve, but the Quixote is
the first, uh, it's the first,

200
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,040
uh, case. Uh, now I think,

201
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,540
and I hope now we have,

202
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,310
I hope a clear terminological
distinction between normal and romance.

203
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,880
And you will understand
when I speak about them.

204
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,770
Now get confused when
we know that in English,

205
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,220
picturesque stories are
often called romances.

206
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,560
This is particularly among
English department types. Um,

207
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,750
while in Spanish we call him,
we called them no [inaudible] novels.

208
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,430
I will always refer to picaresque
tales as novels because they are,

209
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,690
uh, they are according to the
definitions that have given up off. Now,

210
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,830
if you know Spanish,

211
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,860
you may be further confused by the fact
that girl Muncie in Spanish is a ballad

212
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,970
and narrative. Originally popular
porn, like the English balance.

213
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,090
Okay.

214
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,750
So you must keep these
distinctions clear in mind.

215
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,130
If you happen to read something in Spanish
and you hear and he read Romancing,

216
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,610
it is not a romance in the sense that
I've been explaining it is a pawn.

217
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,150
Yeah. What was it? That donkey haughty.

218
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,790
So avidly wanted to become,

219
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,760
let me clarify too.

220
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,630
What did you valid romances were,

221
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,750
because this is something that is
taken for granted everyone or devalued,

222
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,170
no less.
That does clarify.

223
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:14,370
I like to clarify things and
to start from the ground up.

224
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,680
What is it that don't be hot?
They want it to become,

225
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:19,890
what is this whole business
of the romances of chivalry?

226
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,130
First as I did with the term the romance,

227
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,970
then we clarified the background
of the word ci, Val, Rick,

228
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,711
she valid.

229
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:36,711
Rick comes from the French word Chevelle
or horse and it reflects the fact that

230
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:42,270
the knights form of
transportation was the horse.

231
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,030
What does French up to do with
English? Well, William the conqueror,

232
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:52,590
the battle of Hastings, the invasion of
England by the French and all of that,

233
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:56,640
which you learned in, uh, elementary
school or high school, uh,

234
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:01,300
on the fact that English to French
is one of the sources of, uh,

235
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,770
of modern English. So, uh,

236
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,730
but the horse was more than
just a form of transportation.

237
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:10,950
It was an instrument of warfare,

238
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,160
a prize possession with
each having a sonorous name,

239
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,340
if at all possible.

240
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,280
The horse work was part
of the knights identity,

241
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,910
hence the whole business about naming his
horse at the beginning of the Quixote.

242
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,830
Now you understand that part, uh,

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,350
of the, uh, uh, culture of horses.

244
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,370
Was it kind of courtesy? Uh, so, uh,

245
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,210
we have in English also, uh,
uh, chivalrous for instance,

246
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,330
horses have always spawned a whole
culture of their own and have Laura left a

247
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:56,810
large imprint on languages because
there were the, the, the, the,

248
00:17:56,811 --> 00:18:00,390
the principal mode of transportation
to the part of the 20th century.

249
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,600
You can imagine. So, uh,

250
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,030
so technically a etymology clichy
Valerie [inaudible] is a horsey romance

251
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,140
or more appropriately
romances about horsemen.

252
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,860
Uh,
in Spanish,

253
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:24,300
the etymology is clearer as the romances
of chivalry are simply goal. Nobody,

254
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,430
Dick [inaudible] and [inaudible] is
the workforce for horse in Spanish now

255
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,280
evaluate the romances or in Spanish?
No,

256
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,670
as they go by and he asked where the
popular literature over the late Middle

257
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:43,671
Ages and early renaissance who's
dissemination was greatly aided by the

258
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:46,620
development of print.

259
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,310
I'm talking about the
14th and 15th centuries.

260
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,060
The printing presses or you
don't doubt? No doubt. No.

261
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,770
What's developed in the 15th century
making available to many readers books,

262
00:18:58,771 --> 00:18:59,970
including the Bible,

263
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,180
which only a very few had access before
we had a copy of the Gutenberg Bible in

264
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:10,470
our own Beinecke library.
If you went to go look at it

265
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,541
now,

266
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:17,340
this development of the printing press
had a decisive impact on literature

267
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:21,510
because it increased, its
different, it's this dissemination,

268
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,320
so the Quixote and the knoll in general
owe their existence to this invention.

269
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,380
As we can see by the impact,

270
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,650
the romances of chivalry hat on our hero
and the large number of them that he

271
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:42,480
had in his library. If you've got really
chapter on the scrutiny of his love,

272
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,750
the library,
the romances of chivalry,

273
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:50,550
where the first best sellers,
they are entertaining.

274
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:55,020
And I encourage you to read one or
two if you have, uh, if you have time,

275
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,123
uh,

276
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,330
now that you valued romances originated
in France and do you ride from the

277
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:07,920
homeowner or courtly romance?

278
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,870
Coahoma Google in French [inaudible],
uh,

279
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,630
eventually became the name for novel,

280
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,370
but go home and Cook Twat or courtly
romance was the narrative inverse,

281
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,040
which was the favorite of feudal lords,

282
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,660
no longer engaged in military exploits
who looked back with nostalgia to a

283
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:30,750
heroic age.
The same as don Quixote will.

284
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,140
The Hemanchu Twan took it steams from
classical legends such as the Trojan wars

285
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,060
or the exploits of Alexander
the great even Oriental Tales,

286
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,990
but it preferred themes
derived from Britain legends,

287
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:50,590
legends from Brittany such as
that of Tristan and Isolde.

288
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,280
The nights in pursuit of the holy grail
grail like Parsifal and Maryland and

289
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,600
Lancet road or Arthurian
tales about Arthur,

290
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,010
the real or imaginary King of Britain
and the knights of the round table.

291
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,600
You have heard about all of these.

292
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,530
All of these adventures take
place in a fantastic atmosphere,

293
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:12,190
shrouded in a vague kind
of lyricists and poetry.

294
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,650
When these hormone trois,
remember embarrassed and so forth,

295
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,770
were turned into prose narratives.

296
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,520
The romance that you've all read
romances appeared each of these books.

297
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,560
How does a hero in knight errant
that incarnated heroism, Hammertoe,

298
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,430
fidelity, and what's the defender
of justice and of the oppressed?

299
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,920
The night was involved in the most
extraordinary adventures against fantastic

300
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,570
and frightening wrongdoers.

301
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,470
He's passionate love for an
idealized lady dominated.

302
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:51,670
He's thought love was a fundamental
component of these narratives.

303
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,090
The night would offer to his lady.
The glory of his fix.

304
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,910
This love for a lady is the same as
courtly love, which as you may know,

305
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,580
is buyer the medieval lyric.

306
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,540
Okay.

307
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,370
And, uh, what's a fashion, uh,
involving all sorts of rituals,

308
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,750
uh, in the courts of elegant ladies? Uh,

309
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,400
it's too long a story to be
told, but, uh, think that the,

310
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,940
the romances of jewelry are, uh, uh, uh,

311
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,250
a shot through as it were,
with the idea of, of,

312
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,810
of courtly love.
This,

313
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,720
we're not just a military heroes,

314
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:40,310
but they were also great lovers in Spain.
They were,

315
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,500
uh, two notable antecedents do the
romances of chivalry in the 15,

316
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:49,880
the in the 14th century
[inaudible] see far,

317
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:52,140
but these are should not concern,

318
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,000
concern during the 14th century,

319
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,410
all of the European books of
chivalry were disseminated in Spain,

320
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,830
uh, in, uh, adaptations and translations,

321
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,980
particularly those of
the blood tone or cycle.

322
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,940
The most significant chivalry romance
in terms of circulation and influence as

323
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,990
well as impact on the Kihatha was ama.

324
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,010
This the gala about which you will hear
and read a lot throughout this semester

325
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
because he is don't be
hopeless chief model.

326
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,313
Okay.

327
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,060
Which was first it was
written around 1492.

328
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,850
That'd be rocky year when
so many things happened. Uh,

329
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,250
but was published in 1508 in Saragossa.

330
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,940
It is known that there were stories about,

331
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:53,941
I'm Elisa Qa dating as far back as the
early 14th century and Montalvo who has

332
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:56,150
its author,
uh,

333
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,990
estates in the prologue that he took
the story written by several authors,

334
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,930
divided it into four
books and recasted it,

335
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,170
adding a few touches and a fifth book
about planned young and Melissa's son,

336
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,340
the chivalric romances
current did have many sequels,

337
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,030
much like today's soap
operas and television,

338
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,800
and responding to the same kind
of demand from the public. Uh,

339
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,110
this could end here. We want more,
more, I'm at least adventurous. We want,

340
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:30,770
I'm a decent sons at ventures and so
forth. Uh, in fact, all popular fiction,

341
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,940
uh, from, uh, Sherlock
Holmes to James bombed, uh,

342
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,610
is sequential in this fashion,

343
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,860
which is the reason why soap operas
are derisively called in Spanish Cooler

344
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Varonis from lever I snake because it's
a snake that goes on and on and on.

345
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,480
And so this was the way that the
romances of chivalry, as you saw, uh,

346
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,870
if you have, if you read the chapter
on the scrutiny of the library,

347
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,790
the MIDC is a very free and application
of novels from the Britain Cycle.

348
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,080
It is a complex network of the most
varied and marvelous adventures.

349
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,710
Uh, it tells the story of
his, uh, of his birth, uh,

350
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,480
virtually in the river because he's thrown
in the river from which he is. I said,

351
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:18,470
baby, uh, to hide his mother's sin
because a, they were not married.

352
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:22,100
His parents are where a king
and a queen. And, uh, uh, he's,

353
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,920
he's rescued and trained
us. I say, uh, uh, uh,

354
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,430
as a night, uh, in, in
combat. Uh, then he,

355
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:34,630
he falls in love with Arianna.

356
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,190
Arianna becomes his beloved.

357
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:41,600
So I'm at least an Ariana is one
of the great couples of literary,

358
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,530
uh, history. He is put
through all kinds of,

359
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,590
of trials, uh, on the, he's
enchanted and disenchanted.

360
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,580
Uh,

361
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,580
and he is a most loyal and faithful
of lovers against all temptations from

362
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:02,990
various, uh, uh, uh,
a lady's, uh, in fact,

363
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:07,310
he, uh, is, uh, forced, uh,

364
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,330
to go, uh, through the
arch of faithful lovers,

365
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,280
uh, which could only be crossed by
lovers who had been absolutely faithful.

366
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,990
Uh,
so how many people can go through it,

367
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,910
uh, and, and so forth.
This is what is in Tokyo,

368
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:30,090
this imagination and
desires, this figure, uh,

369
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,370
of this invincible,

370
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:36,350
a hero who's noble on a great a lover.
Uh,

371
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,630
and, uh, this book was so
important in the 16th century,

372
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,470
uh, that it'd be good, acquire
it didactic value. I mean,

373
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,090
it was a, uh, use as a
model for department,

374
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,360
uh, and for courtesy
even more so. It's, it's,

375
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,550
we're past the model
for a courtly behavior,

376
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,510
uh,

377
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,400
which was written by a great it
Hallean writer called Baldassarre.

378
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:09,810
Castiglione. [inaudible]
is one of, uh, several,

379
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,430
uh, uh, important renaissance figures that
you're going to be hearing about here.

380
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:15,870
His last name is written like this.

381
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,730
Okay.

382
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,020
And his book is called the courtroom
and it was published in 15, 28.

383
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,840
Uh, it, it, it was a very
important book. Uh, but the Ama,

384
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:34,841
this was much more fun to
read and therefore in soar
past got Costa units book

385
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,630
as a source of, uh, models for department,

386
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:44,610
for people in the courts. Um, so

387
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,043
yeah,

388
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,580
it is for all these reasons,
it's not the Ama Lisa chief great success.

389
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,470
I'm on the greatest in Spanish literature
and many express their amelioration

390
00:27:55,471 --> 00:28:00,320
for it in gray, including great
political, uh, an intellectual, uh,

391
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,810
figures.
It was for the readers of the time,

392
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:08,160
the only possibility for innovation,
the only food for their fantasy,

393
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,700
the romances of jewelry
were in the 16th century.

394
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,430
What movies and television
shows are for us today.

395
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,830
But the romances and Amaris in
particular had their detractors.

396
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,190
Spoilsports are everywhere all the time.

397
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,940
Who saw in such book a
threat to public morals.

398
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,690
Uh,
they became a topic of debate.

399
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,800
And this is behind the role.
I'm at this place in the Quixote.

400
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,300
And the reason why I said Avantis
says that he writing his book,

401
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,560
uh, against them to, uh, uh,

402
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,190
make fun of them in such a way that
people will not read them anymore.

403
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,240
He's entering the,

404
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,480
supposedly the debate about the value
or lack there off of the romances of,

405
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,650
of Ho, of jewelry. So No,

406
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,580
I hope you have a clearer idea of what
it was a donkey halted, wanted to become.

407
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,770
So it's not vague. What he wants
to please is clearer and concrete.

408
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,720
I suppose in modern day Don Quixote
would like to be James Bond,

409
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,183
um,

410
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,550
because we have to assume a modern Alonzo
Kiano to be middle aged and to have

411
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:24,870
grown up with, uh, uh, James
Bond as the, as the image of,

412
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,310
of, of heroism. I read that, that, uh,

413
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,890
Senator Kennedy in the last
hours of his life or days, uh,

414
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,050
would watch bond movies for entertainment.

415
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,590
Obviously for a man of his age,
a James Bond was the,

416
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,240
the, the, the, the we of
heroism and the devil, Nah.

417
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:51,040
Or good looking, all the women fall for
him and that sort of thing. So if you,

418
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,330
I guess maybe your parents or
your grandparents, not you,

419
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,800
if you want it to become like you hoped
they would, they would want to be a, uh,

420
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,930
a James Bond.
Now

421
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,630
I'm at least was the most obvious and
allowed by Serantes precursor of the

422
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,660
Quixote in Spanish, but what were, uh,

423
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,800
set Vantis his predecessors
among a more serious Spanish,

424
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,900
uh, literary work, which
were the, the Spanish works.

425
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,230
That's the rant. This
had red absorbed, uh,

426
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,230
incorporated into his
own literary, uh, uh, uh,

427
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,030
project.
I have mentioned some of these.

428
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:38,350
I want to mention them again because I
want to lay the groundwork in the most

429
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:42,640
thorough way possible
so that, you know, uh,

430
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,290
the first was last sale Stena,
which I mentioned in the last class.

431
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,850
Uh,
now it has several titles,

432
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,240
but I think I settled for less.
Ellis Tina,

433
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,680
which is from 1499 written by Fernando.

434
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,110
Hurdle hus
is of indeterminate jaw.

435
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,360
The closest description
would be a dramatic dialogue.

436
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,770
Last Ellis Tina is the most
significant precursor to survive this.

437
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,080
It is a tragic story of two lovers,

438
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:19,030
two young lovers Callisto in Maryvale
who comes to make their love under the

439
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:24,031
guidance of a go between the protagonist
Sally's Tina [inaudible] and all whore

440
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,810
madame of a whorehouse and which,

441
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,190
but in spite of these
unsavory characteristics,

442
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,700
she is the heroine of the
work. This is the most, uh,

443
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,940
original,
uh,

444
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,010
aspect of this work that the protagonist
is an old whore go between which and so

445
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,491
forth.
Still,

446
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:50,360
she is the heroine in the
sense that use willful and uh,

447
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,150
and uh, goes to, it goes against the fate.

448
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,190
And now there is a clear,

449
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,690
a clash between neoplatonic notions
of love, typical of the, uh,

450
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,940
of the renaissance and,

451
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:07,420
and the court integration and the sordid
and cynical view of humankind and of

452
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,650
love in particular,

453
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,710
Celestina controls the whole city
because she controls people's erotic,

454
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,560
uh, adventures. There are
two worlds, not have salad,

455
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:23,470
Stena the servants and horse and,
uh,

456
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,460
that of the lovers Calisto and many
ways parents, we tried the gentry.

457
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:29,370
So there is also a class clash here.

458
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,430
Calisto Jackie Haldane they're
making because he wants to play act.

459
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,170
The role of the courtly lover he's
killed when he falls off a wall.

460
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,620
The wall of cell garden where
he has been making love to her,

461
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,960
uh,

462
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,590
cell is the billionaire commit suicide
on Selestica is murdered by the servants

463
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,100
because she has swindled them to,
uh,

464
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,130
sell Latinos a pitiless book that,
uh,

465
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:00,080
with what can already be called
a, a realistic, uh, quality.

466
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,370
I'll talk about realism in a minute.
The second important work

467
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,940
is the other one that I mentioned,

468
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,150
but I want to now mention
more clearly lovey.

469
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,400
They last Saturday,

470
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:24,150
Nelson Lasa Bdo,

471
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,160
they totally miss.
This is the first picaresque novel,

472
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,380
no known author. Uh, it is, uh,

473
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,750
the life told to a judge as
in a deposition by a petty
criminal to justify his

474
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:45,180
current status. He at the end, from
the perspective that he writes,

475
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:49,860
is married to the arch mistress.
So he is a front,

476
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,710
he's a couple. The husband who is
compliant with societies, he park reeses,

477
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,130
uh, Lossa your tells his life from
birth to the present. What he writes.

478
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,480
This is a life, a scene from the
perspective of a low class individual,

479
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:07,680
a criminal who learned his tricks from
his first master who was ironically a

480
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:12,060
blind man. Guzman. They'll farace.

481
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,320
I won't give you the whole title,

482
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:17,820
but this is good enough because this
is how it is known is the second most

483
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:21,780
important picaresque novel
that I want to Minster.

484
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,973
Okay.

485
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,220
[inaudible] 15,
54

486
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,790
g nine to nine before Guzman got Russia,

487
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,543
uh,

488
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:44,520
is a four part Pawlik stale of a
criminal toll in the first person also

489
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,840
following the formula. But the
difference is that here, the life is,

490
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,980
is told after a religious
conversion to the good.

491
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,630
So the story of Guzman's life is laced
with sermons about where he went wrong

492
00:34:57,631 --> 00:34:59,190
and ways to improve his morals.

493
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,890
But this retrospective moralizing is
always tempered by the appeal of the

494
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:07,260
stories about sin.
Sin Is more interesting always.

495
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,310
Guzman became the model picaresque
instead of anthesis time. Um,

496
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,490
there are clear allusion
steward in the hotel.

497
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,600
This is why you can see the genealogy
within the Spanish tradition.

498
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,580
Now what these words works,

499
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:29,520
a show is the emergence and
development of realism as we know it.

500
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,600
And we should be continued
in the work of Servantez,

501
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,630
particularly Vicky Haughty and a lead
all the way through to the 17th and 18th

502
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:44,550
century or 19th century
novels. I mean, here, this is
the beginning of realism. Uh,

503
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,350
its emergence in my view,

504
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:51,030
has a great deal to do with the Catholic
kings about whom you're reading.

505
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:54,420
And Elliot, the formation of
a new modern state with a,

506
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,870
with a large bureaucracy
and, and a very, uh,

507
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,270
large, also peanut, uh, uh,

508
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,100
not only peanut cultural but penal
institutions to punish this, uh,

509
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,290
uh, uh, this, this, this criminals, um,

510
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,200
a Spanish criminologist called Rafael
Sally just in the 19th century,

511
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,200
link's the picker risk with the
birth of the social sciences.

512
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:25,570
He thinks that in the picaresque
and in this kind of novel,

513
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,990
we have the beginnings of the
study of society as criminology,

514
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:35,500
sociology, and so forth, would
study it in later centuries.

515
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,730
But this is the origin.

516
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:41,860
Okay.

517
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,190
Here in this,
uh,

518
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:48,400
in this work that is a search
for truth about human nature. In,

519
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:53,401
so in the social commerce of people
at the lowest possible levels where

520
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,680
civilization as it were,
has barely reached.

521
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,191
Uh,

522
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:04,191
there is an emphasis on the material
and the sordid in this works against

523
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,380
neoplatonic conceptuals of,

524
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,840
of humankind that are more
typical of the renaissance,

525
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,720
the sordid,
the ugly,

526
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,750
the dirty becomes aesthetically valuable
and appealing in this realistic works

527
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,190
in the behavior of the characters,
uh,

528
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:29,100
their actions, uh, and also, uh,

529
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,420
their attitudes.

530
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,900
The point is that this sort of probe into
the social is an attempt to uncover a

531
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:42,301
truth about the human no longer available
in the ancient classical literature or

532
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:45,420
its imitators in the renaissance.

533
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,930
It goes against that kind
of version of the human.

534
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,540
Okay.

535
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,220
This is too complicated, but
it is, but we'll get to it.
As semester evolves, it is,

536
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:56,640
uh,
uh,

537
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,560
rejection parallel to that of the car
as he formulates his philosophy of the

538
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:06,330
self when he sort of erases,
received, uh, to tradition.

539
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,510
Uh, but, uh, I will leave that,

540
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,560
I'll put that in the back burner
and we will get to it eventually.

541
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,550
In realism,
common common objects.

542
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,500
You will see common objects in
the Quixote appear frequently.

543
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,120
This begins, we sell is
Tina and uh, but it's, it's,

544
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,170
but it's a world mostly of the picaresque
through which Don Quixote passes the

545
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:33,560
characters. Accessories, uh,

546
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,870
are what endowed description of
this world with an aura of reality.

547
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,960
What did what, what they have, uh,

548
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,490
Sanchez wine skin for instance,
uh,

549
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,560
and so forth.
Uh,

550
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,010
liberals look for such common
objects as you read Dicky Halter,

551
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:53,530
you will see there is a focus on them.

552
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,570
Okay.

553
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,590
This is a parallel to a
development in painting,

554
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:05,800
which began with the work of Leo
Battista Alberti known as Alberti.

555
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,220
I'll just do this in passing, but I will
allude to it more during the semester.

556
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,410
Okay.

557
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,243
You wrote

558
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,310
a treatise called the peak Tuta

559
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,560
in very simplistic terms for Albertie
nearly invented was the sense of

560
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:31,340
perspective.
That is that that objects up here,

561
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,760
uh, in different sizes with, uh,

562
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:41,050
depending on where they
are in reference to a pawn,

563
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,800
the fleet boom to the vanishing
point in English, it'll come to me.

564
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,250
And so you understand objects according
to Albert t a r to appear in painting,

565
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:53,234
not flat,

566
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,140
uh,
uh,

567
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,290
as they appeared in
medieval painting board

568
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,230
in relation to how they appear to the
observer and how they are arranged

569
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,520
according to perspective hands,

570
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:11,650
objects appear now in all
their fullness when all there,

571
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,100
the roundness in all
their weight and measure.

572
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,240
This is a form of realism
that begins in painting.

573
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:24,010
Deputy Tuta is from
1435, 15th century. Uh,

574
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,950
Albert teak,
a harder,

575
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,510
an enormous influence on the
history of painting part on,

576
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,060
on philosophy too. I mean this was a way
of conceiving the perception of objects.

577
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,030
Also subject to time because,

578
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,310
because perspective in space
involves also extensive of time.

579
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,960
If something is back here and
something is here, this is closer,

580
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:54,280
I can get to it faster than I get to that.
If you understand what I mean. So this,

581
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,410
this is a now this is if you,
if you have seen Velasquez paintings,

582
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:03,880
I'm sure some of you have, you will,
you will remember how those objects are,

583
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:08,610
are uh, uh, just common everyday
objects. Suddenly how, um,

584
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,360
a full miss now, this is what will
appear in these novels in the cortex.

585
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,460
And this is part of the development
of, uh, of, of, of realism.

586
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,530
Now,
uh,

587
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,740
you will see that the, yeah,
this is a cliche about Spanish,

588
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,480
uh, literature of the Golden Age,
16th, 17th century. What will prevail.

589
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:37,370
It's a between this realistic conception
of vision of the world and the

590
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:41,400
idealistic a conception, uh, uh, uh,

591
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,850
that comes through the
neoplatonic tradition.

592
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,820
And that is the Taro say
embodied in donkey hotel. Okay.

593
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,260
Hottest an ideas perspective. And
Sanctuary is the realistic perspective.

594
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,040
A sanctuary is close to the material,
to the world,

595
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,640
materials that he wants to
eat if he possibly can. Uh,

596
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,980
while Don Quixote doesn't eat meat,
doesn't need to eat,

597
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:05,040
he lives in a world of ideas, but of
course they influence each other. Uh,

598
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:09,380
as you will see, this is one
of the great, uh, uh, uh,

599
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,870
things about the [inaudible] that
this character's influence each other.

600
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,790
So we could say that that is overall
the overarching clash in this works of

601
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,230
Spanish literature.

602
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,250
But keep in mind above all the
what I've said about realistic,

603
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:27,251
because realism will be one of the
triumphs of serve anthesis work.

604
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,300
Now let us finally turn to the Quixote.

605
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:32,811
I assume,

606
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:37,811
and I hope that you have read at least
the first few chapters and that by the

607
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:42,980
next lecture you will have read the
first 10 chapters as well as the assigned

608
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:46,070
readings in the case book,
which will give you a background.

609
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:50,360
I said Lantus is life that I'm not
giving you here. Uh, as well as other,

610
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,110
uh, materials. And of course,
the first chapter in Elliot,

611
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,940
which I think is now the prologue,
the prologue,

612
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,990
this 16 or five priorities.

613
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,040
One of the most important and famous
texts in Spanish literature and products

614
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:09,020
are very important always for Savantas.
Why?

615
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,060
Because of his concern about
the relationship between
creator and his creation.

616
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,140
And he's concerned about the
nature of the self, his own self,

617
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,290
which is a very renaissance preoccupation,

618
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,430
said Advantis products are
very much like montañas essays.

619
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,950
Now I've mentioned Castiglioni. Uh, I've,

620
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,100
I've now I mentioned Montanian,

621
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,760
these are great renaissance figures that
in the context of which advantage road,

622
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:40,760
and you have to remember
the custom Yoni Montagnier.

623
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,263
Uh,

624
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,000
and it is here that on introduces
one of his favorite tropes,

625
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:56,600
one that runs through the
whole of the Quixote irony.

626
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,700
Uh,
this is a very ironic prologue.

627
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,020
Uh,

628
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,020
we just conveyed through a very seductive
kind of self deprecation instead of

629
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,563
aunties.

630
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:11,650
Yeah.

631
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,320
Uh, [inaudible] begins,
I don't reader Jarvis,

632
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:21,070
miss translates this gentle reader in your
translation, but it's there. So Paolo,

633
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,860
like Tor, uh, I don't read her,

634
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,530
said vantage assumes a reader who
comes to his book for entertainment,

635
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:32,370
not instruction and who
reads for not for work.

636
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,890
This is a novelty and a kind of challenge
in a period when the function of

637
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:42,780
literature was very much an
issue discussed by secular
and religious moralists.

638
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:48,380
But we soon see that was advantage
means by entertainment does not preclude

639
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:53,661
consideration of very thorny ethical
issues that involve reading and literature

640
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,670
in general. Uh, this,

641
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,910
these issues emerge
immediately in the prologue.

642
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,770
It is typical of Cervantes and you can
expect to see it in the rest of the work,

643
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:09,390
uh, to deal lightly and
humorously with weighty issues.

644
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,370
This is one of his constituents.

645
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,670
He's able to deal with Larry grave
issues in a very light and humorous way.

646
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,020
That is his perspective.
It's part of is ironic perspective.

647
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,460
Now the prologue, oh look what comes
first. It's a kind of epilogue.

648
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,790
Uh, it was written, uh, obviously, uh,
after he finished the book. This is,

649
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,110
uh,

650
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,110
you cannot take for granted the sequential
order of things as you read them.

651
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,500
They are sequential in a conventional way.

652
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,170
It doesn't mean the product
that's the vantage. Sat down,

653
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:46,200
wrote the prologue and then wrote the
novel he wrote in Oval and then wrote the

654
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:50,070
prologue to ponder about
what he had just finished.

655
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:57,450
Now there is a, in, in
the, in in the prologue,

656
00:45:57,451 --> 00:46:01,920
a tone of a prevailing theme of doubt,
which is again,

657
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:06,270
an echo of, uh, of Montana. Uh,

658
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,940
now pass.

659
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,080
This explains the self deprecating
statements about his own creation and

660
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,030
inventive powers.
You know,

661
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:17,910
that they are weak and that what
else could he produce? And so forth.

662
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:22,170
At the very first paragraph
where he belittles himself, uh,

663
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,400
it is very much like Montagnier because
when 10 years stance is very modern

664
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,260
Montagnier rights with the resignation
of knowing that he will never out to do

665
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:33,000
the classics. By the way, there is a,

666
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,710
there is a very instructive piece
of Montana in the latest New Yorker

667
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:43,800
in the latest New Yorker. I mean,
don't, 10 is still very relevant, uh,

668
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,250
on, uh, speaks to the modern, uh, mine.

669
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,640
Um, he writes with the
resignation of knowing that he
will never do the classics,

670
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:57,990
that he will never really know
the truth even about himself.

671
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,680
And that received knowledge is
of dubious value. For instance,

672
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,370
he and his famous essay
called uncanny balls,

673
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,180
he asks what business the
Europeans have an imposing.

674
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:12,630
Their religious doctors are natives of
the new world who had been getting along

675
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:14,430
just fine with their own beliefs.

676
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,920
And he says that it is worse school to
roast people alive as Europeans do to

677
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:24,630
torture them, done to roast them
once they're there and eat them. Um,

678
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,670
and uh, of course he's, he's
right about, about that. Uh,

679
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,870
he's a relativist in a post Copenhagen,

680
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:39,010
a world in which I'm still talking about
Montana in which we know that the earth

681
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:43,180
is not the center of universe pence,
human kindness at the center,

682
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,170
either in the way that it was
believed to be before in his prologue.

683
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,400
70 sounds very much like long
tenure. Who, if it was not a source,

684
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,440
it was clearly a kindred spirit.

685
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,370
They were both hamlet like in
their display of doubt. Of course,

686
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:59,300
Shakespeare had red mom Pena.

687
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,770
Now who is this friend who
suddenly appears in the prologue?

688
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:08,200
Of course it's a made
up friend, is a, is a,

689
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,550
is that an imaginary friend that's a
randos invents a on to turn the prologue

690
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,990
into a story, uh, and uh,

691
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,820
in which is going to discuss how to
route right a prolo while writing the

692
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:26,710
prologue. And that is the, the whole
joke behind this was a big joke.

693
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,120
Uh, so the, this was fun.

694
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:36,121
Both of telling stories rather than
expounding on doctrine and have dialogue.

695
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,200
He loved dialogue, uh, uh,

696
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:43,900
of having a topic discussed
from various points of view.

697
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:46,060
This will be throughout
the whole of the chaotic.

698
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,770
And we have it already in the prologue.

699
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,480
He has a dialogue with his imaginary
friend is having a dialogue with himself

700
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:55,420
and he's created this thing as
we do occasionally, you know,

701
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:59,970
create an imaginary friend or
someone with whom we speak on,

702
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,920
which is just a virtue and
another version of ourselves.

703
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,650
Yeah.

704
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,030
Different points of view.

705
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,600
A savant Savantas likes these things
that are being discussed from different

706
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:13,140
points of viewers. You
will see, uh, now the main,

707
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:18,260
the main topic of the prologue is the
genesis and intention of the book. Uh,

708
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:23,410
a common topic for a prologue only that
here it is told as the issue of how to

709
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:28,120
write a prologue is
discussed. Uh, there is, uh,

710
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,470
no, there is an apparent contradiction
here at the beginning said,

711
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,740
when says this book could be other than
my black myself because I'm his father.

712
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,401
Then he says,
no,

713
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:43,260
I'm the stepfather by which he means
that is merely merely the transcriber of

714
00:49:43,261 --> 00:49:45,150
this book by see the unmetered billing.

715
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:50,151
Kelly is fictitious morrish author about
whom you will hear a lot in the book.

716
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,100
Uh,

717
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,200
this is the first of many disclaimers
of authorship in the Quixote.

718
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,860
Uh,

719
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:05,160
what Cervantes is probing here
is the genesis of literature,

720
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,200
the genealogy of invention,

721
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,290
which can no longer be taking it for
granted as following the rules of,

722
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,160
uh,
of renaissance poetics.

723
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,400
In what way does a book
belonged to its author?

724
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:24,110
This is why I said Vantis marks the usual
front matter of other books in which

725
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,350
authors boast of their area,

726
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:29,610
audition and others to attest to
the quality of the production. They,

727
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,170
the whole business that is talking about
all these sonnets that he could have

728
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:36,200
asked other people to write for
him and so forth. By the way,

729
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,490
those songs exist in the book and the
left out of the, uh, of the translation,

730
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:45,020
the front matter in a book is everything
from the title all the way to the

731
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:47,750
beginning of the book prologue,
preface, acknowledgement.

732
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:52,100
It's called the front matter loss,
preliminaries in Spanish.

733
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:56,780
If you want to learn that in
Spanish, uh, this, uh, this,

734
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,770
um, sonnets about the book in praise
of the book or like today's Blurbs,

735
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:06,150
you pick up a book and you find that
there are some blurbs. Roberto, Sally,

736
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:11,170
Julia says there is a praise
and what has happened is that,

737
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,180
uh, the, the, the person
blurbing the book, uh,

738
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,460
has been one of the readers will the
press to accept or another book and then

739
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:21,140
they ask you to,
uh,

740
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,890
to excerpt something from your
report and put her in the back.

741
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:29,210
All our times they just send
you the book and say, please,

742
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,340
would you write a blurb
blurb for this book?

743
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:35,580
Many people are in many people who
do it without reading the book. Oh,

744
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:38,120
one of the greatest, you know, and
they just write. So it's the same here.

745
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:39,680
This is what said,
this is marketing.

746
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:44,960
But what he does is instead of
going outside for legitimation,

747
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,170
he has literary characters,
right?

748
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,560
The sonnets in praise of his book.

749
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,790
It's as if I wrote a book and I,
and I had a,

750
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:58,370
a blurb from James Bond to,
to continue with our,

751
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,320
with our fictional character.
What is doing is showing
that literature is solved,

752
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,220
the legitimating,

753
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,910
he's not going outside of fiction and
excited of literature for legitimation,

754
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:13,210
but it's using this literary
characters to be those who,

755
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,140
uh, place. Uh, the book is another game,

756
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:22,260
another, uh, a joke that
he is playing on the river.

757
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,180
So what else does the,
what does the,

758
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,770
the friend tell him to do?

759
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,040
The friend tells him to make up his
own sonnets and also to make up a false

760
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:36,110
bibliography.
I said Guerra and put on the margins,

761
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,610
all of these sources that
he never, uh, consulted,

762
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,280
uh,
as if you created a false,

763
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:47,620
we don't have a fee for a paper that
you've written. Uh, he says, yeah, what?

764
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,340
This, this is a, this is a joke. It's very
amusing joke, but it's also very serious.

765
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,470
What the, what the friend is telling
Saran disease. Forget about tradition.

766
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,330
Forget about Aristotle. Aristotle
never wrote about romances of Jibo.

767
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,950
You're doing something new.
You can just make it all up.

768
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,750
This is what the prior August,

769
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:14,120
that kind of money festival for the kind
of book that they Quixote's the kind of

770
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,870
original new book that it is,
that it can break with tradition.

771
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,940
The brentech make it all up.

772
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,040
I hope you don't take this
seriously yourselves in your
own big geographies when

773
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:30,000
write your papers. But this is nick.
This is the advice that different gifts.

774
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,090
He says, Oh, I thought
that you were Weiss. No,

775
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:38,091
what you have to do is this and that is
now there are digs there and low pay.

776
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:39,161
The they guy,

777
00:53:39,161 --> 00:53:43,710
remember I mentioned him in an earlier
class Lopei who was a very successful

778
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,490
playwright. He was rich, famous and vain.

779
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,850
And uh,
as a rant,

780
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:54,450
this is taking a dig at him because
apparently Lopei got himself some the

781
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,910
sorrows compendia of quotations,

782
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,050
familiar quotations and use
them in his works to make, uh,

783
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,700
to make it seem like he was very
erudite and learn it and not,

784
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,800
I also added the Gay Lopez.
They,

785
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:12,630
they got to his last name to make it seem
as if we were an aristocrat. You know,

786
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:17,060
the D in Spanish, in French,
Spanish or German, Vaughn, uh,

787
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:21,690
indicates, uh, aristocracy. So he's
taking a dig at Lopez and data in terror.

788
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,880
Lobeck lobby was just saw successful,

789
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:26,490
successful and lobby had also said
a few disparate and thing about.

790
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,960
But all of that is to sort of contingent
important thing in the prologue.

791
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:35,520
Is that the same way with tradition?
I'm beginning here a new,

792
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,170
I can make it up.
That is the whole point of the,

793
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,360
uh, now, uh,

794
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:48,600
I am going to end by simply alluding
to the beginning of the book.

795
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:54,170
The birth of Don Quixote is an act
of self invention by a man of 50.

796
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,710
At the age 50 was a very advanced age.

797
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:03,360
Age expectancy didn't go beyond late
thirties, early forties, at the time.

798
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,100
So,
uh,

799
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:10,170
this is also conventional with Savannah
is his own age. He's in his late fifties.

800
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:13,980
When he publishes his book. He
says that in the prologue, uh,

801
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,500
it says lack of self invention.
My amount of 15,

802
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,710
he feels free to create
himself beyond family.

803
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,380
We don't know anything. We don't learn
anything about Don Quixote is family.

804
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,860
Only about his niece.
But we learn anything about his,

805
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,750
his parents know about his birth,
know about his needs.

806
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,180
No.
Uh,

807
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,610
Cervan Cervantes has created
a hero who is beyond Freud,

808
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:47,340
uh, beyond Freud's family romance.
You know, and Freud's theories,

809
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:49,950
the family romance is
Mommy, Daddy, and the child.

810
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,480
The boy is in love with Miami and all
of that. That is the family romance.

811
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,120
And you go through life with a resentment
of daddy or your love or secret love

812
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,680
for money and all of that. That's
the family romance. This is,

813
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,350
this is a mock version of Freud,

814
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,060
but Cervantes says character is
born beyond Freud. When you're 50,

815
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:12,510
who cares about your parents and
all of that. You are who you are.

816
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,150
And not only is he who hears,

817
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,420
but he wills himself to be
something else at the age of 50.

818
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:22,890
It is important that donkey,
how to be that old is,

819
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:27,800
can you think of another literary
hero who is that old cell?

820
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:32,010
Stina but she was,
she had a US co protagonist,

821
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:33,250
the two young lovers,

822
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:38,670
but now protagonists were either
men in their full strength,

823
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:43,450
like Ulysses. An Ia is, uh, the
pilgrim in the divine comedy.

824
00:56:43,451 --> 00:56:47,230
I think it's three, three,
uh, the, not an old land.

825
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,480
Uh,
why?

826
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:55,170
Because it's his self invention is an
act of will based on nothing isn't beyond

827
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,050
all of the pressures
of family and of need.

828
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,460
And this is why he can invent himself.

829
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,160
Uh,
Doki holders,

830
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,300
drew family and genealogy
is the books that he read.
