1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,910
I said in my last lecture,

2
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:07,680
and as you have already,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm sure seen Vicky Haughty has,
uh,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,820
two, uh, overarching plot. Uh,

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,750
one is the story of the mad you
[inaudible] go and his choir.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,010
Uh, and the story about
the writing of the novel,

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,490
the one about the insane don
Quixote will acquire a coherence,

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,730
uh,
after the fight with the Caner us.

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,770
Jarvis caused it in your translation
because he and his choir will now be

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,740
pursued by the holy brotherhood.

11
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:54,741
I will explain what the Holy Brotherhood
is and by the priest and the barber,

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,690
uh,
his neighbors,

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,720
the priest and the barber wants to return
along Suki Hanno to his home in that,

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,640
uh,
on named village in Lamont Chia,

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,710
the episode about the lost manuscript
and the search for the balance of the

16
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:18,711
story the manuscript found and his
translation follow themes mentioned in the

17
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,860
prologue about the books,
authorship.

18
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,410
You will also have noticed
how, uh, Cervantes, uh,

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,130
has a place with the
division of the chapters.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,720
They seem to be arbitrary. Uh,
they seem to be very whimsical.

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,160
These are all winks at the reader,
uh,

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
telling him that this is a very artful,

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,190
artificial and fictional
work. Obviously, also,

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,840
many of these divisions were made after
the manuscript was, uh, was finished.

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,310
Uh, scholars have worked on
this and come to a conclusion,

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,940
uh,
in the context of the business,

27
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,720
of finding the manuscript and the
balance of the story and all of that.

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,600
Uh, one could ask who is
the second most important,

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,830
uh,
character in the Jihad?

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,280
Is it Sanctu I think
that it is the narrator,

31
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,430
the narrator and his
various, uh, agents, uh,

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,120
who appear, uh, throughout
the novel. Uh, that would be,

33
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:33,780
uh,

34
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,410
to my mind the second most
important character in the Quixote.

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,240
Now, now in the, in this, uh,

36
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,770
playing with the manuscript, uh, and, uh,

37
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:52,560
the last manuscript and all of that
Serantes is parodying the romances of

38
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:56,910
chivalry where such
devices, uh, appear, Oh,

39
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,911
this manuscript of this novel was evolved
from where it was written by some,

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,720
uh, uh, sage and so forth. Uh,

41
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,210
and Cervantes is parodying that remember
a parody is a marking imitation of the

42
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,850
style of a literary work or works,
uh,

43
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,730
ridiculing,
uh,

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,430
is stylistic practices
by exaggerated mimicry.

45
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,061
In that sense,

46
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:30,061
a parody is both a criticism and an homage
because it is a copy of something you

47
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,410
said distorted copy,
but it is still a copy.

48
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,143
Uh,

49
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,710
so the business of the unfinished
manuscript and it's translation,

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,740
uh,

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,740
rekindles questions and issues that
the narrator opened in the prologue,

52
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,320
that product that we discussed
a number of classes a ago.

53
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,400
Uh,

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I will talk a little bit today about
why all of these games of authorship,

55
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,510
but that does sort of recapitulate how
many texts are virtual texts we have so

56
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,404
far.

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,100
We have the original texts that were
supposedly written in Arabic by allying

58
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:20,020
moreish historian called see there.
I met, they've been in Haley.

59
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,300
Um,
the second is that text,

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,250
uh, of the translation
that the narrator pays for.

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Then if further text is the one
that this narrator presumably,

62
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,380
uh, corrects and, and, and,

63
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,220
and copies and rewrites and
comments upon them, their margins,

64
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,300
as you will see in several
episodes in, uh, in the future.

65
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,210
Uh, but what about the
manuscript up to chapter eight?

66
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,850
And that narrator,
uh,

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,480
we have no idea how the narrator
came about that manuscript so that,

68
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,180
uh, uh, uh, the texts of the
first eight chapters, we don't,

69
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,370
it is not explained, uh, uh, where
it came from. Now, this whole,

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,520
uh,

71
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,860
collection of manuscripts do
not make a coherent system.

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,240
Uh, you can reduce it to a coherent
system. Just we have the first one,

73
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,620
the second one, the third one. It is all,

74
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,890
it all remains a vague Ann
and Ann Anne and mystery.

75
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,330
And besides, uh, we know
that the whole thing is a,

76
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,830
a joke beginning with the name. See
the I made, they've been in Haley,

77
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,060
uh, or bedding. Hannah,
what's bedding? Hannah

78
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,820
eggplant or say I that is his
last name is could be eggplant.

79
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,850
So it is a joke. Um, no,

80
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,320
why I Cervantes and his narrate or
establishing this distance from their own

81
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,154
text.

82
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,140
How does this distancing Mesh
with the authorial willfulness?

83
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:13,100
We found in that first sentence
when the narrator says,

84
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,230
[inaudible] the name of which I purposely
omit referring to the village in La

85
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,470
Mantra where Don Quixote
or Alonzo Kiano, uh, lives.

86
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,650
It is as if this modern
author said Avantis could not
pass it his own existence.

87
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,370
We thought radical reservations,
self doubts.

88
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,320
Uh,
sometimes it's about himself as a creator.

89
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,380
I have emphasized that this kind of
ironic distancing a has echoes of Montañas

90
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,420
self deprecate Tori, uh, irony. Uh, also,

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,500
uh, uh, echoes of Erasmus is a irony.

92
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I have only mentioned Erasmus in passing
the great humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam

93
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,910
who had many followers in Spain and
who wrote a book that may be one of the

94
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,110
sources of the cohort.
They called in praise of folly,

95
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,120
in praise of folly. It's a
very, very ironic a book.

96
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,070
They start praising folly.
It is doing so in a mocking way,

97
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,420
uh, but it is not sort of
mocking way that you find in, uh,

98
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,210
in, in, in Cervantes. Now, uh,

99
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,150
it is as if a set of anthis we're
removing the origin of the texts.

100
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,370
We're leaving it, uh, in
a, in a, in a sort of a, a,

101
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:44,930
a cloud of mystery.

102
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,700
And that this is part both
of the irony and of the, uh,

103
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,610
joke. Remember the quote
from Luke Acts that I, uh,

104
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,780
read in the first lecture
about this first modern novel,

105
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,350
uh,

106
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,350
emerging at a time when the Christian
God has abandoned the world.

107
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,350
You do not have the centeredness
that you had in the divine comedy.

108
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,530
If you have read Dante
in the divine comedy,

109
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,300
everything coheres because there
is a cosmological system, uh,

110
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:24,470
on a, uh, with the attendance
symbolism provided by,

111
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,850
by the Catholic Church,
by Catholic doctrine. Uh,

112
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,500
I'm so the self of Dante, the
pilgrim, uh, is very much,

113
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,980
even though he's also like
don't be halted traveling,

114
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,930
uh, within a coherent
universe. And in fact,

115
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,290
in the very middle of the divine comedy,
the centered verse,

116
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,530
the Central Verse of the
divine comedy alludes to Dante.

117
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,890
So Dante is at the center
of this coherent universe.

118
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,270
This is not the case in the Quixote.
And these are for your games, uh,

119
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:01,560
underscore that this is
no longer the case. Uh,

120
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,920
remember that this is,
as I've been saying,

121
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,870
a post Kapernick and world,

122
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,120
a world in which the earth is no
longer at the center. Therefore, man,

123
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:16,380
quote unquote, mankind is no
longer at, uh, at the center.

124
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,280
So, uh, uh, this is what is, uh,

125
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,230
at stake as we were in all
of these other games. Again,

126
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,900
these are very serious issues, but
Servon is always presents them, uh,

127
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,570
uh,
in a light humorous tone,

128
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,320
which is part of the irony
itself, the, the humor,

129
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,630
the laughing at oneself, uh, and
the laughing at others. So this is,

130
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,300
uh, uh, uh, uh, very important,
uh, element of, of, uh,

131
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,440
of the Quixote,
uh,

132
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,710
and one that it has in common with a
very famous painting by Diego Velasquez,

133
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,470
Diego Velasquez, the Great Velazquez
about whom most of you, most of,

134
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,210
uh, most of heard, um, and that painting,

135
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,190
Oh, uh, it's not very well represented.
It's kind of blurry is last.

136
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:19,080
Meninas they made the maidens of honor.
Um,

137
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,070
can we improve a little bit on
the quality of that? Maybe if we,

138
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,210
if we turn off the lights.

139
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,393
Okay.

140
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,800
No, these are like, well that'll help too.

141
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,543
Is that a focus?

142
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,360
Is it better now? It's better, but it
sort of, what could it be improved at all

143
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,630
here? So lends up,

144
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,490
oh, what is wild there? We can't do
anything with it. Got me. So I have, um,

145
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,200
I have brought both my pointer
and a, if you will, excuse me,

146
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:13,690
this little flashlight so I can look
at my notes. A hoop he doesn't, uh,

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,590
it's not distracting to you. Uh, as
I have a perhaps mentioned before,

148
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,070
I am a pilot and this is
my, my pilots, a flashlight.

149
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,990
Do you use it in the
cabin and the cockpit?

150
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,360
I'd make to look at charts
and stuff like that.

151
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,070
And I thought that I could
improvise and use it for this.

152
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,640
So now as you look at the painting and
I apologize for the poor technology,

153
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,650
uh, and uh, I, uh, promise that we
will bring a better one the next time.

154
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:46,580
Or maybe I'll make a copy of that.
I can distribute, first of all,

155
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,480
as you look at it,

156
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,660
think of what I mentioned before
about Albert is the pick Tuta uh,

157
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,010
the, uh, treaties on perspective.

158
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,000
Remember that I talked about Leon,

159
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,020
I'll Alberti Leon Battista Alberti 14,

160
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,580
oh four, 14, 72 and Italian, uh,

161
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,670
who wrote these treaties on perspective.

162
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,680
He was an architect and
wrote an architecture and I
really encourage you to read

163
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:21,670
this little tree. It's very brief,
but it's very influential, uh,

164
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,990
because he, uh, he, he, uh,

165
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,370
he laid down the basis for perspective
in, in painting. As you can see,

166
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:35,371
we do have perspective here because of
the relative size of the figures as they

167
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,810
move away from the front.

168
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,100
So I just want you to take
that into account. Uh,

169
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,500
now the, the, the relevance
of Las Meninas working hard,

170
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,150
they're essentially,
uh,

171
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,750
because of this issue of self
reflexive putty in both works,

172
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,780
that creator has been given a prominent
place within the work and in both AFP or

173
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:02,260
in their function as creators
of the very work in question.

174
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,370
That is bill [inaudible] and he is
obviously in the act of painting.

175
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,681
I said,

176
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:16,681
Vantis appears within the whole day
in the act of writing the novel.

177
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,550
Uh, now, uh, we look at Velasquez,
he looks a little quizzical.

178
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,050
We will speak a little bit
more about his figure. Uh,

179
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
and you can,
uh,

180
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,230
recall the words I've
said this in the prologue.

181
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,093
When he wrote,

182
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,780
I often took pen in hand
and as often laid it down,

183
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,850
not knowing what to say.

184
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,530
And once upon a time being in deep
suspense with the paper before me,

185
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,510
that pen behind my ear,

186
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,690
my elbow on the table and my cheek on
my hand thinking what I should say.

187
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,770
And you can think of
Velasquez, uh, poised in the,

188
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:59,500
in a similar way,
uh,

189
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,920
as if thinking of what to paint next.

190
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:05,760
And also actually comparing,
uh,

191
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,980
he's models who are speak about who
the models are to what he is painting.

192
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:16,220
But it's the same, uh,
moment, uh, uh, of, uh,

193
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,620
of of doubt that we have in,
in, in, in, in, in, in, uh,

194
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,110
uh, instead Avantis. It is
kind of a visual aporia.

195
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:31,020
Aporia is a rhetorical
figure to express doubt. Uh,

196
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,860
a p o r I a, uh, and a,
a visual Aporia and that,

197
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,340
uh,

198
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,320
Belasco seems to be hesitating
what the next brush stroke will be.

199
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,670
Now,
uh,

200
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,450
less money now seems to capture a moment
and not a very significant moment.

201
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,800
And that is significant in itself.

202
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,560
How do we know that it's not a
very significant moment? Well,

203
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,740
there are certain gestures like this,
a little girl,

204
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,760
I just put her foot on the dog.
Uh, these figures back here,

205
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:03,350
if we could see them more clearly,

206
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:08,270
you can see they're engaged in
a trivial conversation. Uh, uh,

207
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,880
the, the, the, the
princess is being offered,

208
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:12,830
I think a glass of water or something by,

209
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,170
by this made and this man on in the back,
uh,

210
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,220
is about to leave the room.
So it's an insignificant
moment. There's a moment, uh,

211
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,750
uh, like those inductee Horton, those
many moments that are contingent,

212
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,850
serendipitous, uh, things
just happened. Uh, not,

213
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,950
uh, in a sequence, but just caught
like a snapshot. And that is what,

214
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,700
uh, uh, is important about this, uh, uh,

215
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,660
moment in which, uh, uh,
Velasquez on his, uh,

216
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,040
uh, all of these other people
are in the painting are, uh,

217
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:53,360
are caught up now of the painting.

218
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,090
We see only the back of the painting

219
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,490
and we see the Easel, the pains,
uh, the brush that he's received,

220
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,190
the instruments to create the painting.
And in fact,

221
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:10,730
we are in Velasquez Studio,
his workshop.

222
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,030
So Velasquez is painting the inside of
the workshop within which the work of art

223
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,600
is being created
as we are,

224
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,090
as we read about the manuscript
being copied, translated
and so forth. Given the,

225
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,620
the, the, the,

226
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:32,420
the details about the composition and
the creation of the novel that we are,

227
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,420
uh, are reading this, this studio of,

228
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,450
of Velasquez would be akin
to Don Quixote's is library
where he keeps the books

229
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,780
of from which I, uh, he has, uh, uh, uh,

230
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,130
that have turned him, uh, Matt.

231
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,390
Now the other important element,

232
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,580
perhaps the most is that the,

233
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,530
the line between reality and fiction
between life and art has been abolished.

234
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,880
How saw, well, uh, who is
the model of the painting?

235
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:08,661
Well,

236
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:13,550
presumably the king and Queen who are
reflected on the back on that mirror.

237
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,630
But the models are truly ourselves as
we position ourselves in front of the

238
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,550
painting.
In fact,

239
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:27,551
the first time I saw this painting
many years ago in 1969 to be exact,

240
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,840
uh, it was, now it's in a large room and
you can barely get to see the painting.

241
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:36,260
There are so many, uh, uh, uh, tourists.

242
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,440
We're looking at it and guides
talking about it and so forth.

243
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,000
But when I saw it in 1969 and the
problem is museum, it was in a room.

244
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,890
The painting is a much larger than what
you see here. It was in a room, uh,

245
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,460
that, uh, for itself. And, uh,

246
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,030
the dimensions of the room and the way
that the painting was, was, uh, uh,

247
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,420
position. The moment you walked
in, you walked into the painting,

248
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,610
you became the model.
Uh,

249
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,930
it was really a uncanny
sensation that you had.

250
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:11,640
And we really had the sense that you
had walked into a painting and you had

251
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:14,640
become the painters model.

252
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,590
You have to become that which he was
in the process of, of, of painting.

253
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,940
Um, so, uh, here we are,

254
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,010
become the model as there is a Belasco
is within his own painting. He was,

255
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,410
he was a genius, vain, a little lacy, uh,

256
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,360
both boastful. He's wearing the, the cross
I think is of Calatrava, one of the, uh,

257
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,900
military orders. You didn't become
a member of the Calatrava or just,

258
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,300
uh, like that. So He's been boastful. Uh,

259
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,400
and there he is. Uh, uh, now

260
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,500
all of the, all of these self reflexive
moves that we've seen in the heart,

261
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:00,420
they are the same.
Uh,

262
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,990
here we see the painting. I see where, uh,

263
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,970
from behind we, we, we see the
preparation of the painting,

264
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,640
but not the painting itself.
My late friend,

265
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,700
several sort of Dewey said that the
Las Meninas was within [inaudible],

266
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,800
but backwards the same way that in
the Arabic manuscript of the Quixote,

267
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:28,770
presumably that Quixote is backwards
because of course you write Arabic the

268
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:33,090
other way. It's a little bit
too clever perhaps, but you, uh,

269
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,870
you get the idea that the
painting is within the painting,

270
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:41,730
but you're not seeing the painting.
But how the painting is comes about.

271
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,160
We also have the issue of,
uh,

272
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,750
the multiple perspectives.
None of,

273
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,420
none of them complete. That
is, uh, Velasquez can see us,

274
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,950
can see the model. He can't
see the rest, the rest of the,
of the, uh, of his studio.

275
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,710
Uh, the, uh,

276
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:06,630
the mind in the back is the one
with the most complete view of the,

277
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,340
because he can see the painting and he
can see the models even deed the models

278
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,350
are the king and queen.

279
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,810
So ironically it is not man.
Who is it at that point?

280
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,260
Uh,
who has the most complete view?

281
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:27,261
I say ironically because I detect a
pun on the Alaska says a park in that a

282
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,910
figure, uh, uh,

283
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:37,060
because that in terms of
perspective is more or less,

284
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:40,530
but the plant, the fleet in
French, the vanishing point,

285
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,480
the boom to the food guy in Spanish.

286
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,010
That is the point of the center
and the depth, the depth of the,

287
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,350
uh,
that is the vanishing point.

288
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,440
And ironically in that pump to the full
guys in man about to leave various,

289
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,600
I think the punt involved there,

290
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,920
or perhaps I am being just too
clever like my friend, I said,

291
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,900
but the idea is that no one
has a complete perspective.

292
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,490
Everything. Everybody has a
partial incomplete perspective,

293
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,580
including the artist.

294
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,680
And this is a fundamental,
uh,

295
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,380
because it makes for this,
uh, Ironic, incomplete view.

296
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,700
Uh, remember, uh, the greatest, uh,

297
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,990
part of the irony in Cervantes is that
we only have a partial view of this

298
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,080
infinite world.
Uh,

299
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,890
this post Kapernick and now Galileo world,

300
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,190
we're going to live who wrote
around at the same time.

301
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:45,200
And Galileo discovered the
use of the tennis coach.

302
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,710
He discovered the infinite spaces.

303
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:51,400
So our perspective is always limited.
So,

304
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,110
so in the Meninas,
the perspectives are all limited partial.

305
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,830
And in that to,
uh,

306
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,080
the painting on the novel are alike.

307
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,400
Now, Galileo, I think I quoted
him in an earlier lecture. If not,

308
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,130
I'll call him again. And
I said, the more we know,

309
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,090
the less we know because he was
just covering more stars, uh,

310
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,520
more space on.

311
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:23,020
He knew then that it would be
impossible to get to know all of space.

312
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,340
We're still in that situation,

313
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:28,450
although we have improved
our capacity now.

314
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,810
So. So what, so what
is the significance of,

315
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,940
of all this? Uh, what I've
just said, I mean the, the,

316
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,030
the limits of human knowledge,
the limits of self knowledge, uh,

317
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,560
uh, and, uh, what else?

318
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,780
We are the models. We are the
models of the painting. And,

319
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,900
uh,

320
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,600
Ben last case has given
himself a prominent position
in a painting that should

321
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,870
be the painting of the king and Queen.

322
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,230
So he has usurped the place
of the king and Queen.

323
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,660
He has given himself a
more prominent position.

324
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,460
He has as well as were erased them to
put himself, uh, this is this ambivalent,

325
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,250
uh, uh, uh, position of
the, of the modern, uh,

326
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,440
I writer and uh, or, or, or, or author or,

327
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,190
or painter or artist,
uh,

328
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:31,090
about his own creative
powers. But you know, he is,

329
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,260
uh,

330
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,060
he has put himself in the painting
instead of those who should be the models

331
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,720
that came.
And furthermore,

332
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,200
he has opened the space of the model
so that we as we see the painting,

333
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,830
uh,

334
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,660
actually occupy the position
of the king and Queen.

335
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,610
This has all kinds of political
implications. You see,

336
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:03,611
the king and Queen had been removed and
we who are commoners can occupy instead

337
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,960
that position. So in that sense, this
is a very revolutionary painting.

338
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,610
This painting is saying,

339
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,030
anybody can be king and queen by you're
stepping in front of my painting,

340
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:21,200
I'm becoming my model. You will
become king and queen for that moment.

341
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,690
Remember there was a show
called Queen for a day.

342
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,810
You'll become queen for a day
or a king for a day. Uh, uh,

343
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,510
you understand?

344
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,510
So there has been a
displacement of power here,

345
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,510
uh, in, in, in, in Velasquez,

346
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:43,511
this painting by omitting the king and
Queen or by relegating them to the back,

347
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,760
uh,
to a reflection.

348
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,750
They're very kind of a blurry reflection,

349
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:55,640
made more blurry by our poor
company here, uh, uh, of the king.

350
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:59,840
And Queen. So now, historically,
if you will read your earlier,

351
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,610
you will see that this reflects a
real political situation in Spain,

352
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,890
meaning that in fact,

353
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,980
the power of the monarchy
has been diminished in this
painting is from 60 1656

354
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:17,300
remap Mary's later than Vicky hotter.

355
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,440
But history did move
that fast in the period.

356
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:25,920
So you can 1605 Persky
halter 60, 56, 50 years ago,

357
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,070
give or take. But by the 17th century,
the Spanish monarchy has been weakened.

358
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,250
Uh, it is in the, in the, uh,

359
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,290
in in the hands of a
valley. Those, uh, uh, uh,

360
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,000
nobleman occupied positions
of power and, and, and, and,

361
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,160
and the Habsburgs were, uh, uh, very, uh,

362
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,120
uh, this interested
in, uh, in, in, in, in,

363
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,970
in governance and more in,
in luxury and all of that.

364
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,340
But Alaska is painted, uh, the
Habsburgs in some of those activities,

365
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:04,460
hunting and stuff like that.
But here in this painting,

366
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,400
he has eliminated them
from the position of power.

367
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,520
He has placed himself at the center and
it has allowed US commoners to occupy

368
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:14,744
that position.

369
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,560
So this insignificance
of now that the panel,

370
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,650
the most important parallels to,

371
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,350
to this will come in
part two of the Quixote.

372
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,250
Uh,
but I have,

373
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,300
but I will anticipated here when sank
[inaudible] he's made governor of a mark,

374
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:41,170
uh, Highland, uh, uh, on, on, on central,

375
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,690
uh, by the way it performs
well as a ruler. So he,

376
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:50,691
the commoner has come to occupy
it post deposition of Mueller.

377
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:57,020
And this is something something similar
to what is happening here in Las

378
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,120
Meninas. So this is why
this painting is so, uh,

379
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,620
important, uh, uh, uh, in
relation to the Quixote.

380
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,060
But I also want you to,

381
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,270
in anticipation a look
at this figure here.

382
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,040
Uh, the, uh, the kings of Spain.

383
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,510
Like many others,
including Astec emperors,

384
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,430
kept,
uh,

385
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,910
freaks in their court for entertainment
and for amusement midgets,

386
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,450
people deformed and all of that. Of
course, this is from our perspective,

387
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:41,190
horrendous. But it was part,
uh, it was practiced all over.

388
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:41,881
And Bill,

389
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:46,881
last case was fascinated by
people who had a peculiar,

390
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,820
uh, features, uh, irregular
features. Uh, he painted, uh,

391
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,020
midgets and, and, and so forth.
And, uh, this is obviously a,

392
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,370
a deformed,
a woman.

393
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,330
I think that she is important,
uh,

394
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,360
because Cervantes too was very much
interested in depicting a strange

395
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:13,560
individuals, individuals who
are, are, are not beautiful,

396
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:17,480
but who have been scarred by time,
uh,

397
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,690
on by life, uh, and by, uh,

398
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,590
bad luck and so forth.

399
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,920
So when you get to the chapter in the inn
and you read the descriptions of Marty

400
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:34,110
tornness, the, uh, when she a prostitute,

401
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,490
uh, who creates that whole
fracas, uh, at night in the,

402
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:43,280
in think of this, uh, of
the face of this, uh, uh,

403
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,820
uh, figure here, flat faced,

404
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,120
deformed and so forth because it's
another correspondence are very important.

405
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:57,141
Correspondence between the Alaska says
aesthetics and Sylvana stasis aesthetics.

406
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,920
So, uh, so much for now for Las Meninas,

407
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,750
we will go back to Alaska is later, uh,
quite soon as a matter of fact to look,

408
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,620
uh, at, uh, another one of his
masterpieces. But for now, uh,

409
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,950
so much for last many,

410
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:17,010
now we will go back to having light.

411
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,570
Okay.

412
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,290
Both artificial and a
little bit of natural light.

413
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,103
Oops.

414
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,220
The one thing that I

415
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:02,030
failed to mention is that as you
noticed in looking at the painting,

416
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,290
Velasquez has given himself unimportant
position within the painting,

417
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,500
but he's not a central position.

418
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:17,210
He Easy Nano bleak position
as it were a lateral position.

419
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,240
Uh,

420
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,240
this emphasizes this ambiguity of the
power of creation of the modern author.

421
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:31,240
And at the same time, the self
doubt to self doubt, uh, that, uh,

422
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,920
that, uh, the cell terrific
reflectivity, uh, expresses,

423
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:41,130
uh, so it is, it is, I think,
noteworthy that he is on,

424
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,010
on the side. I said we're, and
the creator is looking, Eh,

425
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,240
obliquely at the, uh, uh,
of the, uh, the model,

426
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,950
um,
in the same way that said,

427
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:58,951
Vantis says that he is father
or stepfather of his work.

428
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,890
Remember what he said in the 1605,
uh,

429
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,800
prologue that you, that we talked
about in one of the first classes,

430
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,440
the bleakness of,
uh,

431
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,750
of Alaska says position within
the painting is similar to that.

432
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,500
We'll bleakness of whether he's
father and stepfather on so forth. So,

433
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,600
uh, we, uh, go back now,

434
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,670
uh, uh, do the Quixote.

435
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,670
Now after the episode with the scanner,

436
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,080
the Wask, uh, when, uh, uh,
Don Quixote, uh, dangerous.

437
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:41,680
This man in this, in this fight, uh, uh,

438
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,030
central is a very apprehensive.

439
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,370
He is sure that they're now going to
be pursued by the holy brotherhood.

440
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,070
Uh, the, uh, they don't get held down.

441
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Sangio moving a whirl of alienation of
madness on social ability on how cancer

442
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:07,540
society deal with donkey
halt. This is madness, uh,

443
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,730
real society.
Uh,

444
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,360
now this issue is highlighted
by the presence of civil law.

445
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,273
Uh,

446
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,970
indeed in the book central knows that
they're being pursued by the center man,

447
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,760
Dad, and who was the same tire
man, dad or wholly brotherhood.

448
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,530
This was a vigilante police force
that the Catholic kings had created.

449
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,060
Ferdinand and Isabella, you
remember your Elliot, uh,

450
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:41,360
y remember that their greatest,

451
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,590
uh,

452
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,270
they invested a lot of effort in
trying to unify the Spanish peninsula.

453
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,800
But as I've mentioned,

454
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,080
Spain is divided in several regions with
different cultures and languages and

455
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,780
exemptions from the law.
Uh, where royal authority,

456
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,160
just like the federal law in this
country could not reach because of those

457
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:07,880
assumptions that this, uh,
that this regions had. Uh,

458
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,360
therefore the Catholic kings created
a police that could go through those

459
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,340
regional boundaries and
apprehend fugitives.

460
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,760
The Holy Brotherhood was in charge of the
roads because the roads were under the

461
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:30,350
purview of the, uh, of the crown. Uh,

462
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,030
and,
uh,

463
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,570
they were parallel to another institution
that the Catholic kings created.

464
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:43,400
That was also, uh, uh, they're
also, uh, could, could,

465
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,350
could, uh, police, uh, uh, all of the
pinion. So like the holy inquisition,

466
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,510
the acquisition code, police,
uh, regions other than Castille,

467
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:56,570
that is Galicia, the bass
countries, uh, and so forth.

468
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,000
And so could the holy Brotherhood,

469
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,830
the Holy Brotherhood were feared because
they could, uh, not only apprehend you,

470
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,990
but, uh, try you and execute
you on the spot. And,

471
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:13,610
uh, Sanchez that he already hears
their arrows buzzing in his ears.

472
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,690
Why? Because sanctuary is
vulnerable to the holy brotherhood.

473
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:19,330
Where asked Don Quixote,

474
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:23,150
I send Evalgo feels that he
is protected from the law.

475
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,580
But so sanctuary is a one,

476
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:30,230
if you will notice who insists that
they are being pursued by the holy

477
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,290
brotherhood and that they have a,
they have to, uh, to hide in the,

478
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,830
in the hills and, and, and so forth. Uh,

479
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,540
the Holy Brotherhood,

480
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,190
I sorry to give away the plot
will eventually apprehend them,

481
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,030
but let them go at the end
of perk of part one. Um,

482
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,010
now the,

483
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,090
the members of the Bra Holly Brotherhood
were just ordinary people who were, uh,

484
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,440
engaged in this, uh, uh,
in this police force.

485
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,053
So

486
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,530
we moved out to the adventure with
the goat hurts, uh, and the speech on,

487
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,250
on, on, on the golden age.

488
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,500
That is one of the more famous
episodes of part one. Uh,

489
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:18,430
now this is an episode like others in
which a contrast is established between

490
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,510
what Don Quixote has in his head
from having read so many books and,

491
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,760
uh,
the real world around him.

492
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:34,030
He thinks that these goat hurts are
like shepherds of the classical,

493
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,910
uh, tradition. And this is what
makes him think of the Golden Age.

494
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:42,930
When there is no mine or Lao,
there is no private property,

495
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:47,931
there is only a goodness and
man lifts are one with nature.

496
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,150
And he delivers his beautiful speech,

497
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:56,151
which is filled with all kinds of cliches
from the classical tradition to this

498
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,480
quarter. So don't understand
what he is talking about at all.

499
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,860
But he, uh, what, what is the, uh,

500
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,120
what is the,

501
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,910
the connecting thread between
that idealized reality?

502
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,190
Uh,
he said that idealized world donkey,

503
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,680
his head and the reality of
this goat hertz who are, uh,

504
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:24,960
uh, listening to this speech and
not understanding a thing. Uh,

505
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:29,961
that donkey hope is it say the
one thing that connects the two,

506
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,660
and it goes back to one of the points
that I've made before is the goat herds.

507
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,870
Kindness.
They are kind,

508
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,140
that is that which has not
changed from those classical,

509
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:47,130
idealized times.
And the present is the kindness of people.

510
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:51,340
And remember that I said that
I serantes likes to depict, uh,

511
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,070
people from the lowest classes,
uh, being, uh, kind of, uh,

512
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,780
to each other and to Don Quixote.

513
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,950
They have not reacted to
Doki Quixote's appearance,

514
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:05,440
which is striking to say the least,
uh,

515
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,120
for this man to suddenly show up,
dressed in armor,

516
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,410
on speaking this way. And they have
allowed him to, uh, to sit with them,

517
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,330
to share their food and
their drink. And, uh, and uh,

518
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,150
do we involve in their, in their life. So,

519
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,160
so there is a sharp contrast,
but also a commonality here.

520
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,800
The, the people, the
goat hurts or kind, uh,

521
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,660
to Don Quixote and allow him to be,
uh,

522
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:37,770
what he wants even if they
don't understand what it is
that he is talking about.

523
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,353
Uh,

524
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,100
now this is the first of several post
prandial speeches in the Quixote.

525
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,920
This is the word, the, another one
of these words that I'm going to,

526
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,130
to teach you in this class so that you
can be very pedantic Yalies in the,

527
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,430
in the present and in the future.
Postprandial simply means, uh,

528
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,600
an after dinner speech. Uh, so,

529
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,913
uh,

530
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,310
what is the significance of
this postprandial speeches
on what do they have to

531
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:18,450
do with the theme of
Donkey Hotez, uh, speech?

532
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,340
Well after dinner speeches,
celebrate the defeat of the,

533
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,940
of the world that is of animals
and plants at the end of work.

534
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:35,110
And there haven't been turned
plants and animals into food. Uh,

535
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:39,640
here, uh, the, the eating some
meat, they eat, drinking some wine,

536
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,700
which is like the blood of the earth.
They're passing the,

537
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:46,840
the wine around and they are, uh, uh,

538
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,750
enjoying the fruits of their labor.
At the end of the day,

539
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:54,220
they're celebrated the
end of work and rest. Um,

540
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,260
and there is a connection of course,

541
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,360
between the eating and the
talking and the speech, uh,

542
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,190
oral activities, uh, both of
pleasurable activities. Uh,

543
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,090
so this is the connection between
this postprandial speeches,

544
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:13,780
between the food and the under speaking.
Uh,

545
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,770
others will be a, there will be
much more Merriman and so forth,

546
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,410
but this is, uh, a, a,

547
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:25,300
a recurring scene in the,
uh, in, in the Quixote.

548
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,840
Um, there is a great deal
about food in Don Quixote. Uh,

549
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,550
and in some cases,
food and language actually coalesce,

550
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,940
uh, most, uh, memorably.

551
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,060
And,
uh,

552
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,180
when don Quixote on central vomit
on each other after the episode of,

553
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,010
of the sheep, uh, when they vomit
on each other and it is a sin,

554
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:56,560
I see food and language had become
one and they have a dialogue,

555
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,940
uh, between them. I vomited on you and
you want me to me. And that is a form of,

556
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,020
of dialogue.
I know it's not a

557
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,950
very palatable to think about that,
especially if you just had lunch.

558
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,710
But this is a, uh, this is the,

559
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:16,450
the significance here of
speech on food and uh,

560
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,490
okay. And so, but the most
significant part of course is the,

561
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,300
it's this is the contrast
between Doki halters, uh, uh,

562
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:30,040
ideas and cliches about drawn from
the classical tradition and the real,

563
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,360
uh, everyday, uh, life of
this goat hertz who also,

564
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,770
uh, serve as a transition toward, uh,

565
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,800
the Monticello. Marcel Langley Saastr
my episode in which the whole, uh,

566
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,460
uh, theme of the pastoral, we'll be,

567
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,950
uh, we'll be, uh, taken
up, uh, out of, out of,

568
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,610
we could say a higher literary level.

569
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,680
The stakes are much higher and that
you saw stonewall and Marcella episode

570
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,810
because of course the death
has occurred. Uh, and uh,

571
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,380
there is a real, uh, a conflict.

572
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,950
But so I think that the
transition here is smoothed.

573
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,230
The transition is made smoother by
the figure of evolve who you have.

574
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,910
I'm sure you remember,
uh,

575
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,720
who was the man with whom donkey hall
to engage us in conversation about the

576
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:23,920
nature of, uh, of, uh, of
knighthood and, and, and so forth.

577
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,420
And they all anticipate because it had
been told by the goat hurts and so forth

578
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,740
about this conflict involving the
death of, uh, of the disaster.

579
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,130
Most have really soft Domo.

580
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,550
So we move to that
episode in which the main

581
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,790
theme appears to be that of freewill.

582
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,430
The theme of Freewill,
uh, is the main thing,

583
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:54,431
but an attendant and very
important theme is also that again,

584
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,520
of literature, literature
and its effects. Because, uh,

585
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,810
Marcella and resource are,
uh,

586
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,830
figures that are counterparts to
donkey hottie in their relationship to

587
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:13,990
literature because both
Marcel angry source to more,

588
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:18,920
but mostly Marcella want to
play act and a literary role.

589
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,060
She wants to be a shepherdess,
uh, and take to, uh, to the hills.

590
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,730
And of course resource Domo,
uh,

591
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,440
does the same to pursue her,
uh, but also resource Domo.

592
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,980
Uh, and in this he is also, uh,

593
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,740
like Don Quixote is a reader
and not only a reader,

594
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:41,180
he's a student from the University
of Salamanca and a former student,

595
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,590
the graduate and a port.
So the stakes here,

596
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:49,010
as I say, I repeat, are much higher.

597
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,510
And it is almost as if
literature where on, uh,

598
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,540
on on trial we can remember what the
scene is consistent [inaudible] has

599
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:02,500
committed suicide. It is not said, uh,

600
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,280
straight forwardly because
suicide is mortal sin.

601
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,030
And, and, and Savannah,

602
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:13,880
this is writing in within the context
of very Catholic Spain and he can't just

603
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,570
ride it out directly that
we source the more, uh,

604
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,461
committed suicide.

605
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:23,780
But the words used in the text
desperado he became desperate.

606
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:28,781
He was desperate all point out to
the fact that he committed suicide.

607
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:33,740
He committed suicide because
Marcella spurned him.

608
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,933
Uh,

609
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,050
but what is amazing here is the very
detailed socioeconomic context of the

610
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:46,350
episode.
In this sense,

611
00:43:46,351 --> 00:43:51,351
it's Mantis is anticipating ballsack the
great 19th century French novelist who

612
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,600
gave very,

613
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,630
very specific details about the
economic situation of his characters.

614
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,680
And here we have that because we learned
that Marcella Marcella is very rich.

615
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:12,560
She has achieved the daughter of William,
the rich who uh,

616
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,830
her mother died giving birth to
her and then William the rich,

617
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,530
died and left Marcella, uh, uh,

618
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,920
and trusted to an uncle, to a brother,
I guess of his who's a priest.

619
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,110
Uh,
and who,

620
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,650
who will administer Harris
date until she gets married.

621
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,170
Women could not a whole property outright
on the moment that you married the,

622
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,740
uh, state would go Ooh,
would pass over to her, uh,

623
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:47,030
husband in the case of the resource to
who is no longer a youth as we will meet

624
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:53,590
later in the book. He's already 30 years
old when he dies because when Gwen said,

625
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,790
when lucky haughty leans over
to look at the cadaver, he says,

626
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,480
I saw a man of about 30.
Uh,

627
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,500
risotto is also, uh, uh, rich.

628
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,580
He has inherited a great deal of,
uh,

629
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,940
of property in lands and animals and,
and so forth.

630
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,580
Uh,
and uh,

631
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,640
so it seems as if this
were a perfect match.

632
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,650
He is of noble, uh, lineage. She's not a,

633
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,570
but this would not be an impediment
and, uh, it would not bring down the,

634
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:33,900
uh, the Linus said, where
because a nobility is,

635
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,190
was passed on in the Castilian
laws by through the mail.

636
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,760
So it said renters or created
a situation here for a, a,

637
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:46,830
a perfect marriage in a small
village, uh, this to rich,

638
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,240
a young people would marry
and, uh, create a larger,

639
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:54,630
even a state. It could become
even a my, your ass go.

640
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,020
It worked that you will learn,
uh, uh, about a little more

641
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,890
later and entailed state. Uh, and, and so,

642
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,813
uh,

643
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,180
now what intervenes when intervenes
is Marcella has a desires to become a

644
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:16,300
shepherd to spurn all of her many suitors.
Uh,

645
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,310
Andy Resource, Tomas,
uh, mad pursuit of her.

646
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,370
You saw stonewall is a, a,

647
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,580
um,
a port.

648
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,630
We learn that because his
poem is read at the funeral.

649
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,260
A typical Petrarchan concerning,
uh,

650
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,830
he's also the one who writes the outdoors,
Sacramento Talis,

651
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,570
the allegorical place on
Corpus Christi Day. Uh,

652
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:50,340
so he does a religious play,
relates about the Eucharist. Uh,

653
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:55,380
he said costs mammographer he can tell
what the weather is going to be or the

654
00:46:55,381 --> 00:47:00,030
future and all of that. He
said, kind of a budding Faust,

655
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:05,070
uh,
good to Faust in the 19th century in that,

656
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,570
in that he can, he wants to foretell
the future. He's madly in love.

657
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,060
He supported,
he has all of these qualities,

658
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:16,350
all of these sort of demonic
qualities that lead him, uh,

659
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,100
to desperation and to a suicide.

660
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,930
In fact, uh, he is, uh,

661
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,910
so much he wants to be so
much in control that he has,

662
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,710
uh, repaired his, his, his burial, uh,

663
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,980
in such a way that it is
almost like a play. Uh,

664
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,990
he wants to be buried where he met
Marcel and not in consecrated ground.

665
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,090
All of these raise the eyebrows of the
church in the town, and I rate her, says,

666
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:54,510
uh, he has to, he's home a barrier. Uh,

667
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:57,130
and funeral, it's going to be
like an outdoor Sacramento,

668
00:47:57,131 --> 00:48:01,660
like one of these plays that he wrote and
his body would be the main prop on the

669
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:02,500
protagonist.

670
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:08,190
So we see other characteristics
of this character and meanwhile,

671
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,280
uh, Marcella, uh,

672
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,860
appearance on this at the funeral and
delivers a very spirited defense of

673
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:22,861
herself using very precise forensic
rhetoric that is legal rhetoric and legal

674
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:25,450
terms to defend herself.

675
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,180
And they issue becomes who
is right at the end. Uh,

676
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,380
the, the, the women characters instead of,

677
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:39,730
and this are very active and
one to take, uh, uh, destiny,

678
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,930
they're investing in their own hands
and not seller is a, an example.

679
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,860
So one could say Mount Sinai is right
and this is what Don Quixote determines

680
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,230
dokey how to access a
George. And he said, wait,

681
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,650
because when she leaves in
and runs into the hills,

682
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:55,870
people want to pursue her and
said, oh, no, no, no. He stands,

683
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,270
I will defend her right to be free.

684
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,680
She has a proven beyond any doubt
that she has nothing to do. You had,

685
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:06,700
you had no culpability
whatsoever in the fate of a,

686
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,900
of [inaudible] and such. You
should be free. So is she right?

687
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:13,630
Is She right?

688
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,630
Or has Marcella also acted with some
part selfishness by wanting to become a

689
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,570
literary shepherdess to go around the
woods and playing and being a shepherdess,

690
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,740
not marrying these two have
squandered their estates,

691
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:33,000
have squandered his
possibility? Well, uh, it,

692
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:36,820
it is not as clear as it would seem.
Uh,

693
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:41,320
the question I think, uh, remains
open. The sauce, the more has died.

694
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,110
He has killed himself.
Uh,

695
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,490
Marcella has sort of
suffered a civil death,

696
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:53,080
civil death in the sense that she has
run into the woods, into the hills,

697
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,820
into the thickest part of the
hills, the, uh, uh, the Texas,

698
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,580
and we don't know what's
going to become a of her,

699
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:04,600
they're separated from society
playing this literary role.

700
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:09,140
And so, uh, the, I think
that the, the, uh, uh,

701
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:12,190
the end of, of the, of the episode, uh,

702
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,700
leaves us with a sense of ambiguity.

703
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:19,750
We have to decide as we did
in the undress episode before,

704
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,970
but it's not as clear as a, as
it seems. It also seems that the,

705
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,550
that the,
the episode is inviting us to,

706
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,540
to consider the effects of literature
that is literature has given Marcella and

707
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:40,451
also [inaudible] the idea that
absolute freedom is possible.

708
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,930
That you can live your dreams,

709
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,650
that you can live out your desires.
Uh,

710
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,230
and obviously this is a dangerous,
uh,

711
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,720
this is a dangerous proposition which
can lead to the kind of conflict that we

712
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:01,850
have that we have here.
Uh,

713
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,450
remember the one passing
judgment at the end is a madman.

714
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,370
Don Quixote has passed judgment because
in a way he is like Marcella and he

715
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,800
defends Marcella's right to be,

716
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,140
to be insane like him and to act out his.
Now,

717
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,230
this whole episode in away
concludes on a very hilarious note,

718
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,640
which is the next episode,

719
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,870
the next episode in which
they're going to the wheelchair.

720
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:33,930
Marcella has escaped and
they find a locals Aminos,

721
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,000
which is a commonplace in literary,
uh, art and literature. Uh, uh,

722
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,880
a very, uh, pleasant place that
he's a with grass, with shade,

723
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:48,950
with water running, brook waking,
a blessing sound and so forth.

724
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,840
And what do we have?
What happens here?

725
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,680
We have here the translation,

726
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:59,570
sort of these amorous episode
into, uh, into animal love.

727
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,110
Uh,

728
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:05,110
when board resy Nunca who doesn't seem
to be a strong enough to harbor such

729
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,930
desires, uh, meets a, uh,

730
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:14,000
some mayors that are being also,
uh, uh, but there to grace and,

731
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:18,170
and have water by some,
uh, uh, men from young.

732
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:19,460
Was this a Galicians?

733
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,390
We said we've met the now people
from various regions in Spain.

734
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,050
And what happens when,
when,

735
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,410
when borders in Anthea approaches
and the mayors to us, the Texas,

736
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:34,610
we communicate his desires through them.
They meet him with hoops,

737
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,150
they kicked him,
and then there they are.

738
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:42,080
Keepers come and beat the
daylights out of border.

739
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,850
She Nantais and a, and a don Quixote
on central tried to intervene.

740
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:51,770
And they are also beaten up by this,
by this, by this people. This is the,

741
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,020
the conclusion in a way of the
resource to mall and Marcella episode.

742
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,040
But in a humorous,
uh,

743
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,120
Keith Serantes likes to work with this
contrasts and with this transposition of

744
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,500
something that was a very serious,

745
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:11,360
and even sober in the softer one
Marcel episode into, into this, uh,

746
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,100
uh,
a slapstick,

747
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,910
a comedy episode of Poor Rocinante,
uh,

748
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,950
trying,
uh,

749
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,330
to seduce the mayor and
being kicked viciously.

750
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:28,470
So I think that this, the, the
end of, of the, uh, of the, uh,

751
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,170
uh, uh, uh, Marcel angry
software might be sold.

752
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,820
The last comment on it
as it, as it were. Um,

753
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,180
so now the night and he squire themselves
are about to enter into the thick of a

754
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:45,330
novel,
uh,

755
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:50,400
which will be a counterpoint between the
Sierra Morina that is this hills into

756
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:55,260
which they,
they go fleeing from the holy brotherhood.

757
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:01,700
And also because don't be hurt that wants
to do penance for Lucinia a wilderness

758
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,890
like the wanting,

759
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,890
which Marcella was lost a counterpoint
between that and one Palo Maca is in the,

760
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:16,890
in where the freakers happened before
with mandatory list and so forth. Uh,

761
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:21,590
which will become a, a temple, a
courthouse, uh, on where the, the,

762
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,480
the complicated love stories in part one.

763
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:29,481
And you will see how many complicated
love stories and sue will be resolved in

764
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:32,510
that, in, and, uh,

765
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,500
so that is what we are going
to move into in the next, uh,

766
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,490
classes.
