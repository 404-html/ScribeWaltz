1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,573
I,
um,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,120
I want you to ponder
over the next few days,

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,690
uh,
what is commemorated

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,330
on October 7th,
the next October 7th,

5
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,280
which will be next Wednesday.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,060
Get bonus points for your midterm.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,410
If you, if you know it right off the
top of your head already, you can, uh,

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,590
you can tell me if not, think about
it and, uh, you may come up with it.

9
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:45,360
There's something very relevant
to this, uh, course and, uh,

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,490
I can see that my tas,

11
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,940
the graduate students
are also puzzled by it.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,770
Uh, you can, you can go
home and Google it and, uh,

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,510
and maybe it'll come up, but, uh, um,

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,880
we'll talk about it on Tuesday,

15
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:07,830
which would be the eve of the
anniversary of you was okay.

16
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,690
Um,
we are going to talk today,

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,520
uh, uh, mostly,

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,910
but not exclusively about the novel
of the curious impertinent as you can

19
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:29,460
anticipate by the various triangles on,
uh,

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,190
on the board.
Um,

21
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,510
said Avantis was criticized in his time
for the inclusion of this novel in part

22
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:45,060
one of the key halting.
He answered,

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,710
he answered his critics through.

24
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:53,750
He's characters who speak
about that criticism. Uh,

25
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,130
chiefly a character,
a character called Sung,

26
00:01:57,131 --> 00:02:02,010
Sung Carrasco whom you will meet,
uh,

27
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,450
when you begin reading part
two very soon. And, uh,

28
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:10,380
he also talks about it in
the prologue to part two,

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,840
and, uh, he said Advantis refrained

30
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,500
from inserting any novels
like this in part two.

31
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,030
So, uh, he took the criticism to heart.

32
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,190
Um,
as I said in my last lecture,

33
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,030
Cervantes was trying to
combine the sequential kind
of plot of that you Valerie

34
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:45,000
romance one adventure after another,
uh,

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,390
with the collection of stories

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,480
in the style of Boccaccio a book.

37
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,080
Got Joe. I have him I
think before, but uh,

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,030
if not,
uh,

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,393
okay.

40
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,610
But Capture Giovanni Boccaccio 13, 13, 13,

41
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,870
1375. If you're a literature
major, you should know,

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,700
uh, Boccaccio or to know at least
about Boccaccio culture. He's,

43
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,080
uh, his work, his famous
work is called the camera on

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,570
now. Not that, that evaluate romances, uh,

45
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,200
didn't have convoluted plots,

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,170
but the insertion of a novel like
this was not one of its features.

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
It is known.
That said,

48
00:03:56,001 --> 00:04:01,001
Avantis contemplated the publication
of a collection of stories to be called

49
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,210
Semanas.

50
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,240
They'll haredim weeks at the
garden and he did publish in 16,

51
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,500
13,

52
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,020
the collection of stories that you have
and from which you will read called the

53
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:20,600
exemplary novels, no
way less, uh, him Pladis

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,090
this collection,
as you will discover,

55
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,150
does not have an overarching fiction
involving character narrators leaving the

56
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:37,621
city fleeing the plague and
gathering to tell stories as in the,

57
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:42,040
the camera on the overarching fiction
into the camera on is that all of these

58
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:47,041
young people leave the city because there
is a plague they gather in a pleasant

59
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:50,830
place and they each tell
a story every day. And uh,

60
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,870
that is the overarching fiction of the,

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,880
the camera on the exemplaries
novels of Cervantes did,

62
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,740
does not have such an overarching fiction
is just a collection of stories by

63
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,170
Miguel. Listen, run tests
with a prologue and so forth,

64
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,923
uh,

65
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,930
weeks in the garden or [inaudible] does
sound as it would have had that kind of

66
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,880
applaud meaning overarching plot,

67
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,350
meaning that characters would
get together in a garden until,

68
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,760
uh,
stories.

69
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,640
The point is that in, in, uh, India,

70
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,590
Quixote part one,
uh,

71
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,300
Cervantes is attempting to mesh these
two forms of narrative. As I said,

72
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,060
uh,
the result may seem awkward,

73
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,290
uh,

74
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,290
but it is mostly really very innovative
and it leads to the creation of the

75
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:54,460
modern novel with this
very loose structure,

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,800
which this kind of in Thurston is,
uh,

77
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,020
is possible.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now we saw how those commingling stories
about Fernando [inaudible] and Lucinda,

79
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,370
uh,
hallow stories are correlated.

80
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,480
And my colleague from the Department
of Comparative Literature,

81
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:22,481
David Quint calls it interlacing
how the stories are interconnected.

82
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,450
In a fairly recent book on Sarah on this.

83
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,090
And I proposed that their structure,
the overall structure,

84
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,670
all of these stories with his cuts,

85
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:39,110
faults and gaps was like a
representation of human memory,

86
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,720
human memory of bunk,

87
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:46,721
which fiction depends and on which the
very makeup of the creative self of the

88
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,250
author is based memory.

89
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,310
As we will see, uh, today
and in the next class,

90
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,050
uh,

91
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,050
the final resolution of the conflicts
in those stories is a narrative to the

92
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,344
force,

93
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,390
the very devil boast of artistry
on the part of Savantas.

94
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,040
But the novel of the curious impertinent
does stick out as being very different

95
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,650
and apparently only tenuously related to
the main plot and to the other stories

96
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,780
from twitch differs.

97
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,060
Why is the story inserted
here in the whole day?

98
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,800
You could say, is it, is it padding,
it's Amanda's patting his novel

99
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,530
or does it have something to do with the
intercalated stories that we have been

100
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,940
discussing and that are
about to be resolved?

101
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,340
First,

102
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,340
let us go over how Cervantes does
justify the inclusion of the novel.

103
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,850
At the most elementary level.

104
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,010
The innkeeper one Palmetto
reveals that he keeps a suitcase.

105
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:14,201
Somebody left with some papers and
that he owns a number of chief Valerie

106
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,620
Romances.

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,620
This is a second suitcase we find the
first was kind of which the character's

108
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:25,691
found rotted in the middle of the
Seattle La Morena and it also contained

109
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:31,331
writing contained gardenias manuscripts
and poems and some shirts and most

110
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,930
importantly for sanctuary.
So money

111
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,090
and discussion ensues
involving the innkeeper,

112
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:48,401
his wife and daughter and under priest
about the value of those books that you

113
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:50,060
Valerie Romances.

114
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,290
This is a return to the scrutiny
of the books episode earlier.

115
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,140
Hm.

116
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,580
Um, the scrutiny of the books,
in fact, it's mentioned by
the, uh, by the characters.

117
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,110
The breeze wants to burn that
you've all read romances. I see.

118
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:12,190
Did we don Quixote's but the innkeeper,
we'll have none of it.

119
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,770
One Paloma, as he says, he's
not mad. He's not insane.

120
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:21,910
He knows that what those books
relate happened a long time ago.

121
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,400
Not In the present as don Quixote does.

122
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,760
He knows that it is not applicable
to the present in a day.

123
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,050
In addition,
he maintains the romances of jewelry,

124
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,180
provide entertainment.

125
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,360
When at harvest time the workers gather
around at the end of the day and someone

126
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:44,230
reads out loud from one of them.

127
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,160
The tradition of reading out loud goes
back to the middle ages and the convents

128
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:56,530
and monasteries and a n and rituals
of, of, of, of, of, of that,

129
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,740
uh, uh, kind in an in such institutions.

130
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,313
MMM.

131
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,230
He says that it provides a soulless
and on rest and relaxation.

132
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,910
At the end of of of work,

133
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,230
the ink keeper's wife and daughter,
uh,

134
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
for their part are fond of the,

135
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,340
of the love scenes and
they talk particularly the
daughter about the love scenes

136
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,110
that move her so much.

137
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,803
Uh,

138
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,490
one Palo Banca defense,

139
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,260
the voracity of the chivalric romances
saying that these books are published

140
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:40,180
with the approval of the crowns councils
have the stamp of the Crown Council.

141
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,170
How could the crown allow
books of lies to be published?

142
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Of course he has a very primitive
notion about printed books and,

143
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,940
and, and so forth. He
is corrected by others,

144
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,600
the priests mostly,
but to no avail.

145
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,390
He still sticks to his guns,

146
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,120
but no books are birthed
because books are not Bert.

147
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,050
They will be soon another scene with a
character who is the Canon of Toledo.

148
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:21,060
You will learn what the Canon of polio
or what it can on is when we get to that

149
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:25,590
part in which the romances of
chivalry will again be discussed,

150
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,650
uh, but at a theoretical level, uh,

151
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,521
by,

152
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:37,521
by very well educated and well
read characters like the priests,

153
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:42,390
the Kingdom of [inaudible] and Don
Quixote and so forth. But here,

154
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Savannah seems to be emphasizing that
the romances of chilvery do have a

155
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,440
function in society.

156
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,830
They Fernie's relaxation Buhler people.

157
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,810
It is foolish to take Cervantes at his
word when he says that he has written the

158
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,280
Quixote to demolish and
banish romances of jewelry.

159
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,460
There are people who still
take him at face value on that,

160
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,990
but in fact,

161
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,020
the Quixote as we go parodies
is both a critique on an Amish,

162
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,910
the romances of chivalry,

163
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,630
and it is perhaps the last
of the romances of chivalry.

164
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,620
So, uh, uh, oh, we must
not take, I don't think so.

165
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,600
Run this seriously when he says
that he wrote the book simply to,

166
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,930
to do away with the romances of children.
Remember what I've,

167
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,000
what I said before that by his time
essentially the fashion, uh, uh,

168
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,150
uh, of publishing them
anyway, uh, had ended,

169
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,270
but they continue to be read at
least if we take the Quixote, uh, uh,

170
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,640
evidence of, uh, of there being
read by the common people.

171
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,800
Now,

172
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
then the innkeeper speaks about the
papers in the suitcase and main choose the

173
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,310
story,
the novel of the curious impertinent,

174
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,850
which he says had been approvingly
red in it had also been read out loud

175
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,063
at the inn.

176
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,410
It is in manuscript form much
literature including Cervantes,

177
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,340
his own stories,
uh,

178
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,420
still circulated in manuscript even after
the development of the printing press.

179
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,650
A sprinting was complicated and expensive.

180
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,330
So you must not assume that
once printing became available,

181
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,370
literature did not circulate in
manuscript form anymore. It did.

182
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,020
And, uh, some of, uh, uh,
set of anthesis work, uh,

183
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,530
segregated in that in such fashion.

184
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:57,640
Some of the stories that were later
included in the exemplary novels,

185
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,810
a book had been circulating in,
in this form.

186
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,130
This is then another self
referential moment in the 80s.

187
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,080
To me clear.
That's advantage.

188
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,700
It is a himself who left
that suitcase there with the,

189
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,740
with the manuscript instead of anthis
is again winking at the reader.

190
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:25,280
And this is me who left
this suitcase here.

191
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,693
Ah,

192
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,690
it is clear too that he has found a way
to publish the story by inserting it

193
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:36,890
here in the Quixote. Uh, that doesn't
mean that it just padding the novel,

194
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,620
uh,
the long short story,

195
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:43,630
the novella or move well in the manner of,
uh,

196
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,970
Boccaccio was a form with which Cervantes
felt very comfortable as you will

197
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:51,980
discover what you read the stories.

198
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,290
And as you have already discovered
in this integrated stories that he,

199
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,460
this sort of long short story is
a form that's Advantis a favorite.

200
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,133
Now

201
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,180
let us not miss the irony, which is
easy to miss. We have to read carefully.

202
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:15,100
Remember, read for
details. That is the, the,

203
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,580
the irony that it is the
priest who reads out loud,

204
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,530
the novel of the, uh,
curious, impertinent,

205
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,280
this perverse twist.

206
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:33,281
The love story is told in the voice
over representative of the church.

207
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,520
This priest is a very,
um,

208
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,320
a complicated character
as you were just covering.

209
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,030
He invents Duvall with
Romances, uh, and uh,

210
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,950
he's uh, uh, uh, out in the fields
such as using a don Quixote.

211
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,690
And, uh, uh, it is, uh,

212
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,940
do me a very ironic that you have the
priest reading this, uh, uh, this story,

213
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,190
Cervantes loaves, this, uh, ironic games.

214
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,980
It is the priest who at the end those
a critique of the story and asked

215
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:16,600
permission to have it copied
later Cervantes. This is
engaging here in some, some,

216
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,900
some self criticism but also in some
self praise having one of his characters

217
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,150
praise the story with some reservation,

218
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,190
but the prisons it this breeze just
as we have already learned this also

219
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
literary critic I've rediscovered in the
episode of the scrutiny of the books.

220
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,370
No,

221
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,370
the novel of the curious in pregnant
is the most blatantly literary story

222
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:44,630
contained in the whole day,

223
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,520
the most artful and obviously
derived from literary sources.

224
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,200
The action is set in Florence
and in a vaguely defined past.

225
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,980
It is a time and place of fictions,

226
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,540
not depressant, uh, uh, in which, uh,

227
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,790
the Quixote takes place.

228
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,960
It is drawn from a known Italian sources
and written in the style of Walcott Geo

229
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,580
whom you now know and Ben law

230
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,460
bail bundle.

231
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,340
This course is under the ages of the
literature major that is comparative

232
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,460
literature. So you are getting quite
a bit of Italian literature here,

233
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,370
which is inevitable.
Uh,

234
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,460
Mateo been below 1485,

235
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,340
1561 who was one of the great short,

236
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,880
short story writers already
of the 16th Century, uh, uh,

237
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,670
much red throughout Europe. And in
fact, one of his stories inspired,

238
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,270
uh, Romeo and Juliet.
Shakespeare as you know,

239
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:13,860
was very fond of reading
Italian literature.

240
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,550
In fact,
the novel of the curious impertinent,

241
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,020
essentially drawn from audio stores.

242
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,180
Orlando Furioso.
I have mentioned Ariosto several times,

243
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,190
but I will mention him again now.

244
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,773
Okay.

245
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,550
His famous poem is Orlando
for yours or [inaudible] 1474,

246
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:51,010
1533. And the Orlando of food,
he also was published in 15,

247
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:53,980
16 then 15,
21 and 1532.

248
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,560
It is a mock epic as I've
mentioned before. Uh, uh,

249
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,750
it's a mock epic poem that's
Advantis much admired and,

250
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:10,420
uh, as we should know by now. So we
have here these three Italian authors,

251
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,790
uh, that, uh, that Avantis, uh,

252
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,250
was indebted to. Um, other, uh,

253
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,660
more distant sources have been found.

254
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,980
But Ariosto is the abuse one
when very distant source,

255
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,323
uh,

256
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,660
of the story of a king who wanted
to put his wife to the test and,

257
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,000
and had somebody seduce her and so forth.
The same story,

258
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:40,010
but that is very remote. And, uh, uh,

259
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,500
the most obvious source
is a fragment from, uh,

260
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,910
the Orlando Foodie.
Also, I underscore again,

261
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,950
a set of anthesis indebtedness to it
through the two Italian Renaissance

262
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,590
Literature,
uh,

263
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,170
as he was also two Italian
renaissance art. As I mentioned in my,

264
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,030
in my last lecture.
Remember,

265
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,840
you have been reading the case book
and your introduction in Toronto.

266
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,270
I spent a good deal of time in Italy,

267
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,240
which had been of course the center
of the, of the, of the renaissance.

268
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,530
Now, the novel of the curious impertinent
has been variously interpreted,

269
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:27,170
but the most apt analysis the most,
uh,

270
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,270
how could I say, um, a
current or, uh, analysis, uh,

271
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,350
the most accepted is the one by her ne
Jeeva as you are now we have a French,

272
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,693
no.

273
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,090
Do you allow was a French professor who
taught in the United States nearly all

274
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:55,990
of his life.

275
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,160
His most famous book was called in the
original most songs romantic very day.

276
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,480
It romanesco known in English as deceit,

277
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,970
desire, and the novel, the original,

278
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,480
the first publication was 1961.

279
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,430
Your asshole theory revolves around the
concept of triangular or mimetic desire.

280
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,970
This desire is both external,

281
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,590
what it applies to a novel
and it's sources, the,

282
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,420
the previous books that it imitates
and internal when it applies to the

283
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:39,100
protagonists, love relations.
And in fact you are,

284
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:43,830
will claim that all novels
contained the current level.

285
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Knowles is this kind of memetic triangular
desire and his book contains analysis

286
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,410
of famous novels in
the European tradition,

287
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:58,090
like madame Bovary who shall in
wild and so forth. I recommend,

288
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,920
uh,
his book.

289
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,000
Now the story of I should run this.

290
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:11,040
Then all of the curious impertinent is
crucial to the development of Gerard's

291
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,190
theory and indeed it made having spired.
His theory is that important.

292
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,920
Gerard rights and this is,

293
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:22,921
I know it's a little dense quotation
translated from French into a little

294
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:27,650
awkward English. I'll read it very
slowly. Uh, so that you can follow it.

295
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,260
He says the existence of the novel of
the curious impertinent in the key Hartej

296
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,330
cause always intrigued critics.

297
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,970
The question arises whether the short
story is compatible with the novel.

298
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,510
The unity of the masterpiece
seems somewhat compromised.

299
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,770
It is this unity which I revealed by our
journey through novelistic literature,

300
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,200
his journey in the book through novelistic
literature in which he shows her this

301
00:22:56,201 --> 00:23:00,670
triangular desire exists in all its not
having begun with sort of Antici begins

302
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,001
his book.

303
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:06,001
We serantes we returned to Cervantes
and ascertain that this novelists genius

304
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,760
has grasped the extreme forms of imitated
desire nor small distance separates

305
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,860
this advantage of donkey, haughty
and disadvantages of Ansel motions.

306
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,880
All the novels we have considered in this
chapter as they show that the distance

307
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:29,050
is not in Superbowl. Since all the
novelists are linked to each other.

308
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,730
The simultaneous presence of external
and internal mediation in the same work

309
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,620
seems to us to confirm the unity of
novelistic literature and in turn,

310
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:41,890
the unity of this literature
confirms dot of [inaudible].

311
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,930
One is proved by the other,

312
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,630
just as one proves that the earth
is round by going around it.

313
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,020
The creative force of Cervantes is so
great that it has exerted effortlessly

314
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,610
that he has been exerted effortlessly
throughout the whole novelistic space.

315
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,590
All the ideas of the western novel
are precedent in German Don Quixote.

316
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,210
I keep, I continue reading Gerard
and the idea of these ideas,

317
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,750
the idea who central role is
constantly being confirmed.

318
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:16,751
The basic idea from which
one can rediscover everything
is triangular desire.

319
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,820
That's the end of the court.

320
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,980
I am sure this sounds very
strange and obscure to you. Uh,

321
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,450
if you haven't heard about it before,
but I tell you, once you understand it,

322
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,500
you may glean something
useful about your love life.

323
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,830
I said that reading the Quixote
would provide lessons for living.

324
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,420
When I was a graduate student,

325
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,840
this book was the rage and everyone
was interpreting his or her love

326
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:51,540
relationships in terms
of triangular desire.

327
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,580
Um,

328
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,960
so you don't have to make any
confessions at the end of the course,

329
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:02,040
but you might, uh, uh, uh, if you want to
tell me if this has helped you in any way,

330
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,270
understand your life.

331
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:06,740
Okay.

332
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,280
For Gerard,
desire is never spontaneous.

333
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,850
It's never a spontaneous
one to one relationship,

334
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:19,851
but mediated one desires a man or woman
because he or she is desired by another.

335
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,551
It is dark,

336
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:28,551
presume desire by the mediator
that makes her or him attractive.

337
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,780
I say presume because then the
mediators desire most yet have another,

338
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,510
a mediator to exist as such.

339
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:40,590
And then there will be a sort of
an endless series of mediations,

340
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:43,680
but we are focusing on
one triangle at a time.

341
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,400
Jealousy,
in other words,

342
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,090
is a requirement for desire for love.

343
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,660
You can now think of all the novels you
have reading with jealousy plays such an

344
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:58,510
important role.
Post full of jealous characters.

345
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,713
Okay.

346
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,100
Hence imitation of the mediator,

347
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,130
the one of whom one is jealous is of the
essence because of the belief that she

348
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:17,160
or he is loved by the object of
our desire. If you followed done,

349
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,520
this is the mimetic part of
desire, which may lead to the, uh,

350
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,240
to desire for the mediator in the guise
of desire for the original object of

351
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:27,470
desire.

352
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,800
That is you love so much the mediator
that you wind up loving the mediator,

353
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:35,820
not loving the person that you began.
You thought you began to love it.

354
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,200
You will see some of that in the novel,
the curious impertinent

355
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,950
in the context of the novel of the
cooters. In pertinent, it works like this.

356
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,260
We begin here. Um, you
have, uh, your, uh, uh,

357
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,860
your handout for easy reference.
Uh,

358
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:04,310
Anselmo cannot love really Kamila
until he gets low Tario to love her.

359
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,140
This is the gist of this
man's twist desire that,

360
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,800
uh, and, and, and why he
must put her to the test.

361
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,530
So, and sell more loves Camilla, but once,

362
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,590
but loteria is inserted as the mediator.

363
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,690
Then eventually when
Notario loves Camilla,

364
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,210
uh,
he does.

365
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:37,890
So in second triangle because
she has loved Anselmo before.

366
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,590
So we have these two triangles,
uh,

367
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,960
now this story may will reveal
a hidden sub story of the kind.

368
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,240
Uh, we, uh,

369
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,280
have been finding when characters tell
stories and the story may very well be

370
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,510
and it has been, uh, um, uh,

371
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,940
proposed a homosexual love between the
two friends using Camila as the mediator,

372
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,830
the certain, the third
triangle and sell more, uh,

373
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,630
really loves little patio, uh,
using Camilla ask the mediator.

374
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,730
And last way,

375
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,640
Gomez way w e y Nicole,

376
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,101
last way,

377
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:30,660
Gomes has written a very rare
swift persuasive article,

378
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,790
not only about that relationship between
the two, but also showing that Ansel,

379
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,680
most illnesses,
uh,

380
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,200
both physical or psychosomatic,
uh,

381
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,420
are feminine in the Medicine of the time,
uh,

382
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,520
to underscore the nature of the
relationship between these two.

383
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,370
So I hope that you're
understanding all of this and uh,

384
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,310
I hope it's not ruining your
love life, uh, uh, and uh,

385
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,080
uh, or your life in general by
realizing how complicated love can be.

386
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,143
Now,

387
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,840
this structure sheds light on the
intertwined stories that we have been

388
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:19,960
discussing. And this is why I have, uh,

389
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:25,020
these, uh, other triangles here on
the, on the board, on, on your handout.

390
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,050
Uh, uh, whereas, uh,
where we have that, uh,

391
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,890
this Fernando,
uh,

392
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,190
Gardenia Lucinda Triangle
in which Fernando loves
Lucinda really because she is

393
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,910
Cardenas a girl, uh, or it's going
to be his, his girl eventually,

394
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:49,930
and I suggested this in another
class. There is also, uh, there are,

395
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,350
there are intimations of a homoerotic
relationship here between Fernando on

396
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,783
Cardinia.

397
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,970
Now for the non goal when
it comes to the [inaudible],

398
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Fernando loses interest in Doterra once
he has processed her because there is no

399
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:14,050
mediation.
But he marries her once.

400
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:18,660
She appears at the end defended by Carl
venue. So once got a Daniel appears,

401
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,200
I said potential, uh, uh, mediator, uh,

402
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,940
Fernando, uh, goes ahead
and Mary's the pair.

403
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,510
Now a

404
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,140
donkey halters mediations,
other romances of chivalry and his heroes,

405
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:42,530
particularly the [inaudible], the
governor whom he imitates. I see.

406
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:44,290
You also imitates Orlando,

407
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,620
the Orlando also the
object of his love to see.

408
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:50,710
Now I said projection of the
loves of those famous lovers.

409
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,400
Oriana in the case of where Mardis
Angelica and the case of Orlando,

410
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,940
which is why he desires her and in the
way inventor from their own constructions

411
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:05,150
of her. And uh, we will
see her transformation,

412
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,850
uh, as the novel progresses,
which are a remarkable,

413
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:13,630
especially in part two.
Now,

414
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,440
the novel of the curious impertinent
is that holds up a mirror,

415
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,070
the mirror of literature to the young
people involved in love stories that are

416
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:29,230
about to culminate in marriage.

417
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,370
It provides a contrast to the comedy
like ending of the stories of Fernando,

418
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:38,560
Little Gardenia and Lucinda.

419
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,960
The novel of the curious in pertinent is
not so much an admonition though it is

420
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:48,961
that to us a lesson about the
complexities of love and how no permanent

421
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:53,380
stability can be achieved,
particularly not by marriage.

422
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,990
It is also a wink at the reader.
I think a wake up call, I mean,

423
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:01,780
can anyone,
you will see one who does soon,

424
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,860
but can anyone really believe in the
sincerity and the sincerity of the

425
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:08,680
permanence of don't Fernando's conversion?

426
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,680
Is it likely that Fernando
will be a faithful husband?

427
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,750
What about Lucinda?

428
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,340
She was tempted ones by money
and status and could be again,

429
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,640
literature teachers through pleasure,

430
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,770
a very harsh lesson.

431
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,190
Ultimately the novel of the
curious impertinent is about,

432
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,620
in my view,
the death instinct,

433
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,190
concealed within desire co evil with it,

434
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,940
with love.
It is what Freud called the death drive.

435
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:50,240
There is no stability where there is
desire that their affection of a social

436
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:53,180
erotic situation of Anselmo,
Camilla and Lotoja.

437
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,740
We Send me Raj and an
invitation to tragedy.

438
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,570
This is an even harsher lesson
about the human condition.

439
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,820
What the priest says at the end is that
he finds that the story well written but

440
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:12,050
he cannot believe, uh, that
the author has not, uh,

441
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,620
has not shown a real situation because
her husband would never do that.

442
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,390
Uh, that maybe young people, uh,
in love before marriage, um, uh,

443
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,120
ward but not husband.

444
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,340
What he's saying they are is something
that is a given in old golden age,

445
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:36,370
Spanish literature and they're given
is that everything that happens before

446
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:41,891
marriage is the stuff of
comedy and everything that
happens after marriage is to

447
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,760
stuff of tragedy.

448
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,550
This is not a lesson to be

449
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,210
taken too seriously,
but it's something to be a pondered.

450
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,190
Um, and I think that this
is what the priest notices.

451
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,190
He notices that, that this, this to
him would not be possible for a, uh,

452
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,860
uh, a husband to, to, to do this, uh,

453
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,910
subject his wife to this sort of,
of tests.

454
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:16,640
But then if it were among
people not married yet,

455
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,880
it may in May we made me,

456
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,620
of course a

457
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,260
marriage is usually
the ending of a comedy.

458
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Comedy's tend to end in marriage because
marriage is a return to stability.

459
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:35,470
And in, in, in theater, uh,

460
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,590
comedy is a return to an
order that has been upset

461
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,990
where our strategy does
not return, uh, to order.

462
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,510
So this is what the literary side of that,
uh,

463
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,620
would be whether it is
applicable or not to life.

464
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,160
It is for everyone, each one
of us to, uh, to discover.

465
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So now we move to the ending of
all of these stories are the,

466
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,440
uh,
[inaudible].

467
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,750
Fernando accepts Dorothea after everyone
pleads with him and a good deal of

468
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:19,751
services about the concept of
[inaudible] from [inaudible].

469
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,910
She pleads her case, uh, with us.

470
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:33,911
March verbus Marcella did in an
earlier episode and with a very,

471
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:38,280
um, thorough knowledge
of Castilian, uh, law.

472
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,423
MMM.

473
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,840
You see, she is lacking
either via Dorothea nobility,

474
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,670
but it Albia is passed on through
the male line, not the female line.

475
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:57,240
As we've mentioned here before, this is
what she underscores in her own defense.

476
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,270
Uh,
[inaudible] house.

477
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,330
He's Lucinda who has the either
but not the wealth Dorothea has.

478
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,740
Um,
so there is,

479
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,400
I mentioned in the earlier crass
sort of crisscrossing here,

480
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,810
a mirror image of the,
of the two women, uh,

481
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,780
that is, uh, has no, uh,

482
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,400
nobility but has money and
Lucinda has very little money,

483
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:27,870
but she has a nobility and so
forth. Lucinda, by the way,

484
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,090
in the midst of all this had been
kidnapped from a convent. Uh,

485
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,740
I'm brought to the in, in what, in
what turns out to be a side story,

486
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:41,640
not told in detail.
These stories could be,

487
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,660
could be extended. I didn't feed item
if you pursued every one of them,

488
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,240
but remember seen the, uh,
had been kidnapped and she's,

489
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,810
she's brought back for this, uh, ending.

490
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,020
Have you heard of red or whom
I mentioned in the last class,

491
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:00,330
and I mentioned him here
again with the respect and uh,

492
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,050
sometimes we'll disagree
with good old Javier who is

493
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:13,020
very, was retired now,
very competent critic.

494
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,350
Uh,
and uh,

495
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,550
also I should say a very
catholic Craig as you will read,

496
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,720
as you would understand from what I read
here, that's, there's no sin in that.

497
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,430
Uh,
have you had eto interprets in this way?

498
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:34,350
The Battle of the Wineskins, uh, that
leads to the resolution of the conflict.

499
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:39,240
He also has a kind of symbolic sexual
symbolic interpretation of the whole

500
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:43,210
thing, but it's good to
hear it, uh, to, uh, to, uh,

501
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,450
corrected a little bit,
but learn from it.

502
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,850
He says the meaning of the battle
against the wineskins is now clear.

503
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,310
He has been exposed.
You're leading.

504
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,660
Don Quixote is in a state of the nation
since he's really possessed by an

505
00:37:57,661 --> 00:38:00,840
intense dream and acting with closed eyes.

506
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,420
Thanks to super impose wineskins which
he saw in his room when he went to bed to

507
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:09,840
be the giant panda
Filando and to behead him,

508
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:12,510
he cuts the head around
and pierces the body.

509
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,070
The wine flow floods the room
on fills the end with smell.

510
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,920
Don Quixote has destroyed an erect
penis. This is what good. All right.

511
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,870
Um,
has filled in with the smell of wine.

512
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,020
Donkey hot the has certainly
cut down the power of lost.

513
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:31,740
I'm still putting this
blood transform into wine.

514
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:34,230
Most certainly be taken
as a sacramental symbol,

515
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:39,100
a symbol of the mysterious power of the
night against the anaerobes, pestilence,

516
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,900
metaphorically. The courage and
courtesy of Don Quixote have a vanquish.

517
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:46,960
The arrogance, cruelty,
and lost of Don Fernando.

518
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,990
It is true of donkey halter is wrong.
That is,

519
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:54,610
adventures have created havoc and morally,
his motivation is mixed,

520
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,510
but it is also an undeniable that
he's courageous, truthful, and chased.

521
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,780
His foolishness brings
him blows and ridicule,

522
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,860
but his greatness makes him a worth.
The instrument of providence

523
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,040
and rental goes on.

524
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,420
We see clearly that the spiritual move
movement has been completed by don't.

525
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Fernando's descend from lost and pride
to a Christian humility and fraternity,

526
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,030
but which he races his victims to the
level of his affection and now reunited in

527
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:29,350
love.
A common embraces possible.

528
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,360
The giant is dead and the true man,
the Christian gentleman has replaced him,

529
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,410
but which powers have brought
about the conversion has,

530
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,310
has it been the beauty that tears
the truths of Dorothea the priests or

531
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,630
situation?
They certainly all have a part in it,

532
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,560
but the texts leaves no doubt
that all these elements together,

533
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,940
together we're talking [inaudible] have
been the instruments of providence with

534
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:58,420
a capital p while men and women,
he goes on,

535
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,030
I'd been acting through the
impulse of their passions,

536
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,940
which brought them to the
labyrinth of the Sierra Morina.

537
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,110
Not a reference has been made by say
wanted to Savantas to heavens will,

538
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,280
but as soon as Cardenio meets
Doterra and installed at Don,

539
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,200
Fernando did not take
Lucy [inaudible] with him.

540
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,530
He expresses hope that heaven has decreed
their salvation from that moment on

541
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:24,160
their destinies began to escape from the
darkness and confusion of the elaborate

542
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,070
at the end,
the locals of social reunion.

543
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:31,300
And consequently of the transition
from wildness to civilization.

544
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,260
Lucinda having been released
by Don Fernando in the scene,

545
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:38,080
justice gripe exclaims his clothing,

546
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:43,081
Lucinda observe how heaven by unusual
and to us hidden ways has brought me into

547
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:46,510
the presence of my true husband and well,
you know,

548
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,870
buy a thousand Dearborn
experiences that death alone.

549
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:51,490
Can you face him out of my memory

550
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,940
goes on immediately.
And in the long scene of reconciliation,

551
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,200
all the participants claim that they're
meeting in the end is not accidental,

552
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,850
but on the contrary, the work
of provenance, of course,

553
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,020
the question to be considered is the
conflicts would have been solved without

554
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:15,190
the intervention of Gnocchi. Chaotic.
Uh, which I will speak about in a minute.

555
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:19,060
I think that, uh, that he was the
agent of course. Uh, in any case,

556
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,090
a little winds up his article,
uh,

557
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,400
which ultimately deals with
the whole issue of marriage,

558
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:25,810
which is so important and they can halt.

559
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,670
And so important in the 16th
century and about whom, uh,

560
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,750
the likes of Erasmus on Bvs
wrote as he quotes them. And,

561
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,550
and the Council of Trent, which is taking
place as you know, from reading, uh,

562
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,320
earlier, uh, discussed that.

563
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:44,060
We will talk about this again in part
when we talk about part two about

564
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:47,210
marriages and all of that because he
hasn't said marriages are the core of

565
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:52,170
social stability and social, uh, on
transitions in, in, in, in, in, in,

566
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,550
in society. The way that society, uh,

567
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,000
renews itself. So it's,
it's, it's crucial.

568
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,640
So this is what a retro rights and it's
important because he is bringing in

569
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,593
first the,

570
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,740
the neoplatonic notion of notions of
love derived from the courtly love

571
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:15,650
tradition that I think I've spoken about,
uh,

572
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,890
against a sort of a movement in Spanish
society and in 16th Century Society and

573
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:25,630
philosophy in general to
two or more bourgeois, uh,

574
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,500
sense of marriage. Uh, uh, you remember,

575
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,350
I think I've spoken about the Courtney
love tradition according to of tradition,

576
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,030
which is one of the great,
uh, uh, uh, uh, can I say, uh,

577
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,200
uh,
spiritual revolutions in the West is the,

578
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,490
the idea that the woman, uh,
had to be adored at a distance.

579
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,290
The law love could not be consummated.

580
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,860
It usually the love [inaudible]
a woman who was unattainable,

581
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,540
preferably married and, uh, the lower
paid homage to the woman and so forth.

582
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,990
Uh, we still hear the
echoes of the, of the,

583
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,470
of the courtroom off tradition
in modern poetry, in Ooda,

584
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,350
on Octavio Paz and the great
modern, uh, points. Uh,

585
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Doki hotter is a courtly
lover in that sense, an agent,

586
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,700
uh, out of fashion, a
Courtney lover. But that's,

587
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,550
that is what inspires a,
his love for Lucy. Now,

588
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,830
neoplatonism of course, was at
the core of these, uh, uh, uh,

589
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,250
uh, Courtney love traditionalist. Okay.

590
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,550
So [inaudible] says the following.

591
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:42,551
Now that I think I have placed this in
the in its ideological context against a

592
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:47,750
sentimental and neoplatonic tradition
which made a woman a goddess,

593
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,450
Cervantes takes the side of the conjugal
love presented by Erasmus and Vvs

594
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,360
Erasmus of Rotterdam. I will speak
more about him following classes.

595
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,880
It was a very important
16th century humanist

596
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,850
and so what's Bibi's

597
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,970
which allows my not only do enjoy the
legitimate pleasure of the sexual union,

598
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,780
but to help each other to fight against
the inevitable weakness and imperfection

599
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:15,860
of the human condition.

600
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,330
By emphasizing the social
civilizing aspects of marriage,

601
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,780
Cervantes was closer to the new doctrines
of reform then to the renaissance

602
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:31,160
ideals of love. Indeed with he
said he's thinking of patriarch,

603
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,420
got to see last two on the ports
that I have mentioned before.

604
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:37,900
Indeed with his attacks on the pastoral
and by the story of El Kudos in

605
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,150
pertinent to the curio.

606
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,100
Then all of curation pertinent Cervantes
is precisely marking his distance from

607
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:48,420
the Gregory Socratic tradition of the
renaissance and joining the new to a great

608
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:50,970
extent,
Bourgeois Christianity,

609
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,600
which descended to the south of Europe
from the low countries in opposition to

610
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,830
[inaudible] marine billionaires.

611
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,330
These are the that you heroes so that
you've all read romances. The Nouveau,

612
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,950
you are a lover. It's not a
knife, but a Christian gentlemen,

613
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,770
such love as we have
seen has two elements.

614
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,940
It is Christian and the
activity of providence and
the priest show the role that

615
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:16,440
God and his church play in, in its
growth, but it's also jumped in mentally.

616
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,970
Both got Denny on. Don't Fernando become
through love, not only Christians,

617
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:25,800
but Christian gentlemen. Core three
love brings the night to madness,

618
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,350
but Christian Love saves him.

619
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,360
Such a rescue is metaphorically expressed
in our story by the great classical

620
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:36,510
myth of the labyrinth lost in the
wilderness of this, yet at the Morena,

621
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,890
their lives twisted into the integrate
mace of the librarians on the brink of

622
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:44,840
being devoured by the mentor
of lost the madness. Cardinia,

623
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:48,780
Lucinda Rotarian Fernando are finally
rescued by don't keyholders courageous

624
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:52,800
battle and bear the civilizing
force of an Erasmian church.

625
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,420
Divine providence in fact,
has provided us a Rodney the saving.

626
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,370
So that that's the end of her,
of the court,

627
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,210
which I hope now you can understand given
the background that I gave you about

628
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,660
all of these sounds fine.
And it is instructive,

629
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,530
particularly the references to
harass me most and to beers, uh,

630
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,180
until we take into account the hilarious
convolutions and the mixture of madness,

631
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:19,020
dreams and lies that bring about
the resolution of the conflict.

632
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:25,250
The conflict has been solved by
don't get hold this intervention.

633
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,160
Uh,

634
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,730
but how can such a ridiculous figure and
be the instrument of providence with a

635
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:33,280
capital p?
They have been solved by donkey health,

636
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:38,281
this agency because they are truly
worldly conflicts involving tensions of a

637
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:44,040
world in social flux where the older
values to say the values of the,

638
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,110
uh, of the, of the, uh, the renaissance,

639
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,450
the values of quarterly love,
uh, no longer hold sway,

640
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:56,010
don't get halted and bodies the mixture
of values in transition so he can

641
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:59,190
mediate in the various
conflicts and solve them.

642
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,140
He would not have been able to do
so if we had been a real night,

643
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,170
nor had he been an ordinary man
of his time. But to say this,

644
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:15,171
it's not to do justice to the multilayer
plots on raveling in these episodes.

645
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:22,580
I am mostly struck by sort of
anthis inventiveness by the wild.

646
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:25,080
You're disciplined imagination at play,

647
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,830
which cannot I think be reduced to
this a providential a scheme that,

648
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,520
that, that have you had, uh, offers don't,

649
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:40,521
Fernando is the one level
[inaudible] the giant,

650
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,680
remember the rhyme, fair to
Nando, bong, Daffy Langdon,

651
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,330
the figure of fun.
Now,

652
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:52,360
Philando though invented at Hawk by
the priest is presented as an effective

653
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:57,670
factor in the outcome of the conflicts
are denied the Weiss and Princess

654
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,540
[inaudible] Macona although
not real and grotesque

655
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,400
don't real in relation to
the fiction of the normal.

656
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:11,610
This whole ensemble exists and performs
on a level not unlike that of the

657
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:18,151
characters who invented them or who
invented this whole ensemble ensemble.

658
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,670
There story of Panda Filando
is like a dream version,

659
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,690
a recognizable distortion
of Doterra's real conflict.

660
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,700
If you remember when we went over it,

661
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,940
the story of the story of Panda
Filando is like a dream version. Uh,

662
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:37,720
uh, I, I repeat, uh, off of
total territorial conflict.

663
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:38,554
Remember again,

664
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,850
the hidden meaning of Mikko Macona over
which I will go again if her name that

665
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:45,810
is an illusion to mimicry
to representation. To me,

666
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:49,540
Macy's do the very process
by which she was invented.

667
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:55,350
Those Mikami Kona not in a way
represent representation itself.

668
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:59,890
I mean she is the representation
itself taking place before our eyes

669
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:06,400
are all these inventions of characters
by other characters similar to Cervantes

670
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,220
invention of his own
characters in the hotel.

671
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,220
And this is what this
whole thing is telling us.

672
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,400
This is what is truly Dennis sling,

673
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:20,401
about the resolution of all
these conflicts that they
do unravel at every level.

674
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,430
Sort of simultaneously that is
to say, and this is, uh, the, uh,

675
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,440
what you have on the back of
your triangles. And I have
here on the, on the, on,

676
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:33,910
on the board, uh, the all these
levels, the donkey holders dream,

677
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,180
which is ducky holdup on the Philando.
And we can we go now, he caught the,

678
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,450
the head off of the giant.

679
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,620
He thinks in the dream they met a
fictional creation by the priest.

680
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:49,210
That story the priest invents and
Amico Macona then, uh, performs,

681
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,510
uh, meaning Dorothea Doki,
Hotifa, Philando becoming,

682
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,580
going up in actually all
these characters in that,

683
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:59,140
in that novel that the priest
and, and, and Dorothea invent.

684
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,430
And then there is the fiction of the
novel, which is Donkey Horton on Fernando,

685
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:04,870
a little terror and so forth.

686
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,810
All of those levels sort of
collapse together and are,

687
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,430
the conflicts are resolved by Don Quixote,
uh,

688
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,610
slaying the slang,
the,

689
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,880
the giant that is occurring,
uh,

690
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,890
bursting poor.
One Paloma is wine skins to his horror.

691
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,120
Um,

692
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,120
it is a stroke of genius that the process
of restitution will be motivated by

693
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:31,760
Don Quixote's nightmare,

694
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,150
which comes to interrupt the reading of
the novel of the curious in pregnant or

695
00:50:36,151 --> 00:50:39,650
the point incidentally near the end,
which is when it's about to unravel.

696
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,380
When that Novelis about doing robbed,

697
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:46,310
another case of these interruptions
in the dream don't be healthy.

698
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:49,370
Completes the story of
Princess Mikami Corner.

699
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,500
That is Doterra's predicament translated
into the language of chivalry.

700
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,360
Like Don Quixote psychotic
delusion. Remember about, uh,

701
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,090
uh, uh, about, uh, uh,

702
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,670
queen Massima having had an affair
with this surgeon, uh, which was, uh,

703
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:11,120
his version of Lucinda in the
flower by the Fernando. Um,

704
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,930
now these version of the testing
Burgerville true to the name,

705
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:19,790
she assumes it's a grotesque parody of
her story. I go back to what you said.

706
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,120
Remember that Mikko Means Monkey Mikami
colonize the twice monkey with an

707
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:28,340
argumentative like that.

708
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:31,310
Remember the [inaudible] that I mentioned,

709
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:35,690
Segundo Second Dome from second.
Second Dong is a big second,

710
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,730
uh, grand too. Delong in Spanish, uh,
low marks for alarm marks and so forth.

711
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,320
Mikko me come is, it is an augmented
if involved there McCormick.

712
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,020
Uh, remember monkey see monkey do
and all of that. It's in the back.

713
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,760
She said big blown up. Distorted copy
of [inaudible]. This is what Mikko.

714
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,700
Mikko Nice.

715
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:02,530
The ending of [inaudible] story in that
register is what breaks off the reading.

716
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:05,270
As I mentioned of the novel
of the curious. In pertinent,

717
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,930
that story will be resumed and
comes to it's very tragic ending.

718
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:12,230
While those of Cardenio Leucine,
that latte under Fernando,

719
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:16,040
we'll have it purely
comic one happy endings,

720
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,390
as I mentioned with marriages
are typical of the, of comedy.

721
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:26,060
This is yet another intersection of
the two stories here with the accent on

722
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,770
section and crossing on cutting.

723
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,900
The ending of the novel of the curious
in pertinent reveals his artificial

724
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:37,360
literary quality when the reading is
concluded. And as I've mentioned that the,

725
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:42,170
the, the priest, uh, uh, uh, uh, remarks,

726
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,010
uh, uh, as I said that it doesn't sound,

727
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,300
it doesn't sound right for a husband to
have done some that it's not good me,

728
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:51,900
Macy's.
Uh,

729
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:56,460
and then there follow the court
like scene of reconciliations, uh,

730
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,530
uh, between the various,
among the various, uh,

731
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,580
couples and restitutions made including
restitution to the barber who's based

732
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:09,020
in, was uh, uh, you, you
haven't gotten there,

733
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,900
but you will see that there is this
their steers of restitutions to all the

734
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:15,500
characters who have been
injured or damaged in some, uh,

735
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,970
or harmed in some, in
some way. Uh, the, the,

736
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,980
the in becomes like a court of
law where these institutions are,

737
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,960
uh, are made now, uh,

738
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,680
I want to quote, have yet in a
positive light. Now, uh, and,

739
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:35,880
uh, he, he's,

740
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:39,480
he's right in the sense that the values
are church changing and there is sort of

741
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:42,120
an emerging bourgeois sense.
It is true.

742
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:46,430
He says that neoplatonism associated
with the tradition of course we love was

743
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:51,431
still the accepted poetic and artistic
Vigo four h four aristocratic sentiment.

744
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,220
But through the influence of Christian
humanism and as an expression of the

745
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:57,900
strength of the new use,

746
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,880
the bureau can patients with secular
life and above all marriage replaced the

747
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:07,140
stylized conventions of chivalry and
the austere ideals of monasticism.

748
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,000
This,
this may be true,

749
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,920
particularly if we take into account
all of the economic and legal background

750
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:17,980
that I have given you about
the relationship between
these characters. The,

751
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,930
the fact that Fernando is, they
say, well, I'm Dong a and a,

752
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:25,770
and it's not going to inherit a much of a,
of the state,

753
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,170
which makes him very anxious. Uh, uh,

754
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,720
the fact that [inaudible]
runs the farm and, and,

755
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:37,020
and has money and all of that. Uh,
it does give the impression that,

756
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,050
that there is a kind
of bourgeois sense of,

757
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:45,150
of marriage and stability
that is replacing the old
ideals of the neoplatonic,

758
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,950
uh, idea of, uh,

759
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,980
contained in this aristocratic versions
of love in the poetic traditions.

760
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:58,320
The idea, uh, also seems to be that, uh,

761
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,750
to cure the characters in the real world,

762
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,090
uh,
of the fiction where they live,

763
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,270
they also have to be cured in
their dreams and inventions. Uh,

764
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,090
which is one of the overall plot strands
now being resolved in the karate.

765
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,540
He's the only one missing here.
I mean,

766
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:23,520
everyone is going to be sort of cured
of his or her dreams, hallucinations.

767
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,500
Uh, uh, uh, and so forth. Uh,

768
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,340
but don Quixote still has not,

769
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,800
but they have to be cured of those
hallucinations as well as, uh, uh,

770
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,580
their situation has to,
has to be stabilized in social terms.

771
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,490
The priest,
uh,

772
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,640
the barber and the rest of the characters
engaged don Quixote at his level of

773
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,900
madness in part because they
are also mad in their own ways.

774
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:51,380
You have to realize, uh, this, uh,

775
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:56,400
what are the priests and the Barbara
doing traipsing all over Spain after the

776
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:58,140
night?
Uh,

777
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:01,500
remember what I said before about the
priest is a very strange priest who's a

778
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:03,960
reader of romances of chivalry.
Uh,

779
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:09,470
what has become of the priest duties at
the church or the barbarous customers?

780
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:11,690
Uh,
we,

781
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:16,320
we ask they to have left
normal lives as sanctuary has.

782
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:21,240
He left his wife and children to engage
in an insane quest after an insane man.

783
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,080
The point is that mental life is made
up of levels that mirror and his toward

784
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:31,480
each other, and the literature
appears to emerge from this interplay.

785
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:36,430
The creative mind of the author is
capable of reflecting or expressing the

786
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:41,450
multilayered essence of that
mental life after the captive,

787
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:45,940
stale about which we'll be talking
in the next, uh, class. Fascinating,

788
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,810
very entertaining. Coptic style based
on said Rhonda for his own life.

789
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,710
The priests and the barber and the
others will send Don Quixote home.

790
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,040
They will cage him and sent him home and
a return that will still engage them in

791
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,760
further, uh, adventures. Uh,

792
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,940
the end of part one is near and
we will get to it next week.
