1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,400
US, we approach the episode of, uh,

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,210
Camacho's wedding.
Uh,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,330
it should be readily apparent,
uh,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,960
that it was the story of
what's going to be a play.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,930
Uh, it has a beginning, a conflict
or climax and a resolution,

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,760
uh,
given that it has a happy ending,

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,840
uh, it's safe to assume that
it was going to be a comedy.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,330
Actually, scholars of Ferritin
around undiscovered, uh,

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,360
evidence that indeed it was a play
that Cervantes was planning to write,

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,703
uh,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,500
and a set of antigens seems
founding the Quixote, uh,

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,670
a book where he could a total
dump all of his work in progress.

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,020
The, uh, the stories, uh, uh,

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,330
some of which wound up of course
it the book a exemplary stories.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,790
But some of the, uh, the stories in
the book of course where, uh, uh,

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,520
written independently on her
actually circulated independently,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,900
uh,

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,020
the novel as it's being developed in the
cohort that will be a uninclusive kind

19
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:21,210
of, uh, of, uh, of literary work, uh,

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,680
with a loose format,
uh,

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,700
not following the strict
rules of our literary forms.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,120
Or John has a derived from
the classical tradition where,

23
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,750
uh, these, uh, liberties, uh,

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,740
who are not available but
the Quixote does, uh, allow,

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,080
uh,

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,880
for these kinds of incorporation
of stories and have various texts.

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,720
It is a, uh, a feature that the novel, uh,

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,580
we'll continue to have. And that in the
modern period of course, uh, will be,

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,060
uh, exploited to the, to the very limits.

30
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,883
Um,

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,760
lenders also notice how these love story
is a neatly integrated into the plot of

32
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:16,530
the novel as opposed to the
more than general way in which,

33
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,300
uh,
such stories were inserted in part to uh,

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,590
here,
uh,

35
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,610
donkey hope they central are more or
less involved in the developments and

36
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:31,770
certainly no Quixote's
involved in the outcome.

37
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,650
Of course, given that this was
going to be a play, there is a,

38
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:40,470
a great deal of theatricality
in the whole episode,

39
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,880
which includes theater within the theater,
uh,

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,180
as these celebrations for
the wedding take place.

41
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,590
Even nature has been artistically arranged
so much so that the outdoors now has

42
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,590
a roof.

43
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,590
You may that when they enter the meadow
where the celebration of the wedding is

44
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,340
going to take place.
Uh,

45
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:11,170
it is noted that the trees have
been arranged in such a way,

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,260
uh,

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,260
us to provide a canopy a that the sun
can barely penetrate to reach the grass.

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,660
Uh, that is his nature
turned into architecture,

49
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,840
us a US adware.
Um,

50
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,750
the play within the play, uh,
is, uh, a way of underlining,

51
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,560
uh, uh, that everything is theatrical,

52
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,810
that there is no real action, uh, uh,

53
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,380
that is not already theater,

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,280
that his life is already
theater in part two.

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,430
And this is part of the theme of this in
Ganja that I have been underlining for

56
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,290
the past few lectures.

57
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,660
Let us also take notice of the abundance
that prevails here and in the second

58
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,680
part in general,
in contrast with part one,

59
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,480
whereas in, in, in part one,
the characters eight frugally,

60
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,400
uh,

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,400
now sent Joe has so much food before
him that he's scarcely knows what to do

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,300
with it.
Um,

63
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,200
don't compare this with
the very frugal meal,

64
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:33,540
that donkey hope they had at that very
first in where he ate a fish because it

65
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:38,460
was a Friday abundance contrasted
with the starkist want.

66
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,370
It's typical of the aesthetics of
the Baroque, this, uh, this, uh,

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,180
clash and a abundance ties,

68
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,040
uh, in with the notion of sensuality, uh,

69
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,020
the sensuality of server antiques art
that Auerbach spoke about in the essay

70
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:01,021
that you have or red and that he says
he is the hallmark of sort of antithesis

71
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,330
work.
The essential,

72
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,810
the tangible in all its abundance
turns into a simulacrum and reveals its

73
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:15,770
opposite, which is quite literally
death. This is the, this,

74
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,650
this in Gagnon aspect.

75
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,220
So we have Santos speech about
death being the devour of all,

76
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,973
as I said,

77
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,880
the overarching plot and
the plot within the, uh,

78
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
the work in this,
uh,

79
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,140
stories follows this pattern of in Ganja,
Ganja.

80
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Now we may ask when we come to this
episode of why our wedding so important in

81
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:53,230
fiction, including film of course
in the theater too, but him film,

82
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,040
there are many, uh,
films that you, uh, uh,

83
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,810
I'm sure I can remember, uh,
that uh, center on a wedding,

84
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,400
weddings mark a moment of Social Union
and renewal both of society and of our

85
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,450
Matrix.
They are at transition mark by 15,

86
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,140
particularly by eating in fiction.

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,190
Weddings tend to be conclusions.
Uh,

88
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,480
they married and lived
happily ever after is common,

89
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,660
uh,
traditional ending two stories in the,

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,350
in the, in the wedding celebrations,
the, the world is consumed,

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,290
uh,
uh,

92
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,690
in a way that leads to the
consummation of, uh, of, of,

93
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:51,650
of the, of, of the
marriage. Um, the story,

94
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,950
I will see much more about this in a,
in in a very short time,

95
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,220
the story of Camacho's wedding, like
the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, uh,

96
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,490
which it is based.

97
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,930
You see conjunction of love and death
of arrows and Tinnitus or love that

98
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:13,811
struggles against death
for continuity and renewal.

99
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,930
There are intimations of
the death scene. Uh, uh,

100
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,720
the culminating death theme, which is
really not the, that scene, but, uh, uh,

101
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,210
contrived or theatrical that scene.

102
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,390
But there are intimations of the death
scene in the calf that is impelled to be

103
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:39,530
cooked, that our is find as
they arrive at the wedding,

104
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,040
a celebration,
one good one grove.

105
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,670
So see in that impaled calf escape goat,

106
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,360
which is typical of feasts celebrations.

107
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,240
Now Camacho is rich and powerful,

108
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:00,490
like don't Fernando in part one.
Uh,

109
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,860
what basilio's abilities and skills
prevail over social and economic forces.

110
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,640
His, uh, uh, his, uh,

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,070
abilities, uh, win the day.

112
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm there as much made of how many
skills he has. He can play the guitar,

113
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,260
he can, uh, he's an athlete.

114
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,520
We later found out that he's
quite an actor also. Uh,

115
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,890
now the, the episode is
a prose a pizza. Lamean

116
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,240
I think I'd better write this.

117
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,860
A poem or song in praise of the bride or
groom or have both from the Greek Epi,

118
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,980
uh,
[inaudible] and [inaudible] chamber

119
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,740
and a,
uh,

120
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,510
a versus a bit alarming is actually
performed as part of the wedding.

121
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,860
A celebration, if you remember
what an elaborate one at that,

122
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,340
uh, this episode of, of, of a wedding, uh,

123
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,120
uh, with such celebrations,
uh, he's, he's,

124
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,310
he's common in the literature
of the period most,

125
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,730
the most prominent one is
in the great poem by Louis.

126
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,870
The gum Guerra, who's name I may not
have mentioned before, who is the great,

127
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,840
uh,
by rock port.

128
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,240
It is from him that you get the
word in English, gum go ristic uh,

129
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:53,570
something very baroque complicated
and he,

130
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:55,000
he's famous for many poems,

131
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,780
but the most famous one is
called the solely Dallas.

132
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,720
And uh, in the Solidago
this, there is quite a,

133
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,160
an elaborate wedding, a
ceremony, but it's described

134
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,953
okay.

135
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,500
It is, uh, uh, it's like a spring ritual,

136
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,680
a celebration of nature's replenishment.

137
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,200
Remember the park too vaguely
begins sort of, uh, uh, in spring,

138
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,140
but in the whole episode when wonders
is nature corrected by art or dose,

139
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,580
the nature prevail.

140
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,840
I think the answer is
Opo side art prevails.

141
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,890
That art corrects niche.
And this is again,

142
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,600
one of the main themes in
part to like eat healthy.

143
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Don't you hold these on this side
a of Basilio [inaudible] Camacho.

144
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,680
And in this the episode is very mindful
of Marcella's and resourced almost in

145
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,800
part one when don Quixote,
again, it's on the side of, uh,

146
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,643
of Marcella.

147
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,910
Uh,

148
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,130
perhaps this episode is the,

149
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,970
is the kind of ending that demo say like
resource episode should have had in,

150
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,210
uh, in part one the, uh, the,

151
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,220
the reminiscences of that episode also
in the attempted or faked suicide in part

152
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:30,430
one resource to us we saw had
actually committed to site.

153
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,410
Now the stories are version of the
myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, uh,

154
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,690
which had been anticipated
by lowering. So, uh,

155
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,400
the Dan does sonnet on the
topic during the episode.

156
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,590
Uh, Diego Demi down does house his
father's house, the man in green,

157
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,900
uh, and it's mentioned directly by
one of the students on the road,

158
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,420
uh, to the, uh, to the wedding.

159
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,470
It is also acted out in the
downside of lava. The spoken dance,

160
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,090
the Peter Lamean during the
wedding festivities. So the,

161
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,490
the myths of period was from Tishbe.
He hangs Haley over this episode.

162
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,910
John Synagis writes,
quote,

163
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,210
the occurrence of the ceremony in a
theater theater like implies that the

164
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:28,900
wedding is what? One more
active artifice. Therefore,

165
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:33,430
when Basillio appears,
we become caught up with the spectators,

166
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,383
the wedding,

167
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,620
they let the audience at the play
where to Spencer's Esperando.

168
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,460
They were waiting in suspense to
see what would happen. The heroin,

169
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:47,461
it star of the play has just stepped
on stage and everyone is anxious to see

170
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,300
what he will do.

171
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,660
Synagogue ads comparing this episode,
which is uh,

172
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,250
uh, the only one on love on, on,

173
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,010
on the second part with the current Daniel
tale of the first part and he writes

174
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:05,320
the following.
This is a rather lengthy court,

175
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,940
but I think a useful quote from
this, uh, uh, John Finnegan,

176
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,133
it goes,

177
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,150
the final result of the
action of commercials wedding
is the confirmation of the

178
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:21,151
propriety of romantic love
and the rejection of the
illegitimate claim on love

179
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,860
by greed.

180
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,210
The same conclusion was
provided by Cardinia tail.

181
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,470
There are however important
differences between the two stories.

182
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,530
Cause then you're stale ends in an in to
which the hand of fate had led the two

183
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:46,570
couples. The Camacho
wedding episode, however,

184
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:49,670
ends in a stage the conclusion,

185
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,870
the conclusion is brought
about by basileus skill.

186
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,650
The difference between
these two endings reflect,

187
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,740
reflect a significant difference between
part one and part two in part one only

188
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:07,291
don't be haughty on the priest acted as
authors in the sense that they tried to

189
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,790
impose fiction on reality.

190
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
The role of art was of secondary concern
to the other characters in part two.

191
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:15,970
However,

192
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,920
art and artifice are extremely important
and a larger number of characters from

193
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:23,830
central bouncer to the Duke
and Duchess and of course, uh,

194
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Samsung Carrasco Act as authors by using
fiction to impose their wills on the,

195
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,810
on all the characters in
connatural wedding Basilea
access author because he is

196
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:41,350
not content to let fate
decide the end of the story.

197
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,830
Therefore he imposes his will on the other
characters by using fiction to all to

198
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:52,380
alter the course of the story away
from its natural. And, um, quote,

199
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,290
can you see also what he's also
the act of this play that he has,

200
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,120
uh,
made up.

201
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,100
But another way to look at the episode
is to see it as a modern version of the

202
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,510
beer must anticipate myth,

203
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,960
which is clearly in the ground on a
alumina's have just said over the story.

204
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,220
The Pyramus and Thisbe story in Orbitz
with the morphosis highlights the pagan

205
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,420
theme of suicide,

206
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,930
which Cervantes in his Catholic
environment uses for dramatic effect,

207
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,590
but ultimately avoids. Now, all of it,

208
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,490
we all know who he was and I gave you
some information in the law in the sheet

209
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:45,611
that I passed around with a copy of
this episode in the metamorphoses.

210
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,780
He was a Roman poet of the,
of the last dog osteon Augustan age.

211
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,410
He's known for his ours.

212
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,420
I'm a Tortilla with someone called the
most immoral work written by amount of

213
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,570
genius.
It's a love.

214
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,740
Don't rush out now to get the book.
Uh,

215
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,240
but the metamorphosis is
his most important work. Uh,

216
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,620
which is a long narrative poem book,

217
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,600
which recounts a legends in which the
miraculous transformations of matter,

218
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,330
uh, occur. In fact,

219
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,360
the poem begins.

220
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,650
My intention is to tell of bodies
changed to different forms.

221
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,470
And it begins with the change
from chaos to customers, uh,

222
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,240
and, uh, and goes on to the moment, uh,

223
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,380
to Julio. Cesar been
transformed into, into a star.

224
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,740
So the Middle Ages took the Vietnam
office is to be kind of a Pagan Bible like

225
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:56,171
an old testament if you'll test
them and tells the story of the,

226
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,920
uh, of the, of the universe.

227
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,950
So does the metamorphosis using the
classical myths he's influenced,

228
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,830
uh, on, uh, in the
renaissance was a tremendous,

229
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,050
and even in the, in the
late Middle Ages, uh, he,

230
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,090
he was kind of the,
the sourness of myths that artists both,

231
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,640
uh, painters, sculptures and writers, uh,

232
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,730
youth, uh, very often, um,

233
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,210
now, uh, in, in, in Spanish literature,

234
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,660
he was a very influential,
as he was,

235
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,190
of course in English
literature throughout the ages.

236
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,590
Um, he was, he, he, he is,

237
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,040
he with virtual,
uh,

238
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,020
in importance as a classical
author, uh, to be, uh,

239
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,790
followed.
Now they're deeper,

240
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,680
more disturbing aspects
in this story. Uh, uh, uh,

241
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,640
in Cabarrus wording linking
the flat deflowering blot
and the connection between

242
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:14,910
life and death thing,
to which I will go in some detail.

243
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,740
Love appears as a mock
death to promote life.

244
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Violence and love are complicit because
violence is the subtext of love.

245
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,290
The issue here is of classical
mythologies version of this,

246
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,390
uh, uh, contrasted with, uh,
uh, uh, Christian doctrine.

247
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,180
The question for artists
of the renaissance deeply
interested in the classical

248
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:44,220
world,
uh,

249
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,570
but living in a Christian one was
what to do with the ancient gods.

250
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,490
Uh,
the most common answer was allegory.

251
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,310
The myths were seeing as moral
allegories. Uh, they, uh,

252
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,300
they told him moral tales.
Um,

253
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,830
but in the case of the
episode of Camacho sweating,

254
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,920
what's the seems to be proposing is a
modern reenactment of an ancient recurring

255
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,930
dilemma concerning love, uh,

256
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,950
and using for that,

257
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,980
the classical myth Pyramus and Thisbe
basilio's arts are used here to steer the

258
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:30,570
story away from its pagan ending,
uh,

259
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,830
suicide to a victory of
love and Christian marriage.

260
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,410
You have read the story in the handout
that I gave you in the last class.

261
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,560
The Pagan ending is turned into theater.

262
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,200
If the representation into art,

263
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Don Quixote has referred earlier to
marriage as an as an irreparable accident.

264
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,270
It's something that,
you know,

265
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,310
something that sounds very funny to
us today is to just using a scholastic

266
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:03,750
terminology to refer to it.

267
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,610
I'm always in the context of these
debates about marriage that I will revisit

268
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,440
today.
Basilio makes the accidental,

269
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,810
the result of choice,
his choice.

270
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,820
The point is the skill and wilingness
need to a virtuous result here.

271
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,330
The whole of the second part of
the Quixote is an apology for art,

272
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,650
for the artificial, for the
constructed, for the contrived, for art,

273
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,630
helping nature attained good ends.

274
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,720
After going through the process
of disingenuous that I have been,

275
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,350
uh,
underlining in the past few classes,

276
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,140
it is a way of turning the seat,

277
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,980
which would normally lead to the solution
went into a positive force that leads

278
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:52,870
to a happy ending.

279
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,920
As I said, by Celia skill
prevail over, uh, uh,

280
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,870
the economic forces,
uh,

281
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,100
the social and economic forces
is his craftiness wins the day.

282
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,080
Now what I claim, uh, is
that is beneath all of that,

283
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:17,140
the kind of sub story is subtext.
Uh,

284
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,860
this story is a rewriting of the last
stories of part one that turn on on equal

285
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:28,150
marriage and the that involve
the issue of secret marriages,

286
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,230
which as I said, we're a topic,
uh, the hot topic of the day,

287
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,910
which was taken up by the council of
Trent. I've been read Eliot, you know,

288
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,340
now what the council of Trent was.

289
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,470
I spoke about these issues when, uh, uh,

290
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,800
when speaking about the episode in
which Dorothea allows herself to be

291
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,990
deflowered by Don Fernando.

292
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,850
The difference here is the lurking
precedence of classical myth.

293
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,550
Typical,
more typical of the Baroque in part one.

294
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:05,430
These stories about all of
this, uh, young people, uh, uh,

295
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,850
seem to be drawn from,
from contemporary legal archives,

296
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,550
contemporary stories about
conflicts involving social issues,

297
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,310
states and legacies.

298
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,410
Here the source is much more imposing.
An ancient,

299
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,430
the myth of period was on therapy,

300
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,580
but true to the political
character of part two. Uh,

301
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,450
there is in addition,

302
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:37,960
a protracted discussion of the
issue of marriage by the characters.

303
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,890
The issue of marriage was a political
issue, not just a religious issue.

304
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,020
It's impossible to separate the two

305
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,750
other echoes of part one our Basilio's
madness when he hears of credentials,

306
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,700
cutaneous impending marriage,

307
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,360
which recalls both resource
Tamang Cardinia when they go mad.

308
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,930
In the case of Canadian,
mostly we don't see it.

309
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:08,730
The system will actually act it out.
And of course the issue of suicide, uh,

310
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,260
which evokes, uh, the system. Uh,

311
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,340
this is another case I
emphasize of rewriting episodes
from part one so that we

312
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:22,401
writings involve here both episodes
in part one on classical myth,

313
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,760
which is being rewritten.

314
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,920
But there is a deeper take on marriage

315
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,050
at the level of material transformations.

316
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,330
The story of commercials.

317
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:41,350
Wedding is about the issue
of marriage as a sacrament,

318
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,360
the transformation of matter
for transcendental purposes.

319
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,750
That of creating a new human life and
how it is institutionalized in civil and

320
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:58,970
Canon law.
That is by society and religion.

321
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,480
The law is based on prohibition.

322
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,570
Thou shall not here the ban
instituted by cutaneous parents once,

323
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,190
uh,
uh,

324
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,490
she and Basilio have
reached sexual maturity,

325
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,170
which is what quite evident if
you read the story, uh, there, uh,

326
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,350
uh, prevision comes up when they are, uh,

327
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,380
they have reached sexual maturity.
Uh,

328
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,470
she has to be gone to menstruate and
he's now capable of impregnating her.

329
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Her parents are reluctant to have her
reproduce with an input impecunious

330
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:43,370
Basilio who for all his
skills as not profitable ones,

331
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,860
but that stands also as to simply
the prohibition. Thou shall not,

332
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,520
as we saw when discussing the,
uh, issue, uh, uh, regarding, uh,

333
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,880
Doterra,
a clandestine marriages,

334
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,910
which is lurking here in the background
because we must assume that they had

335
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:09,191
been one between a Basilio and criteria
that's in marriages could lead to

336
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,210
polygamy.
I mean,

337
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,790
I could say to any girl
that I was involved with,

338
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,610
uh, Jess, yes, I will marry
you. And B, then if the, if,

339
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,270
if it took, I said where you could
be married to several, uh, such, uh,

340
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,343
several women

341
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,000
and also how can avow hastily made

342
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,640
in the heat of passion a yoke partners
for life in what donkey hotel calls.

343
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,040
Again,
using scholastic terminology,

344
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,690
we MaxCDN t irreparably meaning something
that cannot be taken back in the

345
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:52,640
Catholic church who are going to
take it back. That is how can such a,

346
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,380
a cow can words uttered
in this circumstances, uh,

347
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,450
make a marriage,

348
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,610
how can freewill be so easily surrendered?

349
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,370
The council of Trent proclaim
that the Church of horror,

350
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:14,270
clandestine marriages, an order
declared gene not to celebrate weddings.

351
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:18,050
We thought published bands
and the presence of witnesses.

352
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,710
This was incorporated by Phillip the
second into Spanish statutory law in 1564

353
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,050
and remained thus the foundation of
marriage in Spain until the 19th century.

354
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,870
The conflict is dealt with
very subtly in this story.

355
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,770
Basilio is proficient in Canon and
civil law and he puts it to good use.

356
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:47,400
In trick to Merrick Italia.
How does he do that? Well,

357
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:50,130
he threatens to die without confession.

358
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,750
You have to have to underline this
because, uh, even if you are a Catholic,

359
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,780
this is very difficult to conceive
from are a modern perspective.

360
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,170
So you want to die without confession.
So what,

361
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,210
go ahead be my guest,

362
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,600
but bought by threatening to do that.
Uh,

363
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,760
he is accusing them of,
uh,

364
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,830
sending him irrevocably to hell
because suicide is a mortal sin.

365
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,800
And uh, and uh, uh, if he
dies without confession, uh,

366
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,080
in the conventional side, he's
going to hell no matter what. Uh,

367
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,950
this is how he convinced everyone.
He is very,

368
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:38,970
he knows canon law and he knows civil law.
Uh,

369
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,930
so you die without confession.

370
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,820
If she will not give in,
Eh,

371
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,950
would condemn him to eternal
damnation. Keith, Daddy,

372
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm the others would have done
more harm to him this way.

373
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,590
Then murdering him,

374
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,920
murdering him will be nothing
compared to eternal damnation.

375
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,760
Then he has both terrier.

376
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,380
I'm himself alter the
words about free consent.

377
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,210
That would legitimize the marriage
before church and society.

378
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm sure you remember the episode in
which he insists and the proper words,

379
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,060
the legal words. I used a affirming, uh,

380
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,920
uh,
consent.

381
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,210
She confirms later her determination
afterwards to dispel any doubt about her

382
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:35,881
desires and make void any future claims
to dissolve the marriage that is cheap.

383
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,690
She confirms it afterwards. So it was
so just in the spur of the moment,

384
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,230
she confirms that she wants
to marry a busted you or are,

385
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:48,820
these are very carefully
constructed episodes, uh, uh,

386
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,650
to show, uh, basilio's a lawyerly skills.

387
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,490
But as I am suggesting in this story,

388
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:01,060
Sarah vantage probe deeper
into the issue of marriage, uh,

389
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,560
deeper than issues of the legal issues.
He goes back to the,

390
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,670
to marriage as a kind of
transubstantiation the tress
and dental metamorphoses

391
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,780
of matter, the transformation of
matter, the blending of bloods,

392
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:20,980
literally that makes the
union indivisible presumably.

393
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,270
Okay.

394
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,450
In looking at the episode
with this background in mind,

395
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:29,780
it appears that Cervantes
is favoring the clandestine,

396
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,200
I do that area most of articulated

397
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,080
while at the same time,
uh,

398
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,810
having her on Basilea
observe the rituals of,

399
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:46,390
by the Council of Trent. It,
it seems to be a middle course.

400
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,583
Uh,

401
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,830
the sacramental nature of marriage lurks
in the subtext of the story through the

402
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,850
myth of Pyramus and Thisbe.

403
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,750
It is a tragic story,

404
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:03,751
the myths of Pyramus and Thisbe in which
a cruel fate befalls the young lovers

405
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:05,680
because of a misinterpretation,

406
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,560
although it could be read as an ad
monetary tale about the recklessness of

407
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,340
youth.

408
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,340
The myth goes back to the conjunction of
love and death at the moment when love

409
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:20,590
ripens and is about to
become regenerative,

410
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,810
driven by desire.

411
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:26,950
The young lovers are to meet at the
tomb of knit Nina's where they die,

412
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,010
not killed by the lioness,
but by their own hands.

413
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,520
The bloody veil can be seen as an image
of the hymen rent in the act of love,

414
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,240
that bloody event,
uh,

415
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,400
the renting of the hymen that also
recalls the onset of menstruation.

416
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,580
That is the beginning of the
capacity for reproduction,

417
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:49,350
but also the recurrent
death of a woman's ovum.

418
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,450
The red of the trees. Fruit is both a
symbol of resurrection and of death,

419
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,280
as it recalls menstruation in,
uh, in their recurring coloring.

420
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,710
The Myth we reenacts the tragic human
predicament symbolized by the spilling of

421
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:10,030
blood at conception,
birth and death,

422
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,430
leaving open the possibility that the
law here, the parents' disapproval,

423
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,720
gun over comm or forestall
the fatality of the situation.

424
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,490
But the prohibition is also aligned
to death because it is instrumental in

425
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:28,210
bringing about the tragic ending in orbit.

426
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,090
The conflict appears to
resolve itself in beauty,

427
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,090
the gorgeous red fruit of the tree.
Instead of Antis. It goes further

428
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,420
by way of contrast and
comparison. We will, we will, uh,

429
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,300
later see how Velasquez deals,

430
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,810
whose class was class with
classical myth in Cervantes.

431
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:55,140
The Myth of pyramids on Tsp is
given in shards fragments with,

432
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:58,090
uh,
a faint outline like a distant memory.

433
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,770
It looks forward stores
Joyce, the Julissa's, uh,

434
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:06,700
where these fragments appear more than
backwards through the Middle Ages and the

435
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,830
renaissance where the
midst were more coherent.

436
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,410
I am inclined to believe however that's
Advantis had overt it's text in front of

437
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:18,790
him or that he had a prodigious memory.
For instance,

438
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:23,470
when Basilio feigns being near death,
his eyes are part of the act.

439
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,990
If you remember,
his eyes already turned in his head.

440
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,210
He's playing, he's about to die.
So he has his eyes turn his head,

441
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,040
which recalls the moment when this
B asks pyramids to answer, where,

442
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:40,940
uh,

443
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm not going to read you
the Latin because then I'm
going to really sound like

444
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,970
a priest saying mass. And, uh,

445
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,990
but he heard the translation.
She heard the name of this B,

446
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,991
and he lifted his eyes with the weight
of debt heavy upon them and saw her face

447
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:59,780
and closed his eyes. So
the eyes, uh, the element,

448
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:02,500
this is one of the shards that I say,
uh,

449
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,370
remain of the middle of my
argument. My argument, uh,

450
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,840
follows what I would like to call or
what I like to call an itinerary of blood

451
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,880
from the pregnant calf on the spit that
sanctuary sees when they arrive at the

452
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:21,590
wedding, which for tells of the
sacrificial victim, the groom,

453
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,180
which he replaces.
It also recalls the violence at weddings,

454
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,840
Romeo and Juliet being the most
famous example in western literature.

455
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,100
The violence,

456
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,100
the blood announced just station and the
spilling of more blood as the new human

457
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:40,700
being. Uh, the most elemental
purpose of marriage is produced.

458
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,090
The consumption of the animals,
the wine and the bread.

459
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,180
Obvious Christian symbolism to,

460
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,410
to consumer to consummate go
together in a wedding celebration.

461
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:55,460
As I said earlier,
they consume the world around them,

462
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,370
including the earth,
through the wine.

463
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,780
It is a form again of transubstantiation.
Transubstantiation is the,

464
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,450
is the word for the Eucharist when the,

465
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,720
when the body of Christ is transform into
blood and wine it into bread and wine

466
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:17,420
that is of transforming one substance
into another through actions that involve

467
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:21,050
both pleasure and violence.
Hunting. Butch butchering,

468
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:25,220
squashing the grapes and of
course sex basilio's intervention.

469
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:27,080
Postpones the blood could,

470
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,210
would have shared in Camacho's
bed substituted that for
the fake blood that he

471
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:36,200
has concealed these blood stains,
his garment,

472
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:41,510
the proxy blot suspends the real
blood would seal the marriage.

473
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,590
But I contend that there is another hidden
blot that forestalls the consummation

474
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:50,690
of the intended marriage
between Camacho and criteria.

475
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,890
And you don't have to follow me on
this or, or, or, or, or, or, uh,

476
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,380
be persuaded if you don't
want to put it bluntly.

477
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,760
I think that the is menstruating on her
wedding day in the Spanish original it

478
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:10,210
says [inaudible],

479
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,470
I'll go this Colo Rita [inaudible]
pass and us know we asked in component,

480
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,520
but Aaliyah of any data,
this was borders. Jarvis,

481
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,550
the ferric Italia looked a little pale
location perhaps by want of rest the

482
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:25,490
preceding night,

483
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,490
which bright always employed in setting
themselves off and dressing for their

484
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,160
wedding day.
Following this call,

485
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:37,320
Florida in the Spanish not does
not just mean Pale, a little pale,

486
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:42,321
but to have lost once color because of
an illness or a fright and components.

487
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,020
It means to dress up of course,

488
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:50,790
but also to recover from an illness.
Why mentioned that she's Pale?

489
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,760
I believe that the suggestion
is that she's menstruating,

490
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,490
menstruating menstruation is fraught with
all kinds of prohibitions and lower in

491
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,390
all cultures in hours going back all
the way through the Old Testament.

492
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:10,020
No menstruation in this case would have
been a providential blood that would

493
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:14,910
have impeded the consummation of Camacho's
marriage. Postponing the terrios hi,

494
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:19,860
menial or high menial blood and
preserving it. Pro Basillio's bed.

495
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,230
Keep telling us man, situation. Her
regular, which is another word of saying,

496
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,600
ah, menstruation in Spanish
and it means rule simply rule.

497
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,903
Okay.

498
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:38,610
Would it be a superior law inherent in
the blood itself and determining the

499
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:44,200
outcome of the conflict?
Marriage is seen as ordained by God,

500
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:48,700
part of the divine plan that
supersedes customer law and overrides

501
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:51,940
considerations of unequal social status.

502
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,890
The process of marriage is
embedded in blood itself.

503
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,080
In the general transformation of matter.

504
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,020
According to divine grace in the Bible,

505
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:06,960
man and woman will become one
flesh in marriage. You know,

506
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,660
it's a pagan version.
There is no salvation possible.

507
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:15,661
The lover's fusion is only achieved as
ashes in a funerary earn or in the beauty

508
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:19,970
of a mulberry tree in
bloom instead of one.

509
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,020
This a form of justice have been made
and there is every reason to believe that

510
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:28,510
the commingling of broads
will lead to regeneration.

511
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,720
Do the birth of a new human being.

512
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,090
This is the kind of conclusion
that we did not find in part one,

513
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,930
uh,
where marriages are yet to occur.

514
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:46,170
Accepting the tale about foolish curiosity
where there is also a great deal of

515
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:51,130
blood. If you remember,
I think that, uh, uh, uh,

516
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:53,980
in a deep sense said, Ron,
this is true to, of it.

517
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,040
And to the spirit of metamorphosis,

518
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,210
Metta movement more the change of form,

519
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,280
what has given you the Christian twist
and translated into the present and

520
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:09,640
Cervantes.

521
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:14,850
The Myth is not retold with the
didactic Sateri call or even a,

522
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:20,170
or even aesthetic purpose. In fact,
it is not so much retold as we cycled.

523
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,630
It is not an Ovi Morley z.

524
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,390
Well read more highly say
we're Joyce from 1340.

525
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,780
There's a, there's a book
by in French, by Pierre,

526
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,470
which influenced the many, uh, writers,

527
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:49,471
including Chaucer and into which 15
bookstore or chapters of the metamorphosis

528
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,350
are turning into allegories.
As I mentioned before,

529
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,330
Maura allegories here,
this is not, uh, uh,

530
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,670
what sort of anthis does at all,

531
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,600
either on the level of,
uh,

532
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:09,601
of marriage as a social institution and
so forth or at that deeper level that

533
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:15,070
I'm claiming, uh, uh, is
total in this, in this,

534
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:20,071
in this a sob story or subtext that
I called the itinerary of blog.

535
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,350
Now, in this use of myth, Cervantes, uh,

536
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,210
resembles Velasquez.
Um,

537
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,400
so let us turn to Velasquez again.
And uh,

538
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,400
now we have to, uh, uh,
doubts the lights or uh,

539
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,430
but put the curtains down on,
uh,

540
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,280
Elaina is going to be good enough to be
showing us some paintings by Velazquez

541
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,140
that I used to want to
discuss in this context.

542
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,740
So if you wait a minute for the theatrical
part of the presentation today to be

543
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:03,330
prepared, I said, wow. All
the way down, all the way now.

544
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,220
Well where they are, he cannot go all the
way down, but okay, that's good enough.

545
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,533
And then

546
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,550
we turn off the lights and I got to let
my eyes adjust so that I can read my

547
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,254
nuts.

548
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,480
Let's go to the [inaudible].

549
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,123
Okay.

550
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,210
The Spanish philosopher, Jose Ortega,
Iga sit who might have mentioned before,

551
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,350
but I think that, uh, I want you
to remember him as part of it.

552
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,170
Can you see from this side?
No.

553
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,883
Okay.

554
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,340
Mentioned him before.

555
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,150
He's the most important Spanish
philosopher of the 20th century,

556
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,620
known in this country,
mostly for his book,

557
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,780
the Revolution of the
masses, but also, uh,

558
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,890
he also should be read for many books,
but one is the, the dehumanization of art,

559
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,340
which is about the avant garde art. In
any case, the Spanish philosopher Ortega,

560
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,350
uh,

561
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:36,350
claim that what Velasquez
meant by mixing classical gods.

562
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,590
We don't savory or ordinary characters
from everyday reality is that there are

563
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,060
no gods.
I'm not dressing dental.

564
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:52,061
Meaning if we take the gods to be the
representation of the higher sense of

565
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:55,580
things when seen in
connection to each other,

566
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,740
Velasquez, he says, is,

567
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,670
I caught now or Tayga,
an atheistic giant

568
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:11,110
at colossal in pills.
Man with his brush,

569
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,010
he banishes the gods as if
smacking them with a broom.

570
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:20,100
I love the signally because you can
think of the brush as a little broom as a

571
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,450
smacking them with a broom in his
back or now, which is this painting

572
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,710
known in Spanish as Los Barrachos.

573
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,380
The drunks in his back.

574
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:35,470
I know that is not only no backers,

575
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,000
but a rascal impersonating backers.

576
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,183
Yeah.

577
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,070
Baca now has nine figures,

578
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:49,980
two of which seem to be dressed or rather
Andress for a backing out and backing

579
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,350
out back on us or feasts
in honor of backers.

580
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,760
The God of wine celebrated
in the spring. And, and for,

581
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,420
uh,
these two guys who are near naked.

582
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,510
The others are lusty peasants,

583
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,960
roughly closed in contemporary dress.

584
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,520
And with the same sort of casual,

585
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,540
not post air that characterized
the naturalistic genre
scenes call in Spain bore

586
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:18,750
the bonus,

587
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,380
which is simply still lives in
English and Spanish are called bull.

588
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:25,260
They go on this,

589
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,040
these paintings sought and achieve the
effect of a casually chosen slice of

590
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:40,244
life.

591
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,110
But Baca Nile is carefully composed
around the light flesh of the Bogles.

592
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,520
Backhoes at the center,

593
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,500
Jonathan Brown says,
is one of the great experts on Velasquez.

594
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,690
He wrote a book with Elliot.
Oh, on Spanish architecture,

595
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,423
uh,

596
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,500
that attempts to interpret the painting
quote as a parody of the Olympian gods

597
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,270
or what's a sermon on the
evils of drink have failed.

598
00:44:13,271 --> 00:44:18,271
And instead Velasquez intended
to represent backhoes as
a giver of the gift of

599
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:19,354
Wine,

600
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,420
which freed man temporarily from the
harsh unforgiving struggle of daily life.

601
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,500
Deprived of the benefits in liquid,
the bigger fines,

602
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,740
no respite from the which in sober
moments will be shared by all the company.

603
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:42,330
This marvelous painting hangs
or the Prado Museum and a,

604
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:48,481
if you remember the worst by
Auerbach about the supple plastic,

605
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,360
uh, nature of set Avantis is
art of the he's depiction of,

606
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,850
of of things.
I don't have an of sensuous.

607
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,570
And you can see that there is,

608
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,400
besides the connection I'm trying
to establish here, uh, uh, uh,

609
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:07,920
a kingship between Sylvana. This is
art and that of a, of [inaudible].

610
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,160
And you can imagine these characters
as appearing in episodes of the guilty.

611
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:18,210
I'm sure. Look at this, uh, the,

612
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:23,110
the face of stupor on this
drunk, he has sort of, uh,

613
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:27,250
uh, green, uh,

614
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,810
of stupidity and uh, and drunkenness
and the others, you know.

615
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,690
Okay.
This spinners last Elan Dennis

616
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:50,410
was painted around 1657.
It is, does a very, uh,

617
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,840
late work,

618
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,560
contemporaneous with Las Meninas and
nearly as complex and as ambitious in it

619
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:02,310
will ask us as combined two subjects,

620
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,770
one from the classical mythology,
um,

621
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,440
and the other from his own time.

622
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,010
It is a commonplace work
seen as you can see.

623
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,313
Yeah.

624
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,140
There are in fact two stories
from classical mythology
combined in the picture,

625
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,300
the fable of our acne and the
story of Jupiter's rape of Europa.

626
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,490
In the foreground we have
the activities of tape,

627
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,730
tapestry manufacturing as was done in
the factories on the royal patronage in

628
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:39,610
Madrid and in the alcove in the back.

629
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,400
The classical tale of the weaver Arachni.

630
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:46,970
Okay.

631
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,970
The scene takes place at a rock in a
shop where as a great artist just visited

632
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,020
by elegant ladies,

633
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,800
the tapestry hanging on the
back wall of the alcove,

634
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:03,340
which is presumably an agonist work is
the key to the relationship between the

635
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:07,460
two, uh, scenes. It is a woven,

636
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,230
a copy of Titian's the rape of Europa.

637
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,610
Could you give me that painting?

638
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,113
Yes.

639
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,590
This is the actual painting by
Titian, uh, the rape of Europa,

640
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,760
which back to England Datas,
which we find in the back.

641
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,183
Oops.

642
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,900
In that tapestry,

643
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,080
the rape of Europa is one of the most
celebrated of Jupiter's erotic adventures

644
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:42,870
with, with mortal women. I,
Rodney has challenged me nerve,

645
00:47:42,871 --> 00:47:47,540
a patroness of weavers and goddess
of wisdom do a winning contest.

646
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,810
It was called a drawl,

647
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,380
but because her Agnes tapestry was
judged to be the equal of Minerva's and

648
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:58,760
further because it depicted such
as candles act by her father,

649
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,780
the God has punished Arachni
by turning her into a spider.

650
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,770
The story is also drawing from Ovid's
metamorphoses book four, book six.

651
00:48:09,771 --> 00:48:14,510
I'm sorry. This is the reason we never
really shown just during angrily.

652
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:19,343
Okay.

653
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,020
Jonathan Brown again,

654
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:25,220
believes that quote by inserting
a quotation from this famous work,

655
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:30,250
the rape of Europa into the composition
Velasquez implies his belief in the

656
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:35,840
nobility and trust in dental value of
the art of painting in the spinners will

657
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:40,841
ask us six to reconcile the artificial
world of myth with a palpable world world

658
00:48:42,681 --> 00:48:47,681
of visual reality without sacrificing
the decorum required for bye bye you the

659
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:53,180
one and the various militude by the
other that the courtroom by the classical

660
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:56,870
myth and the various humility,
the realism by the other,

661
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,460
the contrast he goes on
between the foreground,

662
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,530
whereas 30 women toil,

663
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:09,100
burdensome tasks and the refined
atmosphere of the artists out the year.

664
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:14,321
The scene in the back is
perhaps we Alaska's way of
implying is conviction about

665
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:19,250
the distinction between craft
and art. Well, this is fine. Uh,

666
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:23,670
that's the end of the quote by John
Brown, uh, on, at the time, uh,

667
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,430
there was a raging dispute as to
whether painters were artists or mere

668
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:32,420
acquiescence. This may seem a
strange to us, but there was,

669
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,190
yeah,

670
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,490
I don't, of course, Titian had
been a favorite painter of jobs.

671
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:40,340
The fifth reveal sanctuary
and Phillip the second.

672
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,640
So the painting is an homage to him and
there is no doubt though by inserting

673
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,810
Titian's painting into his Velasquez,
he's putting himself at the same level.

674
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,640
Well, there is a lot more to it.
It seems to me as enough Meninas.

675
00:49:55,641 --> 00:50:00,230
There seems to be a revelation of the
art of the act over testic creation,

676
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,390
which in the painting has to
do with Minerva and Arachni.

677
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,840
But that taking the whole work, uh, in,

678
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,290
in into consideration has to do
with Velasquez. His own creation.

679
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,090
Creation appears as a layered
process that involves the real,

680
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:22,570
this is the real either because art is
a reflection of reality or because art

681
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,610
illuminates reality,

682
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,640
but also because reality on
veils the artificiality of art

683
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:33,981
in the spinners,

684
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:38,390
we have paintings within paintings
and the presence of in the foreground,

685
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,320
uh, on depressant. This is
the present in the foreground,

686
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,070
uh,
uh,

687
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,640
appears as a repetition of the
classical past. But he said,

688
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,090
but it is a repetition
that is also a calm down.

689
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,020
Can the present day spinners
recall the myth of Arachni?

690
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,200
It seems to me that what Velasquez
is doing as sort of take,

691
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,740
I said suggested about the backer.

692
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,760
Now is it this diminishing
the gods and also showing,

693
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,040
uh, by showing me Nineveh's
studio within the weaving shop,

694
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,960
he showing the inner
recesses of representation.

695
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,250
It's back day stage tricks.
Uh,

696
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,410
I said where I see did I
see showed in Las Meninas

697
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,930
the whole painting is a disingenuous in
other words is what I'm trying to say.

698
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,440
What we take to be gods are like today's
the spinners that weavers shop is no

699
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:40,691
different from Minerva studio in both
the deception of art are created to

700
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:42,590
deceive man.

701
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,890
We see the contemporary
weavers in relation to the
classical fable and we see at

702
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,260
the center of Alaska suspending
painting a quotation from a masterpiece.

703
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,990
It is again an infinitely
receding Seaquist.

704
00:51:54,991 --> 00:51:59,720
It played of mirrors within this workshop
of representation that we are being

705
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:04,140
given here, which is like giving
us a worst, a workshop of Engonnia.

706
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,300
Therefore,
by giving us the workshop is giving us,

707
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,970
it is a desk in Gunyah.
Now

708
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,060
the process is similar

709
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:21,800
to what's the advantage
does in commercials wording
episode and how the whole of

710
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:26,380
the Keyhole, uh, an an an an an
of the whole of the chaotic, uh,

711
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,410
dealing with myth.

712
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:31,790
They favor of pyramids and things
we takes place in fabulous Babylon.

713
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,110
Got Mattress wedding takes place in
an insignificant village in Spain.

714
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,450
What about senior dogs is to use the
artist artistry of the fable to receive

715
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,750
those in attendance,
particularly Camacho on his friends,

716
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,930
but also the Quixote Saint John,

717
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,750
even the reader who does not know what
is happening until the moment that the

718
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:55,160
trick is revealed to bring the story
to a climax and eventual resolution.

719
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:56,750
There is a mirroring,

720
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,340
mirroring of myth and pressing reality
and the elaboration of a deceit through

721
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:05,000
artistry, acting, playing
the role of the mythological,

722
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:10,250
playing the role of a mythological
pyramids on the, uh, Basillio pain,

723
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,110
that role acting it out.

724
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,190
It is both an in Ganja on Edison
Gagnon making up the whole story.

725
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,640
The backstage of representation
is displayed as in Las
Meninas and as we shall

726
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:25,280
soon see in the episode
involving master bedroom,

727
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:30,710
he ness the buzz Avanti as puppeteer
and most revealingly in the culminating

728
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:34,970
episode in the whole
of the, the, the, the,

729
00:53:34,971 --> 00:53:38,280
the one about Montesinos
cave in which we are,

730
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:43,610
which we are given the whole underpinning
of donkey halters madness is actual

731
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,710
subconscious now,

732
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:51,690
whereas in part once Cervantes seems to
be addressing the romances of chivalry

733
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,660
and the picaresque as models and sources.
In part two,

734
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:59,661
he takes up the grand tradition of
homer offered virtual and Dante,

735
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,860
particularly in episodes.

736
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,040
So just the Cave of Montesinos
and the pageant in the forest.

737
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,220
The more we'll be seeing soon,
this is very significant.

738
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:13,610
It seems to me that he now knows that
he is in their league and that he has

739
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:20,331
created a literary character that
will endure like theirs and like the

740
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:23,820
characters in classical mythology.
