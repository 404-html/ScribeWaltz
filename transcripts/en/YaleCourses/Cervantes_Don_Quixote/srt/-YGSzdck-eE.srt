1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:01,520
Yeah,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,520
I want to return briefly to this and
Ganja because there may be some confusion

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
caused by disillusionment.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,410
The English word used to translate
the term which is an approximation.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,370
Uh, as, uh, all translations are,

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,540
uh, busy illusion meant, uh,

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,580
can mean in English disenchantment and
disappointment words that have a very

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,260
negative connotation,

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,910
whereas this in Ganja does not
quite have that connotation.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,740
Uh,
at worse it could mean resignation.

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Meaning I was resigned to find out that
such and such a person was not as good

12
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:52,440
as I thought him or her to be.
Uh,

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,570
remember the quote from Otis Green that I,
uh,

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,630
read you in which the same
ganja was a thought of us are,

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,980
uh,

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,980
the sumo boom boom or the ultimate
good desired by the storage wise man,

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,820
baroque disingenuous.
It's,

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,920
it's a positive condition at which the
individual arrives after having shared

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,830
the scales from his eyes, remember, uh,

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,030
and learned of the deceitfulness
of appearances of the
mystifying allure of all

21
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,510
that he has taken as being very valuable.

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,520
Everything that shines is not gold,
is what the individual learns.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Having gone through the process of in
Ganja that is deceit and this and Ganja to

24
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:50,450
put it in, in the simplest of terms. Uh,

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,510
what I suggested more over is that the
plot of the Quixote and that of some of

26
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:59,870
these stories embedded in it.
In this part too.

27
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,330
Uh Hm.

28
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,410
Go through a similar unfolding
from and Ganja to this in Ganja.

29
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,823
Uh,

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,410
we will be following this development
in the episodes that we will be dealing

31
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,790
with during the rest of the semester,

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,800
some of which other culminating
episodes in the entire book,

33
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,170
not only, uh, the second part,
what the tire get haughty.

34
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,490
Uh, so, but that was first
turn our attention today,

35
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,890
uh, to uh, uh,

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,160
to critics whose essays you are
reading this week in the case book.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,340
And this is, this is
sort of the, uh, the, uh,

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,620
the highlight or the high point
I should say, of the casebook,

39
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,380
these two essays by our back and Spitzer.

40
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,310
Now we already saw, uh,
our box main thesis,

41
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,570
we Macy's his famous book. And, uh,

42
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:09,571
that that thesis is about the
Christian mixture of the sublime,

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,040
uh, and uh, the low style
in the New Testament. Uh,

44
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,610
and how this led to the emergence and
development of realism and eventually to

45
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,940
the novel and to a book like the Quixote.

46
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,350
This mixture of the sublime and the law
style was a break away from the strict

47
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:37,300
separation between high and low style.
In the classical tradition,

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,410
which our back, uh, derives, uh,

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,940
this idea from Saint Augustine
and the church fathers,

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,340
the patristic tradition,

51
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,880
our back labels settling more immediately.

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,390
I put it on the board or humble
sermo better humble discourse.

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,420
This Christian response to the classical
division of styles derived that

54
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:11,941
division of styles derived from Aristotle
and from Roman rhetorical theory.

55
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,720
This mixture of the transcendent and the
low style was exemplified by Christ's

56
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:24,721
passion through which the drama of Man's
everyday life assumes the most profound

57
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,580
meaning. Life does not end in the
brief span of worldly existence.

58
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,350
Eternity is present in the
passion as a message of hope.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Our backs, uh, application of
these theory, uh, in the, uh,

60
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,710
to the Quixote leads him to the belief
that the Quixote is essentially a funny

61
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,330
book as you have read in the essay,

62
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,910
uh, the enchanted Boosie
Nair and interpretation,

63
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,870
uh,

64
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,340
for which our back was
excoriated by his Hispanics,

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,520
particularly Spanish
ones for whom Nikki Haut.

66
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:12,460
There was a very profound
at untrusting dental book,

67
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,450
although many we're motivated by a
nationalistic interpretation of Cervantes

68
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,600
whom they saw as the highest
example of Spanish genius.

69
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,340
And he's protagonist as the various
representative of the fatherland.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,580
They will not entirely
wrong in their reactions.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,270
What happened in Spain was that,
uh,

72
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,830
the key hot there was canonized,
meaning turning to a classic in the,

73
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,360
in the 18th century. Uh, and
then by the early 19th century,

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,940
during the romantic period,
uh, it was assaulted us, the,

75
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,980
the highest point of Spanish genius
and the highest representative of the

76
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:58,400
Spanish language in which the
spirit of Spanish. And this was,

77
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:02,920
uh, I was, uh, embedded and so
forth. And, uh, it became, uh,

78
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,700
this was a very nationalistic reading
of the Quixote that prevailed and still

79
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,860
prevails in some quarters. And, uh,

80
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,690
so the people who held this view of the
hotel of course were outraged by our box

81
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,870
reading of the Quixote as
essentially a funny book.

82
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,620
Uh, they were not entirely
wrong in their reactions. Um,

83
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,240
he should be very clear to those of
you reading the Quixote that there is a

84
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,540
great deal that is very
deep and serious in it,

85
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,110
both about life in general
and about literature,

86
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,930
our backs analysis.
However,

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,580
it's very revealing of how the law style,
particularly in St John,

88
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:51,581
all the low class characters plays such
a crucial role in the farcical episodes

89
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,340
in the chaotic, besides we are not, uh,

90
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,180
familiar in the modern period anymore
with this separation of styles are high

91
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:04,980
and low style or anything like that. And
it very instructive to read our bag, uh,

92
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,530
who was steeped in that, uh,
uh, even when he goes astray,

93
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,610
in my view,

94
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,620
I was criticized by some Hispanics for
having included that essay in the case

95
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,650
book,
by the way.

96
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,850
Mostly because they had not been included.

97
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,100
Our backs problem is that he cannot
get out of his home, his scheme,

98
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,380
which equals equates theory
looseness with uh, only with tragedy.

99
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,970
Don Quixote can be serious
without being tragic. And in fact,

100
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,320
this is one of its most important
lessons and most innovative qualities.

101
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,670
One of the most innovative qualities of
the new literature that emerges in the

102
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:52,590
wake of the Kiata to
say that's an advantage.

103
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,230
It's not deal with the serious
issues of his time is pure nonsense.

104
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,580
Uh, as we have seen, uh,

105
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,610
do claim that the book is above all a
farce is also nonsense besides a novel's

106
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:13,331
worth should not be gauged by how
faithfully represents reality.

107
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,730
If such a thing can be gauged at all.

108
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,500
Our back is wrong when he says
that Don Quixote's it they fix,

109
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,200
has no contact with reality and
that it only causes confusion.

110
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,970
On the contrary,

111
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,850
he see fix served by contrast to
clarify many things around him.

112
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,180
But there are salvageable
parts of our bags, essays,

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,170
essay, which is why I included
it in, in, in the casebook.

114
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,820
Um, novel cough. On the other hand,

115
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,930
the great Russian novelist has
a horrible book on the Quixote,

116
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,090
which was a series of lectures that he
gave, uh, at Harvard and the, there,

117
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,630
the book is interesting only
because Nabokov wrote it,

118
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,670
but he says really outrageous things.

119
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,150
Like there is no reflection of this.

120
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:09,000
Pain of the ranches is
time in the Quixote.

121
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,130
Nabo cough was a great writer,
but not a great critic. Oviously

122
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I think that the first salvageable
salvageable thing in our backs essay,

123
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,000
his,
uh,

124
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,330
his reaction against romantic criticism
and the tendency to over interpret

125
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,070
whatever that means. Ultimately, uh,

126
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,400
our back writes the finding his own
position, the following you have in, in,

127
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,650
in the case book page 58,
four centuries. He says,

128
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,240
especially since the romanticist
many things have been read into him.

129
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,830
He didn't Quixote which he interested
want this, which he hardly for boated,

130
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,510
let alone intended such transforming
undescended interpretation.

131
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,670
Interpretations are often fertile.

132
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,010
A book like Don Quixote dissociate itself
from its author's intention and lead a

133
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:06,990
life of its own. Don Quixote shows a
new face to every age which enjoys him.

134
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,280
Jet,
the historian whose task meaning himself,

135
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,140
whose task it is to define the place of
a given work in a historical continuity,

136
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,470
most endeavor insofar as that is possible
in so far as that is still possible to

137
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:27,090
attain a clear understanding of what
the book meant to its author and his

138
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:30,070
contemporaries and court.
Uh,

139
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,460
this is the dream of the philology.

140
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:37,380
And so the critics steeped in philology
that they can actually get back to the

141
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:42,310
meaning of the, of the, of the work in Eh,
in the period in which was writing and,

142
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,240
and, and to discern what
the author's intentions,

143
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,110
where we are not so sure anymore.

144
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,570
Peter Russell's book, Peter
Russell was an English, uh,

145
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,950
Hispanics of some note.

146
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,190
His book is called Don Quixote as a funny
book follows our back and it's among

147
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:07,191
those who styled themselves as the
hard school of Savantas criticism based

148
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:13,590
mostly in England and,
uh,

149
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,620
who's hardness is mostly of the
intellectual arteries in my view,

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,560
just because the advantage is contemporary
is found the book funny or just

151
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,110
because of what's Advantis
said about the comic.

152
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,500
It is impoverishing to see
the Quixote in this light,

153
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,100
particularly when the
comic is not defined.

154
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,640
If the comic arises as it does in the
quota from the toils of our mind out of

155
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,510
sorts with the modern world,

156
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,370
then it is a comic of the
highest form of seriousness.

157
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,090
Comedy can be very serious and profound
and it is in the Houthi contemporaries.

158
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,920
Often Ms. Reed works written,
uh, in their time, obviously,

159
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,430
and author's intentions are very,

160
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,070
very difficult to ascertain.

161
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,410
And I'll say a little bit more
about that later. Spitzer,

162
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,470
Leo Spitzer was another great critic
of the German philological school.

163
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,160
He to escape from Nazi Germany and
proceeded our back in the chair at the

164
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,390
University of eastern bull.
Uh,

165
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,180
Spitzer wound up at Johns Hopkins
University, not on Yale, alas,

166
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,050
like our back

167
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,540
Spitzer was known to be irascible and
belligerent in the defense of his points

168
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,810
of view and road vicious reviews of
the books with which he disagreed.

169
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,230
Uh, for example, Steven Gilman's
book on the Cell Astena,

170
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,800
uh, was shredded by Spitzer
in an angry, uh, review

171
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,500
pitcher was more thoroughly grounded in
philology and linguistics than our back.

172
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,540
He was a, a philologist
and a linguist and, uh,

173
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,330
uh, spoke, uh,

174
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,670
many modern languages and new practically
all the classical ones. He was a very,

175
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:24,160
very,
very learned man and very brilliant.

176
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,200
She picks her beliefs that one can get
at the core of a work of literature by

177
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:34,600
going from something
marginal on the periphery,

178
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,170
like a detail and pursuing and all the
way to its center that a detail Caniff

179
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:45,550
properly analyzed year. The
comprehensive interpretation of the work,

180
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,850
the geometric metaphors,

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,410
periphery circle center are a beaten,
a bit naive here.

182
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,160
We use metaphors in writing theory
and engraving criticism and his,

183
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,450
uh, are a bit naive when
we think about them. Uh,

184
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,830
we learned to look for
metaphors in criticism in,

185
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,180
through the work of the
great deconstruction is Paul
the man who was a professor

186
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:17,680
here at Yale. So the geometric
metaphors are a bit naive,

187
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,603
uh,

188
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,650
as is spitzers emphases on discovering
the personality of the author or his

189
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:28,450
worldview. He's Weltanschauung
to use the German word.

190
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,940
He wants to get into the
psychology of the author.

191
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,260
These are approximations
that Michelle Foodco,

192
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,260
I think I mentioned him.

193
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,180
He's a French philosopher.
[inaudible]

194
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,820
who's most famous book is
liberal elite shows in English.

195
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,730
The translator as the order of things.
And the first three chapters,

196
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:56,300
I don't Hispanic things, one on Velasquez
Las Meninas, one of the grantees.

197
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,220
And the very first the beginning is
on board. Here's the Argentine writer.

198
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,590
Um, these are approximations and Michel
Foucault would argue that one limits the

199
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,400
possible meanings of a work by reducing
it to the alleged intention of its

200
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:14,090
author. If you say these
were the author's intentions,

201
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,940
you create kind of a fence
around a, uh, work on, uh,

202
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,920
uh, there can be no meanings, uh, beyond
what you assume those intentions, uh,

203
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,720
to be.
Uh,

204
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,440
but I believe that what
Spitzer is trying to find is,

205
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,760
is the servant was what
I call this advantage.

206
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,480
We should him is a point of confluence
between form and content that makes for a

207
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:43,670
coherent overarching meaning.

208
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,760
Since language is after all,
the primary material of a literary work,

209
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,130
I believe has pictures.

210
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,140
Work is a good lesson to critics who
would leap too hasty interpretations

211
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,480
without a detailed knowledge of the text.

212
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,940
Now that language is the,

213
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,320
is the primary material with
literary work might seem obvious,

214
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,140
but it is a very,
uh,

215
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,510
complicated a statement to make because
one could say that paint is the,

216
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,360
is the, uh, primary material of painting.

217
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:21,530
And that doesn't get you very far in
the case of, of, of, of language. It,

218
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,280
I think that it,
that it does not a far a spritzer would,

219
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,220
uh,
would believe,

220
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,680
but I think that it does in the
case of the, of the Quixote,

221
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,810
she pitched her, accomplishes his task
by meticulous work on Pollino Mattia.

222
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:40,600
But if you have this
words in your essay swamp,

223
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,820
I'm not going to have to put
them on, on, on the board. Uh,

224
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,910
I know that there are jawbreakers Paulino,
Manisha,

225
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,190
multiple names and polio, etymology,
multiple origins of words,

226
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,570
meaning multiplicity of ne of names and
multiplicity of word origins that are

227
00:16:56,571 --> 00:17:01,571
present in this scenes that he analyzes
Spitzer equates the multiplicity

228
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,840
implicit in these

229
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,890
and the words to the
perspective as inherent in the
interplay of varied views in

230
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:15,500
the novel by various characters,
various characters,

231
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,370
and various different point of view.
And this is reflected in the, in the,

232
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,050
in the multiplicity of ideologies
and the multiplicity of names, uh,

233
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,690
uh,
given two characters and two things.

234
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,790
The differences of opinion among the
characters is evinced through the,

235
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,380
uh,
through the use of language.

236
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,650
The key term in the novel
is the Portmanteau Word
Sanctuary uses to mediate in

237
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:48,311
the dispute about the barbers basing
the Buffy yellow or the basing helmet in

238
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:50,574
English,

239
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
but which he attempts to
convey the conflicting points
of view about the object.

240
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,080
According to Webster, a
Portmanteau word and, uh,

241
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,360
James Joyce was famous for making them up,
uh,

242
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,080
is a word that he's a combination of
two other words, inform and meaning,

243
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,420
like the word Smug,

244
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,650
which is a combination of smoke and fog.

245
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,140
I bet you didn't know that.

246
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,090
Smoke and fog give you smog
and that is a Portmanteau word.

247
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,100
Uh, Joyce use uses it uses them. Uh,

248
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,830
um,
in funny ways,

249
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,080
a passenger in,
in Joyce is the

250
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,820
pass anchor, which in
France, French means not yet.

251
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,360
Of course a passenger is a bass core
because he hasn't gotten there yet.

252
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,650
And this is the kind of
thing that Joyce does. Um,

253
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,650
so that's a Portmanteau word and
embassy Gilmore basing helmet,

254
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:56,670
his apartment to work.

255
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,720
And you remember that Spitzer
mixed quite a bit of that,

256
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,400
uh,
much spacer but Spitzer ru's behind it,

257
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,870
mostly multiplicity that is [inaudible]
the creator of this whole artistic

258
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:13,704
machine.

259
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,280
He stands over all the games of
authorship and all of the ironies that is,

260
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,410
you can, you can, uh, you
can think of it, uh, uh,

261
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,930
Serantes and then all of the pulling
of Asia and all the bullying,

262
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:28,950
the margin of that,

263
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:33,951
but they are contained in
this figure of Cervantes.

264
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:35,770
The author who is the,

265
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,240
who is the author of all the ironies
and all of this against Cervantes.

266
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,910
Spitzer argues is no relativist
when it comes to morals.

267
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:48,180
We saw this already and
perspective is in an IRA,

268
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,690
an irony are inherent
in a Christian position,

269
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,660
which is humble by definition,
meaning I don't know enough,

270
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,610
I will never know enough to
behind Cervantes the creator.

271
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,590
There is God whom
Cervantes never denies so,

272
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,670
so they will be gone above Cervantes.

273
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Spitzer provides a convincing historical
scheme during the Middle Ages.

274
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,010
There is a correspondence
between word and things,

275
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,200
names and characters. And this is, uh,

276
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,540
so in the readings of scripture

277
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,180
in the renaissance,
there is a word world,

278
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,910
a world of words,

279
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,130
to use my own portmanteau
word at world of words,

280
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:46,131
when connecting or leading to the next
by my autonomy and a world book world

281
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:52,471
made up of books like Alonzo
[inaudible] was a result,

282
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,720
becomes don Quixote.

283
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,740
But inhabiting that book world was a
world of books in the Baroque that is a

284
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:05,671
phantasmagoria of words that are like
dreams and reveal the deceit of the world,

285
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
including that of language here
in this world of the same gun.

286
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:16,870
You know, it's where we find instead of
on this particularly the Bantus have 16,

287
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,020
15. So, uh,

288
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,190
I put these things on the board because
I liked you to have clear ideas.

289
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,110
So Middle Ages,
renaissance and Baroque correspondence,

290
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,600
word things, words, the words,

291
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,280
and then words who are
the seat full, uh, and uh,

292
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,360
uh,
uh,

293
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,770
purveyors of [inaudible] and then
leading to death and gardening.

294
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,273
Now

295
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,990
I am very interested because,
uh,

296
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,110
I think it is useful for us as readers
and US students of literature in the

297
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,840
Cervantes according to
our backend Spitzer.

298
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,970
Uh,

299
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,970
to me the most interesting part of our
box essay is ultimately when he tries to

300
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:17,050
define this Advantium
low set of Valentino,

301
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,950
which can be compared with spitzers
effort to come to a similar overall view.

302
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,370
Your theoreticians and critics can
say that there is no such thing as

303
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,060
[inaudible]. Uh, yet there is,

304
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,830
there is a, you know, w w if you
have read the Quixote and you know,

305
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:42,580
literary history, you know, what is,

306
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,150
what belongs to a sort of
disadvantage world, uh,

307
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,020
is a great writer,
creates a world of,

308
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,820
of his or her own is, is
a set of plots, ideas,

309
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,970
tropes,
uh,

310
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,030
that has some coherence and that can
be identified if you have read Proust.

311
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,190
Uh, you know what I mean? You
read one boosting sentence,

312
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,930
his long flowing sentences and you know,
immediately you're reading,

313
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,930
you read a symptoms by bore with
these refined irony and you know,

314
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,540
you're reading uh,

315
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,880
a border borders or you read years
later before the firing squad Colonel

316
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:28,150
Aureliano when Dee,

317
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:32,530
I was to remember that remote afternoon
when his grandfather took him to who sea

318
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:36,460
ice or I'm trying to, this is the
beginning of 100 years of solitude.

319
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,323
And you know,

320
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,740
now our buck in defining the
Sylvanian begins by giving up.

321
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,840
He says the peculiarly servanty and
cannot be described in words because by

322
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,940
giving up, but then he says, first of all,

323
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:57,941
it is something spontaneously sensory
if vigorous capacity for the vivid

324
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,540
visualization of very
different people in very,

325
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,541
very situations for the vivid realization
and expression of what thoughts into

326
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:11,390
their minds,
what emotional fill their hearts on,

327
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:13,430
what words come to their lips.

328
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,430
You have to remember that
these quotes from our bar, uh,

329
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,910
were originally written in German and
German prose is very complicated and it

330
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:26,000
shows in the translation
later he says,

331
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,940
and just a sensory is his capacity to run.

332
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:33,941
This is to think up or hit upon and a
new combinations of people and events.

333
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,710
He's, I think he's right when he says
something like that, he goes back, uh,

334
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,200
our back goes back to the idea of the
mat gentleman running into people.

335
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,990
Uh, and he says, what attracted
Cervantes was the possibility,

336
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,860
uh,

337
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,860
this formula offered for multifariousness
and effects of perspective.

338
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:02,300
The mixture of the fancy food and
everyday elements in the subject is

339
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,590
malleability elasticity,
adaptability quote.

340
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,280
He finally proclaims the following.

341
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,430
This Advantium is an attitude and
attitude towards the world and hence also

342
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:21,161
toward the subject matter of his art
in which bravery and equanimity play a

343
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:26,831
major part together with a delight he
takes in the multifariousness of his

344
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:31,040
sensory play.
There is in him a certain southern here,

345
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:35,420
meaning southern European, not
folk, Marion's south, you know,

346
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,000
uh,
there is an incidence,

347
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,990
southern reticence and pride.

348
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,370
This prevents him from taking the
play very seriously. He looks at it,

349
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,830
he shapes it.
He finds a diverting.

350
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,080
It is also intended to afford the
reader refined intellectual diversity.

351
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,330
On quote, he goes back over this. He says,

352
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,400
the theme of the mad country gentleman
who undertakes to revive night errand

353
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:05,401
tree gay Cervantes and opportunity to
present the world as play in that spirit

354
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,750
of multiple perspective,

355
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,960
non judging and even non
questioning neutrality,

356
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,360
which is a brave form of wisdom.
There's something I think also,

357
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,910
uh,
quite perceptive there.

358
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,350
That is the advantage is like
a puppet master like a master,

359
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,900
uh, in, in, in,

360
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:30,690
in the episode Europe about the re,
uh,

361
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,900
and he presents all of these many
different characters who, uh,

362
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,870
in action and sort of stands
back without passing judgment.

363
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,060
Now Spitzer on the other hand,
uh,

364
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,380
uh, concludes the following.
These beans are in our novel.

365
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:54,381
Things are represented not for
why they are in themselves,

366
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,530
but only us.
Things spoken about or thought about.

367
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,170
And this involves breaking the narrative
presentation into two points of view.

368
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,630
There can be no certainty about
the own broken reality of events.

369
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,900
The only unquestionable true on which
the reader may depend is the will of the

370
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:20,970
artists who chose to break
up a multivariant Vaillant
reality into different

371
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,470
perspectives.
In other words,

372
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,150
perspectivism suggests the existence
of an archimedean principle.

373
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,530
Something on which the whole thing rests,
uh,

374
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,490
outside the plot and archimedean
principle outside the plot.

375
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:38,980
He goes on and the are, Kennedy's must
be sort of Anthony himself unquote.

376
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,510
And one more quote and we may see instead
of Andis two fold treatment of the

377
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:47,730
problem of nicknames.

378
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,730
Balino Mattia another example of
this baroque attitude. What is true?

379
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,090
What is a dream this time toward language,

380
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,960
the language itself is not human language.
Also a Vanitas Tattoo.

381
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,530
Tattooing vanity of vanities.
What I was saying about the,

382
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,290
the Baroque languages,
a phantasmagoria,

383
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,360
this is the end of,
of uh,

384
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Spitzer syntheses is his conclusion
after this very thorough and brilliant

385
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:23,690
analysis of, uh, of the
novel. This is my view, uh,

386
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,340
I have been expressing in our rhetoric,
uh,

387
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,110
this is my beautiful view both
on our, uh, on our backend.

388
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,640
Spitzer in the
glorification of the author.

389
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,020
Spitzer does not take into
account Servantez errors.

390
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,750
He's famous oversights,

391
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,430
which we speak over floored creator,
not God.

392
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:46,380
Like in any sense,

393
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,770
hence pushing the whole issue of point
of view to the edge of the abbess of Matt

394
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,160
[inaudible].
I'm sorry,

395
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:57,850
of the abyss of madness
since the final authority is,

396
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,460
is, is flawed. Um, moreover,

397
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,230
Cervantes placed so much with the
author's lack of authority that one has

398
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:12,231
finally to take him at face value and
agree that not even he has authority.

399
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,150
Uh,

400
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,660
the final authority of the book that
we read and I think this he would have

401
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:23,190
agreed with,
uh,

402
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,210
and we have seen it in many in
our readings of many passages.

403
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,000
The same is true for our back.

404
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,450
My answer as you will see in my
essays is he ness cross idleness.

405
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,950
Remember that he needs is a figure of
the author and the figure of the modern

406
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,230
author. He has blown his book.
He wants to make money from it.

407
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,530
He's from the lower classes and he's
cross eyed and this reveals that there is

408
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:54,570
perspective is in from within an
assumed single self. That is that this,

409
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,460
this, this figure of the author here, uh,

410
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,570
cannot be in possession of the
truth because being cross eyed,

411
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,740
I don't know if I can
make him enough cross.

412
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:10,741
I'd hear his view of reality is flawed

413
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:18,330
and conflictive conflictive
because there are two eyes,

414
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,550
not a single point of view. And, and,

415
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,600
and this author figure being cross eyed
makes literally that he has that he's

416
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,560
two ice means two different visions.

417
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,590
We will talk about that when we
talk about the puppet play, uh,

418
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,650
that he needs the a Monte
puts on here in part two.

419
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,410
Um, so, uh,

420
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,680
the author is multiple within himself,
his eyes,

421
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,800
a work independently of
each other as it were.

422
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,330
He is congenitally incapable of
providing a single point of view.

423
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,860
Now we turn to the assigned episodes,
uh,

424
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,630
in the Quixote as we turn
to this episode's. Uh,

425
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:09,870
let me remind you that I will be looking
into how much each resembles an episode

426
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:15,241
in part one to what extent these episodes
are we writings of others that have

427
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:21,760
already taken place in the first book.
Also,

428
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,940
we will see that running thread
through these episodes is doubling the

429
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:32,300
appearance of doubles, uh, of Don
Quixote, of reflections of Oakley, Hopi.

430
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,740
Uh, the first is the episode
that is called in Jarvis,

431
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,460
uh, the episode of the night
of the looking glasses,

432
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:46,360
which makes it very awkward for me to say
because of course this is 18th century

433
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,420
England English and the English
say looking gloss for a mirror.

434
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,680
And uh, so, uh,

435
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,750
I say night of the looking glass is just
to be consistent with the translation

436
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,520
that you're reading this time around,
but it's in Spanish color yellow.

437
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,930
It looks at speckles night of the mirrors.

438
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,960
Now this episode brings to mind that
have the fight of Don Quixote with the

439
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:15,620
Basque in part one because
you do have an actual dual,

440
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,140
the most significant episode.
Uh,

441
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,970
the most significant aspect of this
episode is that in it, Don Quixote meets,

442
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,350
meets his mirror image image
and the feeds that mirror image.

443
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,570
Carrasco has decided that the only way
to subject Don Quixote is to meet him at

444
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:35,404
his own level.

445
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,770
But mostly what he's doing is reenacting
one in the way that donkey hope they

446
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:47,180
reenacted. Oh, really? I'm still
reenact the romances of chivalry.

447
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,610
Don't hot.

448
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,610
They will find a copy of himself
model after his own mat inventions.

449
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,700
A copy that is rich in details.

450
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,440
Notice that don't see now here is gassing.

451
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,490
They are they one Dalia Dalia means
and the Lucia land of vandals.

452
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,200
The vandals were one of the
Germanic tribes, but uh,

453
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,210
invaded the peninsula,
uh,

454
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,650
after the collapse or with the
collapse of the Roman Empire.

455
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Carrasco Carrasco get up as at night
errand is quite something he has outdone

456
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:32,050
Gnocchi Haldane and here is a quote
from page five 54 Loki Hartej viewed his

457
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,971
antagonist and found he had his helmet
on and the beaver down down so that he

458
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,870
could not see his face,

459
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:47,110
but he observe him to be as strong made
man and not very tall over his armor.

460
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,580
He wore it kind of circuit
certitude or loose coat.

461
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,830
Seemingly have the finest gold be
sprinkled with sundry little moons of

462
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,360
resplendent looking glass,

463
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,640
which made the most gun and splendid
show a great number of green,

464
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:08,630
yellow and white feathers. Waved
about his helmet on. Quote,

465
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,850
this translation or the translation
struggles a bit with the lunas.

466
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,670
The word used in uh,

467
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,360
four mirror in the original mou,
Jazz Luna's their risk.

468
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,720
This is a horse

469
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:41,070
which contains that word, uh, um,

470
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,400
a most important suggestion
in the passage La Luna,

471
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,600
they lists backhoe is the
reflecting part of the mirror,

472
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,860
but lunar means moon
of course,

473
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:01,720
and moon leads to lunacy
do madness.

474
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,270
Sandstone is the night of the moons.

475
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,750
The night of lunacy denied of madness,

476
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,760
which is quite appropriate because in
trying to cure Doki hold this madness,

477
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,950
he's acting like a madman,
like a lunatic. The moon,

478
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:21,100
of course, he's also the
celestial body of reflected light,

479
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:24,780
but excellence the same as the
night of the looking glasses.

480
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,650
Sound song in this getup is
a reflection of don Quixote.

481
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,260
Quixote came close enough to some song.

482
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,880
He will be able to see himself
reflected on the little

483
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,100
as in the episode of
the Parliament of death.

484
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,360
Don Quixote has met in mirror
image of his madness here.

485
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,620
It's more than just a reflection that
is reflected in the in the night of the

486
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:56,490
most was acting like came and he's also
reflected in his armor being reflected

487
00:35:56,491 --> 00:36:00,540
back from those little mirrors on his uh,
on his costume.

488
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,250
So you can see

489
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,210
sent Joe has also met his double in domain
CCL whose fault knows is a prodigious

490
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,310
example of the grotesque,

491
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,880
which is such a prevalent
quality in part two.

492
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I quote scarcely had the clearness of
the day given opportunity to see and

493
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:30,450
distinguish objects when the first thing
that presented itself to Sanchez eyes.

494
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,620
What this choir of the woods knows,
which was so large,

495
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,460
that in almost over cha overshadowed
his whole body in a word.

496
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,110
It is said to have been of an excessive
size hawked in the middle and full of

497
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:48,111
warts and carbuncles of the color of
mulberry and hanging two fingers breath

498
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:50,610
below his mouth,
the size,

499
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,590
the color of the carbon
carbuncles and the cooker.

500
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,850
This so disfigured his face,

501
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,820
that sanctuary at site,

502
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,860
they're off being unto tremble hand and
foot like a child in a fit and resolved

503
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:11,771
within himself to take 200 cuffs before
he's color should awaken to encounter

504
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,140
that hub gobbling. I
mean, he says he was, he,

505
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,970
he may have thought that he'd had to fight
this fellow us there two matches with

506
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:23,460
Friday. He saying after seeing
that knows I would never,

507
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,500
never fight these monster.

508
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,380
Notice the exaggerated dimensions
and other hideousness of the nose,

509
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,590
which together with this being artificial
and new features of part to Muddy

510
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,180
Torres was naturally ugly and though
her physical deformities were extreme,

511
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:47,181
they were at least her own and not likely
to inspire fear so much as repulsion,

512
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,400
but here centuries moved to dread,
which will happen often.

513
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:58,401
Impart to fear is one of the emotions
that we encounter once and again in part

514
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,540
two and you can begin
charting them from now on.

515
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,420
Domestus yards. Nose is connected
to the aesthetics of the Baroque,

516
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,330
who's emblematic figure is the monster.

517
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,710
The figure made up of
disparate conflicting elements
like the nose and contrived

518
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,340
to cause admiration.

519
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,770
The monster is made to be shown.
And uh,

520
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,270
and uh, this quality is embedded in
the very etymology of the word monster.

521
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,530
Monster had him in Latin.

522
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,460
If Don Quixote has met him the
night of the looking glasses,

523
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,520
an image of his madness in Seattle central
has met an image of his foolishness

524
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,990
domain is like a carnival
figure of the fool.

525
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,090
And his costume is reminiscent of
those of the actors in the wild.

526
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:55,910
One of the parliament of death.
His name is [inaudible] [inaudible]

527
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:58,923
[inaudible] [inaudible]

528
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,470
domain of course is, is, is,
is, is a form of Tomas, Tomas,

529
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,950
okay.
But Seattle at the time

530
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,670
meant a kind of trout.
So to maybe in the past,

531
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,100
his name means means I ate drought.

532
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,060
If you stopped back and think of it,

533
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,560
there are many names that mean something
and you don't catch onto it until you

534
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,450
think about it.
But this is scholars have come up.

535
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,900
I didn't define that
Tomasa, chairman, I trout.

536
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,263
Uh,

537
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,560
now the fact that that
domain is an image of, of,

538
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,020
of Sanchez is foolishness.
Foolishness is so much.

539
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:53,200
So because domain is Sanchez neighbor,
please eat

540
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,810
with whom you this courses some things
proper to squires and who's gluttony and

541
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:00,984
other habits.

542
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:06,050
He shares the dialogue about the
contingency of meaning in language.

543
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:12,770
A centering on ie whole there
Buta or on is hilarious,

544
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,070
but he speaks of a very
modern conception of language.

545
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:22,071
As spitter mentioned somewhere in this
essay that is meaning is contingent in

546
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:26,250
language. It is not fixed. It's shifting.

547
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,000
And this is consistent with
the view of the Middle Ages,

548
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,530
renaissance and Baroque and the Baroque.

549
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:35,620
This blue shiftiness of
languages emphasize. Uh, so

550
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,673
okay,

551
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,220
in the dialogue of the squires,

552
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
there is also a critique of the opera
class as a frequent topic in part two that

553
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,380
you might also chart as you read it.

554
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,940
They particularly central do not
accept the colts of Chinnery.

555
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,430
That leads that lead to such a oh fights.
Uh,

556
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:05,490
central seems to be saying that it
is the opera classes that start wars.

557
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,810
So very deep critique.
This is part of the political element,

558
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,910
uh,
of these second book of the 1615 Quixote.

559
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,763
Uh,

560
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,990
but also fits in with the semantics
of the disingenuous because,

561
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,050
uh,
the accoutrements of the opera classes,

562
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,200
they're luxuries are part of the seats
that are own done by the same guy.

563
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:32,320
No.

564
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,310
As you will see as you move through the
upper classes in the next few episodes.

565
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,630
Now, what is the significance
of all this doubling?

566
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,510
Okay, hold them. It's double
sanctions. Dobo I think that at the,

567
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,310
at the deepest level,

568
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:56,390
it means that the characters have met
themselves and struggle each within

569
00:41:57,091 --> 00:42:02,091
himself to find meaning and identity or
identity within meaning or a form of,

570
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,290
of, of Weiss. Uh, self recognition,

571
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,960
troubled self recognition.

572
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,630
This is tied to the issue of self reflect
society that we have been discussing

573
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,250
since the beginning.

574
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,420
If the renaissance mind with
the mind of the renaissance,

575
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:26,010
if I may use an abstraction,

576
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,580
Sally's forth in search of the real world,

577
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:35,390
which it tries to interpret control and
use the baroque mind in that Sally in

578
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:41,250
forth fines mostly itself,

579
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,540
it finds its own inner workings.
This,

580
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,210
I equate to the God,

581
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:54,070
don't your sweet Gogi Ergo soon I
think therefore I am what you see.

582
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,180
Ultimate truth that the car
can find the card 1596, 1650,

583
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,160
roughly contemporary a little
later then of one. Yes.

584
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,870
But it's, it is itself, it
is a self recognizable jet.

585
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,080
This figure in this images it need a
further and further thought and reflection

586
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:21,840
with the, with the emphasis on
reflection on, on uh, like a mirror.

587
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,820
It is appropriate then for these
reasons that the characters should meet

588
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:31,850
distorted images of their own selves
or twisted reflections of themselves in

589
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:34,560
their adventures.

590
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,540
So Carrasco has falling into his own
trap while Don Quixote on have an almost

591
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:47,541
literally out of body experience seeing
themselves outside of themselves and

592
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:50,730
seeing themselves,
how they would look to others.

593
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,760
This is particularly
troubling to I think central,

594
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,790
but also to look the haughty who as the
novel progresses we'll find more such,

595
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,900
uh,

596
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,410
instances where a reflections
of this guy and uh,

597
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:12,180
undermine his, uh, his quest.

598
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:18,260
So, so we move on to the
episode of the Lions, uh,

599
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,170
which is reminiscent of that of
the galley slaves. In part one,

600
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,783
the lions,

601
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,990
like the prisoners are prisoners
and they belonged to the king.

602
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,990
They're are also under the
supervision of the crown.

603
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,820
Finding lions in the middle of
Casteel is not a common occurrence,

604
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:41,390
so their appearance is another instance
of the real conspiring to add to don

605
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:46,791
Quixote's madness by presenting him with
beings and objects that are out of the

606
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:50,010
ordinary,
like the players in the cart,

607
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,370
lions or object of a mule
of objects of amusement,

608
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:57,270
they'd been taken to court so they
can be viewed by the people. Uh,

609
00:44:57,271 --> 00:44:58,620
amusement and display.

610
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,430
They are fit for heroic action and Don
Quixote does act with great courage only

611
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:09,480
to be marked by the lion,
but not only arts peacefully,

612
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,750
but turns his hind quarters to the night.

613
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,330
Ultimate insult theories him is no longer
possible under these circumstances.

614
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,920
It is a very cruel episode
for donkey haughty,

615
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,510
but together with the fight with
the night of the looking glasses,

616
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,120
these are two victories for Gnocchi,
Quixote,

617
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,300
which together with the knowledge that
is now in a book are to his deluded sense

618
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:38,040
of importance and of accomplishments.

619
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,750
The characters around him conspired
to increase this dilution,

620
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,890
but the lions are real and could have
killed him. Quixote and the others.

621
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,610
Jorge Luis Borges from I have
quoted so many times in this course.

622
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:54,690
The Great Argentine writers
says that, uh, uh, uh,

623
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,750
courage is the one characteristic that
is a constant from first from book one to

624
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:02,280
book two,
the courage of Don Quixote.

625
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,820
And then he's also the constant from
alone Sukarno to Don Quixote and back to

626
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,430
Alonzo Kiano at the end of the book.

627
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,240
And so we come to the gentleman in green,

628
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,440
the gentleman in the green writing coat,
uh,

629
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,630
in Don Diego de Miranda don't help
healthy meats and other double,

630
00:46:26,631 --> 00:46:28,950
but an inverted one like a mirror image.

631
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,970
Don't [inaudible] appears to
read the Dolly go donkey hot.

632
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:37,971
They would have been had he
not read romances of chivalry
turn mad and chosen to

633
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,570
attempt to revive the age of Chimichurri.

634
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,970
He is like the night of the looking
glasses and other distorted reflection of

635
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,850
[inaudible]. The one I repeat
that he could have been don't.

636
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,930
Leo is the image of what the French
in the period called the [inaudible].

637
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,500
He is reasonably well off,
reads devotional books,

638
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,380
humps and lives, an honest, peaceful
life at home. Don't be haughty.

639
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:11,390
Mocks him slightly in the episode of
the Lions when Don Diego prudently runs

640
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:17,250
away and again as he takes his
leave telling him that the,

641
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,610
that he's not looking out,

642
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,180
they says he's not given to
leisure leisure like Don Diego.

643
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,210
Diego is a kind of pre dra character.
Uh,

644
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,660
but he has a son who wants to be a
port lowering. So they meet under,

645
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,990
we have once again the
postprandial conversation and
one more time to discussion

646
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:41,650
center centers in the relative
merits of arms and letters.

647
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:47,190
This is a repetition of that episode,
but now you know what?

648
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:52,191
Appointed house not in a dilapidated in
and Don Quixote's has interlocutors who

649
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:57,271
are or his intellectual level Lorens who
is quite a good poet who reminds us of

650
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:02,680
resource resource to more on Gardenia
but does not take action as they did.

651
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,940
Though Quixote reveals that he
knows a great deal about poetry,

652
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:12,640
but the outcome of the exchange is
that Cheever re surpasses poetry.

653
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,770
That arms are superior,
who letters.

654
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,200
This whole section seems to be,
uh,

655
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,490
in homage of Gfsi Lasso,
the La Vega,

656
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,240
the great Spanish board
of the 16th century,

657
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:29,230
whose name I've mentioned many times
and who has become by this time,

658
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:33,650
the model of Port Kertscher
and soldier Garcia Lasso,

659
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,150
uh, who lived in the first
half of the 16th century, uh,

660
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:43,330
died while attempting to scale the
wall of the castle during a battle.

661
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,530
Uh, in Charles if his army,
they dropped a rock on him.

662
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,250
He only lived 36 years,
but his poetry

663
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,470
changed the course of
poetry in Spanish forever.

664
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,800
Cervantes was quite devoted to him.

665
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,350
The discussion turns to the issue of
if report can be made or if he's born.

666
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:06,603
And,
uh,

667
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:11,590
this again gives another example of
Don Quixote's extensive readings,

668
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:16,870
uh, other than, uh, rather than
merely a books of chivalry.

669
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,200
Uh, this is the library beyond
the library that was burnt by the,

670
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,160
by the priest and the barber and,

671
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,740
and the women that don't get hurt.
This house.

672
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,790
And then we come to a, uh, uh,

673
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:35,170
the last episode I'll be discussing today
and which is a transition episode to

674
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,160
go mattress wedding.
This is the episode of the swordsman,

675
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,670
the two sportsman who begin to argue
about who's better. One is very,

676
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:47,530
very strong and the other one
is an expert, a scientist of,

677
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,050
of, of, of fencing at this time, uh,

678
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:56,310
since the advent of firearms and all of
that fencing had become a sport and a

679
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:58,330
not only a sport or a science,

680
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:03,210
I were books written about
trying to understand, uh,

681
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,280
fencing in geometric mathematical terms
and surrounded like to poke fun at this.

682
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:15,200
However,
it is the scientific stories man who uh,

683
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:20,410
who makes a fool out of the other one who
is so strong that at the end when he's

684
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:21,244
very angry,

685
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,420
he takes his sword and throws it so far
away that it takes a long time to get up

686
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:29,840
there and pick it up. The
point of this, uh, uh,

687
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,063
uh,

688
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,100
throw away episode it may seem is that uh,

689
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,880
it shows that art triumphs over nature,

690
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:46,380
that science triumphs
over strength on the,

691
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,630
the triumph of art over nature is a
baroque topic that appears once and again

692
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,080
throughout part two.

693
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:02,830
And we are going to be talking about
that in the next class when we talk about

694
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,180
commercials wedding in relation to a
painting by the Alaska is called the

695
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,130
spinners last.
Elon Elandra's.

696
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,360
But now we have to turn on to conclude

697
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,570
to our exemplary story,
the glass graduate,

698
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:24,530
which I hope that you, uh,
uh, that you have written.

699
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,460
We have gone over the 16,
13 exemplary stories book,

700
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,080
how Cervantes published it because
publishers became interested in his work

701
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:39,200
after the success of the 1605 Quixote.
Also,

702
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:43,970
once he realized that he couldn't use
the stories which he had a in the way he

703
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:47,570
used an in part one because he had been
so criticized and you have read about

704
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,680
the criticisms as they appear at
the beginning of part two. So, uh,

705
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,790
I said one test who prided himself on
being the first to ever write this kind of

706
00:51:55,791 --> 00:52:00,410
Noel and the Spanish language collected
them in this wonderful book that would

707
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:05,120
have given serve anthesis uh,
a prominent place in the, uh,

708
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,050
in, in the Canon even if he had
not written the whole thing.

709
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,110
Now the glass graduate good.
He's one of the better known stories,

710
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:17,270
famous for the very strange kind of
madness that afflicts the protagonist.

711
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:22,520
He believes himself to be made of glass
and lives in constant fear of being

712
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:23,354
broken.

713
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,810
It is another example of Cervantes is
profound interest in the workings of the

714
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:33,950
human mind and in issues concerning
knowledge and the ability to arrive at the

715
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,610
truth.
Tomas,

716
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:39,500
he a very suggested
suggestive sort of paranoia.

717
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,980
It is an illness that has a [inaudible]
air to it in Kafka's the metamorphosis.

718
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,080
As you know, the protagonist,
uh, becomes a roach.

719
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,580
Tomas suffers mls that is expressed
through fear of bodily harm or physical

720
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:00,160
fragility.

721
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,180
It is a way of feeling different
than vulnerable that can be extended.

722
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:09,860
It's extended to a general human
condition, a form of alienation.

723
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,880
I think this is the main reason
why the story is so compelling.

724
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:19,540
The idea of this madness that you feel
yourself made of glass and therefore

725
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:24,760
vulnerable and you would, you tried to
establish a distance between you and and,

726
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:29,770
and others who might break you or have
or anything that was a tile falling off a

727
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:34,850
roof. My break you and
taking laborious, uh, uh,

728
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:40,040
uh, measures to protect, uh,

729
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,290
you're very vulnerable, uh, uh, a body.

730
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,600
Now the novel begins as if
it were to be a compressed,

731
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,380
kind of been doing for months.
That's a German word for word of,

732
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,720
of or novel of Education.
Bill doing education building from us.

733
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,790
But then it moves on to
encompass Tomasa's entire life.

734
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,890
It is not however,
a biography,

735
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:05,580
but it centers on two or
three periods of his life,

736
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,850
most particularly on the
one during his illness.

737
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:14,210
The plot is circular and a circularity
is expressed through Tomas.

738
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,180
Very last name. First.
He's called [inaudible].

739
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:21,203
Yeah.

740
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,790
His last name is [inaudible],

741
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:29,870
which means slice is a
slice or not quite a circle,

742
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,010
a fragment. It was fear,
but when he, at the end,

743
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:39,480
when he recovers from his illness and
is in full command of his faculties,

744
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:41,270
his last name becomes

745
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:48,300
Rueda, which means wheel.
So he has been completed.

746
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:52,880
We go back to Spitzer and
his bully. No Meisha. Um,

747
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,250
now during his illness,

748
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,290
he is known as the [inaudible],
which is the name of the story in Spanish,

749
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,370
which means the license should
delay at licentiate glass window.

750
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,340
They call him graduate glass
in the translation, but
media, music glass window,

751
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:16,890
a stained glass window or a glass
display case. So this is what his name,

752
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,980
his name's, uh, is again go back,

753
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,230
we have to go back to Spitzer and
names and things and so forth. Uh,

754
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,160
there is something passive about
Tomas except when he's ill,

755
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,230
but on the whole things happen to him.

756
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,700
He was found lying down under some trees
by the young gentleman who take him to

757
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:38,160
Salamanca using their,
uh,

758
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,920
in the their servant for eight years,

759
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,000
but also acquires an education
showing a remarkable intelligence.

760
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,620
Though he's only, this is only
reported not dramatized until he's ill.

761
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,210
He is always in a second plane.
I said, we're as a soldier,

762
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:58,680
he moves around trying to soak up as
much experience and culture as possible.

763
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:04,850
Tomas is then administer a poison by the
spurned woman spraying the woman who is

764
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:08,490
no quarterly damn soul border,

765
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,400
notorious whore who
falls in love with him.

766
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,420
The poison queens preserve [inaudible]
that she gives him is redolent with

767
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:22,950
sexual connotations as in
Latin, in the, in, in, in,

768
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:28,010
in the classics. The memory
Yoda in the original Latin, uh,

769
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,890
was associated,
uh,

770
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,180
by way of resemblance
with female sexual organs.

771
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:38,170
This is how she lures him into eating it,

772
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,270
but there is no hint of what makes him
attractive to her other than perhaps is

773
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:46,900
famous. A brilliant scholar. It seems like
a whim that she falls in love with him.

774
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,130
She disappears and that is as far as
the erotic thing goes in the story,

775
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,190
it disappears when ill Tabasco is placed
and remarkable intelligence and wit

776
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:01,710
being not only insightful in his
observations but making these with pumps,

777
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,260
sharp witticisms and
clever circumlocutions.

778
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,810
He's a regular like and
he's like an oracle and he's
consulted as such by people.

779
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:16,260
There is a correlation between his illness
and his insightfulness which seems to

780
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:23,911
hinge on transparency since he
believes himself to be made of glass.

781
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,860
And if you go to page one 13,
you will find a quote in which,

782
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,580
uh, he says, uh, he, he,

783
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,740
he challenges them to ask him questions
that he will be able to answer for uh,

784
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,370
uh, but because he was a man
of glass rather than flesh,

785
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:46,780
I'm quoting for since glass was
a finance delegate substance,

786
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:51,790
his mind to function more
quickly and efficiently in that,

787
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,500
in a conventional body, uh,
which was made of a denser,

788
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:57,640
an earthly or stuff.

789
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:01,480
I mean his body would be denser and
glass is transparent and so forth.

790
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:06,040
This is a page one 13.
Uh,

791
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,580
in other words,
Tomas,

792
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:14,320
mine makes transparent the world around
him just as his body is presumably

793
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:17,620
transparent. Transparency
gives him access to the truth.

794
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,460
But he's also said to be highly
educated and intelligent.

795
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,060
So He's into insightful.
Does once he's ill,

796
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:30,061
it's like an increase of these
qualities or is it disconnected from it?

797
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,280
It is not clear if,

798
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:37,330
if it was the poison or the precarious
condition in which he believes to be,

799
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,370
that sharpens his wit.

800
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,500
He is like the black man in
the traditional story who
can tell the emperor that

801
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:49,450
he is naked because he has
nothing to loose. Uh, because,

802
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,320
uh, Tomas because with illness
has become a sort of of freak.

803
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,890
He has no reputation to protect.
Uh,

804
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,670
and so he pierces through all social
convention and through hypocrisy and lies

805
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,260
and tells the truth. Uh, he also, uh,

806
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:10,260
in, uh, outlining the
various virtues and defects,

807
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:10,750
uh,

808
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:15,750
of each of a profession or trade
is following a traditional formula,

809
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,713
a set,

810
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:23,060
a set piece that became a skid in the
theater to someone who tells well amongst

811
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:28,340
do this and cobblers do that. And
that, that is behind this story.

812
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:29,200
Now they,

813
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,200
the black graduate has much in common
with the Quixote and seems to dramatize

814
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:36,150
the common debate,
uh,

815
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,570
in that book between arms and letters
because it's both a soldier and his, uh,

816
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:45,560
an a student, a brilliant student,
and Salamanca last unit. Uh,

817
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:50,300
but whereas don Quixote's mainly and
reader of literature of Romances of

818
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:51,410
children, we, above all,

819
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:56,360
Tomas is a legal scholar whose
mission is reaching the truth.

820
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,670
His quest is more intellectual than
literary. So in that sense, uh,

821
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,910
he is not quite like Don Quixote.
He is different,

822
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,910
more philosophical if one could say,

823
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,600
the ending seems to suggest as
it is throughout the holder,

824
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,920
the preeminence of arms over letters
when he has to escape from Salamanca.

825
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:19,631
Uh,

826
01:00:19,631 --> 01:00:24,631
and it goes back to Flanders and has a
career in the army and ends his life,

827
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:28,310
uh, owner ugly. Now will,

828
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:33,020
we will be looking at other exemplary
stories in the near future and you will be

829
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:37,820
able to experience the variety of
plots and narrative experiments that,

830
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:42,290
uh, the book contains. And that I
think is the reason for its being.

831
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,570
For this story's being
colleague exemplary.

832
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,470
They are a collection of
samples or examples of, uh,

833
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,840
plots and stories.
