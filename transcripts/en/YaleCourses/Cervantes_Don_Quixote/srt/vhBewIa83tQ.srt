1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,670
Today,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,670
I'm going to talk about the transition
from part one to part two of the,

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,660
uh, Jihadi, um,

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,320
our transition not serve and this
is a transition, uh, remember,

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,910
uh, that he didn't know for sure
that he wasn't a right a second part.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,100
Of course when he wrote the second card,

7
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:27,750
he knew for sure that he had
written part one and it is a, uh,

8
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:31,980
a transition for us, uh, and
also a transition in his life,

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,120
uh,

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,120
but not one that was envisioned
when part one was being conceived.

11
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,260
I underline that fact.

12
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:45,240
I have said several times because the
illusion is created that it is one book by

13
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:50,070
the fact that it is all bound together.
You will see today, uh, that uh,

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,550
are quite different as books because
we will be seeing the title pages, uh,

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,820
of them.
Um,

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,510
I would begin by reviewing what
I call the grand themes of,

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,780
uh, criticism, uh,

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,510
regarding part one before
moving on to part two.

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,590
Now the first of those grant themes,

20
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,100
number one is ambiguity and perspectivism.

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,730
This is a review session, uh, as it were,

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,000
uh, Leo Spitzer, whom you will be meeting
in a week or so when you read his, uh,

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,120
uh, very fine piece in the case book
called linguistic perspective is in Minto.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,930
Quixote, uh, says the
following. Uh, I want to do,

25
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:41,340
you're going to talk about his
conclusions. We will talk more about,

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,660
uh, how he comes to those conclusions
after you have read, uh, his, his piece.

27
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:48,840
But I need to go over his conclusions.
Uh,

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,560
he says this means that in our novel
mean Nikki Haughty things are represented

29
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,060
not fort why they are in themselves,

30
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,180
but only as things spoken
about or thought about.

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,280
And this involves breaking the narrative
presentation into two points of view.

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,630
There can be no certainty about
the own broken reality of events.

33
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,520
The only unquestionable truth on which
the reader may depend is the will of the

34
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:19,521
artist who chose to break
up a multivariant reality
into different perspectives.

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,653
In other words,

36
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,770
per perspective is him suggests an
archimedean principle outside the plot.

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,000
And the Archimedes must
be Servantez himself,

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,180
meaning the archimedean principle,
the focus,

39
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:38,010
the center of the Fulcrum is
Cervantes himself who has created this

40
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:38,844
perspectives.

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,030
He adds a Spitzer outs and we may see in
Cervantes is two fold treatment of the

42
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,540
problem of nicknames, which has
studies in great detail in his article.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,330
Another example of his baroque attitude,
we will be talking about the Baroque,

44
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,290
uh, extensively in the next few lectures.
He's baroque attitude. What is true,

45
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,020
what is a dream?
This is one of the topics of the Baroque.

46
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,770
This time continuous Spitzer toward
language is not human language.

47
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,020
Also,
Vanita Vanitas,

48
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,030
Vanny tattoo vanity of vanities
is quoting of course a scripture

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,800
that's the end of Spitzer.

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,750
And we saw that CD Echo Morang
Aroyo who's a name you have heard,

51
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,620
uh, before, uh, what,
what he said about irony,

52
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm repeating a quote that you heard
in a previous lecture. He says,

53
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:35,401
I agree with spitzers
definition of servant Ian
perspectivism and now he quotes

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,950
Spitzer, who says, in terms of morals,

55
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,920
Cervantes is in no way a perspective is,

56
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,340
does the end of the spitter quote
within the Merona Royer quote in a note,

57
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,840
more on a Rodeo continues.
He has,

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,870
perhaps we ought to point out here,

59
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,460
this is CDR core Bordonaro you
perhaps we are to point out here that

60
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:02,290
perspectivism is inherent
in two Christian thought.

61
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,500
Uh,

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,500
prospective ism is in the sense of a form
of modesty that recognizes the limits

63
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:13,951
of all judgment and human knowledge
is indeed a Christian humility and

64
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,620
intelligence, uh, in the strictest sense,

65
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,610
the capacity to perceive the
limit of our own creations.

66
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,850
And then he uses the Greek word for irony,
irony.

67
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,580
So perspectivism this partial view
that creates, is irony and so forth.

68
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,410
Moron earlier underlines is
a very Christian perspective.
I would add that the,

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,910
the self assurance of the
renaissance, uh, is being eroded,

70
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,170
uh, on the ordered cosmos
of the Middle Ages, uh,

71
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,080
has long disappeared.
Uh,

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,670
now that is the, the first of
the grand themes, uh, ambiguity,

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,020
perspectivism and so forth.

74
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,050
The second of the grand themes is that
the self can impose its will on reality,

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,160
but only to a certain extent.

76
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm the self is defined.

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,640
That self is defined by the agonistic
struggle to do so to input between

78
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:15,640
postage. Well, on reality, uh,

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,650
we, uh, uh,

80
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,870
Captain Ahab in Melville's,

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,490
Moby Dick is the most obvious modern
example in fiction. And also of course,

82
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:31,780
an air of donkey hope. The Melville
was a great reader of Cervantes.

83
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,090
Uh, remember in this context of
imposing our will on reality.

84
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,460
Uh, what I said about, uh,

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,470
how we invent our beloveds when
in love that is part of this, uh,

86
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,450
of this willful imposition, uh,
of ourselves on, on reality.

87
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,203
Um,

88
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,760
now why is doubt such an integral part
of what we could call the aesthetics of

89
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:04,610
the, uh, how can doubt
be a positive value?

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,560
The book gives of substance,
uh,

91
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,130
to the sense of doubt brought about
by the scientific discoveries and

92
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:17,780
philosophical ideas of the period.
It enacts doubts,

93
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,220
the Quixote. It dramatizes
it. Dramatizes it is,

94
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,630
it is the, a modern
condition. Remember what I,

95
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,190
what I mentioned about, uh,
uh, a coper, Nicole's Galileo,

96
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,370
the fact that the world of mankind is
no longer at the center of the world.

97
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,580
The earth is no longer at the center
of the universe. And this is a,

98
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,270
has brought about this,
uh, sense of, of doubt.

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,820
There is doubt. Uh, continuing
with this second grand theme,

100
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,560
uh, there is doubt about
the voracity of texts,

101
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,760
the capacity of text to convey the truth,
including,

102
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:01,860
and most prominently the Bible.
Oh,

103
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,580
the Bible as interpreted
by the Catholic Church, uh,

104
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,490
such a doubt was the only prevalent
among Protestant thinkers,

105
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,790
but also among Catholic Catholic
ones like Erasmus of Rotterdam.

106
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,870
Erasmus is one of the, this
great renaissance figures
that I have, uh, mentioned,

107
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,040
uh, as being important,
uh, for, uh, sort of,

108
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,880
and this is a time the humanists,

109
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,450
Erasmus was one.
We're philologists.

110
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:36,620
The philologists means lover of language,
Phyllo Logos,

111
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,040
lover of language,
students of language,

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,550
particularly classical
languages like Latin,

113
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,430
Greek and Hebrew. Chairs
for the study, uh,

114
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:52,010
of these languages were created in Spain,
uh,

115
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,260
at the University of Alcoa,
for instance,

116
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,650
that pound where Cervantes happens
to have been born by the way,

117
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,570
uh,

118
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,570
humanists like Erasmus wanted to read
a scripture in the original Hebrew and

119
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,280
Greek, Hebrew, Old Testament Greek,

120
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,990
the new testament and challenge
saying your ohms official Latin Bible.

121
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:18,200
They wanted to do their own
translations of the Bible.

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,630
The church didn't like this at all.
And the Erasmian in Spain were persecuted.

123
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:25,920
Yeah.

124
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,420
But there is an underlying, uh, Erasmian,

125
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,190
uh, subtext in most of the, this,

126
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,910
the humanists like Erasmus wanted to say,
uh,

127
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,420
wanting to say the reading of this,
uh,

128
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,930
word in St Jerome's a Latin
version of the Bible is wrong.

129
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,120
It should be this.
And of course,

130
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,780
changing that word changes
the meaning of the text.

131
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,300
So there was doubt about the sacred texts,

132
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,330
which builds over into doubt about
texts in general and about language.

133
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,260
And we certainly have a echoes of
this throughout surrenders his work.

134
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,940
There is also continuing with
the second grand theme of doubt,

135
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
ontological doubt,
doubt about who one is,

136
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,210
which is an encouragement
to self creation,

137
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,450
to self fashioning to self invention as
Steven Greenburg Greenblatt calls it in

138
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:36,210
his book,
Renaissance Self Fashioning in Quixote.

139
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,570
There are many characters we
have seen who invent themselves,

140
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,670
not just on Quixote.
Uh,

141
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,790
he nest [inaudible] Marcella [inaudible]
springs is becoming Kona and so forth.

142
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,780
Doubt leads to pondering.

143
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,570
Pondering comes from
bundles in Latin way too.

144
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,980
So pondering is to way uh,
uh,

145
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,770
to weigh the different possibilities.
There are differences,

146
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,210
different alternatives to,
to being to action.

147
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,860
Self doubt is the
precondition to inventiveness,

148
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,750
to the play of the imagination.
It is the gateway to freedom,

149
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,970
which is one of the main themes of
the guilty as I have been pointing out

150
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,420
throughout
doubt,

151
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,650
doubt leads to vicarious lives,
live through literature,

152
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,330
as in the cases of Don Quixote
and Marcella for instance,

153
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,480
and many others that you will
meet in part to this is again,

154
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,490
I underlined the freedom
of the imagination.

155
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,040
Why do we want to become
others in the age of myths?

156
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,840
We want it to be gods in the modern age.

157
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,640
We want to be heroes like donkey hot.

158
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:59,490
They want it to be one of the two Valerie
heroes and like people today want to

159
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:03,960
be James Bond or uh,
such a modern, uh, hero,

160
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,500
a dissatisfaction with the world,

161
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:12,501
the world that is unstable leads to a
desire to make it other and to make one's

162
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,530
self other.

163
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,790
And this is very much the core of the
whole day from the very beginning.

164
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Now the third of the ground themes
that I'm reviewing as we conclude,

165
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,650
part one reading Nikki hotter is a book
about reading and it protagonist is

166
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:34,410
first and foremost a reader.

167
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,300
But there are many readers in the
book like Marcella Ag Resource, Tomo,

168
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,960
[inaudible],

169
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,330
and even the poor trooper who has trouble
reading the order of arrest as we saw

170
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:52,720
in that hilarious scene.
The Quixote,

171
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,800
the that you thought the encourages the
reader to look for stories not told or

172
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:04,051
calling directly by means of other
stories or embedded in other stories.

173
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,640
It is a book,

174
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,310
a hotel that is a lesson in reading
and interpreting in the broad sense.

175
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,370
There are so many scenes in
which challenge a deputation was,

176
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,840
are challenged or interpretations
by various characters clash.

177
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,220
The pleasure of reading
involves the discovery,

178
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,250
the teasing out of this subtextual
stories as we saw when we talked about

179
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,580
Cardenio story, uh, unwise. We,

180
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:40,360
so when we talked about
Princess Mikami corners story,

181
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,040
this is also a lesson for life
that one can learn in the hotel.

182
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,660
The fourth of the,
uh,

183
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,800
grand themes is that
characters are relational,

184
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,150
not static that they develop
in relation to each other

185
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,390
and given to us today.

186
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,200
This was an innovation in the Quixote
and innovation developed from the

187
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,950
picaresque where there is
character development in
fiction for the first time in

188
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:21,970
the Selestica. There is a, there
is some of that already 1499,

189
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,440
but this begins to develop
with the picker risk.

190
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,580
Last year, 1554, the Guzman and so forth.

191
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,570
Characters influence each other.

192
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,810
The mutual influence and transformation
take place by virtue of the dialogue

193
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,970
which posits that the self is
relational and dependent on the others.

194
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,250
This is evident in one of the truly
grand themes about the hotel started by

195
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:53,020
Salbaba.
They must Ariaga,

196
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,440
which is the theme of the
quick Saudization of sensual
and the sanctification of

197
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:03,160
donkey. Haughty meaning that
donkey, that a sancocho becomes a,

198
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,780
is influenced by his master,

199
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,640
and that Don Quixote is influenced
by his squire. The most,

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,710
the most obvious modern
example of this, uh, for me,

201
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,450
uh, is a, uh, a book and a,

202
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,300
uh, on a film that, uh,

203
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,710
called the kiss of the
Spiderwoman by Manuel [inaudible],

204
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,540
the Argentine writer,
uh, where, uh, there is,

205
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,560
uh, uh, there are two
fellows, Eh, uh, in jail,

206
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:39,430
in Argentina want a political activist.
And the other homosexual. And,

207
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,500
and the whole story is, is,
is how the homosexual, uh,

208
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,210
transforms the political activists by
telling him the stories of movies. And,

209
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:54,090
uh, it's a very moving a film
with a very quick Celtic, uh,

210
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,740
uh, uh, uh, structured to it,

211
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,170
but at least two characters talking
and so forth. Now don't fit it.

212
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:04,270
Nando's transformation as
well as that of Dorothea.

213
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,830
Is it a, is a prime example of
this evolution of characters.

214
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,170
Uh,
in addition,

215
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:16,040
we have seen the characters can invent
themselves identities and have adventures

216
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,010
in their new roles and within those
new fictions. As in the case of, uh,

217
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,670
of Princess Mikko be corner, we will
meet others who do the same in part to

218
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,850
the fifth of the grand
themes of criticism.

219
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:36,851
And this is mostly my own grand theme
about the Quixote is improvisation.

220
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,460
I have talked several times about
improvisation in the Quixote.

221
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,940
My Random House gives
two meanings to four, uh,

222
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,670
four to improvise,

223
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,440
one to prepare or provide
offhand or hastily extemporize

224
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,320
to compose,

225
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,410
but actually for meanings to compose
verse music on the spur of the moment.

226
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,310
Three to recite thing extemporaneously
and four to compose other or execute

227
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,840
anything extemporaneously.

228
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,040
The dictionary of the Spanish
Academy says, personally,

229
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,790
I said it on our costs are
prone [inaudible] studio
senior [inaudible] Alguna to

230
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:26,780
make or do something.
Suddenly we thought study or preparation.

231
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,350
Improvisation has something
to do with blurry.

232
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:35,351
Equally a concept that was very popular
during the heyday of structuralism.

233
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,560
And that means according to my

234
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,310
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible],

235
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,480
the first one probably swap [inaudible]
fancy fee to install something to

236
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,950
provide or arrange for something.

237
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm a tourist league and ingeniously to
fix or repair something more or less in

238
00:16:56,121 --> 00:17:00,950
a professional way to fix something up
too fancy foil to falsify it or pass it

239
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:05,951
off for something else to improvise
has on the one hand a positive side,

240
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:11,621
it is a boast of skill to be able to
do something without a model or plan,

241
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,680
but it also has a negative side because
the product of improvisation is usually

242
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:21,350
shorty imperfect,
fragile, and provisional.

243
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,860
We have seen that there is a great deal
of implicit improvisation in part one of

244
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,010
the Quixote somatically.

245
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:33,260
I said where a meaning that there are
things and actions had described which are

246
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,160
improvised.

247
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,470
I gave one pal Omegas in as an example
of this because it is made up of

248
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,940
Patchwork, uh, carried out
over time, haphazardly.

249
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,900
But I also pointed our features of the
novel itself that seemed to be trade

250
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,610
their construction.

251
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,970
They're notorious 17 oversights such
as the disappearance of Santos Donkey,

252
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,670
but there are many others.
For instance,

253
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:04,380
I don't know if you noticed that it said
Advantis pulls out of his out of his

254
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:08,680
hat at the end that the
innkeeper but one polemic,

255
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,210
uh,
was a trooper of the holy brotherhood.

256
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,920
Something that goes on mentioned
during the earlier episode.

257
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:21,921
In the end when quantile Omeka puts
out a candle to prevent a trooper from

258
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,680
finding out what is going
on in his establishment,

259
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,130
how come if he was a trooper himself,

260
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,400
I these lapses on the part of Cervantes
or part of the aesthetics of the book,

261
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,200
I would like to think that it is part of
the aesthetics of the book and that the

262
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,230
air of improvisation is very much in line
with the books in formal tone with the

263
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:52,011
fact that its origin is presumably a
found manuscript whose discovery is

264
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:57,150
episodic and who's redaction,
uh,

265
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,020
seems to be concomitant with
the action and the reading.

266
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,390
Most notoriously,
the prologue,

267
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,470
the [inaudible] dramatizes the process
of improvisation because it tells how it

268
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,810
is being laboriously written.

269
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,920
The prologue sets the tone for
the book and it's defined and,

270
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:23,280
and it is also if defining
epilogue as I said earlier, it is,

271
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:27,390
I know to improvisation to an
imperfection qualities too,

272
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,940
which the author resigns himself.

273
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,860
Remember that many and the speed dial
in the piece that you read, attributes,

274
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,540
improvisation, do the Spanish
character, he says this was resignation.

275
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,690
He's a Spaniard.

276
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,700
GMC was a Spaniard himself and
Isi Riley British has been,

277
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:49,400
is to love Spain. Uh, uh,

278
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,480
admiringly compares to the improvisation
in the Quixote to fighting and to

279
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,860
Flamenco dancing,

280
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,360
which are activities in which
improvisation is the order of the day.

281
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,700
I believe that it is a
theoretical statement on the
part of their Vantis which

282
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:10,701
he proposes again in chapter
five of the 1615 Quixote.

283
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,500
The second part when
he has the translator,

284
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:18,501
apologize and you will get to the
chapter for transcribing a text in which

285
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:23,811
central does not sound like
himself sounds to learn it.

286
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,410
This is a text that on dos itself
that is as, as it is being read,

287
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,370
it is also a critique of my niece,
me, my missus of representation.

288
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,470
It is an improvisation made from what
there is and at the translator and

289
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:41,430
transcriber pass on resigned.
Oh, it's imperfections.

290
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,860
All of this is connected to the themes
that I mentioned before about doubt,

291
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,510
self doubt and linguistic uncertainty.

292
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,050
How can my poor self create something
perfect and enduring in language given

293
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,000
what I have said about doubt,

294
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,090
self doubt on the instability of
language and conceived by the humanists,

295
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,860
uh, the whole, the whole thing. Uh,

296
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,900
it also opens the question of
temporality about this text that says,

297
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,610
well,
this doesn't sound like San job.

298
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,420
I transcribe it because it is my
duty to do so on so forth. Uh, uh,

299
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,730
in what moment or at what moment does
the Texas exist in relation to the

300
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,780
originals in which it is based?

301
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,690
Yeah.

302
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,970
Uh,
one solution,

303
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:43,860
perhaps the only solution is to say that
the texts exists only at the moment of

304
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:46,440
reading of each reading.

305
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,720
And that is a very modern,
uh,

306
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,520
current conception of textuality
that is already present in Cervantes.

307
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,200
So these are the grand themes that I
wanted to review with you about part one.

308
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,900
And now we move to part two 16,

309
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:11,500
15, 10 years. The whole
decade has elapsed.

310
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,280
Cervantes was an instant
success with Don Quixote.

311
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,920
Uh, and he moved to Madrid in 16, 16.

312
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,230
Publishers become interested in his
work and he brings out the novella a him

313
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,380
Pladis exemplary stories that you have
in 1613 on Ochoco Manias [inaudible]

314
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,510
eight place and eight interludes in 60 16,

315
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:40,420
15 the same year that the
second Quixote appears.

316
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,830
And I have a page here that you have read,
but I want to read again,

317
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,390
uh, from Darren's book set Avantis. Uh,

318
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,340
and from the biogas little biographical
chapter at the beginning that I

319
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:58,270
reproduced in my case
book so that we have, uh,

320
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,400
a synoptic view in 1606 durangos
the court settled again in Madrid.

321
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,230
And you have been following an Elliot.

322
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,210
The migrations of the Spanish court said
Vantis and his family moved with it.

323
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,060
Cervantes wanted to be in
touch with other writers.

324
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,260
I was looking for new publishers,
the women in his household,

325
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,490
busy with fashion and designing and
sewing. We're looking for customers.

326
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Miguel's last year in Madrid,
we're relatively serene.

327
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,510
He overcame through patience and wisdom,

328
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,230
all these adversities that
neglect the famous writers.

329
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:40,231
And so just the Vega who seldom had a
good word for his works and the sadness of

330
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,400
family crisis.

331
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,260
His daughters married but soon became uh,

332
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,000
his daughter married but soon became
the mistress of a wealthy middle age

333
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:50,834
businessman.

334
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,010
When Cervantes intervened in the
interest of preventing scandal,

335
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,100
she became a stranger.
Never again visited him.

336
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,010
Cervantes immersed himself in his work.

337
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,900
It was harvest season
for him late in life,

338
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,610
yet in full command of his talent, he
produced in books, work session at Sam.

339
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,560
He's extemporary Nawbo 16, 13, the second
part of Funky Hotel 1615. And finally,

340
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:20,300
Perseus answer, he's wound. That's the his
though and novel, which is imagination.

341
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,070
Uh, and his love for adventure
found almost limitless in scope.

342
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,560
And he hides a quoting, uh,
unhealed del Rio and he'll del Rio,

343
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,760
the Great Hispanics who was a professor
at Columbia University for many years

344
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,710
and who in the forties, published a
great history of Spanish literature.

345
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,230
Wrangles objectively serve
life was not a success story.

346
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,000
He will sell them in full control.
He was too poor for many years.

347
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:54,560
He lacked public recognition.
Yet as an hill del Rio points out,

348
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:58,100
and here he goes on in the real.
There is no reason to lament.

349
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,300
Cervantes is misfortunes nor the
mediocrity of his daily life.

350
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,100
He could those through an experience
which is seldom obtain when the writer is

351
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:08,210
successful and wealthy,

352
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:12,740
no observe and feel the beat of
Spanish life and its greatness.

353
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:16,130
And it's poverty and it's heroic fantasy.
And in,

354
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,830
in the sad reality of
an imminent decadence,

355
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,360
he was to leave in his books the most
faithful image of this life reflected in

356
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:27,890
multiple perspectives with bittersweet
irony and penetrating humor.

357
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,700
So the, uh, uh, uh,

358
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,210
this moment of where the beginning
of the decline of the Spanish empire,

359
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,670
uh, begins. And so, uh, to also, uh,

360
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,140
have a very clear vision of this moment.
Uh,

361
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,150
I want to read a text that I presumably
you have a also read from imperial

362
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:01,280
Spain. Uh, Elliott's a marvelous book,

363
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,440
which I do do hope that
you, that you read. Uh, um,

364
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,680
and he goes as follows.
In page.

365
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,610
This is three 19 three 20 of
your penguin classics edition.

366
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,260
He has been talking
about, um, uh, how, uh,

367
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,820
um, the writers could find sponsors
for their work and so forth.

368
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,860
At the same time,

369
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,880
the moral and emotional involvement of
the intellectuals in the tragic fate of

370
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:35,480
their native land seems to have
provided an additional stimulus,

371
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:40,280
giving an extra degree of intensity to
their imagination and diverting it into

372
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:42,830
rewarding creative channels.
Ironically,

373
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:46,200
a moment of crisis can
create a great literature.

374
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,790
This was especially true
of Cervantes says Elliott,

375
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,150
who's life from 1547 to 1616 spans the
two ages of imperial triumph and imperial

376
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,980
retreat.

377
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,750
This is the important sentence spans
the two ages of imperial triumph and

378
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,970
imperial retreat.
The grace,

379
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the crisis of the late 16th century cuts
through the life of Servantez as it got

380
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:19,101
through the life of Spain separating
the days of heroism from the days of

381
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,900
[inaudible]. This is a word that we will
be visiting again during the semester.

382
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,653
Okay.

383
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,840
They'll be on deceived,
somehow said Van.

384
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,250
There's magically held the balance
between optimism and pessimism.

385
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,380
Enthusiasm.
I'm irony,

386
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,030
but it illustrates what was to be the
most striking characteristic of 17th

387
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,070
century literary and artistic production.

388
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,580
That deep cleavage between the two
worlds of the spirit and the flesh,

389
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,240
which coexist and yet
our forever separate.

390
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,260
This constant dualism between
the spirit and the flesh.

391
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,060
The dream and the reality belonged
very much to 17th century European

392
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,380
civilization as a whole,

393
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,860
but it seems to have attained an
intensity in Spain that it rarely achieved

394
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,760
elsewhere.

395
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,640
It is apparent in the writings
of Calderon de la Barca,

396
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:25,110
whose name I have mentioned before and
the portraits of guest who's work we have

397
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:26,970
seen and continue to see,

398
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,100
and it prompted the bitter
satires of Canedo Francisco.

399
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:35,070
They came in through one of
the great writers of this,

400
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,620
of this vanish.

401
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,380
Yeah,

402
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,850
17th century.
He's quoting here,

403
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:48,690
so give me a little bit, are many
things here that seemed to exist on,

404
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:53,691
have there been and yet they are nothing
more than a name and an appearance.

405
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,950
[inaudible] road at the end of his life
was the reality of Spanish experience to

406
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:05,351
be found in the heroic imperialism of
Charles the fifth or in the humiliating

407
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:06,830
passivism of Phillip,

408
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:11,831
the third in the world of Don Quixote or
the world of central Panzer confused at

409
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:18,020
once by its own past and its own present.
The [inaudible] still of Philip,

410
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:18,920
the third,

411
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:24,310
the land of Arabic priestess
sought desperately for an answer.

412
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,851
I'd be curious.

413
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:30,851
Does you will meet in the
first chapters of a part two

414
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,030
from RBT or which was a, uh,
an opinion [inaudible] where,

415
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,390
uh,
um,

416
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,450
people who offered advice to the
government on matters of the economy on

417
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:54,280
military matters.
Some of the advice was really outlandish.

418
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,350
Uh, if he saw the people who
developed into today's economists,

419
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:04,570
the ones who have brought us to the
present crisis is what I always think of

420
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:08,950
when I think of the beauty status.
Uh, you will be meeting them,

421
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,190
as I said at the beginning of part two
when the characters discuss them and

422
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:18,550
discuss some of these advice given to the,
and donkey Horta himself.

423
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,760
Act as an arbitrary start by
giving some advice on how to, uh,

424
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,210
take care of the threat of the Turks,
uh,

425
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,620
coming down again after
the defeat in Lepanto.

426
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,330
So,
uh,

427
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,950
we are not responsible for answering
the question of what happened in Spain.

428
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,630
Why was it different?
Uh,

429
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,660
but we are responsible for seeing the
effects of this crisis as reflected in a

430
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,000
Saran thesis work. And I
wanted to do, to have a clear,

431
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,430
uh, uh, view of this, uh, uh, two ages of,

432
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,580
uh, of empire, uh, uh, one,

433
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,870
one of triumph and one of of defeat.
Um,

434
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,520
now the second part,

435
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,893
uh,

436
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,180
let us look at the, uh, uh,

437
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,100
various titles. Uh, the title,

438
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,460
that page of that we saw
of the 16 or five Quixote,

439
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:34,020
the title page of the 1615 Quixote
and the title page of the [inaudible],

440
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,190
he, he's known by his second
last name or some people are,

441
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:44,890
and you have to remember his name.
You will see it complete now on the,

442
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,850
on on the screen, a, yeah, a Ne the,

443
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,630
uh,
because

444
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,670
the two things that have happened to
Cervantes since the publication of 605,

445
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:03,290
the most important things is to the
success of the Quixote. And in 16,

446
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,160
14,

447
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,970
the appearance of an Apocryphal
Quixote published by [inaudible].

448
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,030
Now this is the,
uh,

449
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,230
title page of the 16 or five jihad.

450
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,970
The one we had just finished part
one. And this is as is, no. Okay.

451
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,970
[inaudible] remember we went over each
one of those words in one of my first

452
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,190
classes.
Okay.

453
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,580
Now we go to the title
page of the 1615 Quixote.

454
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,713
Uh,

455
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,500
and you say Segunda Party dealing
Henny Kava Yanno key hotel,

456
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,150
a mantra. There has been a major
change. He's no longer an e.

457
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,480
Dot. Logo. Now he's a Caballero

458
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,031
boredom.

459
00:32:55,031 --> 00:33:00,031
Miguel Lesser Vantis Saavedra I will
tore the La Primera party by Miguel de

460
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,200
[inaudible].

461
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,380
Author of the first part is being
underlying because [inaudible] in 16,

462
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:12,610
14,
there had appeared and apocryphal Quixote.

463
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,343
Okay.

464
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,253
Say Wound

465
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,340
[inaudible] [inaudible] the third
Sally. It will be the third. Sally,

466
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,080
uh, years. La, la, la I. Dot. E

467
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,390
E Lakita the fifth part,
because he goes after,

468
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,710
normally the first part is divided in
four. So this is the fifth part. Uh,

469
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,730
and so on, so forth, uh,
by, uh, loan software.

470
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,260
[inaudible] see, yes. Uh,

471
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,530
born in the, uh, in the
village of total. The sea. Yes.

472
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,690
Cause he just, he's a very famous,
uh, little town nearby. A lead.

473
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:56,831
Why?

474
00:33:56,831 --> 00:34:01,831
Does anyone remember why no one remembers
why that treatise of after the seed.

475
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:05,690
Yes. You're all very learned
Yalies the treaties d software,

476
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,760
the seizures whereby the pope,
uh,

477
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,360
in 1494 divided up to new world
between Portugal and Spain.

478
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,110
Uh, Francois Premiere,
Francis the first of France,

479
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,180
later complaining in the 16th century,

480
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:23,470
she says they wanted to see Adam's will
where Adam had bequeathed all of this

481
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:26,570
world to the Spanish,
but so toward the seizure.

482
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:31,280
So you remember to turn
the suggestion now. Uh,

483
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,020
so he took over a year though.
Not only I need, I'll go.

484
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,230
Is it because of Cervantes
felt that his deeds,

485
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,280
quote unquote in the first part,
elevated him tonight?

486
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,770
Uh,

487
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:56,270
some believe that the change was made at
the printers and not bite Advantis uh,

488
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,790
in part to, uh, distinguish
this book from our Jeunesse,

489
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,160
which still call it either,

490
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,630
so you call it [inaudible] night to
distinguish it from the Apocrypha.

491
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,990
Also,
some have said that the printers felt,

492
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:18,110
you see the hotels you have learned
was immediately translated into several

493
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:21,630
languages, English, French and so forth.

494
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,850
And the printers felt that Caballero
night was easier to translate into other

495
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:31,851
languages then either Evalgo editors
tend to make such changes in the interest

496
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:38,040
of profits. But, uh, we,
we don't know exactly,

497
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:41,970
but the fact is that the cha,
the title has been, uh, changed.

498
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,520
Uh, and this is a good way of remembering
that this is a different book.

499
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,973
Uh,

500
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,060
now the second part was,
uh,

501
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,920
finished in a hurry.
I said,

502
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:03,890
one is due in large measure to
the publication of the 1614 hour.

503
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,240
You're neither a spurious.
Second part.

504
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,170
Second parts had appeared
of [inaudible] of Guzman,

505
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,100
uh, of the cell is Tina,
not to mention, uh,

506
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,480
those of romances of chivalrous as we
saw in the episode of the scrutiny of the

507
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:25,620
books, there were whole cycles.
Second, third, fourth sparts.

508
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,390
Uh,
why

509
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,380
William Hendricks,

510
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Hendricks has recently finished a
doctoral dissertation about sequence,

511
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,920
uh,

512
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,900
and demonstrated that sequels dominated
the 16th century in Spain when the most,

513
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,660
uh,

514
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,660
were among the most popular of books and
a whole poetics of the sequel emerged

515
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,140
that the same thing to write a book from
scratch than to write a book that is

516
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:58,320
the continuation of a previous book.

517
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,270
Why was this,
why did this happen?

518
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,261
Well,

519
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:09,261
it happened because with
the advent of printing,

520
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,360
it was, uh, uh, uh, uh,

521
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,570
easier to produce these books and to
disseminate them and to make a profit from

522
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:22,440
them. So second parts,
uh, proliferate it. So,

523
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,801
uh,

524
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:27,801
in writing a second part of the Quixote
Cervantes is following this trend.

525
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,110
Most recently, the second part of it was
Mondale Farace, which had been published,

526
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,000
uh, right before the first part of
the, uh, of the [inaudible], uh,

527
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:44,220
now in why was he, uh, uh, so, uh,

528
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,660
upset or the appearance of the,
uh,

529
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,670
of a Neda [inaudible] because these novels
were big and these characters who are

530
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:55,350
becoming commodities

531
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,890
over which people would quarrel.
Remember that we're talking about authors,

532
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:03,450
as I have mentioned in earlier classes,

533
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:07,860
who are the first professional offers
we're trying to make a living from,

534
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,840
uh,
the writing.

535
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,880
So the Quixote was a
commodity for a set of Lantis,

536
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,320
uh,

537
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,150
particularly because this was not a
character derived from classical mythology

538
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:26,180
to which anyone had a right or from one
of those cycles of jewellery romances

539
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,630
which had been used and reuses
the character that he invented.

540
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,150
So he felt it was his own.
Of course,

541
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,570
the character would become a literary
myth under then taken up by others.

542
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:42,140
But, uh, at this juncture is around,

543
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:47,110
this was very jealously guarding
his, uh, his creation. He is,

544
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,710
he is, uh, very much aware of the,

545
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,410
of the value of his
invention because of his too.

546
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,980
He brought in fame and also
because he brought him a profit.

547
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,080
And in fact you will get to a,
a,

548
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:04,081
an episode in part to that
is a brilliant satire of uh,

549
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,560
the uh, relationship between
money and literary creation.

550
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,210
Something that we take for granted.

551
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:15,211
Now I need is the episode where Gnocchi
hope smashes a puppet show that was

552
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:18,610
brought by none other, that he missed
the pass them onto these guys as my say,

553
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:20,740
Pedro, uh, on,

554
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:24,790
he breaks up all the figurines
and after the episode, uh,

555
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,210
Don Quixote has to pay for
each one of those figurines,

556
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:29,830
each one of those characters,

557
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,220
depending on the importance
of the character in the story.

558
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,170
So you can see that it is a satire
of the value of literary inventure.

559
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,260
Uh, it is a Yvan Fleming
said, you know, my,

560
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,460
my James Bond is worth so
much on the Pussy Galore.

561
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,050
This woman who appears in one
of his movies had Rachel's
Lee named Pussy Galore.

562
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,320
Uh, is, uh, is, uh, is worth so
much and so forth and, and, and,

563
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:56,154
and,
and so on.

564
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,690
No.
So

565
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,180
the, uh, um, the second part was, uh,

566
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,170
was written in a hurry.
And let me,

567
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,560
let me show you in how much of a hurry
in detail by quoting one Henry Sullivan

568
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,660
who, uh, uh, in a, in a book
called a grotesque purgatory,

569
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,370
uh, writes the following, and I'm
quoting and follow this closely.

570
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,830
He says,
part two of the key hot,

571
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:29,510
they was begun in 16,
12,

572
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:36,170
seven years after her on the stocks
and well on its way by July 16,

573
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,750
13,

574
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,540
about halfway about half complete by 20.
July 16,

575
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,380
14.

576
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,870
Then continued at
breakneck speed in fall 16,

577
00:40:50,871 --> 00:40:51,704
14.

578
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,540
And finally completed by
January or February 16,

579
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,500
15,

580
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,500
a period of about two and a
half years in all unquote,

581
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,400
I will get returned to this, uh, uh,

582
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,070
by using a quote from Manuel do
wrong, but you can see the, uh,

583
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,550
how does a solid one know
this board from evidence,

584
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,420
from documents and
statements do. I said, well,

585
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,770
there's another sense of worth
about how the novel was developed.

586
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,590
You will see that part too is it's quite,
quite long.

587
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,413
No,

588
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:30,370
one of the best critics
of our millionaire does,

589
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,020
uh, the whole thing was stiffen Gilman,

590
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,700
who was for many years a
professor at Harvard. And, uh,

591
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:45,190
he, um, he, he wrote an essay
called the Apocrypha lucky hot.

592
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,090
They're very much are worth
reading, uh, uh, in which he,

593
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,630
he has, uh, a memorable phrase. Uh,

594
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,340
Gilman says that's advantage rather than
confront our DNA that when she does to

595
00:41:57,341 --> 00:41:58,174
a certain extent,

596
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,220
court prefers to encompass
him in a web of irony,

597
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:09,210
he says, said, avant this through a
net of irony, a web of irony over, uh,

598
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,050
his rival. You will see how he does
that because actually I'm a Anita.

599
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,830
His greatest triumph,
his book didn't have much success,

600
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,110
was to wind up as a character.

601
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:26,111
We think don Quixote is fiction and
having his characters incorporated into

602
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:26,561
Tulum,

603
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:31,561
keyholders fiction to add to the game
of mirrors that Quixote already was

604
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,730
in fact a critic.
Uh,

605
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,780
and with enough time in their hands,

606
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,770
critics and scholars will
almost say anything. Uh,

607
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,480
a critic claimed in fixed in in 1915 that,
uh,

608
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,950
the Apocrypha that the hotel had
been written by Cervantes himself.

609
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,210
Um, that's absurd. But, uh,

610
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:06,740
at some level, uh, it makes sense
because it's Arianna hadn't existed.

611
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,360
Cervantes would have had to invent him
in the way that he uses him in part two

612
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,313
of the Quixote.

613
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,530
Now if you want to read
the most outlandish, uh,

614
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,510
take on all this,

615
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:25,511
you must read a story by the
Argentine master Jorge Luis Borges,

616
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,230
who wrote a story called Pierre Menard,

617
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,750
author of the Quixote
in which, uh, a French,

618
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,720
uh,
poet minors color and so forth,

619
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,090
decides to write the Quixote again,
but not a different Quixote,

620
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:45,130
but the same key hot they word for
word as sort of aunties had written it.

621
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,940
A,
it is a,

622
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:51,941
is a dizzying theoretical meditation on
all of these Games of authorship that

623
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:58,001
Cervantes initiates himself in part one
of the Quixote and continues in part two

624
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,440
in a sense,
the appearance of our [inaudible].

625
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:08,000
It's like a self fulfilling prophecy.
If there was a CD, I met a bidding,

626
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:08,834
Haley,

627
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,260
who was supposed to have been the real
author of the Quixote and is of course,

628
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:13,370
a fictional author.

629
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,670
Suddenly Cervantes finds himself with
a real false author of the Quixote.

630
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:25,540
So this is what the other
[inaudible] book adds to the Quixote.

631
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,750
Now, the [inaudible] book,
uh, is tremendously boring.

632
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,220
Uh, it is conceived within
scholastic philosophy. Uh,

633
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,550
the characters instead
of engaging in dialogue,

634
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:45,770
have long monologues
that are, uh, really, uh,

635
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,010
obnoxious, uh, uh, Don Quixote
is not in love with. We'll see.

636
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:52,060
There he is the,
uh,

637
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,760
the loving night sanctuary
is a bit pornographic.

638
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,900
Uh, and, uh, uh, it is,
uh, in fact, uh, uh,

639
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:06,810
a very dull a book that only those of us
who are a set of and testers and cannot

640
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,770
avoid doing. So, uh, read, um,

641
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,250
so, so much about our
[inaudible]. Uh, and now,

642
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,420
uh, let's move on to part
two. Uh, you have a treat,

643
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,340
uh, in store it because in my view, part
two is better than part one if that,

644
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,070
if that is possible, although scholars
argue back and forth about this. But I,

645
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:32,730
I think that there is no,
no question.

646
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:37,731
Part two is a superior a book and is even
much more complicated and complicated

647
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:44,060
by the fact that characters in part to
have read part one adding to the game of

648
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:46,734
mirrors.

649
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,750
And you will find this in the
very early chapters of part two.

650
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,890
I'm going to read you now a few quotes
again from Durang's set Avantis the uh,

651
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,550
because they serve as a good uh,

652
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,600
uh, introduction, uh,

653
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,760
to part two because it is
kind of a synthesis of,

654
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,900
of what [inaudible] thinks or thought
about the Quixote at this point.

655
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,710
And you have some general ideas
before embarking on reading the uh,

656
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,810
part two of the hotel.
These are quotes,

657
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:29,811
he says the art of dialogue in Servantez
reaches its peak in the second half of

658
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:35,040
his novel. It is true. Second part,

659
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:38,670
there is much more dialogue and not
just between sanctuary. Don Quixote,

660
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:43,020
those dialogues. And we enjoy so much
and they're more here, but among many,

661
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,910
uh, different characters with
different points of view, different,

662
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,860
different ways of speaking
and, and, and so forth. Again,

663
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:53,360
drunk.

664
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,200
It is also in the second part when the
interaction of the two main characters,

665
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,320
the night and his choir reaches a climax,

666
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,290
central Pansa becomes increasingly quick.

667
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:09,291
So ticed and even a certain moments
occupies the center of the stage.

668
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,230
Having become temporarily
the novels center character,

669
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,830
there is an impressive trick.
It is not done with mirrors.

670
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:21,180
It is achieved through dialogue on quote,
and this is true.

671
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:26,720
You will see that sanctuary in various
chapters that I'm not going to anticipate

672
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:31,600
and ruin for you becomes the
protagonist of the novel. Uh,

673
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:35,500
and there is a back and forth between,
uh, Don Quixote and sanctuary.

674
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,280
Okay.

675
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,410
Again,
[inaudible] human memory,

676
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,440
the memory of the squire and his
master ruminates upon the past,

677
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,210
nothing that occurs in their
travels is entirely finished.

678
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,860
They will talk about what has happened
to them and try to find a meaning to

679
00:47:54,861 --> 00:47:58,160
every obscure detail
etched in their memory.

680
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,730
Every possibility the future holds open
will influence their present attitudes

681
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,181
since the past.

682
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:10,181
Keep on echoing upon the present and the
future keeps on working its magic upon

683
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:11,810
the minds of the two characters.

684
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:17,140
Each moment of the present is made richer
and more subtle by the interplay of

685
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:18,284
past,

686
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:23,330
present and future of quote to this,

687
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:29,290
I might add that the presence
of part one as a memory,

688
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,330
uh, is, uh,

689
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:36,250
an important one in part two and uh,

690
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,480
a device, uh, of part two, uh,

691
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,550
is that many episodes are in some way
a rewriting of episodes of part one and

692
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,640
rewriting that is usually much
more complicated and elaborate.

693
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:57,641
But you can see the kernel of the episode
from part one in the episode in part

694
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,970
two. This has to do this,
this racist of course,

695
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:06,140
philosophical issues about
memory and about, uh,

696
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,060
about the repetition of the past and all
of that that we will be talking about

697
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,950
when we reached those episodes.

698
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,420
Okay.

699
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,500
The interaction between the individual
and his environment is shown to be unique.

700
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:24,530
It escapes logic and language because
logic and language are systems of labels

701
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:27,780
super imposed upon our experience.

702
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,550
And Cervantes wants to free us from
all labels by showing how much each

703
00:49:32,551 --> 00:49:37,551
individual is capable of interpreting
his own facet of a multifaceted reality.

704
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,890
Yeah. The, the, the, the,

705
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:43,350
the presence of reality
in its multifaceted ways.

706
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:47,940
And there were even interpreting becomes
much more complicated in part too

707
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,930
because this guy says proliferate and uh,
uh,

708
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,530
a lot more of the action takes place,

709
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,350
not in the open air but indoors where,
uh,

710
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,830
where, uh, charades can be
organized and, and, and so forth.

711
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,553
Yeah.

712
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,940
Now the following quote, which is, uh, uh,

713
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:16,000
a little long but takes us back to the
composition of part two and I think

714
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:19,720
we'll, I hope round out your cause, your,

715
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:22,990
your knowledge of it as you,
as you, uh, approach, uh,

716
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,740
reading it [inaudible] goes,

717
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,730
the sense of unreality is
heightened throughout part two.

718
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,120
When Don Quixote on Santo
have to face their doubles,

719
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,370
their reflection in the mirror,

720
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,720
they meet people who have read part
one or five or have heard about it.

721
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,730
They have to react to what this readers
of their previous adventures think about

722
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:44,330
them.

723
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:49,330
Even worse after chapter 36 we just
wouldn't say Advantis finds out about the

724
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,500
existence of Avaya Neda's book after
chapter 36 they have to fight off another

725
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:58,370
image of themselves.

726
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:03,140
The Bogles image in the crooked mirror
of Avaya Neda's fake second part,

727
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,290
the false Kihatha doors.

728
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:10,340
The end of 1614 Cervantes was
working is what we went over,

729
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:13,100
but now I'm going to repeat
it in a different key.

730
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:17,240
Cervantes was working on
chapter 36 [inaudible] second
part are we gonna do this

731
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:20,270
book appeared in October of the same year.

732
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,710
Cervantes reacted by writing
38 chapters in seven months,

733
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,260
uh,
strenuous effort,

734
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,760
which may have exhausted what
was left over precarious health.

735
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,310
This bureau,

736
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:38,210
second part was the work of an unknown
author of a young Nigga is obviously a

737
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,770
pseudonym, is a pen name. We
don't know who really have a,

738
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,390
I was boats Advantis hard.

739
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:49,391
One reputation was in danger until he
could refute the piracy by issuing his own

740
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:51,134
part too.

741
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,760
He was also indignant at the lack of
intelligence and sensitivity of his

742
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:59,930
imitator. He wasn't even a bad imitator.
If he had been a good imitator,

743
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:01,130
he may have been flattered.

744
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,700
He's anger is expressed
through his main characters.

745
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,330
Don Quixote on Santo have
to face your ugly ghosts.

746
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,080
They must convince the readers of Ypn,

747
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:19,100
NATO's book that day are real characters
are intruders trying to usurp their

748
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:24,230
personality, their selves, their reality.

749
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,220
It is a situation only Cervantes
or Pirandello could have device.

750
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:33,100
The illusion here is doing when she
Pirandello a great Italian play,

751
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:37,880
right of the 20th century who wrote
a famous play calls six characters in

752
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:42,540
search. Oh offer. So this,

753
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:47,970
this Cervantes characters
are the other characters,

754
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,870
Blair reality or functionality in a way,

755
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:54,300
having read part one yourselves,

756
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,380
you are like some of the characters in
part two of the hotel and you are in the

757
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:05,280
very, in a very similar situation
as you go through that second part.

758
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,050
Okay,
we'll leave it there.
