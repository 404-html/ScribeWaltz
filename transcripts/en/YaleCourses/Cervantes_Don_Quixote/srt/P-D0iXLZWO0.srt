1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,070
So this is, um, the Corsen Cervantes, uh,

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,190
Don Quixote. Uh, I am Roberto Gonzalez,

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,310
each area,
uh,

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,260
from comparative literature
and the Spanish Department. Uh,

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,070
normally in Spanish.
We go by the first of the two last names.

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:28,071
So even though my email is
robotical dot Echeverria uh,

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,150
I am normally known if at all, uh, uh,

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,000
Gonzales, officer Gonzalez,
[inaudible], professor [inaudible],

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,780
uh, just for your, uh,
general, uh, information, uh,

10
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:46,860
you will be getting tidbits about
Spanish culture such as the one I've just

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,860
given you throughout, uh, the course,

12
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:54,690
even if this is not a culture
class or a language class,

13
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:58,110
but, uh, it is important
to, for you to know them.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,400
You will also be getting a good
deal about Spanish, uh, history,

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,630
uh, both, uh,

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,670
in the lectures and in the assigned
readings and of course through the reading

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,090
of the, uh, of the Quixote. Uh,

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,970
you will also of course have
to learn a few titles in,

19
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:21,150
in Spanish works of Spanish literature
that I will be mentioning, uh,

20
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:24,460
and a and that you, uh, will, uh, uh,

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,620
learn in the course of the,
uh, uh, of the semester. Uh,

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,370
but that is to be expected,
I guess.

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,670
So in this course we are going to read
together one of the on question master

24
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:39,960
pieces of world literature,

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,830
let alone the western Canon as defined
by my friend Harold Bloom in his popular,

26
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,790
uh,
book,

27
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,150
the western Canada where it appears,
uh,

28
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,120
at the very top of the
list paired with a hamlet.

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,680
The hot day is a book that
will affect your lives,

30
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,940
not just your understanding
and enjoyment of literature.

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,480
I can anticipate that,
um,

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,600
Vicky Hall is the first modern novel.

33
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,190
I'd be talking a lot about the novel
modern novel and it'll become clear as we

34
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:28,830
move along because there are a,
there is a confusion,

35
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,200
uh,

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,720
and novel in which according to
Gabrielle Garcia Marquez the Nobel Prize,

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,830
a Columbian novelist,
uh,

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,260
and novel where there is
already everything that
Novelis would attempt to do in

39
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,190
the future.
Until today,

40
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,720
young Sigmund Freud formed a set
of Advantis club with his friends.

41
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,100
And the Quixote was Jorge.
Luis Borges has is obsession,

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,160
bought his ass. You may
know was the great, uh,

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,230
Argentine writer,
famous Yan,

44
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,030
what?
Uh,

45
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,440
the late British scholar
considered a donkey.

46
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:19,441
Haut they one of four myths
of a modern individualism,

47
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,620
you call them.
Uh,

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,710
the other been Faust don't
Huang and Robinson Crusoe
in words by good to digital

49
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,820
that Molina and Daniel Defoe.
Uh,

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,660
but this is not the most important
thing about, uh, about the book. Uh,

51
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,820
the Hartej has and has continued to be
read by millions of readers in every

52
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:51,691
imaginable language and we
will be asking ourselves why,

53
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,150
what is it that this book has
that is so meaningful to so many?

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,300
I myself have a, uh, answered
the question in this fashion,

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,330
in the introduction to the
penguin classics edition that you,

56
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,570
we will be using in this course.

57
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,280
The penguin classics translation
by [inaudible] Rada Rather Ford.

58
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,520
I say they're in that introduction.

59
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,610
The following Miguel disadvantage subway,

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,620
the subway that's a masterpiece has
endured because it focuses on literatures

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,840
for most appeal to become another,

62
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,290
to leave at typically embattled self
for another closer to one's desires and

63
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,210
aspirations.

64
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,540
This is why I don't be haughty has
often been read as a children's book and

65
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:49,780
continues to be read by or two children.

66
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,090
Experience and lives,

67
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,980
blows teachers our limits and erode
the hope of living up to our dreams.

68
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,520
But our hope never vanishes.

69
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,580
It is the sows pith the flickering
light of being the spiritual,

70
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,570
the spiritual counterpart
to our DNAs master code.

71
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,090
When they hero regains his
sanity at the end of part two,

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,480
he dies as the last chances of
living an imaginary life disappear.

73
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,290
So most life itself,
Don Quixote's,

74
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,370
serene passing reflects
this understanding.

75
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,720
He knows that the dream of life is over.
And I said,

76
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,460
neoplatonist and Christian,

77
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:41,461
his only hope now is to find
the true life after death.

78
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,060
So much for my own cook, sorry, uh,

79
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,650
for you reading the Quixote will be,
uh,

80
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,510
an event that you will always remember.

81
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,860
And uh, Don Quixote on
Saint Joe, his squire, uh,

82
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,390
will become lifelong friends, uh,
about whom you would think often.

83
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,180
I can predict that safely.
I think. So what is the Hopi

84
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,450
and novel you will say?
Well, first of all to hot,

85
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,000
if it is a novel,

86
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,780
is to Nols one published in
1605 and the other in 1615

87
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,750
yeah.

88
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,330
To gather,
they are known as the key,

89
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,810
much more about the title in a minute.

90
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,650
And knowledgeable people refer to them
as part one and part two or the 1605

91
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:48,090
Quixote and the 1615 Quixote.
So the first thing to learn,

92
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,130
and I like first things because I like
to build on them from the ground up,

93
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,550
is that the Quixote consists of two
parts originally published separately,

94
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,060
10 years apart,
10 years apart.

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,560
But what Cervantes wrote low considered
the first modern novel was not an oval

96
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:15,120
as we as we know them today,
because novels did not exist as such.

97
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Yet novels developed in
the wake of the Jihad.

98
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,140
So Cervantes could not have
set out to write a novel

99
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,320
in his time

100
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,180
than Toronto's his time.
There were [inaudible] Valerie Romances,

101
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,070
stories about night errands,

102
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:40,071
a lot more about that in the very near
future pastoral Rollbahn sis stories.

103
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,620
How about fake shepherds?

104
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,390
Picaresque lives,
uh,

105
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,470
what we call today
confusedly picaresque novels.

106
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,880
And brief Novell lay or new vendor that
is long short stories of which Advantis

107
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,780
wrote quite a few on and very good ones.

108
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:07,781
And we will read some here in this course
to the modern novel would evolve from

109
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,430
translations and imitations
of the [inaudible],

110
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,880
particularly in France and England and
would attain its current form in the 18th

111
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,413
century.

112
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,360
I am very much a historian and I
would like to for you to have a clear,

113
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,630
uh, historical, chronological, uh,

114
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,130
idea of the development of the novel
and of surrenders his own career.

115
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,300
So, uh, take note of this,
uh, chronological, uh,

116
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,270
clarifications that I give you
now.

117
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,790
What may you know about the chaotic,

118
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,600
many of you I suppose come to this course
and intrigued by the name of an author

119
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,410
and the title of a book that
you might have heard about,

120
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,270
but not like most classes,
classics,

121
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,090
not many have actually read in
its entirety, much less studied,

122
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,340
uh, us with both classics. Do you
have probably heard so much about,

123
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,310
uh, the key halted that it
feels as if you had read it?

124
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,710
Many have heard the songs
from man of La Mancha,

125
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,010
the impossible dream, the
impossible dream and so forth. Uh,

126
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,110
perhaps you haven't even seen the
show is quite a good show by the way.

127
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,800
I don't look down upon it. It
is a version of the Quixote, uh,

128
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,960
in an American, uh, mode. Very,
very much an American mode,

129
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,290
but a very good one.
Uh, so many of you have,

130
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,610
I've seen man of La Mancha
have heard the songs. Uh,

131
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,430
uh, maybe you have even read a comic
book based on the, uh, on the novel.

132
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:55,020
They are coming books based
on, on, on, on an oval. Uh,

133
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,870
others may have read it in a, in a,
in a high school class, parts of it.

134
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:05,220
Some of you may have read it in
a course like directed studies,

135
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,440
uh, in conjunction with other
western classics such as the Odyssey,

136
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,150
the need and the divine comedy.
Uh, whatever the case may be.

137
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:19,830
Most of your probably
puzzled by the, uh, uh,

138
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,860
spelling and pronunciation
of the protagonist's name
and the title of the book.

139
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,110
Let me clarify those.

140
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,110
US At modest beginning the first step,

141
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,590
having been to tell you that they
can help these two novels. Now,

142
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:38,070
the second step is to tell you about that.

143
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,770
The name of the protagonist
on how to pronounce it,

144
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:44,040
on how we pronounce it in Spanish
and how it's spelled and Hawaii,

145
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,990
the way to pronounce it in modern
Spanish is Quixote d hall day,

146
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,810
no gliding of the, Oh, not
Quixote, Quixote in Spanish.

147
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,180
We don't glide the vows.
They are short and crisp.

148
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,470
Why then that vixen x in English.

149
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,750
The reason is that when the book was
written in the last years of the 16th

150
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:17,751
century and the first of the 17th the
sound of theJ in Spanish was still in the

151
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:24,321
process of moving from the show sound
that it had thanks to the influence of

152
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,020
Arabic and we'll worry about that later.
Moving towards the aspirated

153
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,280
of more in Spanish.
That ash,

154
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,350
that sound was then written with an x
in this still to be codified spelling of

155
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:47,250
the language more than European spending
of modern European languages was not

156
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:51,840
qualified until the 18th century.
Uh,

157
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,880
for instance,
the word for soap in Spanish,

158
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:59,710
many of you who know some
Spanish note how boom, uh,

159
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,960
what's written then with an x,
and it was pronounced Chavon

160
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,940
Mexico was pronounced mushy,

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,510
Goh and up,
and it was spelled with an x.

162
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,590
That x that is still retains though in
Spanish it is pronounced may Hiko never

163
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,410
Mexico.
Hence the,

164
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,760
the English seeing an x in the middle
of the title of their fantasies book.

165
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,810
The book was translated very early
into English or Irish in 1605,

166
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,170
the first translation appeared
in 16, 11. That's six years.

167
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,600
It's very fast in the 17th century.

168
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,530
So the English team that
acts mispronounced it quick
salt with a sound that it

169
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,310
never had in Spanish.

170
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,360
That is why you have the x in English
and the mispronunciation quick salt.

171
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,550
You follow the history.
Now the French,

172
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,120
meanwhile hearing that
she rendered it Keyshot,

173
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,190
which is still the way they mispronounced
it, the French call it don't keyshot.

174
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,510
I will always say here he halted and
hope that you will learn to do the same

175
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,160
from now on the risk of
sounding a little snobbish,

176
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,460
uh, uh, two English speakers.

177
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,310
But Yalies can sound snobbish if you,

178
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,693
um,

179
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,870
so now a few more basic,

180
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:41,980
very basic facts about
the title of the book.

181
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,630
The title of a book or a painting is
like the first interpretation by its

182
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:53,910
author. It is a sort of what we
would call in literary criticism,

183
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,260
a metal text,
the text above the text.

184
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,070
Sometimes though titles can be misleading,

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,930
but they're always interesting
and should be examined carefully.

186
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Making sure that you gain access to
the full title of the first edition,

187
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,400
not one that has been tampered with by
editors or the reading public later.

188
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,600
Uh, for instance, the,
the Pickwick papers,

189
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:27,320
the novel by Dickens was really called
the posthumous papers of the Pickwick

190
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,840
club. And it is interesting
why it is called. So,

191
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,140
um, now be careful also with
the translations of titles.

192
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:41,650
I will tell you later about some of
the key hotels because translations of

193
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:46,651
titles sometimes are very
misleading novel by Aleppo.

194
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,730
Uh,
tarpon ta call and seagull.

195
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:54,350
The last was translated as
explosion in the cathedral,

196
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,090
Wha Wha why?
Uh,

197
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,600
because the editors thought that the
age of enlightenment would sound like a

198
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,290
title of a textbook or something.
So that's the way that they translated it.

199
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:10,220
So you don't have to be very careful if
you're going to really read something

200
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:14,870
carefully about the title. So
you go to the real title. Now,

201
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,470
the full,
the full title

202
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,200
of the first part of Don Quixote,
remember published in 1605.

203
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to engrave that date on your mind
is as follows,

204
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,390
[inaudible] don Quixote,
the line manager.

205
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,170
You know that the youth
was rendered as a, uh, uh,

206
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,590
uh, uh, uh, perform the Latin.

207
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,580
So in Henry also Evalgo
Don Quixote Dela mantra.

208
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:51,180
This is a reproduction of the
actual title page of the first key.

209
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,080
You are seeing it.
Okay.

210
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,740
We are fortunate enough to have a copy
of that first edition at Beinecke library

211
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,650
here at Yale. Um, what do you do?

212
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,710
Okay. All right. So, uh,

213
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,880
let us go over those words one by one.

214
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,230
I can assure you we're not going
to go over every word in the book,

215
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,480
one by one as I'm wanting
to do with the title,

216
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,310
or it would take the rest of our lives
to finish reaching the Chiota together.

217
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,880
So in Henny also does not mean here what
exactly what it means today in Spanish.

218
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,700
You know,
uh,

219
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,970
in Henry also means today
something like a cute, witty,

220
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,360
cute or inventive in 16,

221
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,130
11,
covarruvias rights.

222
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,810
Now it's a name that you're going to
be hearing throughout the semester,

223
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,160
and I'm going to put her on the board
just the last name because it's very

224
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:02,994
important.

225
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,760
Okay.
He's name was save young,

226
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,250
the Covarrubias your Roscoe.

227
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,120
Uh, he was, uh,

228
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,140
a lexicographer who published in 1611.

229
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:28,950
The first dictionary of
the Spanish language,

230
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,660
the first dictionary of the Spanish
language called Tesoro. The Lingua cast,

231
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,000
the Yana or Hispaniola,

232
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,410
the sorrows of the Castilian
or Spanish a language.

233
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,140
It's very convenient that go on.
Ruby published that dictionary in 16,

234
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:51,060
11. Right in between the, uh, the,
the two parts of the Kihatha 16,

235
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:55,260
oh five, 16, 15, the dictionary
comes in 16 hours, 1611.

236
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,190
So Covarrubias gives us
instead of anthis Spanish.

237
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,170
So this is why it is, uh, so, uh, such
an important book for the reading of,

238
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,400
of, of, of, of is a don Quixote. Uh,

239
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:12,660
the title itself is interesting because
it shows that Castilian and Spanish,

240
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:16,220
I wanted the same thing. I'll
talk about that a little. Uh, uh,

241
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,440
more later he writes about in Henio we
commonly call in Kenya a natural force of

242
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:30,081
the mind that inquires that which through
reason and intelligence can be found

243
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,570
through all sorts of sciences,
disciplines,

244
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,560
liberal and mechanical arts
suddenly inventions and deceit.

245
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,720
Hence we call it,
we call it engineer in [inaudible].

246
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,780
He who builds machines to fight off the
enemy and to attack him in Henry also is

247
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,290
he who has a subtle and sharp wit.

248
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,980
So in Henry also in the title of a donkey,

249
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:02,981
halt of the Quixote means
heightened kind of what,

250
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,040
or understanding one
that verges on madness.

251
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,410
Recalling what Plato said
in the Republic about ports,

252
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,420
sports being slightly bad in a few years
before the publication of donkey Hartej

253
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,483
of the Quixote,
Eh,

254
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,540
in the year 1575 within
Cervantes is lifetime one,

255
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,830
one day,
not one corn out this one,

256
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,370
uh, so many ones here, but
one worked, they sung quant.

257
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:37,020
You don't have to remember
this name so much.

258
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,540
And medical doctor publish a very
important book called examine Dane Henio

259
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:48,210
Spatola CNCS and of a very
long title. Uh, it's uh,

260
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,070
uh, which examined would be the
translation of that, uh, uh,

261
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,790
of that title, uh, uh, in,

262
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,730
in which he studies
different kinds of madness.

263
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,650
So examine the enhanced yours
meant for what they, the sound one,

264
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,000
uh,

265
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
an examination of various kinds of madness
of the kinder that covarrubias have

266
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,260
mentioned. So this is to
give you the, the, the, the,

267
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:17,740
the context of the word in Henry,

268
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:22,350
also in the title and in Henry also
Evalgo lengthy hotel, a mantra.

269
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,840
Now you got to go,
it's a contraction of e hall,

270
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:32,790
the Al Gore, which in Spanish means
song of something. But of course,

271
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,340
we are all sons or daughters of something.

272
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,350
But what that meant was you are the
son of someone of some distinction,

273
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,330
uh, uh, a worth the lineage. Uh, and uh,

274
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,350
uh,

275
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,350
Covarrubias says it means the same as
noble with an ancient pure lineage.

276
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,120
That in other words, fewer
of cast of origin, of ilk,

277
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,510
of tradition,

278
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,400
and he dialed go as you
will discover reading.

279
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:07,090
The first chapter of the
book is a petty nobleman,

280
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,110
someone belonging to the lower
and the ability or aristocracy.

281
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,460
It is important here to note that said,

282
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,610
this does not call donkey Horta
here it Caballero at night.

283
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,030
The novel is that the most basic level,

284
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,120
the story of a petty nobleman who becomes
by dint of his own self invention and

285
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:36,871
night worthy of using the dome
that is given in the title in 1615.

286
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,780
However,
in the second part of the cohort,

287
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:48,700
and we will look at that title
page when we come to it, uh, the,

288
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:53,210
uh, don't get holidays
called the Caballero, um,

289
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,510
for a variety of reasons that I will
explain, uh, at the proper time.

290
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,040
Now, Don don is a form
of address like Sir Sire,

291
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,440
that not everyone had a right to
do expect though Kihatha did not,

292
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,070
or alone Suki handle the
man who became Gnocchi Hall,

293
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,710
not by virtue of his
modest station in life,

294
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,750
but he takes on the dome as
part of this self invention.

295
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,140
You Dad, it goes, in other words,
did not have the right to the dome.

296
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,420
Dome of course, derives from
the Latin. Domino's. Uh, sir,

297
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,360
Lord Master, uh, your readings in Elliot,

298
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,800
the, his, the imperial Spain,

299
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,970
one of the books for the
course will give you further,

300
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,980
much further background on this.

301
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,210
Now key hot day as you will learn reading
the first chapters of the book too is

302
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:54,511
said to be a derivation
of Kihara jaw or cassava,

303
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:58,480
something having to do
with cheese or Kay Hannah,

304
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,830
something having to do with complaint.
Uh,

305
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,060
[inaudible] or key Hannah could be
it. He said that is the last name. Uh,

306
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,960
one of them, he Hanoi is the
last name of alone. Suki hell,

307
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,560
the man who becomes Don Quixote,
uh,

308
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,050
the doll go who turns himself
into and Quixote, uh, uh,

309
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,330
these names,
uh,

310
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,440
echo those words mentioned before he
[inaudible] the salar and so forth.

311
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,810
They are not very high
sounding or ennobling words.

312
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:36,440
Quite the contrary. I hope no one
here has the last name. Kiana Organa.

313
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,570
It happened to me in one of these
classes as I was explaining this,

314
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,980
that a Hispanic young
woman in the class, uh, uh,

315
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,010
how the last name Kianna and
I had to profusely apologize,

316
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,830
but I'm just trying to explain
the title of the novel,

317
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,210
but I am hoping that none of
you is. Last name is Gal. Uh,

318
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,610
now the ending OT OTE,

319
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,800
suffix is a suffix that in Spanish always
refers to something based or grotesque

320
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,640
and sounds, it go from
Gordon Lewis, [inaudible]

321
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,670
granddaughter from ground.
There is a hulking big guy.

322
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:24,671
A Luxe felty from fail is an ugly cuss.

323
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,930
So kihatha then was meant to
sound a basing and ridiculous,

324
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,670
particularly when pair with dumb,
uh,

325
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,140
with which it forms are kind of
oxymoronic pair. Don't be haughty.

326
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,060
Dongs high son. Nicky hope
this has all of this, uh, uh,

327
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,270
negative connotations.
It also has echoes of [inaudible],

328
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,480
one of the night errands that, uh, uh,

329
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,990
Don Quixote reads about.

330
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,430
And it has also been discovered
that it is the name of, uh,

331
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,420
uh,
of a part of the armor covering the leg.

332
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,370
But the important, uh, uh,
background is what I gave, uh, uh,

333
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,263
before.

334
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,580
Now Mine Cha Logmein Chai is a region
in central Spain in because still that

335
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:18,380
encompasses parts of the provinces of
Toledo's, you Cuenca and Alba city.

336
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,280
There are maps of Spain in the website.

337
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,160
Uh, and geography is very
important in that Quixote,

338
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,000
particularly in part two.

339
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,920
This is a novel that is very
rooted in a given geography.

340
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,150
Now, Lamont change flag,
iris and monotonous.

341
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,960
It's main product used
to be serious and wine.

342
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,220
But the important thing
here is that it is not,

343
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,590
or it was not until surrenders his work,

344
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,640
a particularly desirable place to be from

345
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,210
a Manchild, some in stain in Spanish. Uh,

346
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,870
it all sounds like a put down being
from La Manchuria was like being from

347
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,500
Bridgeport or buffalo

348
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,440
or Brooklyn or podunk.
Uh,

349
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,933
uh,

350
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,330
now of course this assault
changed with the book and,

351
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:25,620
uh, now, uh,

352
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,420
the name has and the region has a
poetic air and their theme parks in your

353
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:35,090
mantra with windmills and all in
Spain, you know, uh, of course.

354
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,640
Uh, but, uh, that was,

355
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,950
that was not what's the rent is
intended when he had no, you know,

356
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,860
they be from La Manchuria.
Uh, it was to be, uh, uh,

357
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,930
in contrast to other nights who
came from more distinguished places.

358
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:55,990
I am at least of,
I'm at least the gala from Wales or pal.

359
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,890
They Inglot Tara from England
and then don't go the,

360
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,010
you see, this is what it's
supposed to be meant by the title.

361
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:08,550
You wouldn't have suspected this if I
hadn't told you because you're still under

362
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:13,290
the influence of man of La Mancha.
Now

363
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,910
the issue of Loki hotters spurious dumb
is significant in broader historian,

364
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:24,090
a broader historical sense.
By the 16th century,

365
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:27,030
the glory days of the
nobility were long gone.

366
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,860
Noble men were no longer much engaged
in the military except that the highest

367
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:36,861
ranks and never seeing actual combat
wars were fought by professional armies.

368
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,540
There was little chance for the nobility
to exercise Marshall like activities,

369
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:45,510
uh,

370
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,510
which were left now to Josh and to
hunting war became sports for the

371
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:54,450
aristocracy.
The nobility was on the whole,

372
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,480
on a downturn in Spain because of politics
policies initiated by the Catholic

373
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,240
kings,
Ferdinand and Isabella,

374
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:07,170
to curtail the power of the
accuracy of the aristocracy. Now,

375
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:11,700
certain groups at the highest level
of a cluster around the courts of the

376
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:15,270
descendants of the Catholic
kings just had a lot of power.

377
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,010
But on the whole, the nobility is
on the decline more noticeably.

378
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,990
So in La Manchuria which had a sparse
population of EDL grows as opposed to

379
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:28,380
northern regions of the peninsula.

380
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,880
So for donkey halted to
practice [inaudible] night,

381
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:37,650
Aaron tree was a way of reviving the past,
uh,

382
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,980
of reliving a past of splendor and glory.

383
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,110
Now only really available through
reading that you, Albert Romances,

384
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,890
uh, which portrayed
the Medieval world, uh,

385
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,600
when the aristocracy was truly
involved in warfare or, uh,

386
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,100
in, in sports such as hunting of which
don't get hotter, was fond of you.

387
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:02,430
As you will learn in the
early chapters of the book,

388
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,210
we will have much more on the
[inaudible] side promised in the future.

389
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,980
Now what about the language
of the key holding?

390
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:15,570
What language did a serve Vantis right?

391
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:19,830
You say in Spanish? Yes, but
we're in the 16th, 17th century.

392
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,110
Uh,
in the 16th century,

393
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:27,111
Spain Spanish was undergoing its last
significant linguistic revolution is last

394
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:31,890
significant change.
And uh,

395
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:36,420
at the time that the Quixote was written
and published Pronoun Verb Forms,

396
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,580
we're still in relative flux,

397
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,380
but Cervantes Spanish does not sound do
the modern Spanish ear as archaic and

398
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:51,090
Arcane of Shakespearean English
dose do modern English readers. Uh,

399
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,430
I have a difficult time understanding
Shakespeare on the stage.

400
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:56,560
Sometimes with my American English,

401
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,320
it does sound the Spanish have Cervantes
though sound quaint and the book's fame

402
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:05,470
gives Cervantes Spanish
today a formal sound,

403
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,920
but it did not have to its
contemporaries for whom the book was not,

404
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:14,890
of course,
still the classic if read out loud,

405
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:19,910
the Quixote is more comprehensible to
current speakers of Spanish from Spain and

406
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:25,210
Latin America than hamlet is to a
modern British or American audience.

407
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,400
But it, but what language was
it that said this used? Well,

408
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:33,250
he wrote in Castilian or Spanish,

409
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,120
which are the same as
we learn in covarrubias.

410
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,120
His title Americans have the mistaken
notion that they speak the student in

411
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:47,620
Spain and we don't know. And the
rest of Latin America, it's the same.

412
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,370
It's the same. It's the same language. Um,

413
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,680
because the alien was the language
of Casteel land of Castles.

414
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,080
Because as the conquest, we will, you
will learn what the reconquest is.

415
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:07,081
That is the reconquest of Spain from
the Moore's advanced in central Spain.

416
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,970
Uh, as the, uh,

417
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:13,810
US history conquest advanced castles
were built to secure the territory's,

418
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,130
hence Castille. Uh, and
then Castille became,

419
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:22,900
as you will read in Elliot, the, the,
uh, the, uh, the most influential region,

420
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,850
political and military above all
of the peninsula. And with the,

421
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:30,880
uh, with the unification of the
peninsula under the Catholic kings,

422
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:35,680
it tried to impose this language
on the rest of Spain. Uh,

423
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,120
so you know what the difference between
the language and the dialect is a

424
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,840
language is a dialect with an army.

425
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,460
So, uh, uh, language is, uh,

426
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,340
uh,

427
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,370
the language over a region with enough
power to impose it on other people and

428
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,870
become, uh, so, uh,

429
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,300
there are the wear and our
other languages in Spain,

430
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,700
Catalan Galician basketball engine,

431
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,470
but the Catholic kings and
their descendants in post
Castilian on the peninsula

432
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:22,390
as much as they could and on the
vast territories of the new world,

433
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,850
what is today Latin America because
of discovery and conquest were mainly

434
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,620
Castilian projects.

435
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Spanish is more uniform as a result of
these policies today than English is.

436
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,180
So what is spoken in the Bronx,

437
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,660
Mexico City and Madrid.

438
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,290
Castilian would you
Spanish is what's spoken.

439
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:54,120
He's spoken in those places.
So you can erase that, uh,

440
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,020
American prejudice from your
minds if you ever had it.

441
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,200
Uh, it is a true, I mean, I
had a colleague at Cornell,

442
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:07,610
a very distinguished American
medievalist who would ask me,

443
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:11,750
in what language do you write
your scholarship, Roberto? I said,

444
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,430
what do you mean in English and Spanish?

445
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:17,000
He was worried that if I didn't write
in English being a Latin America,

446
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,260
I didn't have a cult,

447
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:22,120
a language of culture in which I could
write because he didn't think that in

448
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:24,680
Latin America we had
a language of culture.

449
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,550
It's an American prejudice.
Well,

450
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:32,300
if Spanish was undergoing its last
transformation in the 16th century,

451
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:37,301
this was also a turbulent
sanctuary for Spain in political,

452
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,040
religious, social, and artistic terms,

453
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,280
considered that in the 16th century,

454
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,580
Spain settled the new world and beyond
the Philippines and organize a vast

455
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,240
imperial bureaucracy to rule it.

456
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Spain also control parts of Italy and
the low countries and Spain itself was

457
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:03,500
adjusting to the unification brought
about by the marriage of Ferdinand and

458
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,700
Isabella chief and could
still hear from Aragon.

459
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,300
They created the first modern
state. By the way, you will,

460
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,830
you will find in the Quixote characters
come from various regions of Spain,

461
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,700
uh,
most memorably at the very beginning,

462
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,020
a basket who speaks in broken Spanish.
Because even today,

463
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,270
there are regions in Spain,
as you know,

464
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:30,680
if you've been to Spain where Spanish
is really not the language spoken,

465
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,200
uh, Galicia and the Basque country.
And Catalonia and so forth.

466
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:41,330
Now in the religious fears, pain became
the defender of the Catholic Church,

467
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,800
which was breaking up in the rest of
Europe as the result of the reformation.

468
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:49,520
Remember the reformation
is a 16th century event.

469
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:55,270
Spain was the bastion of Orthodox
Catholicism and this affected tremendously

470
00:34:55,521 --> 00:35:00,110
it's political, social,
and literary life. In 14,

471
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:04,430
92 of the Catholic kings
expelled the Jews from Spain. Uh,

472
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,170
and that in 1613,

473
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,970
the Maurice goes the sentence of
the Arabs who were still left. And,

474
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:11,750
uh,
uh,

475
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,520
we will be speaking about that and they
will be a distinct echoes of all of

476
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:20,780
these movements and political
events in the, in the normal,

477
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,100
uh, one could say that the, the,

478
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,410
the copies and only
the first modern novel,

479
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:29,930
but the first political
novel in that it is much,

480
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,940
it reflects very clearly
political controversies of its,

481
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,430
uh, of its time. In the social domain,

482
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:42,000
there was a significant
population drain to the new world.

483
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,740
The social mobility costs by the
deliberate erosion of the aristocracy by a

484
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:51,630
crown bent on centralization and control.

485
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,610
You will find as you read the book,

486
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,050
that the characters move through
areas that are really the populated,

487
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,900
uh, and this reflects this,
this demographic reality.

488
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,803
Uh,

489
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,910
the new bureaucracy provided ways to
attain wealth and power that threaten the

490
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:16,551
status of the old and powerful
aristocratic families as
well as the traditional

491
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,060
independence of provinces.

492
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:23,370
And fifth dumps that dated back to
the Middle Ages in the literary world.

493
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,440
Spain's greatest splendor
came at this moment,

494
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,851
uh,
in the,

495
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:34,851
in the waning of the renaissance and
the emergence or are off of new modern

496
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:40,500
forms and joggers. The,
the 16th century opened,

497
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,160
uh,

498
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,140
actually just before the 16th century
in 1499 with the publication of

499
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,760
[inaudible].

500
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,940
That's a word that you should learn here.
Um,

501
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,390
1499

502
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,810
on was followed by with the emerge by
the emergency of the picaresque in La.

503
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:05,210
Sorry,

504
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:10,210
your Miss [inaudible] was the first
what we call a picaresque novels.

505
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,860
Uh,
1554.

506
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,730
And
uh,

507
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,880
they're emerge.

508
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,880
What came to be known as the Spanish
go media for the Spanish theater.

509
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,180
W there were not all comedies, but
it would call the compendia. And, uh,

510
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,320
these were written by a low pay,

511
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:45,321
the Vega and name that you might want
to keep in mind because he was a very

512
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:49,310
prolific writer who was
also Cervantes rivals.

513
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,320
Okay.

514
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,650
He may have written 700 place.

515
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,970
How many of this change we were
right there. You Sonia Lopez,

516
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,980
right dose in a month. It's amazing.
Uh, he was an amazing writer,

517
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:11,510
a very powerful and a Cervantes,

518
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,190
had a very tense
relationship, uh, with him,

519
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,670
um, import to the 16th
century, so in Garcia,

520
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,230
so that Rebecca, and then you
will see in the book many times,

521
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,630
and it's many followers.

522
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,160
The late great blossoming of the
Petrarchan tradition, you know, pay truck,

523
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,810
uh, and the development,
uh, from the Petrarchan,

524
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,350
the powerful strain of mystical poetry,

525
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,740
particularly in diverse of
Saint John of the cross.

526
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,670
Um,
so this,

527
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:49,990
the 16th and 17th centuries are what are
called in Spanish literary history as

528
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:54,040
the Golden Age.
It was also the Golden Age in painting.

529
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,750
If you have been to the Prado Museum
in Madrid, you will see what I mean.

530
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,160
We wouldn't be talking a great deal
about, uh, Spanish painting here,

531
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:05,170
particularly about Velasquez.

532
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,930
Now the hour,

533
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,930
a little philological excursion about
the title of the book already reveals a

534
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:18,790
number of things about the hotel and
about Spain. You may wonder Arabic,

535
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,990
what about what the Arabs
have to do with Spain? Well,

536
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,950
the Arabs occupied Spain for
eight centuries from seven 11.

537
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:32,380
These are good dates to remember
to 1492 when Granada fell.

538
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,980
And that was the last bastion of Arab,
uh,

539
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,990
power in Spain. And it was taken by the
Catholic Kings Verdun and, and Isabella.

540
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,980
And,
but the ire of left and intelligent,

541
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,040
an indelible mark upon Spanish
history and the Spanish language.

542
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,630
It was not an occupation
in the sense that we,

543
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,130
in addition occupations in
the modern period, uh, uh,

544
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,320
historians speak of a Combi Valencia that
is a living together of this Christian

545
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,100
and Muslim cultures which
involve fighting with each other,

546
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:08,620
but fighting amongst Christians.

547
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,760
And the Muslims are allied with Christians
are going to let Muslims and so forth,

548
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,590
but they were there for eight centuries.

549
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,130
And what could say that
the Arabic component in the
broadest sense is the main

550
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,530
difference between Spain
and the rest of Europe.

551
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,600
The title of the book already alludes
to that difference because of that x,

552
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,800
but you will see it in many
other ways as you read it.

553
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,540
Um, now you can also glean
from what I have said,

554
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:42,430
that the Kihatha was translated very
early into other European languages,

555
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,780
which is, uh, uh, who just
already, uh, mention, uh,

556
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,130
1611 for the,

557
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,870
for the English and it went on to
be translated in France. Uh, and,

558
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,340
and so forth.
Uh,

559
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,080
that Quixote became very rapidly that
first edition and 1605 and a European

560
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:03,940
bestseller, uh, turning Cervantes
who was, as you will read. And you,

561
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:08,020
when you read from the, the assigned
readings in the case book, uh,

562
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,750
a minor figure, it suddenly
into a great success. Uh,

563
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,620
it never brought him the financial
rewards that he desperately needed,

564
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:21,550
but it turned into a, into a success. Um,

565
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,620
they say that at the beginning,

566
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,320
in the early years that the hotel was
bread almost universally as a funny book.

567
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,550
It's obviously a misreading. It is
much more than just a funny book. Now,

568
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,350
let us turn now in the, in
this, uh, uh, introduction,

569
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,900
uh,
to the basics.

570
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,160
Do the title to the
protagonist's name in English.

571
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,750
Uh,
all of you,

572
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:52,070
no doubt I've read or heard the word
quixotic and surely have a general notion

573
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:53,930
or with meaning.
Uh,

574
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,580
someone who is a [inaudible] says the
Oxford English dictionary is quote,

575
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:03,100
an enthusiastic visionary person like
Don Quixote or like don't quick soap.

576
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,290
They way that they write it inspired
by lofty and chivalrous cut,

577
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,780
but also unrealizable
ideas, uh, unquote. Hence,

578
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,200
quixotic is quote to strive with
lofty enthusiasm for visionary ideas.

579
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,810
How many authors or books,
uh,

580
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,360
or characters have entered
common usage in this way?

581
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:32,350
Actions or people can be done
task Kafkaesque revelation,

582
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,430
but are any of these
as common as quixotic?

583
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:42,910
Dan Task always refers to the
inferno and conveys a sense of gloom,

584
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:50,300
a fire burning sinners and
all of that is done task.

585
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,820
CAFCA ask describes a situation in
which a labyrinth of forces appears to

586
00:42:55,821 --> 00:43:00,150
control your, your life and is
applied mostly to do rock procees.

587
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,280
Yale's bureaucracies becoming Kafkaesque.

588
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,880
I can assure you of that revelation.

589
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,170
Less common means uncontrollable
appetites. Most the time,

590
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,220
most of the time referring to gluttony,
he had a revelation dinner,

591
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,460
but you risk really sounding snobbish.

592
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,130
If you say that you had
a revelation dinner, uh,

593
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,630
even if you're a Yalie,

594
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,870
but not saying quixotic quixotic
is really part of the common usage.

595
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,950
Uh, if pressed, I bet anyone
of you could give, uh,

596
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,640
a TV guide,
abstract of the book,

597
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,320
even those who haven't read a word of it,
it would go something like this.

598
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,670
I made this up. Middle aged man believes
that he can become a knight errand.

599
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,330
Like those he has read about in chivalric
romances and takes to the road with

600
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:56,930
sanctuary. A peasant had his
choir to set the world are right.

601
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,150
Software's many defeats
but remained some bout.

602
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,400
That's the whole novel right there in
encapsulated and you can put that on a TV

603
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:08,230
guy or something. I, I have, uh, uh,

604
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:13,070
the fantasy that you can do that with
any book, no matter how complicated,

605
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,780
uh, try it, try it with the Bible,
the Odyssey or something like that.

606
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,340
But, uh, but I think
that it was a chaotic,

607
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,100
it works and that is what people have in
their imaginations about the, the, the,

608
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:27,320
the Jihad.
Now,

609
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:32,470
general knowledge of this kind is
the aura that surrounds the classics.

610
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,300
It can become a temptation
not to read them. As a result,

611
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,280
this sort of vague knowledge also has an
undeniable influence on those who read

612
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:41,400
them.

613
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
It is nearly impossible to read a classic
innocently unless you are a complete

614
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:51,090
illiterate. Um, besides, if,

615
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:55,190
if you have read, uh, in some
ways you have read Don Quixote.

616
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:59,070
If you have read the adventures
of Huckleberry Finn or
if you have read madame

617
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,650
Bovary or if you're a red,

618
00:45:00,651 --> 00:45:03,110
the cafcass metamorphosis because
the influence of the Hilton,

619
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,050
all of those works is so great that in
a sense you have read it through them.

620
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,860
Very few literary
characters have these aura.

621
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,580
I wonder hamlet of course, Faust, uh,

622
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,240
remembering what a young watts said,
king lear don't.

623
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:21,930
One Oedipus come to mind.
Uh,

624
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,720
can you think of any others
there? There, there are very few.

625
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,230
There are a few within each
literary tradition. For instance,

626
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:31,740
a huckleberry Finn in the American,
uh,

627
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,130
context [inaudible] vaginal,
but perhaps in France.

628
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,750
Why is it a don Quixote has such
currency as a kind of literary myth?

629
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:44,280
I think that there's hardly
another secular book two,

630
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:49,050
which we come with more preconceived
notions and expectations.

631
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:54,170
It is also one of the very few great
works of world literature that is also a

632
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:58,470
children's book. As I said
in the paragraph on my
introduction, I read it first.

633
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:03,210
It was read to me as a children's
book the first time that I, uh, now,

634
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,170
uh,
is it a kin to a modern in secular Bible,

635
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,890
Miguel de Una Muno,
the Spanish philosopher,

636
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,990
uh, read Don Quixote as if it
were a kind of secular Bible.

637
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:21,240
And I have the feeling that my friend
Harold Bloom does the same, uh,

638
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,690
the kind of New Gospel, the Gospel
for the modern age. Why not?

639
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,160
You have to get something out of the
cohort they relevant to your own lives,

640
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,540
I think, or you're going to be
wasting your time here. Believe me.

641
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,060
Uh, I can't tell you what that is. You'll
have to find out for yourself. But,

642
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:40,790
uh, why, uh,

643
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:46,070
why can't it suggest something relevant
to you or why has it for so many over so

644
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:52,500
many years now I gave my
explanation in my, uh, in that, uh,

645
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,290
first paragraph to my introduction
to the penguin classics.

646
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,250
But let me give you a
more detailed one now.

647
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:03,450
Whatever other more subtle and specialized
answers we give to this question

648
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,710
throughout the semester,

649
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:08,940
the only way to respond to it is to say
that Don Quixote and bodies the most

650
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:10,560
modern of predicaments,

651
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:16,550
the individuals dissatisfaction with
the world in which he lives and his

652
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:19,560
struggle to make the
world and his desire mesh.

653
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,620
I mean this world,

654
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,740
not our world yet to
come a promised heaven.

655
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,890
Why is this a modern
predicament or crisis?

656
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,970
Because the world is no longer a given.

657
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,060
By the time Cervantes writes the
western conception of the universe,

658
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,170
uh, which was, uh, up to
about the 16th century,

659
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:47,410
largely based on a combination
of Aristotle and the Bible.

660
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,150
That is to say scholasticism and the
work of Aquinas has been proven faulty.

661
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,610
Think of one major change.

662
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,910
The first part of the Kihatha
is published in 16 or five,

663
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,750
barely over a hundred years
after the discovery of America,

664
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,030
the 113 to be exact.

665
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:07,510
And the confirmation
that the world is round,

666
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,460
which proved beyond argument or doubt
that much of the legacy of the ancient

667
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:15,250
world and the Middle Ages
was open to question.

668
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,370
Think of a second major change.

669
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,640
The reformation has challenged the
authority of the Catholic Church and made

670
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:27,960
political gains in many important
European nations don't key hot.

671
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:31,300
This is not a struggle between
the individual and the gods.

672
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,530
They fight against cosmic abstract
forces us in Greek tragedy.

673
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,240
It is not as in Dante human desire
transformed into the yearning for us,

674
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:44,770
a blind trust and dental vision casting
a universe of perfect coherence,

675
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:45,940
the machine of the world.

676
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:51,060
It is instead the struggle
of an individual against
the tractability of a world

677
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,050
in which he lives the world
redolent with imperfections of the,

678
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:01,260
with the imperfections of the material
coding the temporal flow that carries it

679
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:04,530
further and further away from ideas.

680
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,430
Does that seem to be two to exist
only in the individual's mind?

681
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,080
Uh,
as hamlet says,

682
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:14,980
the world is out of sorts and
I'm here to make it right.

683
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,210
This is what a Don Quixote,
uh,

684
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,830
says the novel says George Loukakis,

685
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,860
the Great Hungarian critic is the epic
of a world that has been abandoned by

686
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:30,490
God, that novels, heroes,
psychology is demonic.

687
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,740
The objectivity of the novel is the
mature man's knowledge that meaning can

688
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:37,900
never quite penetrate reality,

689
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,910
but that we thought meaning reality
would disintegrate into the inessential

690
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:46,300
into, into the nothingness
of innocence. Reality.

691
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:50,720
This is very abstract language
of, uh, of, of, of, uh,

692
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,230
of rue cashew was a neo Kantian.
Uh,

693
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,280
but I think the important thing
that you remember from that is the,

694
00:49:57,281 --> 00:49:59,900
that is a world abandoned by God.
That is not a,

695
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,280
it's not as a god centered
world anymore as in Dante, uh,

696
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,880
that that moves through.
There are other, uh,

697
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,200
uh, less abstract, uh,

698
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:16,030
definitions of the Quixote global
definitions that I am fond of. Uh,

699
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,810
the one by Larry Nelson that I
quote in my introduction to which,

700
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,560
which goes in crudest terms,
the formula of Don Quixote,

701
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,770
maybe express as the pairing of with tall,

702
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,840
thin idealist with a short fat realist
and setting them off on a series of

703
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:34,580
hazards in previous fiction,

704
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:38,870
parents of characters who almost
always been young friends or lovers.

705
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:44,090
These new however simpler arrangement
together with the Motif of bud literature

706
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:49,091
influencing life constitutes a primal
and influential glory for Cervantes,

707
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,250
a curl airy, uh, issue to
the question of individuals.

708
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:00,770
Mal adjustment to the world is
another crucial modern concern.

709
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:06,100
The perception of reality
and the organization of that
perception into something

710
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:08,120
that we can be considered the truth.

711
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,150
The way that modern criticism has labeled
this in the Quixote's perspectivism.

712
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,260
The interpretation of reality depends
on the perspective of the individual,

713
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,120
meaning in gross terms,

714
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:25,121
that one's interpretation of the world
is colored by one's background station in

715
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,770
life, reading these tires
and experience in general.

716
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,480
There's a hilarious series of episodes
when donkey hoped it takes the basing

717
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:36,760
from a barber, puts it on his head and
says that it is mom Breanna's helmet,

718
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:40,960
a famous helmet from the
epic tradition. And uh, uh,

719
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,680
in one of the episodes in the,

720
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:47,681
in the ensues a scholastic lag discussion
about whether this thing is a basin or

721
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:51,940
a helmet,
uh,

722
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:55,790
which is of course a funny,

723
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,920
a reenactment of the, of the issue of
perspective is in what Don Quixote,

724
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,330
uh, is a helmet. Others is
a, is a barbarous basing.

725
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,930
This is at the core of, of, of,

726
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:11,000
of the book or the core of
much of the humor in the book.

727
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,640
This idea of the various
perspectives don't be haughty, uh,

728
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,720
sees giants and Sancho sees
windmills on the clash,

729
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,270
uh, repeats itself
throughout, uh, the book.

730
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:27,920
But this points to a very
important issue in, in, in, in,

731
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:29,510
at the beginnings of modern philosophy,

732
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:34,511
having to do precisely with the
perspective of the individual on our own,

733
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,640
on reality and not,
uh,

734
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,560
not a perspective that has to
be determined by received, uh,

735
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,950
ideas. So, uh, this is, uh,

736
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,780
these are some of the issues that will
come up during the semester as we read

737
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,540
the haughty. Please do the reading, uh,

738
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,050
as I have a set it out in the, uh, uh,

739
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,960
in the syllabus. The syllabus, as you
know, is on a new website. You can, uh,

740
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,450
uh, downloaded from the website
and there you will find a,

741
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,480
uh, all of the, uh, uh, all
of the readings in, in detail.

742
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:16,250
I want to go over very
briefly over that syllabus,

743
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:19,040
although you don't, uh, a habit, uh,

744
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:24,041
and also want to have you meet with the
two tas so you can begin to try to set

745
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:30,330
up meeting meetings for
the, uh, uh, sections.

746
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,690
Now let me go over the
requirements for the course too,

747
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,250
because I'm sure that you are eager
to learn what the requirements.

748
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,060
Uh, we'll be, uh,

749
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:49,200
now at midterm
and a take home final exam

750
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:54,930
for two page papers.
For years.

751
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:59,580
I have been using this technique for
papers, but each paper is only two pages,

752
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:01,560
500 words,

753
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,630
no more and no less two pages
because I want something crisp.

754
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,860
And to the point, uh, an idea, I will
give you the topics of the paper would,

755
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,020
which you can devise your own
particular topic, but just to,

756
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,320
so you don't have to begin
Vicki hotter the novel written by me.

757
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,230
This is a right to know you're
writing for me and giving you, uh,

758
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,530
what I hope to be as sharp original,
uh,

759
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:31,710
take on the topic that I
give you so far of those. Um,

760
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:37,050
and then, uh, you're required
to come to class prepared to,

761
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,860
we will have discussion after my lectures
in the last 15 minutes of the class.

762
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,560
Uh, and uh, you will,

763
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,800
you are required to come to the sections
as well where you will be graded on

764
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:55,170
your performance, uh, in the, in, in,
in intersection, the grade distribution.

765
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:59,000
You will find that in the, in the
syllabus is 40%. That's your papers,

766
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:03,690
20% of the midterm, 25 final exam, 15
attendance and so forth. You can get it.

767
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:08,370
And uh, it's uh, rather, uh,
conventional. Do you have any questions?

768
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,373
Yes.

769
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,940
The books are available at Barnes
and noble and uh, under, uh,

770
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,190
the number of the course.

771
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,000
And the books are a city.

772
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:26,160
Uh, the transfer, the
Delta in the translation,

773
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,780
uh, the, uh,

774
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:31,860
Imperial's pain and the case book
that I edited with the criticism.

775
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:37,320
Now there is also available a
Spanish edition of the Kihatha.

776
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:39,120
If you are going to read it in Spanish,

777
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,960
it's the same one that is
available for Spanish six 60.

778
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:45,840
That is the graduate seminar.
Uh,

779
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:48,600
you can buy both if you want
to play around with them.

780
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:53,930
I have to say that I am not an entirely
happy with Mr Rutherford's translation.

781
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:58,230
Even though I wrote the introduction, I'm
not happy with any of the translations.

782
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,140
Um, uh, really, uh,

783
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:06,870
is in a translation as good a
smallest from the 18th century.

784
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:13,090
And Rutherford, uh, what I wrote
the introduction, uh, I had, uh, uh,

785
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,710
a bitter exchange through the publisher
because I want him to change a few

786
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:20,850
things, but he's an Oxford professor
who's very antiquated and, uh,

787
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,650
um, uh, I hadn't changed, but I will,

788
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,710
I will be pointing out the shortcomings
of his translation as we move along.

789
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:31,643
Um,

790
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,220
but I mean that's what we have to deal
with because if you're going to read it

791
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:38,100
in translation,
do the translation.

792
00:56:38,101 --> 00:56:42,250
But Ed Grossman that it's also
circulating a lot. It is my friend.

793
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,720
Uh, it's a little bit better perhaps. Uh,

794
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,820
but I liked this one because
it has my introduction,

795
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:51,340
which I think is better than Harold
balloons for [inaudible]. It had,

796
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,420
was a very dear friend of mine.
So this is why I,

797
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:58,120
I chose again to go with the
rather for, uh, translation.

798
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,400
Uh, so any other questions?
The books are there. The uh,

799
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:06,340
the website has all the information
you could possibly want.

800
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,470
My office hours are on
Fridays from 10 to 12. Uh,

801
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,350
I am not particularly fond of emails,
um,

802
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,740
because I don't want you to do at
two in the morning, I have an email,

803
00:57:19,741 --> 00:57:20,081
a professor,

804
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:23,620
one salary through about this idea that
I have for a paper and don't expect that

805
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:28,480
I'm going to answer the next day because
I got a lot of emails. And, uh, so,

806
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,240
um,
I am,

807
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,230
I'm much more of a fund of a personal,
uh,

808
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,420
meeting. You come to my office
and we talk about this. Okay.

809
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,830
Uh,
any other questions?

810
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,220
Well, if not, uh,

811
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:50,110
we are going to now pause so that
you meet with Elena and Dina,

812
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,300
uh, who are distinguished
the students, uh,

813
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:57,700
Elaina and Spanish and Portuguese and
Dina and comparative literature. Um,

814
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,030
Elena, as I said, he's
from Maddy, Conte in Spain.

815
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:06,850
Dina is from Russia,
from Moscow itself.

816
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:12,580
Oh, no, no. You are from somewhere
in the back lands of, uh, of Russia.

817
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,910
Uh,
Siberia perhaps.

818
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,110
So could you, uh, meet with them now?

819
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,700
Um, tried to begin to set up a meeting
because I know it's very complicated,

820
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:29,120
so some games in touch.
Okay.
