1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.080
I said at the start of the last lecture,

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.310
that after the episodes that I will be discussing,

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.430
then the cable Montesinos and a master Peter's puppet show,

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.400
three significant new developments take place in the Quixote.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.730
I want to go over them again.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.570
The first is that Don Quixote will sometimes not be the center of the action,

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.800
which will focus instead on on Saint Jo.

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.340
Uh,

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
the second is that both protagonists become objects of amusement for

10
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:42.180
aristocratic frivolous characters that I've read part one and want them to

11
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:43.500
behave according to it.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.390
The 30th [inaudible] sanctuary will be surrounded by many more characters than

13
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.423
before.

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.670
The overarching theme of the Nobel continues to be the thing ganja.

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.200
And most of the episodes that staged by authors within the fiction,

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.060
which is highly theatrical.
And the backstage of the pranks,

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.780
the stage machinery,
I said,

18
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:15.030
where is revealed to the reader are either during the,

19
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.370
their performance or right after

20
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.630
the episode of the enchanted boat,

21
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.013
<v 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.800
<v 0>of which I gave you a,
uh,</v>

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.950
an illustration of which appears in the handout that I gave you,

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.923
uh,

25
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.340
what's needed to get our protagonists across the river.

26
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.770
Um,
how are we going to show a map?
Oh,
Spain,

27
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.550
although we have already shown you a map about where this appears,

28
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.980
uh,
um,

29
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.500
we have to get them across the [inaudible].
I forgot my 23rd today,

30
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.240
but you can see the evidence right there.

31
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

32
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.143
<v 0>MMM.</v>

33
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.670
<v 0>In part one,
the territory that Doki hotel and San Jo covered was,</v>

35
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.930
was not very specific in geographic terms.

36
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.130
Seville is mentioned as the destination of the prostitutes at the first in.

37
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.980
And,
uh,

38
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.400
also it is mentioned as the destination of undress when he pierce.

39
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.000
Uh,

40
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.300
the Sierra Morina is the setting for donkey holders pennants and the place where

41
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:51.960
Cardinia is hiding in shame and in madness,

42
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.840
at least relative vagueness is consensus consistent with the narrators refusal

43
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:02.841
to mention the village where along Saki handle lives and to which Don Quixote

44
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.980
returns.
Now,
however,

45
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:13.981
in part to geography becomes much more precise starting with Dorsal,

46
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.440
uh,
our protagonists first stop,

47
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.470
which is a real village in Castille and continuing with their original

48
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.960
destination said,

49
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.970
I also where Don Quixote wants to participate in just celebrated on St George's

50
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.420
Day,
April 23rd.
And we talked about that in one of my earlier,
uh,

51
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.440
glasses,
uh,

52
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.000
stream figures in the episode of the fully hammers,

53
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.590
but now don Quixote and sanctuary on their way to start,

54
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.290
I was have to get across the [inaudible],

55
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.810
one of the major rivers of Spain.

56
00:03:55.811 --> 00:04:00.130
We could see another image of there you are of the,
uh,

57
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.023
of the Avatar.

58
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.170
<v 0>I highlight this because of course,
Castille still is not only landlocked,</v>

60
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.860
but there is very little water in Casteel and this is reflected in the,

61
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.080
uh,
in the novel where,
uh,
it only rains once in part.

62
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.090
Uh,
one,
uh,
there is a stream where the fooling hammers,
uh,

63
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.440
uh,
appear.
But on the whole there is very little water.

64
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm going to turn the lights back on.

65
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.670
<v 0>So the second part adds geographic concrete next to it's rare realistic</v>

67
00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:56.060
portrayal of Spanish life.
This is not new with,

68
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.370
uh,
Cervantes.

69
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.470
This he derives from the picker risk in Los Angeles.

70
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.400
Total mess torments is a river is the river,
uh,

71
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.040
that goes through a Salamanca as a matter of fact.

72
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.910
And in the Mandale farace.
Uh,

73
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.830
the geography is quite a precise and,

74
00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:19.664
uh,

75
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.970
both in Spain and in Italy where a Guzman travels also through,

76
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.800
uh,
through Italy.
Uh,

77
00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:32.330
so Cervantes US derived this concreteness from,
uh,

78
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.540
from the picaresque.
Uh,

79
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.370
but the episode of the enchanted boat,
uh,

80
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.710
also serves to highlight comically of course,

81
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:48.890
the difference between Don Quixote's obsolete,

82
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.980
totally make notions of geography and the new Copernican conception of the

83
00:05:55.701 --> 00:05:56.540
universe,

84
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.540
which is being expanded both US knowledge and as a field of knowledge as

85
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.030
Cervantes rights.

86
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.100
What I mean by that is the Copernican Universe is infinite.

87
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.580
The Ptolemaic Universe Universe is limited.

88
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.330
Now,
this a Galileo was making,

89
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.560
uh,
uh,

90
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.970
important discoveries in favor of Kapernick aneurysm in the early decades of a

91
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.460
17th century.
He was in Spain for a while

92
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.920
and developing,
developing instruments of observation like the telescope.

93
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.640
<v 0>But donkey Quixote still adheres to Ptolemaic ideas and calculations as he</v>

95
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:50.351
demonstrates in his hilarious exchange to the sanctuary when he asks his squire

96
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.150
to check if he has any lies on his body.
Because it was come on,

97
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.240
Lord,
that upon crossing the equator,

98
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.110
all sorts of vermin would perish,

99
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.660
as if by magic sensual discovers that his fleas are lives,

100
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.590
are still very much alive.
And he is,

101
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.390
he underscores the plural once saying that the,
he has a few,

102
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.390
uh,
like chivalry.
Ptolemaic geography is a medieval retention,

103
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.170
struggling to survive in a world in which after the discovery and settlement of

104
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:29.560
the new world,

105
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.450
it was wholly on tenable except to the likes of Don Quixote or to Saint Joe who

106
00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:40.420
doesn't care either way.
It doesn't make any difference to Saint Joe.
Of course.

107
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.663
Uh,

108
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.620
the crossing of the river is significant also because our characters are moving

109
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:52.621
beyond landlocked Castille toward coastal regions of Spain that are in touch

110
00:07:55.301 --> 00:08:00.250
with other cultures and languages.
And in this second part,
uh,

111
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.030
we will,
uh,
we will reach such areas.

112
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.770
Barcelona work at alliance spoke.
Uh,

113
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.870
the episode is,
is,
is a rewriting since we're talking also always about,

114
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.383
uh,

115
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.800
these episodes of part two being rewritings of episodes of part one.
This,
I'd be,

116
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:25.710
so,
to me,
it's every writing of the windmills episode in part one,
uh,

117
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.090
because of the wheels of the in the river now

118
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.610
with similar results,

119
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:38.130
except that donkey healthy on Sancocho have again to make restitution for,

120
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.610
for damages,
uh,
and us all crossings.

121
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.590
This crossing is also a transition.
Now,

122
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.640
I have given you a handout,
uh,

123
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.740
with a scene of donkey helps us exchange.

124
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:58.741
We've censure on the issue of the distance they have traveled in a n and as this

125
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:06.081
exchange appears in various English translations so that we can be amused by,

126
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.310
uh,
the efforts that the translators would make,
uh,

127
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.660
to render the into English,
the ponds that are involved,

128
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.340
which are a little bit obscene in the Spanish.

129
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.230
If you have your handout.
If not,
I have copies.
If anybody need one.

130
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.940
Uh,
after essential wonders how much they have travel.
He said Mucho

131
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.670
[inaudible] [inaudible] DNA global.
The Laowei de la Tierra,

132

133

With some at a segment that I put the Stegal,

they look [inaudible] tilt persona Butoh it gaffer Golang at Uda.

138
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.310
I think I spent in the last class the,

139
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.730
the ugly word in Spanish to say to urinate matter equal and in English two pis

140
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.000
and of course in the word Ptolemy,

141
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.910
in Spanish Dolo Mineo that seems to be included.

142
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.290
The first person singular of the indicative of the word matter.

143
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.670
Yo Man,

144
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.730
this is what central hears until [inaudible] male's name and gum puto

145
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.480
computation.
Of course,
to him,
what he hears is Pluto,

146
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.030
which is the masculine of Pluto,
which is hard and it means homosexual.

147
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.770
So,
uh,
what,
uh,
Don Quixote has,
has told him,

148
00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.100
lacks or authorities what he's saying when these authorities have to do,

149
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.080
uh,
with,
uh,
uh,

150
00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:08.081
a person who is a homosexual and a on someone who business a lot.

151
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.730
And,
uh,
this is what,
uh,
central,
uh,
here's,
uh,

152
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.750
the,
uh,

153
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.970
the efforts by our translator by Grv.

154
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.090
It's not very good by the Lord called sanctuary.

155
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:28.750
Your worship has brought up very,
very pretty fellow.
That same tone me,

156
00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:33.040
how do you call him with his amputation to vouch the truth of what you say?

157
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.720
It's trying to get computation and amputation to try to get the Pun.

158
00:11:37.721 --> 00:11:42.330
It's not very funny.
It's not very good.
Uh,
uh,

159
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.340
smaller than the same 18th century tries to get four God cried Sankyo your

160
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:51.730
worship as broad a set of where witnesses to prove the truth of what you say.

161
00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:56.731
Copulation and kiss gaffer with the addition of tooling me or some such name.

162
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:01.660
This is actually better because it catches the spirit of the obscenity of what

163
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:05.620
central is.
A is a is saying,
uh,

164
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.863
our

165
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.380
own Rutherford from Oxford University.
Good.
God said Santo,

166
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:15.520
that's a fine character.

167
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:19.300
You've dredged up as a witness with his sexy butts and he's Tom foolery.

168
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:23.910
And what's more a great pornography or whatever it was you sent me.

169
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.890
Is that Oh,
uh,
uh,
efforts.

170
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.300
The point is that of course they run.

171
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.930
This is making fun of the whole Ptolemaic System,

172
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.650
which by this time it's obsolete.
But Don Quixote of course,
uh,
is,
uh,

173
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.560
invoking it.
Asa whose authority to tell where it is or they're going,

174
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.360
as they write on the,
uh,
on the boat,
you're going to also,

175
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.510
you're going to amuse yourself,

176
00:12:47.511 --> 00:12:51.130
so can try your hand at translating that point if you want.

177
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.503
<v 1>Now,</v>

178
00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.330
<v 0>when Don Quixote unsent you arrive at the house of the Duke and Duchess,</v>

179
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.000
they enter a realm of games and frivolity that they,

180
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.270
that they have not known before.

181
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.710
These are irresponsible aristocrats that belonged to the leisure class lecture

182
00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:16.860
class.
And in fact,
the house in which the action takes place.

183
00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:19.790
It's not even their regular house.
It is,
uh,

184
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.500
a summer home for recreation.

185
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.810
<v 0>Don Quixote first meets the Dutcher's who is out falcon hunting all decked out</v>

187
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:34.480
for the occasion and surrounded by an entourage.

188
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.920
This business of hunting with Falcons was very ceremonial.

189
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.780
People just went out and,
uh,
uh,
with servants and so forth.

190
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.530
Uh,
and,
uh,
the fact them sewer,

191
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.380
the hawks were trained to catch the prey and uh,

192
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.900
and so forth.
That wasn't much a real exercise involved.

193
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.640
I think that the hawks did all the work,

194
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.770
but this is part of the recreation of the Sa Aristocrats.

195
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.870
Um,
the Duke and Duchess are devoted to pleasure,

196
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.930
one of which is obviously reading for they know,

197
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:16.090
part one of the chaotic quite well.

198
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.630
They are idle readers like the ones that run this addressed at the beginning of

199
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:26.971
part one and I under line idle and this description don't Quixote on sent your

200
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.960
like toys to the Duke and Duchess are better.

201
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.220
Better.
They are like literary characters,

202
00:14:36.221 --> 00:14:41.140
which in fact that's exactly what they are.
Uh,

203
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.570
<v 1>okay.</v>

204
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.710
<v 0>Everything in their home.</v>

205
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:47.680
I mean you did don't kill the essential sort of fallen on their hands of these

206
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:52.681
people who are great readers apart one and wow know we have the real,

207
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.090
you hope,
the real quote Unquote Oak Hill,
the Monsanto at our own home.

208
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.590
And so they try to make uh,
uh,
the best of it.

209
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.290
Everything in,
in the Duke and Duchess is home.
It's like fiction.

210
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.560
Except that fiction fiction can be harsh and cruel.

211
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.400
What they're fiction proves the truth.

212
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.810
The truth of their fiction is that reality too is like fiction.

213
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.281
Uh,

214
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:24.281
under both reality and fiction can hurt actually what appears here is a reality.

215
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.930
Uh,
he's always reality plus the props to create the fiction.

216
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:33.230
It's not reality by itself,
but reality improved by the,

217
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.870
or changed by the,
by the props.

218
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.910
This is the harshness of dissing Ganja.
Not only that,
uh,

219
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.660
being diluted can be hurtful.
Uh,

220
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.790
and to be on the alluded also can be hurtful,
but that the,

221
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.660
the physical process may indeed involve injury.
Peter,

222
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.610
he,
Russell,
the,
uh,

223
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.060
distinguished British history says quote,

224
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:03.800
the Duke and Duchess are remarkably on feeling aristocratic pranksters,

225
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:09.250
some of their jokes involving co involved causing physical harm to their two

226
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:13.400
guests.
They will see that,
okay,
Quixote scratch my cats.

227
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.470
Not The fall from the club.
Millennial.
The horse is very dangerous and,
and,

228
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:19.400
and so forth.

229
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

230
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.530
<v 0>You got Russell,</v>

231
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.590
social satire directed at various levels of society is more prominent in this

232
00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:31.690
chapter's than anywhere else in the book.

233
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:34.900
Or this is true social satire.
It's very,

234
00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:37.180
very important in this chapter of the book.

235
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.450
In addition,

236
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.720
and this is a detail that I hope you pick up when you get to this part,

237
00:16:43.721 --> 00:16:45.580
if you haven't gotten there yet yet,

238
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.900
the Duke and Duchess is expensive.

239
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.960
Pleasures are underwritten by the peasant who song those not want to marry.

240
00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.470
Do I not Rodriguez,
his daughter,

241
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.210
which is the reason why no pressure is put on him by his master.
Remember,

242
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.860
this is conflict.
Another one of these conflicts on young people.
Uh,

243
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.380
this young man has a promise to married

244
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.470
daughter because he has impregnated her and so forth and she complains of no

245
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:20.800
pressure is brought upon this young man because his father,

246
00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:24.310
who's a poor peasant within,
uh,
uh,

247
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.360
the Rome control by the Duke and Duchess Lens.

248
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.420
Then money lend some money at very opportune moments.
That is when the,

249
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.510
you can Dutcher's are in dire economic straits.

250
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.140
This is a very significant detail.

251
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.210
These are not only idle opera classes,

252
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.500
but opera classes in Hawk that they're high living with loans.

253
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:54.560
<v 1>Okay?</v>

254
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.280
<v 0>Since you are readers of Elliot's Imperial's Spain,</v>

255
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.430
you will no doubt see that.
It is easy to draw an analogy,

256
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.460
an analogy between the behavior of this aristocrats and the policies of the

257
00:18:10.671 --> 00:18:12.020
Spanish crown,

258
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.510
which lives off the ship bins of precious metals from the new world and loans

259
00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:20.750
from the fingers.

260
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.640
The German bankers who finance the expensive,

261
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.080
uh,
uh,
blushers of the Habsburgs are there court,

262
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.180
the building of the Palace of [inaudible] that you may still see him in Madrid.

263
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.340
Uh,
but Alaska is,
paints is Habsburgs,
uh,

264
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.760
humpty and engaging in this kind of,

265
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.830
this kinds of pleasures to all of that.
Uh,
all of that was,

266
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.370
uh,

267
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:54.140
or most of it was underwritten by loans from German bankers.

268
00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.750
So this is all part of the political side of the 1615 Quixote,

269
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.610
which I mentioned before is the first political novel.

270
00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:09.880
It's social satire,

271
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.060
which may involve political dimension.

272
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.660
In this context,
Saint Joseph's social aspirations,

273
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:25.730
uh,
do not appear that outlandish,

274
00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.780
uh,
in the sense that Sorentos is showing that the social order and it's

275
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.130
hierarchies,
uh,

276
00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:39.180
is crumbling when the upper classes are so corrupt.

277
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.520
And artists as is evident in that a peasant immune suppressant is supporting

278
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.560
this aristocrats in their activities.

279
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

280
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.210
<v 0>So,
oh,
this is a kind of a topsy turvy world,
the social world,</v>

281
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.380
which bespeaks of,
uh,
uh,

282
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.470
erosion of a crumbling of his social order.
Uh,

283
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.980
and,
uh,
what's it run,
this is dramatizing here,

284
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:11.620
is that a new order is in [inaudible],
uh,

285
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.470
in which class mobility may very well be possible class mobility up or down.

286
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.740
Uh,
we see a characters.

287
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.750
I'd be stored in this household of the Duke and Duchess who has enormous power

288
00:20:26.311 --> 00:20:28.780
over his,
his,
his masters.

289
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.560
And we see San Jo of course,
uh,
elevated even if it is fictional,

290
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.470
uh,
to governor of his island.
Finally.
So this whole,

291
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:44.220
uh,
uh,
the,
the second part of Hilton reveals,
Eh,
as I say,

292
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:49.221
a social order that is not as stable as it used to be.

293
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.170
Um,
that is a sort of a shaking

294
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:59.300
and,
uh,
he's giving us very precise surrenders.
He was very precise,
uh,

295
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.530
financial,
uh,
details about,
uh,

296
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:05.870
about this through this satire,
uh,

297
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.650
the kind of of of financial detail that you own,

298
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.680
you expect to find only in 19th century novel as Balzac's Nola in,

299
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.130
in which of course the financial,
uh,

300
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.460
dealings of the characters play a very important role.

301
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.000
But here already instead of [inaudible],

302
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.400
we have this details such as the fact that the Duke gets loans from his peasant.

303
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

304
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.060
<v 0>fix your nurse performed at the Duke's house is mirth full and playful,</v>

305
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.890
but also cruel and caring as I said,
fix your on is also a femoral,

306
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.660
a femoral,
an insubstantial,

307
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.840
like the props that hold it up with the Duke and Duchess Don Quixote on Santo

308
00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.130
temporarily realize their dreams.

309
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:58.910
Don Quixote is treated like a great night and sanctuary Fay finally made

310
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:04.401
governor over done when the hotel enters into the Duke's a palatial summer home.

311
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.300
They have prompted already their help so that they can treat Doki hotels had

312
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:16.910
great presence and have all kinds of things ready for his comfort.

313
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:27.010
But these fabrications quickly disappear.
It is again the same [inaudible].

314
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.910
The truth or fiction is that it illuminates the fictional quality of real life

315
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.310
will be a femoral quality of real life if you want.

316
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:39.650
An American historian is Ruth Ellis Afar put her name

317
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.190
in spite of the name.
She was married to someone or Arabic origin.

318
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.440
She died very young.
Tragically

319
00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.630
Joseph said,
piss a scholar.
She rode,
she writes quote,

320
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.720
all of part two is based on the mistaken assumption on the part of the would be

321
00:23:06.411 --> 00:23:11.411
old controlling character offers that day can deal with a fictional character

322
00:23:13.911 --> 00:23:18.290
and maintain at the same time and distance,

323
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.740
which allows them never to slip into that fictional world with which they plan

324
00:23:23.751 --> 00:23:27.710
to entertain themselves.
Like Samsung continuous l suffer.

325
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.290
They are trapped from two directions.

326
00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.890
They are control to some extent from within their play by the very characters,

327
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:38.930
from the intent to manipulate and from without,

328
00:23:38.931 --> 00:23:41.900
by an author of whom they are on a wire,

329
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.480
by who's will and whose hand.

330
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.210
All they do is contrived on quote us.

331
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.080
We have seen already in the case of sandstone care,

332
00:23:50.081 --> 00:23:53.900
rascal is controlling author that he falls into his own trap.

333
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.100
He loses to Don Quixote in this,
uh,
uh,

334
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.660
counter that they have.

335
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:04.490
And we will see a once and again that the steward who was a very clever fellow,

336
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.560
uh,
and create all of these elaborate pranks,
uh,
the sub succeed with them.

337
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:13.940
Okay.
Eventually they come tumbling down.
Um,

338
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.970
so some [inaudible] is the principal internal author,
as I said,

339
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:23.480
and as we've seen from the very beginning,
uh,

340
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.110
Ben to recreate recreating,
recreating the fiction of part one.

341
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:31.640
But now the Duke's house,
the Duke Steward,
we compete with Samsung,
uh,

342
00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:33.050
quite favorably.

343
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.050
He is the creator of elaborate packs like the island.

344
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.260
We don't sanction would be governor like the pageant in the forest about which I

345
00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:46.790
will speak very soon,

346
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.950
none of which turn out quite as he planned them and within which he gets caught.

347
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.110
Uh,
these steward,
by the way,
if you think about,
uh,
the pageant in the forest,

348
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.260
uh,
was,
uh,
uh,
not only,
uh,
uh,
clever in creating this banks,

349
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.500
but it was also a part,

350
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:08.090
he must've written the lines that Merlin delivers in this pageant.

351
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.073
So

352
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.480
the significance of all this,
uh,

353
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:18.490
apart from its baroque character is it's advantage is speculating as usual about

354
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:25.550
his own position.
Visa vie own fiction is fiction.

355
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:29.300
That seems to be always getting away from him,
from him.

356
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.340
And this is what the presence of this internal authors who are beset by these

357
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:38.190
problems,
uh,
of distance and control,
uh,

358
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.340
uh,
reveals,

359
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.400
which is the same kind of situation in which a master Peter find himself,

360
00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:47.540
finds himself with his,

361
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.320
a puppet theater with got a straw fic results.

362
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.790
So then one of the early,
uh,

363
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:02.950
events that occur at the Duke and Dukes and Duchesses House is,

364
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:04.940
I'm sure you noticed,
uh,

365
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.320
is the debate donkey hold the house with the ecclesiastic.

366
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.640
Uh,

367
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:17.590
this is a criticism of the church not of religion and may also be a commentary

368
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:25.961
on Spanish politics and the role that the clergy is allowed to play in them.

369
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.470
So we have,
again,

370
00:26:30.471 --> 00:26:35.330
another is I know the instance here of these social

371
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.790
and political criticism that appears in the know

372
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:47.521
don't be hot.

373
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:52.350
The intimates that the [inaudible] is a Leech leaving,

374
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.930
living at the expense of the Duke and Duchess,

375
00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:01.140
who in turn live off of the rich peasant who pays,
who gives them loans,

376
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.580
uh,
don't get help.

377
00:27:03.581 --> 00:27:07.950
They also tells him that he speaks without our authority because he lacks

378
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:13.310
experience and accuses him of acting aggressively because he is protected by his

379
00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:17.520
investiture,
meaning that donkey health,

380
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:21.570
they cannot challenge him to a fight because he is a,

381
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:23.000
an ecclesiastical,
therefore,

382
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:27.030
he takes advantage of that protection to be able to act with this,

383
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.060
uh,
uh,
haughtiness.

384
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.390
But notice

385
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.330
that there is some truth to what the ecclesiastic says to the Duke and Duchess

386
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.000
about how they're dealing with donkey haughty,

387
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:47.100
encouraging him to go on with this insanity about being a knight errand.

388
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.850
There are no uniformly negative characters in,

389
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.960
and this even this very unpleasant priest is right in some of the things that he

390
00:27:58.081 --> 00:28:01.110
says.
He ruins the whole dinner.
He's very unpleasant,

391
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.070
but he has some of the things he says are quite true.

392
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.960
Perspective is same as we have been seeing it in throughout the semester.

393
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.020
It means that no one is in possession of the entire truth.

394
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.030
That is truth made up of the various points of view of the characters.

395
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Um,
under the truth.
Baby spoken by the most unlikely people,

396
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.530
even people who are not,
uh,
uh,
very pleasant.

397
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.410
This is a constant insert Landis,
uh,

398
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.180
notice that the debate with the [inaudible] in this case,
uh,

399
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.490
we could call it a pre prandial dinner.
So I'd be a pretty Pinedale speeches,

400
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:46.320
the speech before dinner,
which was ruined anyway by this and that,
uh,

401
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.700
it is a,
again,

402
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.470
another rewriting of the arms and letters speech because don't Quixote,

403
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.630
we seems to be able to get to that topic as it did at the house of Diego.

404
00:28:56.911 --> 00:29:01.911
Them Eudanda when he debated about the virtuals of poetry and of uh,

405
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.990
uh,
the military.

406
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.420
Now we move on now to let be souls that are quite independent,

407
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.870
uh,
and,
uh,

408
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.900
that seemed to build not on part one bottom previous episodes of parts.

409
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.200
Who,
uh,
is this fiction issuing from fiction.

410
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.400
It's like a telescope that you're pulling out from within itself.

411
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.550
What is happening in these episodes that fallen?
Now,

412
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:36.300
think of it as that a telescope and as you pull it out,

413
00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:37.770
you're pulling things from within it.

414
00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:42.430
And that is the way that these episodes are.
I'm going to discuss now appear in,

415
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.080
uh,
in,
in,
in part two.
You said very important episodes,

416
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.310
not quite on the level of the cave of Montesinos,
but very important.

417
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.700
I'm very memorable episodes and that sort of make it coherent unit,

418
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.220
although,
uh,
there will be a return,
uh,

419
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:07.570
to the Duke and Duchess,
his house when Don Quixote is on his way back home.

420
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.123
Um,

421
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.570
so we begin by the episode of the humped.

422
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.110
Uh,
and,
and we have here again this,
uh,
uh,

423
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.800
effect of the receding sequences,
the episode of the hunt,

424
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.070
uh,
and the,
uh,

425
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.080
elaborate pageant in the forest are games within games place within a place.

426
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.810
Um,
what is the hunt?

427
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.740
The hunt is a mock war,

428
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:43.930
uh,

429
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.930
aristocrats no longer participating wars as we have been a c all along.

430
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:55.180
So they now engage in mock wars.
Specifically in hunting.

431
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.110
We saw that both the chaotic and Don Diego de Miranda are hunters.

432
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.601
Hunting of,

433
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:09.601
of the boar involves strategies that are akin to those of a battle demanding,

434
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.990
uh,
uh,

435
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:18.770
horsemanship as well as the playing of drums and various horns and trumpets.

436
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:25.110
Much of the ceremonial aspects of war are reproduced in hunting.

437
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:32.130
War has become a sport and sports modern sports to our mock wars,

438
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.320
think for a moment of American football,
which is,
uh,

439
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.870
the metaphor of war is very crass in American football.

440
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.030
I invade your territory,
whereas the other team defense his territory.

441
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.830
And so there is a dividing line,

442
00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:56.470
which is like the frontier between these two countries at war.

443
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.880
And all of the terminology is derived from,
uh,

444
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.290
from the military.
All of this,
what I called back and forth,

445
00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:09.940
sports hockey,
soccer,
football,

446
00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:13.480
lacrosse are back and forth because you stand there and they go back and forth,

447
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:18.530
back and forth,
uh,
are across metaphor.
Uh,

448
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.840
for war,
uh,
if you,
if you,

449
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.070
if a Martian got off his spaceship and you took him to a football game,

450
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.790
the Martian would be able to understand very soon what is going on.

451
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.240
Not so with baseball,
by the way,
in baseball,

452
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.310
the war metaphor is very elaborate.

453
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:46.070
You run around the bases in a circle to come back home like Ulysses and all of

454
00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:50.450
that,
but that,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
Uh,

455
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:53.000
this is not just a defensive baseball because as you know,

456
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:57.140
I've written quite a bit on,
on baseball and played the game a lot,
but it is,

457
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.420
it is simply the truth.
Uh,

458
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.840
and all these other sports that I've mentioned and hunting,

459
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:07.130
of course our CRAs metaphors for war in baseball.

460
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:12.050
The metaphor,
it's more baroque actually.
He's,
it's not convoluted,

461
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.350
but the outcome of course,
a of sports contests.
I like a war.

462
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.210
I think it's tomorrow.
Uh,
the,

463
00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.940
the New York Yankees who I've just won the world series last night,

464
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:32.500
they're going to be paraded down,
uh,
the,

465
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.090
the streets of New York with ticker tapes.

466
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:39.920
And it's as if they hadn't been returning heroes like those in Rome who came

467
00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:44.750
back and built arches and so forth.
So much for sports.

468
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:49.810
But I want to underline the fact that hunting has become a sport and this is

469
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:54.320
what the,
uh,
uh,
these aristocrats I engaged in.

470
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:59.570
Uh,
Sandra of course runs up the tree scared by the,
by this board,

471
00:33:59.571 --> 00:33:59.981
which a,

472
00:33:59.981 --> 00:34:04.981
these are dangerous animals with along with tusks like this and all of that.

473
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.570
Now,
uh,
I seen Camacho's wedding notice the transition,

474
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.000
the episode begins,

475
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:18.800
the episode of the whole pageant in the forest begins with a kill the animal.

476
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:24.140
I,
if a scape goat where needed to start the action and also escape goat were

477
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:28.520
needed for the feast.
Feast ceremonies and parties,

478
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:33.410
uh,
demand,
uh,
seem to demand escape goat of some sort.

479
00:34:33.411 --> 00:34:34.730
It doesn't have to be a gold.
Of course,

480
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:38.840
it can be a Turkey in Thanksgiving and uh,
and so forth.

481
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:41.960
Or it could be a pig in many celebrations,

482
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.350
but it seems to be an atavistic need of the human race to have this scape.

483
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.970
Goats,
uh,
uh,
uh,

484
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.880
there had been a recent instances in Spain.
I have seen,

485
00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.960
I have seen it disgusts in the newspapers where new traditions of this kind have

486
00:35:00.981 --> 00:35:05.981
emerged and the towns have the practice that when they have their,

487
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:08.703
their big feast,

488
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:13.990
they take a goat up on the church steeple and throw him off and kill him that

489
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:18.020
way.
Gross.
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,

490
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.880
when I'm on the lining is at the beginning,

491
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:24.881
the killing of this bore here has sort of an atavistic ritualistic air to it.

492
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.093
So

493
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.190
now this pageant in the forest is one of the most baroque episodes in the whole

494
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:35.024
of the jihadi.

495
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.300
The episode gather God episode gathers elements of the Cave and want to see

496
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:43.980
[inaudible] and the [inaudible] of the parliament of death.

497
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.740
It is a kind of synthesis of both.
Uh,

498
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.960
this is what I meant by episodes that are derived from episodes like a
telescope.

499
00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:52.890
Can you open like that?

500
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.330
But it is also a version or more

501
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:05.040
accurately a pair version or,
uh,
uh,

502
00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.960
second moment in Dante [inaudible].

503
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:13.350
And I gave you a handout in the previous class with some,

504
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.710
uh,
with a fragment of [inaudible] 29,

505
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.690
uh,
because these episodes here,

506
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.500
as I will describe in some detail,

507
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:30.060
are a tank off the parody of these,
uh,

508
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.890
episodes in the divine comedy.
No less.
I told you that now.

509
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:39.720
I said,
Ron,
this is sources are not just the romances of chivalry,
but,

510
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.420
uh,
all avid Virgil,

511
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.440
homer and done now in Dante,

512
00:36:47.441 --> 00:36:49.590
this in Dante's Commedia,

513
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:53.580
this is a moment of an ignore is of discovery of self discovery for the pilgrim.

514
00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.970
The pilgrim poet is left if I Virgil,

515
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.960
who has guided him up to this point and who will not be able to enter paradise

516
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.680
because he's a pagan.
So he is left,

517
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.070
the pilgrim is left on his own to meet Beatrice,

518
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.540
very dwells in limbo at the entrance of inferno where he is lodged with other

519
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:21.970
worthies of the pagan world.
Neither,
uh,

520
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.060
punished nor rewarded.

521
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:29.090
This is a marvelous invention of dentists limbo or he puts all of these great

522
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:33.810
figures of antiquity who could not,
she didn't say came before Christ,

523
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:36.450
could not have been Christian,
therefore they cannot enter paradise.

524
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:41.130
And they were put here in limbo where they are together in this palace.

525
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.950
Uh,
neither happy nor sad,

526
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.510
the kind of a smile.
Let me steer your smile on their face,

527
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.500
discussing their works with each other.
It's a kind of a perpetual seminar.

528
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.630
It's not bad.
Um,

529
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:58.620
now,

530
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.850
so that's where Virgil dwells and he left to accompany the pilgrim all the way

531
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:06.840
up but not quite into a paradise.
Of course,

532
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:10.140
the whole object of the journey was to find Beatrice.

533
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:16.410
The pilgrim moves on to the end of,
uh,
uh,

534
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.200
purgatorial to do,
we met by Beatrice.

535
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.760
I will get to the solemn profession,
that profession,

536
00:38:22.761 --> 00:38:26.610
the solemn procession that meets him.

537
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:29.280
I don't wish the one in this.
He said,
Ron,
this is based,

538
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.760
but first let me tell you that the meeting with Beatrice is to me one of the

539
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:39.490
funniest moments in the whole of the western literary tradition

540
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.590
after the pilgrim poet has gone through all of hell and most of purgatory in

541
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:51.520
order to meet her.

542
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:56.910
The first thing the Beatrice does when they do meet is to reproach him for

543
00:38:57.491 --> 00:39:00.790
having been with other women after his death.

544
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.630
I find this delicious and very,

545
00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:06.130
very funny and a great lesson.

546
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.210
No good deed shall go on punished,

547
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.920
but what ensues in Dante is an elaborate procession as us,

548
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:24.040
Beatrice appear that it's front there.
March seven luminaries,

549
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:29.130
the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost followed by the 20 elders of the apocalypse.

550
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:36.150
Canticles announce the impending arrival of Beatrice for mystic animals up here,

551
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.810
the four gospels and a cart pulled by a Griffin,

552
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:46.500
the four cardinal virtues follow and then the three theological virtues we Saint

553
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.030
Peter and Saint Paul for Doctors of the Church and Saint John.

554
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.450
The procession stops before the pilgrim port.

555
00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.160
That triumphant Beatrice Symbol of theology makes her appearance.

556
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.880
This is the background of the pageant to distort,

557
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.650
has organized with the help of other servants of the Duke and Duchess,

558
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.420
including the beautiful page playing the role of dual scenario

559
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:20.790
one must pause to ponder at least Ipos to ponder the distance between the

560
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:27.630
universe created by Dante in the divine comedy and that created by Cervantes

561
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.823
indeck haughty.

562
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:34.910
The pageant in the forest is quite a bold parody verging on the irreverent,

563
00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:37.750
on the part of the Atlantis.

564
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:43.380
What makes the difference between Dante's and Cervantes?

565
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.110
This worlds,
this is what we must ask ourselves at this point.

566
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.870
The progressive,
in my view,

567
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:53.590
is the progressive crumbling of the certainties of the Medieval world,

568
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.600
their cosmology grounded on the Ptolemaic system that has been shattered by the

569
00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:01.930
discovery of the new world and the Copernican Revolution,

570
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.700
the Protestant reformation and the schism in the Christian Church.

571
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:09.640
The minute orders,

572
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:14.670
symbolic universe of Christian doctrine apparent immediately well cathedrals and

573
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:20.410
in the divine comedy is no longer available.

574
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.300
The fusion of neoplatonic love and its courtly derivatives,

575
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.170
which could,
which could coalesce in the figure of Beatrice,

576
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:34.171
uniting worldly love with divine love and faith has been torn asunder.

577
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:40.390
So saw that what Don Quixote fines in this brilliant scene is not a Beatrice but

578
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:43.480
it transvestite Dulcinea,

579
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.900
a transvestite billionaire.
No less.

580
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.800
Who reveals to him perhaps the depths of his madness and the true nature of his

581
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:55.154
desire.

582
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

583
00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.530
<v 0>Have you had an arrow who might have caught at many times in the course of the</v>

584
00:42:01.531 --> 00:42:03.600
semester,
says the following?

585
00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:09.050
It is a remarkable twist of Cervantes is irony that the incarnated Dulcinea is a

586
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:16.330
lie of the dukes built on a previous line of sanctuary to top it all till Chanel

587
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.850
as really a man,

588
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.840
that page of the dukes that the steward has selected to play this role because

589
00:42:23.851 --> 00:42:28.851
of his Bilty such as the ontological status of the earthy Dulcinea elaborates of

590
00:42:29.851 --> 00:42:34.560
lights built upon lies,
a contradict of contradictory appearances on quote.

591
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.593
<v 1>Okay,</v>

592
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.470
<v 0>think about this.
Think about the difference between Beatrice and this dude.</v>

593
00:42:41.471 --> 00:42:45.360
See now,
I mean it's a huge difference.

594
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:50.390
I mean between the sublime image of Beatrice who incarnates,

595
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:55.110
uh,
theology in the divine comedy.
Uh,

596
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:57.580
and this,
uh,

597
00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.400
hilarious figure of a deal of the Dukes,

598
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:06.270
but page who's very beautiful playing the role of a,

599
00:43:06.271 --> 00:43:11.220
of duty.
Now this is the evolution of the,
the evolution of the,

600
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.660
of,
of the ideal woman from Dante to serve Lantis,

601
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.530
which goes through Laura in patriarchy.
We saw,
well fray the English,

602
00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:24.450
the Lasso and all of these,
uh,
uh,
winds up in this,

603
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:29.750
in this brilliant figure of the transvestite Lucy now that we have here in this

604
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:34.890
pageant on the forest.
I mean,
this is,
this is where it's a rented reaches,

605
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.950
a level of a penetration into the evolution of,

606
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.820
of the Western mind that it's really,
uh,

607
00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.180
that are really uncanny and where we have not really gone much,
uh,

608
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.233
beyond.

609
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:51.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

610
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:56.370
<v 0>Now the pageant in the forest is bristling with Baroque elements.</v>

611
00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.630
It is the most baroque scene in the entire novel.
First,

612
00:44:01.631 --> 00:44:06.190
it takes place in a Carol squirrel atmosphere and I've explained what Carroll

613
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.620
School Royce
as we shall see,

614
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.410
a darkness that is half illuminated by torches.

615
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.430
It is a fabrication and construction and assemblage of disparate elements,

616
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.200
theatrical,
self conscious,
humorous.

617
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.260
It is play I need is a play the card set up here carrying the costume players

618
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:30.130
are like those use to represent out of Sacramento Talis.
Remember those uh,

619
00:44:30.131 --> 00:44:31.150
allegorical outdoors.

620
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:35.520
I have mentioned several times like the one in the wire on of the parliament of

621
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:39.660
death episode
as in much of the second part.

622
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:44.690
These are complicated borderless pranks based on literary allusions like the

623
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:47.190
Cave of Montesinos episode,

624
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:51.360
which Jew from the classical tradition and the romances of chivalry.

625
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.280
Remember uh,

626
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:58.460
the descent to hades in homer and Virgil and one in the romances of chivalry.

627
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.470
Here in this pageant in the forest,

628
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:05.310
we have us in the cave literary figures like Merlin,

629
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.220
Marilyn and the devil's representing themselves.

630
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.230
That is you think that a literary figure represents presumably a real person,

631
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:16.800
but here is a literary figures who are representing literary figures.

632
00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.700
He said there are several layers of functionality here.

633
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:26.080
It is literally a don task world with clear illusions.

634
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.120
As I've mentioned to purgatorial 28 30 28 29 and 30 a baroque art is,

635
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:35.770
we call it in Spanish [inaudible].

636
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:41.950
It ain't said generating reactions on the audience because of its outrageous

637
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.600
dementia or it's exaggerated qualities.

638
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.360
That's the essence of the Baroque.

639
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.200
The reader is treated to the effects of this art and shown its effect on the

640
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:58.380
spectators and participants like Sancha who faiths.

641
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

642
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.720
<v 0>And and also its effect even on those who are responsible for the whole terrain,</v>

643
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.770
they are caught within their own fiction,
the Duke and Duchess and are scared.

644
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

645
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.360
<v 0>The most jarring effect in this episode is cost by sound.</v>

646
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:22.450
And if we turn to pages six 95 six 96 I'm going to read a passage

647
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.920
that begins and the last paragraph with these and the like entertaining

648
00:46:31.461 --> 00:46:32.360
discourses,

649
00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:37.300
they left the tent and went into the woods to visit the toils and next.

650
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:41.750
This was the in the world of the hunt.
The day was sutent.

651
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.980
Soon spent a night,
came on,
not so clear,

652
00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.900
nor socom as the season of the year,
which was the midst of summer required,

653
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.660
but a kind of Claire Obscure Chiaroscuro.
This is what,
uh,

654
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.360
Jarvis just trying to get out,

655
00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.670
which contributed very much to help forward the dukes and duchesses design.

656
00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:08.110
Now night coming on soon after the toilet on a sudden the would seem them fire

657
00:47:09.021 --> 00:47:11.750
from all the four quarters.
I'm presently,

658
00:47:11.751 --> 00:47:16.751
we're heard on all sides an infinite number of corners and other instruments of

659
00:47:16.851 --> 00:47:21.500
war as if a great body of horse was passing through the wood,

660
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.160
the blaze of the fire on the sound of the war,

661
00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:30.161
like instruments almost blinded and stunned the eyes and ears of the bystanders

662
00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.010
and even have all that were in the world.

663
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.630
Presently we're heard infinity lily,
Lily's,

664
00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.810
which is a sound that the more is made,
uh,
uh,

665
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.820
when they are just going to battle Trump is and clarion sounding drums,

666
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:50.821
beat five splayed and almost all at ones so fast and without intermission that

667
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:54.930
he must have had no sense who had not lost it.
Uh,

668
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.940
the confused didn't have so many instruments on quote the Song Confulco confused

669
00:48:00.641 --> 00:48:05.210
sound causes past month or his astonishment.
So spanx,
oh,

670
00:48:05.211 --> 00:48:09.070
suspense at [inaudible],
admiration and spanked,

671
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:12.640
frightened according words from the,
from the original.

672
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.330
The key here is to shrill this harmony.

673
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.590
The sounds are her uncle,
horse and a spam.

674
00:48:20.591 --> 00:48:24.430
Social fragmenting their voices or on a horrible,

675
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:29.440
the devil is sounding at this Sappho Rado Queer know Rachel's harm.

676
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.550
These are,
there are visual effects to the devils are ugly.

677
00:48:33.551 --> 00:48:38.551
Those fails the millennials and Marilyn has the figure of death is terrifying.

678
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.230
This whole scene he's cast in this clash of sounds and sights artificially

679
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:49.330
created for effect even in the translation that of Yoast red,
uh,

680
00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:49.810
uh,

681
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:54.810
you can hear that Savantas has created this effect also stylistically with harsh

682
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.240
sounding words and own Amato payers.

683
00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.730
There is words that sound like what they represent.

684
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:07.810
Now,
in addition to all of this,
uh,
Baroque,
uh,

685
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:12.550
atmosphere,
uh,
douchey now is a transvestite.

686
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:17.500
I get back to that duty.
Nat is a man.
These guys,
as a beautiful woman,

687
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:22.060
more precisely,
a beautiful young man.
This guys,
as a beautiful young woman,

688
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.180
it is underlying that the page is beautiful.

689
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:31.570
This is the most outrageous of the transformations that Dulcinea on their goes,

690
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.380
even worse than her appearing as a peasant wench smelling of garlic.

691
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:41.190
It makes her femininity is something artificial that can be fortunate with the

692
00:49:41.351 --> 00:49:42.550
proper disguise.

693
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.480
The transvestite is a common baroque figure in Spanish literature because in the

694
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:52.600
Baroque,
even gender can be constructed,

695
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.900
fabricated from the idea of beauty drawn from the neoplatonic and the court.

696
00:49:58.241 --> 00:50:02.500
We love tradition from which Gnocchi Hoda invents dual scenario two,

697
00:50:02.501 --> 00:50:07.420
the grotesque Peston of Sanchez lie to this baroque construction that is an

698
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:12.421
increase in the level of fabrication or what deficient artificiality.

699
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.810
I guess we do invent the objects of our desire.

700
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.130
This is what the novel keeps telling us.
You gotta be careful.

701
00:50:21.131 --> 00:50:23.860
You don't invent the object of your desire.

702
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:27.680
And it turns out to be a transvestite.
Uh,

703
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:31.263
<v 1>um,</v>

704
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.020
<v 0>I have seen some that can really fool anybody.
Uh,</v>

705
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:41.170
I wrote a book on a Cuban writer called [inaudible] who's chief figure is the

706
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:44.130
transfer stock.
He lived in Paris and I,
uh,

707
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.860
visited with him a few places that are not in the tourist guides

708
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:55.690
and where you would find a transfer starts that God really fool anybody.

709
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:04.780
The grotesqueness mentored here and made even funnier by the feature that

710
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:10.760
exposes do sedans,
true gender,

711
00:51:10.761 --> 00:51:13.190
which is her voice.

712
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:16.910
<v 1>Okay,</v>

713
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:20.660
<v 0>Jer,
Jeremy's flubs.
The translation are Jarvis.</v>

714
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:24.010
In the original it says,
don't see now.

715
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:29.100
[inaudible] voice was not very either mother from Dama lady at the mother.

716
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.600
The voice was not very lady like,

717
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:35.330
<v 1>okay.</v>

718
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:38.330
<v 0>Jarvis rendition as amiable.
Ah,</v>

719
00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.670
he ruins the whole effect.

720
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.390
No dual Chanel's voice voices masculine.
She'd also a warrior.

721
00:51:45.391 --> 00:51:47.000
So once you get delivered his speech,

722
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.650
the contrast is that she's beautiful because the page is beautiful and dressed

723
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:55.630
like a beautiful woman.
But suddenly what emerges from her is a,

724
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.130
is a hoarse voice over a male.

725
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:03.500
She has too much testosterone.
And this contrast,

726
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:07.470
this clash is what is important here and done.

727
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:13.160
Lamentably uh,
Jarvis flubbed it.
Uh,

728
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.750
this whole episode makes me think of a movie that is perhaps too old for you to

729
00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:20.090
have seen it,
but it's such a classic that you may have seen it,

730
00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.410
some like it hot with Marilyn Monroe.
Uh,

731
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.500
it's just a wonderful movie on the very last line.

732
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:32.150
It's a classic because when the old man is just continuous,
uh,

733
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:37.010
uh,
to,
uh,
to insist that he,
that lemon is,
is,
uh,

734
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:41.400
is the,
is lemon dig the Guy John Lennon or what is the Clint playing the,

735
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:45.650
the transvestite.
Uh,
he finally defense is,

736
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:50.610
but I'm not even a woman.
And then of course,
nobody's perfect.
Uh,

737
00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.420
answers,
answers her eager lover.

738
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:58.580
And I guess these two see now is not perfect.
I mean,
first of all,

739
00:52:58.581 --> 00:53:02.360
she said,
man,
she made me beautiful.
And in addition to that,

740
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.980
she hauls of Horace.

741
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:08.240
That is just not a very feminine.

742
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.920
This whole elaborate prank is concocted.

743
00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:17.900
To listen champ do scenario to bring her out of the stadium when sand in which

744
00:53:17.901 --> 00:53:19.640
sank,
just like put her,

745
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:25.210
hence the need within this grotesque fiction for central to punish himself by

746
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:30.720
giving himself 3000 lashes on his buttocks.

747
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.160
The prank has a logic of its own,

748
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:40.520
which operates at the level of the lies which are fictions in their own right at

749
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:44.100
that level,
centuries the culprit.
So he must pay the price.

750
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.120
Now I bought white lashes on his butt and neuro his back,

751
00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:53.510
which is traditionally prisoners are uh,
uh,

752
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:58.740
punished by having a number of lashes.
I've ministered to their bare backs,

753
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:00.870
but here is through his bare bottom.

754
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:08.510
There's of course adds to the humor of the whole terrain because Sandra of

755
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:10.710
course wants to protect his bought literally a,
he's a,

756
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:12.810
he's not going to have any such thing happened to him,

757
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:18.860
but of course it is an allusion to Sanchez being so dependent on his digestive

758
00:54:20.521 --> 00:54:25.120
system,
must it where he has already defecated twice in the normal.

759
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:29.570
Remember in part one in the falling hammers.
And then when he takes that,
uh,

760
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:34.020
concoction,
the donkey hold it gives me money,
has a terrible bout of diarrhea.

761
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.230
So,
uh,
defecation and the rear end are very much a part of central.

762
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.180
He has,
uh,
his,
uh,
his rear frank just rear represents,

763
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:47.250
he's freshly character.
It is,

764
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.760
it is his signature or as much as his belly is the last name a Pantser,

765
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.140
if you nail it on the Duke and Duchess Walking Castle.
Duetto

766
00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:03.700
<v 1>okay.
Spanish.
His Spanish from the forties</v>

767
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:19.890
<v 0>saves the Duke at the Duke's house.
Doki hold the field for the first time,</v>

768
00:55:19.891 --> 00:55:23.640
like a real night errand,
but that this is not enough.

769
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.700
And this is the quote from Castle Doro translated by me man's inner reality.

770
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.960
Six to be confirmed in society,

771
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.700
which when it gratifies the amount of action,
grandson,
a personality,

772
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:44.390
but any social confirmation of what is a spiritual is always a parody.

773
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:50.130
Don't Quixote.
A spiritual man sees his own image as a knight errand.

774
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:54.570
Would you have here to four always contemplated in the purity of action.

775
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.640
It is an image of his external self.
The owner's social status,

776
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:04.500
the fame that society can grant the man of the spirit are nothing but a

777
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:06.240
burlesque image of him.

778
00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:11.620
A distortion of his inner life on quote cause a lot of positives at any

779
00:56:11.791 --> 00:56:16.791
manifestation of one's inner life in the world outside has necessarily a to B

780
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:22.800
burlesque that he cannot match its essence in the purity of thought.

781
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.633
And

782
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:29.850
perhaps funky heartache is making this discovery as he is subject to pranks like

783
00:56:30.371 --> 00:56:35.371
those he suffered at the hands of the Duke and the Duchess and their menus.

784
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.330
Now I want to end with a few words about the pretended aunt because you have

785
00:56:40.331 --> 00:56:43.780
written a paper due return in today,

786
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.910
uh,
in which,
uh,
following,
uh,

787
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:53.940
Auerbach and Spitzer on the notion of the servant Yan using that knowledge,

788
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:59.610
you are applying it to your reading of the pretended aunt and dried to decide if

789
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:02.220
it was written or not by Cervantes.

790
00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:06.790
This is a story that appeared in a bundle of manuscripts that included some of

791
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:10.130
the fantasy stories [inaudible] and quarterly,

792
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.540
but that are not,
uh,
but it was not signed.

793
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:17.770
And of course the debate has raised over the centuries,
uh,

794
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.590
as to whether it was,
uh,

795
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:23.950
written by Cervantes or not in favoring of considering the story.

796
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:24.783
Do we serve Lantus?

797
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:29.790
I would say that [inaudible] is an independent young woman who shaves her future

798
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:33.760
by dint of her will and courage.
She rebels and whites up,

799
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:37.810
winds up married to a well to do young man.
She erased her,

800
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:42.811
pass us a whore and becomes respectable and married in this year's like others.

801
00:57:43.241 --> 00:57:45.370
Advantis characters like Marcella,

802
00:57:45.371 --> 00:57:50.371
Dorothea and [inaudible] and also in favor of the story ends with an equal

803
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:52.780
marriage similar to those in the Quixote.

804
00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:58.000
That successful one at that against is being by Cervantes,

805
00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:02.800
Eh,
is the strong,
uh,
strong influence of cellists.

806
00:58:02.801 --> 00:58:05.380
Dena above all in the,

807
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.380
in the salacious episodes,
um,

808
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:10.990
details about repairing virgins.

809
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.360
There's nothing quite as dirty in any texts by Cervantes,

810
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:19.120
including the receipt for marriage and the dog's colloquy stories that you will

811
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:24.010
be reading towards the end of the semester.
It could be a way out.
Could be,

812
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:27.970
is that it could be by a,
an early Cervantes story.

813
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:31.950
Before he was Atlantis.
It could be a Savantas,
uh,

814
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:36.250
imitator who wrote it,
uh,
and so forth.

815
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:39.770
But how many of you here thought that it was written by Cervantes?

816
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:43.750
Raise your hands.
One,
two,
three,
four.

817
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.490
How many thought not,

818
00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.553
<v 1>yeah,</v>

819
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.400
<v 0>how many didn't dig us that aside,
did you,
you didn't take any sides.</v>

820
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:55.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

821
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.950
<v 0>Not Fair.
Okay.</v>
