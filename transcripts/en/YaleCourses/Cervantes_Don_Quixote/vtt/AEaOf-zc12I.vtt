WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.220
Something that I will be,
uh,

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.740
charting as we move through the episodes,
that makeup,

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.010
uh,
parked who is,

4
00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:18.011
how they are reminiscent of others in part one,

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.760
how in many cases these episodes in part to our rewritings of episodes in part

6
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:33.560
one,
this is an issue,
uh,
that doesn't have to be just,

7
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.090
uh,
uh,
stated,
but also pondered,
I mean,
what does that mean?

8
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.920
Uh,

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.950
does it make a statement about there not being a possibility of a,

10
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.810
of something new and original,
uh,

11
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.850
of memory impinging on the presence so strongly that you cannot really move away

12
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:57.050
from it,
uh,
on and so forth.
So,
uh,

13
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.150
so when I discussed this episodes,
I will,
uh,

14
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.840
tried to,
uh,
to link them to episodes in part one.

15
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.790
And I hope that you do the same as you,
uh,
as you read because the,

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.810
the,
the book invites you to do so,
uh,

17
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.880
from the very beginning when,
uh,

18
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.720
Samsung Carrasco sort of takes over as the,
uh,

19
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.020
as the internal author of part two,

20
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.470
and you realize that wasn't so Carrasco once Gnocchi Quixote to do is to reenact

21
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.280
part one to be like it was in part one and to do the things that we did in part

22
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.960
one and in fact many of the characters in part to,
uh,

23
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.600
that the,
uh,
the,

24
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:46.601
the Don Quixote on Jo meet one them to act like as they did in part one.

25
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.403
So,
uh,

26
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.590
this is something that can be seen as a sort of an overarching topic about,

27
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.690
uh,
in my discussions of part two.
And that I hope that you,

28
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:03.110
uh,
uh,
we'll also,
uh,
uh,
do us,

29
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.850
you as you read them and think about,
uh,
uh,
part two.

30
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.700
We are going to begin,
uh,
today,
uh,

31
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:18.701
where we left off in the last class talking about that all important term,

32
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.870
uh,
that I,
uh,
was discussing called the Sin Ganja.

33
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.170
<v 0>The same guy I knew was perhaps the most important concept of the Spanish</v>

35
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:40.434
Baroque.

36
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.460
Remember Baroque is essentially 17th century spilling over into the 18th century

37
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.610
where it becomes rococo if you want to be more precise.

38
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.990
So this in Ganja is perhaps the most important concept of the Spanish Baroque.

39
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.920
It means on deceiving opening ones,

40
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.730
eye to eyes to reality,
awakening to the truth.

41
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.300
These are all valid translations of the term in Guy knew,

42
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.753
uh,

43
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.030
in Spanish means deceit to be fooled thing gang means I fooled you.

44
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.640
This,
uh,
a is to full oneself.

45
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.670
This concept is,

46
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:29.671
is fundamental to park too because the whole plot of the novel seems to be

47
00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:36.520
moving towards distribution meant.

48
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.313
Uh,

49
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.450
so let me give you some definitions of this in Ganja and comment on them so that

50
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:49.931
we can have as clear a concept or as clear an idea of this concept as possible.

51
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.150
The first is from a Otis Green on his book,

52
00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:03.320
Spain and the Western tradition.
All these green was a great,

53
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.760
uh,
Hispanic is that the University of Pennsylvania for many years,
uh,

54
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.360
through the forties,
50s and 60s.

55
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.610
And his book is,
is,
is,
uh,
um,
uh,

56
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.720
was a treasure of information about a Spanish literature and culture of the

57
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.130
Golden Age.
He writes this,
this,

58
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:31.131
and Daniel is related to the sort of awakening to the nature of reality that the

59
00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:36.830
prodigal son must have experienced.

60
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.360
I will arise and go to my father says the prodigal son.

61
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.440
This waking to true awareness is called [inaudible] in La Quinta in Spanish.

62
00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:50.894
It's another way of

63
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.730
Diana in La Quinta

64
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160
do have the scales fall from our eyes to see things as they are.

65
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.370
So just state of mind is desirable.
I continue with green.

66
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.670
This illusion men comes to be viewed even to be venerated as a sword of wisdom.

67
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.080
The wisdom of the STOIC Sapians or wise man over antiquity who was fully aware

68
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.100
of what constituted the sumo boardroom,

69
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.290
the supreme good and was utterly are enticed by everything else.

70
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.700
Um,
quote,
you know who the stoics were.
So this,
uh,
uh,

71
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.280
Weiss stoic man,
uh,

72
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.630
knew what the real good was and what was not valuable.

73
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.340
Guy [inaudible] gone with another quote from,

74
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400
from green to come to oneself was the phrase most used in connection with the

75
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:14.921
type of dissing Ganja we are considering here in signified it passing from

76
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:22.661
ignorance to knowledge and awakening from the falsity of one's dream on quote.

77
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.920
So you can see,
uh,
now,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,

78
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.740
the dialectic as it were between and guide you on this in Ganja deceit and on

79
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:40.770
the seat the seat,
uh,
on dissolution went un UN.

80
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.040
I'm coming to realize what is the true,

81
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.770
the following is the quote that I gave you at the end of the last class.

82
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.840
It was on the back of that map with the uh,
uh,

83
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.640
donkey Hotez a route,
uh,
on the way to uh,

84
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.400
Saragosa and then the,
uh,
swerve to Barcelona.

85
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.950
And it's the following and it is from Baltasar [inaudible]

86
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.610
Baltazar Garcia [inaudible] was a Jesuit who wrote about politics with on

87
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.810
rhetoric.
He lived between 1601 and 1658.

88
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.620
And he wrote a very famous allegorical novel,

89
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.550
an allegorical anomalies and normally with your character represent
obstructions,

90
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.190
reason,
truth and so forth.

91
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.580
And the novel is called Goody Gum.

92
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.890
<v 0>The big critic,</v>

94
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.610
uh,

95
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.530
here is a quote from that book is a quote that you have is a court about this

96
00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:08.364
and Ganja,

97
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.800
the most monstrous of all is the placing of deceit,

98
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.260
the seat at the world's front gate,

99
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.460
and this elution meant at the exit,

100
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.830
a disastrous handicap,

101
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.840
sufficient to ruin our life entirely since to make a misstep at the beginning of

102
00:08:28.651 --> 00:08:33.450
life causes one to lurch head long with greater speed,

103
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.440
speed each day and end up in order perdition.

104
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.490
Who made such an arrangement?
Who ordained it?

105
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.120
Now I am more convinced than ever that all is upside down in this world.

106
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.430
This illusion when should stand at the world's entrance,

107
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I should place himself immediately at the shoulder of the neo fight to free him

108
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.670
from the dangers that lie in.
Wait for him,

109
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.990
but since the newcomer,
bye bye,
bye.

110
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:08.991
An opposite and contrary arrangement makes his first encounter with deceit who

111
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.590
are the beginning,
presents everything to him in perverted and reversed order.

112
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.510
He heads for the left hand,
wrote on strides onto the structure.
As you can see,

113
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.180
this is a very allegorical.
The left hand wrote,

114
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:25.410
the left is always the bad sinister sinister admins left.
Uh,

115
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.280
this is why it has that connotation.
Uh,
the left road is,

116
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.190
is the bad road.
And uh,
so did you have,
uh,

117
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:39.030
uh,
deceit and disillusionment,
uh,
and he says,

118
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.350
is placing a deceit at the,

119
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.410
this is the door to life,
uh,
seat is here.

120
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.780
And then the end of life is the other deek visit.

121
00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:52.220
Emotion meant this is what he is saying.
Uh,

122
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.310
Garcia was very allegorical,
uh,
in his,
uh,

123
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.140
mode of thinking.

124
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

125
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.370
<v 0>The seats are all of Loki holders,</v>

126
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.780
illusions and those of the other characters in the novel,

127
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.030
while the thing Daniel is what they wind up or what they reach,

128
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.790
a disillusionment,

129
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.170
realizing that it is all vanity of vanities.

130
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.520
This is the reason why so much of what happens in part two is staged deceit is

131
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:32.361
the theatricality of so many events which are made up,

132
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.980
constructed the seed.

133
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.780
The seed is the dream of books that Don Quixote Dreams.

134
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.790
It is the unbroken chain of texts,
masking reality,

135
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.990
and even have language also masking reality.

136
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.290
So Don Quixote's dream of books,

137
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.190
these illusions about the,
uh,

138
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.290
Romances of [inaudible] and the knights of old is a deceit.

139
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.890
And disillusionment is coming to realize that it is,
that,

140
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.910
that it is nothing but it'd be seat.
Uh,
and the,

141
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:16.480
the unbroken chain of texts is because,
uh,
in Gnocchi halters mind,
uh,

142
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.490
uh,
one text leads to another,
leads to another,
leads to another.

143
00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:23.480
It's a humanist dream.
The humanists who had,

144
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.630
who were philologist lovers of language,
uh,
Star students of,
of,

145
00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:32.050
of the classics thought in terms of,

146
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.850
of texts leading to text,
leading to texts,
uh,

147
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.130
without ever getting to reality and of language of something that,

148
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.140
that has its own reality and whatever rogue does is,
uh,

149
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.700
undermined or of that and show that it is all a dream.

150
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.950
The best example

151
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.850
<v 1>of these pattern of deceit and disillusionment or of going from the seat to</v>

152
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.300
disillusionment is the play by Calderon de la Barca.

153
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:09.250
Life is a dream.
I have buddies name before on the board.
What?

154
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:11.170
I will do it again.
So do you remember him?

155
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:15.160
He's one of the classics of Spanish literature.

156
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.360
You can't see from there.

157
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.900
No Baraka Sob.

158
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.653
Bali.

159
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.790
<v 0>I am very fond of [inaudible] life is a dream because I wrote my entire doctoral</v>

160
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:48.040
dissertation about that play and uh,

161
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.280
it is one of the classics of Spanish literature in,

162
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.900
but play life is a dream and English prince [inaudible] door has been kept in a

163
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:06.061
tower since birth because an omen told his father king Basilio that say his moon

164
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:14.230
though would be a ruthless tyrant if he became,
if he ever became king.

165
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.730
So he has him grow up since he's a baby in a tower,

166
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.390
cared for by a glottal door and so forth

167
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.810
to put them into a test.
Basilio has a,

168
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.820
so he's Moonglow drugged and brought to the palace where when he awakens,

169
00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:40.690
he's treated like a king.
Confused.

170
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.200
Uh,
so he's Mondo act violently,

171
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.580
<v 2>uh,</v>

172
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.880
<v 0>tries to rape a woman,
throws a soldier off a balcony,</v>

173
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.960
uh,
and and so forth,
confirming the omen in a way.

174
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.910
<v 2>Uh,</v>

175
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.540
<v 0>so he's drugged and brought back to the power where,</v>

176
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.820
uh,
upon awakening,

177
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.240
he does not know if what happened in the Paris was true or just the dream.

178
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.810
Meanwhile,
the people who have found out about the,
his Mondo,
uh,
about,

179
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.010
say he's Moondance existence the people in the kingdom,

180
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.120
a revolt and come to get him to fight again,
his father.

181
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.070
So he's wound or hesitates because he does not know if this is another dream,

182
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:37.150
what decides to go with them and act prudently and just me this time because he

183
00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:43.730
realizes that even in dreams,
it is best to do the good

184
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.190
because if life is like a dream,
the only true life is a life after death.

185
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:50.681
He did,

186
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:55.681
throws his father but does not kill him and marries the woman he should marry,

187
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.250
not the one he had lost it after,
during his first day in the palace,

188
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.680
he controls his desires.

189
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.880
The message is that life may very well be like a dream in a platonic sense,

190
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.190
but even so,
one must behave morally.
As you can see,
uh,

191
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.910
the plot of the play which I have simplified,
goes from the seat,

192
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.850
the first visit to the palace to disillusionment.
Wednesday he's wounded,

193
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.880
Awakens back in the tower and wisdom when it comes to know that life is like a

194
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.720
dream as our political power,

195
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.960
the trappings of government on everything else.

196
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:46.740
The only thing that,
uh,
by the way that he knows what's true,
uh,

197
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.350
when he awakens in the tower is his love for this woman.

198
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.860
The only continuity is the emotion of love and those are the neoplatonic element

199
00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:59.560
in the play.
It's a more complicated play that I have just made it seem here.

200
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.440
We will,
we will have occasion,
uh,
we,

201
00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:06.040
we will,

202
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.040
we will see a very similar story when Santo becomes a ruler later in the green.

203
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.470
Becky haughty.
My suggestion here

204
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.330
is that the plot of the Quixote as a whole follows is similar outline from the

205
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.280
seed to this solution from an ganja to disingenuous.

206
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.700
We will have of course occasion to revisit this when we come to the end of the

207
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:43.300
novel.
But,
uh,
keep it in mind.

208
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.050
Also keep all of this in mind.
Also,

209
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:52.360
when you read for next week,
the wonderful,
uh,
story,

210
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.160
the Glass Graduate Ellison Seattle,

211
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.520
which you are to read for next week.
Next week we have a big week,

212
00:17:00.521 --> 00:17:05.170
we have the glass graduate and also we are going to be doing two of the main

213
00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:06.870
essays in the casebook,

214
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:11.910
the ones by Spitzer and by our back about whom I spoke in the last class

215
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.073
already.

216
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.890
So you should be prepared to read the essay of the enchanted Dulcinea and

217
00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:21.100
episode that we're going to be discussing here today.

218
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.030
This is where we can keep our course,
uh,

219
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.030
not going from the seat to the solution meant,

220
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.930
but we wide-eyed about everything from the very

221
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.003
<v 1>beginning.</v>

222
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.100
<v 0>So let us begin today as we move to the episodes in the Quixote,</v>

223
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.160
uh,
about the discussion of Don Quixote and Santo about night errands and saints

224
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.710
that I'm sure you remember first.
There is the extraordinary room,

225
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:57.420
my CD I made happening Hayley and comments by the narrator about the,

226
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:00.660
what the translator said,
uh,

227
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.830
or what the narrator said about see them at their wedding.
Haley,

228
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.970
but the reader does not,
does not know where these comments appeared.

229
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.280
And we talked about that in the last class.

230
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.770
They are not in in the text as it were,

231
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:18.771
but in a sort of metatech or virtual text that is not a running commentary about

232
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:22.260
the composition of the novel.
And this is one,

233
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:27.570
a new feature in part two that I mentioned before.

234
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.520
Now Saint Joe's subjects Don Quixote to rigorous cross examination and gets him

235
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:42.460
to say that saints are better than nights.

236
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.320
I'm sure you remember that.
Uh,

237
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.800
central has rhetorical skills as those Samsung who earlier had used them,

238
00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.390
had used forensic rec rhetoric to ease don Quixote's.

239
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.420
Sally sandstone may have acquired those skills in Salamanca,

240
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.080
but where did sent Joe learned them or anything else?

241
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:16.461
Where did essential learn rhetoric or it was all of this culture that he has in

242
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:22.440
his mind?
I think that the integration is that,

243
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:27.960
uh,
uh,
central has learned a great deal,
not just from donkey haughty,

244
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.810
which he does and we have seen,

245
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:34.290
but also from hearing sermons at Church,

246
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.310
which he mentions in his discussion with his wife.

247
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.940
The church is on this level,

248
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:46.941
part of popular culture or better Evie ego for the popularization of culture.

249
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.730
Saint George might not know how to read,

250
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:58.731
but he has a culture in his head that he has absorbed from the preachers.

251
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.330
This is one way to explain the evolution of sanctuary.
And he's,

252
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.980
uh,
increased,
uh,
uh,
intellectual,
uh,

253
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.640
on rhetorical,
uh,
powers.
Although of course,
uh,
he's,

254
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.380
he's,
he's he relationship with donkey hotels.
I will mention in a,
in a,

255
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.790
in a couple of minutes is obviously the most important,

256
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.630
the discussion per se,
the theme,

257
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:31.350
the topic of the discussion is very serious here too,

258
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.830
because he plays into a religious debates of the time in Spain who's background

259
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.830
is the reformation.

260
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.530
The debates have to do with good works and with predestination,

261
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.870
predestination and free will.
A

262
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.980
Protestant,
uh,
uh,

263
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.050
sided with predestination,
uh,
Catholicism or at least one,

264
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.470
uh,
one,
uh,
element within Catholicism,

265
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.150
the most important one for freewill.
So therefore,
if you have free will,

266
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.280
you could through good actions,
gain access to heaven.

267
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:19.290
Now this,
these are debates that to us is our secular age seem vacuous.

268
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.580
Uh,
but they were not in the 16th century at all.

269
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.380
There were of the upmost important.
So here in this discussion,

270
00:21:28.381 --> 00:21:32.070
it is not just a question of arms visit versus letters,

271
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.360
uh,
uh,
which is a set discussion piece,

272
00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:39.590
although there is a reminiscence of that here.
Uh,

273
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:44.630
but of good actions for their own sake and good actions for the sake of glory.

274
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:52.370
Sanctuary shows that the knights actions seem to be of this second kind actions

275
00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.510
to gain glory.
And this feeds into the topic of dissing Ganja and in Ganja.

276
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.030
So to perform actions for the sake of glory is to perform actions for the sake

277
00:22:06.031 --> 00:22:09.570
of deceit of in Ganja Gnocchi.

278
00:22:09.571 --> 00:22:14.571
Haltech counters by saying that they were knights who were saints.

279
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.520
Uh,
I suppose that he refers to St George particularly,

280
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.160
and ads that are not everyone can be a monk.

281
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.880
He says Cervantes is,

282
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.430
I think pity is relativistic and liberal take on life,

283
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.910
which is not antireligious against the religious zealots of the time.

284
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.000
I think through this discussion of his characters.

285
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.720
So the discussion has a contemporary relevancy that is political as well as

286
00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:45.924
religious.

287
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.260
And this is connected to what I said in one of my earlier lectures about the

288
00:22:51.511 --> 00:22:56.511
fact that part two is the first political novel because religious and religion

289
00:22:57.181 --> 00:23:00.240
and politics were intertwined,
uh,

290
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.740
in this pain of the 16th and 17th century with all the caveats that we have

291
00:23:04.741 --> 00:23:07.920
learned,
uh,
uh,
by reading Elliot.

292
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.960
So this discussion of the two characters about this issue is consonant with the

293
00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:18.420
political side of part two.

294
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.380
I want to underline that so that you have that clear in your mind.

295
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

296
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.530
<v 0>Now,</v>

297
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:30.530
central also demonstrates as he has before and as he will increasingly that he

298
00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:36.030
is endowed with natural reason,
natural reason,

299
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.593
uh,

300
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:42.360
which can lead him to understand sufficiently the most difficult questions.

301
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.610
Natural reason is,
is a medieval

302
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.360
that survives through the renaissance and reaches the enlightenment,

303
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.740
which underscores God's gift of sufficient reason to every individual,

304
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.840
no matter what his station in life.

305
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.670
To understand the fundamental question of issues of life,

306
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.040
this will become an important topic in part to natural resource.

307
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:19.860
And sanctuary will be the exemplar of this.

308
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.860
It is a theological construct.

309
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.623
<v 2>Now</v>

310
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.810
<v 0>one can see of course that uh,
that because,
uh,
uh,</v>

311
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.590
saint Jo has been influenced by donkey haughty,

312
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.100
their arguments are like discussions the night could be having within himself or

313
00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:43.380
with himself.

314
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.480
What is the significance of their mutual influence?

315
00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.980
I think that to propose a concept of the self as relational,

316
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.440
not as individual or isolated,

317
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.040
not,
I think therefore I am the god of course,

318
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.560
which comes a little later.
Uh,
not so much.

319
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.510
I think therefore I am as I relate to others and myself emerges from that

320
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:26.480
commerce or dialogue with others.

321
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.020
This is what they can hope that through this relationship between these two

322
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:33.050
characters seems to be suggesting.

323
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:35.751
Now,
of course,

324
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:40.751
this is a very profound philosophical statement or suggestion,

325
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.943
uh,

326
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.390
but it is also crucial in the development of modern fiction.

327
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.690
Think of huck and Jim in huckleberry Finn a of their dialogues and have their

328
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:57.080
influence on each other.
Think of doc,
uh,
of,
of,

329
00:25:57.081 --> 00:25:59.630
of Holmes and Dr. Watson.

330
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:04.631
To give you an example from popular culture and even of those Faulknerian

331
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.080
characters that seem to overlap and blend into each other.

332
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:11.750
To the point that you sometimes don't know who's really speaking to one of these

333
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.520
Faulkner's novels,

334
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.730
you don't because of these characters consciousness of sort of blended and and

335
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.330
the individuality has been eroded and this is what I'm suggesting is happening

336
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:28.331
here in Gnocchi Day and sanctuary and why this argument is one that [inaudible]

337
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.790
could have had within himself.

338
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.870
Now this discussion also brings up Doki hottest knowledge of classical Rome and

339
00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:41.080
its architecture.

340
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:47.310
Rome is the par excellence in the renaissance and its architecture was the model

341
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:50.880
for renaissance architect.

342
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.410
This shows remember that Cervantes spent what a bit of time in Italy,

343
00:26:58.771 --> 00:27:00.630
so when he speaks of Rome,

344
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.830
he's speaking not only a of things he had read about in books,

345
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:06.420
but also thinks that he has seen

346
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:14.500
now these shelves or Don Quixote is a humanist that he has read beyond the

347
00:27:14.501 --> 00:27:15.940
romances of chivalry.

348
00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.960
In part two we are beginning to enlarge Doki halters library.

349
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.560
We cannot reduce it to the romances of chivalry that we found with the barber

350
00:27:26.441 --> 00:27:30.460
and priest and uh,
in,
in the s the scrutiny of the books.
But he bought,

351
00:27:30.461 --> 00:27:33.270
he had read other things.
Uh,

352
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.510
you don't,
so anticipate part two,

353
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.240
part two's projection beyond Spain.

354
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:46.150
I say beyond Spain because us don't be haughty.
And Santiago to Barcelona,

355
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.390
they are moving to a part of Spain that is almost not Spain

356
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:56.580
Babylonia being even today a part of Spain that uh,

357
00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.440
it's,
it's very independent in its culture and,

358
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.310
and has and has in fact,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

359
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.030
tried to become independent thought several times.
So,
uh,
uh,

360
00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:10.380
and also of course the,
the,

361
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.610
the battles that you will see at the end of the book beyond the shores of

362
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:18.380
Barcelona are a move beyond,
uh,
uh,

363
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.040
the borders of Spain.

364
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.090
So this projection towards Italy is important in that respect.

365
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:29.930
But also this discussion points out that architecture is an important issue in

366
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:35.700
part to,
uh,
you send important,
uh,
issue.

367
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.640
Uh,
because,
uh,
as I have mentioned before,

368
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.140
a great deal of part two takes place indoors in,
in houses and mansions.

369
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:47.740
And so forth,
uh,
in part to,
uh,
uh,

370
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.110
we have less,

371
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.140
although there are some of those two places that I mentioned in a part one the

372
00:28:54.661 --> 00:28:57.180
desk,
blah,
blah,
blah,
this blah,
blah,
blah.

373
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.050
This boy brow the unpopulated.
Remember that that is a even illegal,
uh,

374
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:11.010
concept,
that area where the law does not reach,

375
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.450
uh,
on the other one that I didn't put on the board.

376
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:19.550
But you must have seen the word many times.
These are the solid bodies.

377
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.610
So they now this are,
uh,
what'd you are out in the wild?

378
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

379
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:32.070
<v 0>There's less of this impart to a more of shelter,</v>

380
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.040
more of architecture.

381
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.630
And this is why the discussion on Roman architecture is important,
uh,

382
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.020
above all in the context of,
of,
of,
of,

383
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:48.260
of humanism and the renaissance and the copying of Rome,
uh,

384
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.450
Rome's architecture.

385
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:52.690
And then of course the development of what would become baroque architecture.

386
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.610
And that scheme that I gave you about buying a plaza sterling memorial,

387
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.870
you blend them,
uh,
forced them together and you get the baroque.

388
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.093
<v 2>No,</v>

389
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:11.090
<v 0>this emphasis on cities brings us to the entry into El Toro Rosso.</v>

390
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.073
<v 2>MMM.</v>

391
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.380
<v 0>The third,
Sally takes place at night.</v>

392
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:19.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

393
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.440
<v 0>And at night goes,
a day goes by and then at night they enter this,
the,
the town,</v>

394
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:29.090
the village of a divorcee.
Uh,
and uh,
being at night,

395
00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.050
uh,
this anticipates much of the mood of part two.

396
00:30:33.051 --> 00:30:36.590
Remember part one began,
uh,
dawn,

397
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.830
um,
don't get hauled down San Jo,
uh,

398
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.960
one to arrive in the town at night,
so it's not to be noticed.

399
00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:50.450
And that night is called in,
in the Spanish.
Ooh,
not Norcia.
In three,
Clara,

400
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:56.180
uh,
at night that was not quite a dark one.
Says,
uh,
Jarvis.
Uh,

401
00:30:56.181 --> 00:30:57.190
and this,
uh,

402
00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:02.230
I underlined because of the concept of Chiaroscuro that I mentioned before,

403
00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:06.410
the concept of Chiaroscuro,
uh,
as,
uh,
something,
uh,

404
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.820
proper,
but road that Norcia in the retail Herrera,

405
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.230
there's darkness.
Sounds

406
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.680
<v 2>okay.</v>

407
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.600
<v 0>Dogs Barking,
donkeys,
brain swine grunting cards.</v>

408
00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:31.400
Mewing Miellyn a plow being dragged.
Uh,

409
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.040
that is an eagerness to his town augmented by this,
uh,

410
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:40.100
by the sound the farm had the farm they meet is singing a song about a great

411
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.310
defeat defeat,
which adds to the,
the omens,

412
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.700
the bad omens sounds as opposed to visual science appear before them.

413
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.530
In part one we had the fooling hammers,

414
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.300
but in part two there will be many more sounds.
Uh,
as you will see,

415
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.490
this sounds here are scary by virtue of the fact that you cannot see their

416
00:32:02.491 --> 00:32:03.151
source.

417
00:32:03.151 --> 00:32:07.830
You could only hear seeing is going to be a different problem in part two

418
00:32:07.831 --> 00:32:09.690
because of the increasing darkness.

419
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:16.340
This is the first time that Don Quixote on central come into a town and it

420
00:32:16.341 --> 00:32:19.940
anticipates the enter into Barcelona as a city,

421
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.990
a great city towards the end of the novel.
What is the significance of this?

422
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.220
I have mentioned this,

423
00:32:25.221 --> 00:32:30.221
the novel which develops from the Quixote will be for the most part on urban

424
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.370
jar,
the jar.
How about often about cities?

425
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.600
Modern cities and don't keyholders influence on the history of the novel

426
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.620
includes this,
uh,
urban park of,
uh,

427
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.140
of the Quixote,

428
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:50.060
particularly as you will see you when you get to the Barcelona chapters here.

429
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:55.061
It also appears as a haunted city with blind alleys and people by strangers the

430
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.810
the farm had,
who do not know,
uh,
anything about it.

431
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.680
The farm hand is an outsider who cannot give them directions.

432
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:09.490
I have always been always been parceled and sort of even scared by these farm

433
00:33:09.701 --> 00:33:14.090
hand in the middle of night who doesn't even know where he is.

434
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.750
And I think I know why and if you will allow me a little anecdote.

435
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:22.751
I was lost in the Pennsylvania turnpike at night once trying to find the town in

436
00:33:22.911 --> 00:33:26.630
probably called Indiana,
Pennsylvania,
where I was giving a lecture.

437
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.620
I got off the turnpike and I was lost,
uh,

438
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:34.510
in little towns in Pennsylvania,
were dark with little lights.
I A,

439
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.990
I drove my rented car,
uh,

440
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.710
towards the sidewalk sidewalk because I saw a man coming.

441
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.880
I lowered the window and I said,
could you tell me how to get to the turnpike?

442
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:48.740
And he went,
I'm deaf,
I'm deaf as,
Oh God,

443
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.510
he's deaf.
He can't help me.

444
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.010
I raised the window and I followed and I found a little gas station with one

445
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:59.300
little light bulb.
And I,
and I got off the car and this guy came out.

446
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.710
We only one eye.
He had a hole on the other side,
said this guy can't help me.

447
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.290
And so I was lost for hours.

448
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.560
They were about to send for the National Guard.

449
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:13.190
I finally found,
uh,
Indiana,
uh,

450
00:34:13.191 --> 00:34:15.350
of Pennsylvania where I was lodged in a,

451
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.470
in a holiday inn with a Mexican motif.

452
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.330
And I was given the Taco Room.
So,

453
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:23.780
so this is,

454
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.200
this is my anecdote and this is what brings to mind this farm hand who appears

455
00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:31.551
in the middle of the night.

456
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:35.810
I can be of any help because he doesn't know anything.
He's not from there.

457
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:42.490
So,
uh,
there are deep,
uh,

458
00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:47.810
residences to me of Spanish mysticism in this dark night of the soul to echo

459
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:54.330
Saint John of the cross,
the great Spanish mystic poet.

460
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:59.680
It's the name of one of his great poems,
Nachi Scooter,
the landmark.

461
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:07.190
It recalls seeing the depths of the soul in the darkness of night.

462
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.760
Sam Cho is actually looking for a memory that is the lie,

463
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.270
the story he made up about going to a torso,

464
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:25.280
remembering something that he does know that he knows those not existence.

465
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.630
Trying to remember something that he knows does not exist so it made up memory

466
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.990
and Don Quixote is looking for a non existent lady who is the object of his

467
00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:36.314
devotion.

468
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.960
Both protagonists are searching for intangibles in the dark of night as as as if

469
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:47.940
it were within their troubled spirits and this is the,

470
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.980
I think the impression that this whole torso at night conveys

471
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.480
right away we come upon the line that has inspired much useless commentary when

472
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.770
looking for Doosan air.
They run into the church.

473
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.480
The line in Spanish reads going like less shy.

474
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.370
Most daughter or son Joel Jarvis translates.

475
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.900
We are come to the church.

476
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:20.901
Central modern readers have have seen in in that sentence a hidden meaning that

477
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:25.440
he said Cervantes is decry.

478
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.210
The interference of the church in all affairs and the line has even become a

479
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:31.680
standard phrase in Spanish.

480
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:34.530
To see that you have come against some obstacle going,

481
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:38.130
like going like Alicia Masato sanctuary when you come against some obstacle,

482
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:41.160
particularly when you are denied something or other.

483
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:45.620
I think that it's only because of the rhythm of the,
of,
of,

484
00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:49.070
of the way the sentence is written,
not Ms. Dot.
Logan Alessia,
Sandra,

485
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.910
what colleague?
Lecia Mcdonald's.
Andrew.

486
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:52.680
But it doesn't have anything to do with that.

487
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.050
This is why I mean that it is useless,

488
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:59.010
but it has remained in the Spanish language as a readymade phrase.

489
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.740
Uh,
I think that what is significant here is that Lucy Nass,

490
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.980
Hassell has morphed into the church that in looking in the dark for duty castle,

491
00:37:12.841 --> 00:37:17.841
they have found a church or the church in the gloom where things are difficult

492
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:22.050
to identify sanctuary scared because he knows that the cemeteries are around

493
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:24.960
churches and he doesn't want to be in a cemetery at night.

494
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.960
This could be a telling transformation,

495
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:33.590
perhaps an indication that don Quixote's love is a kind of religion or more

496
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:38.601
likely given what will happen over and again in part two is an intimation of

497
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:44.310
death of which there are many in this eerie chapter,

498
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.820
this ghostly 19 Ilta worship,
uh,

499
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:53.930
the first adventure in part two sets the tone for the rest of the novel.

500
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.910
So now we move to the chapter.

501
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.690
We're not going to go through every single chapter as I've mentioned before,

502
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:06.180
but here we moved to the a very important chapter.

503
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.280
The one on the enchanted Dulcinea is important,

504
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:15.030
not only because it inspired our backs,

505
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.210
fables essay on the enchanted do scenario that you will be reading,

506
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.600
but also it is a chapter that will play an important role later in one of the

507
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:27.840
most important episodes,
uh,
of part two,

508
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:28.980
one of the whole Quixote,

509
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.120
the episode of the Cave of Montesinos where this enchanted duty.

510
00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:37.660
Now we'll come back.
Uh,
so

511
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.143
first of all,

512
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.320
it is one episode in which we notice once again,

513
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:49.321
but very dramatically an exchange of roles between donkey healthy and Santo.

514
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:50.500
Uh,

515
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:55.500
the first time was when Sanchez played the role of Don Quixote to his wife who

516
00:38:56.591 --> 00:39:00.580
was playing his own role in that,
in that hilarious dialogue that they had.

517
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.780
But here,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,
the exchange of roles,
uh,

518
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.720
is much more,
uh,
uh,
a dramatic,

519
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.570
the first thing to notice is Sanchez Shakespearian monologue,

520
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.270
uh,

521
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.780
that dramatizes is inner conflicts and reveals his apprehensions about donkey

522
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:24.190
Quixote.
He doesn't know quite what to do.

523
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.120
He is Sanchez here like a rustic hamlet to be or not to be.

524
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:36.580
Uh,
he,
he weighs the various options that he has.
And,

525
00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:40.900
uh,
he ops for trying to fool don Quixote with the,

526
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:45.130
uh,
with the,
uh,
uh,
trick of the,
uh,
of,

527
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:47.390
of turning this peasant women into scenario,

528
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:53.320
centuries becoming a fuller character and increasingly important to the novel.

529
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.370
He is one of the pranksters who fooled Okie hotel.

530
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.730
He will be in the sense like,
uh,

531
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.760
Samsung Carrasco unlike the Duke Stewart who will appear later also sanctuary

532
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.290
separated from his master here,

533
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.320
asked when he went to deliver the letter in part one.

534
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.940
But this prefigures several important episodes in part two in which they are

535
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:19.390
separated and central place,
uh,

536
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.260
the role of the protagonist of his own part.
Uh,

537
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.790
but the most important thing about this Shakespearean monologue as I call it,

538
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.720
is that we are exposed,
uh,
here to Sanchez inner world,

539
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.800
his world of doubts.
Yeah.

540
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:39.100
Then of course there is the inversion of Rowe sanctuary is the one trying to

541
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:40.390
convince his master,

542
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:45.030
but what they see is not everyday reality but something drawn from what you've

543
00:40:45.031 --> 00:40:48.890
added with romances.
And He,
he does a pretty good imitation of don Quixote,

544
00:40:48.891 --> 00:40:53.891
his own rhetoric in trying to convince him that this wench is a [inaudible].

545
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.540
So reality was no Quixote perceives as it is,

546
00:40:58.541 --> 00:41:03.541
conspires spontaneously or arranged by someone to appear as on real literary

547
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.183
artificial.

548
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.770
Hence the episode depends on the memory of part one and have similar episodes

549
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:12.933
here.

550
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.900
I think that the episode in the background is that of the windmills setting

551
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:24.050
version.
It is here.
Gnocchi,
Oklahoma.
Who says what?
Giants.
Oh,
what do you,

552
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.020
where is Lucy now?
What do you mean?
Boosie now

553
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.660
that is the episode in the background here.
Now the peasant,
uh,

554
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.010
last,
uh,

555
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.780
react to Santos rhetoric a little bit like the prostitutes in the first in a

556
00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.080
will they react to the hotel door,

557
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:46.720
the prostitutes in the first inward kind of to look.
Quixote done this done this,

558
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.670
uh,
uh,
uh,

559
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.490
peasant women here who are very upset because they think that opera class,
uh,

560
00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.450
uh,
young men or men are making fun of them.

561
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:02.030
This is really a truly hilarious episode.
Uh,

562
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.560
one that makes me laugh if I said that's I said the last time,
uh,

563
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.120
every time I reread it,
particularly the part about,
uh,

564
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:13.370
[inaudible] smelling of garlic,
um,
um,

565
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.570
which I would mention again.
Uh,

566
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:21.100
but there is also the issue of see Nas bodily hair

567
00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.390
specifically in donkey halters interpretation.

568
00:42:28.391 --> 00:42:30.550
Do See Nass pubic hair.

569
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.423
<v 2>MMM.</v>

570
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.890
<v 0>If we go to page</v>

571
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.470
five 30 by 31,

572
00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.770
Sandra is talking and he says,

573
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:50.220
uh,
by which we might have guests.

574
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:55.310
Well,
what was hid beneath that course?
This guy's,

575
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.100
he's talking about her body,
not to say the truth to me.

576
00:42:58.101 --> 00:43:02.870
She did not appear in the list be formed,
but rather all beauty.

577
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:08.110
And that increased to buy a mole she had on her right lip lack a whisker with

578
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:12.680
seven or eight hairs on it,

579
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:16.490
like threads of gold and above is span long.

580
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:20.510
Tom Harris as Mo.

581
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.280
This is a Berlanti answer by donkey whole day.

582
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.760
According to the correspondence,

583
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:30.330
there is between the moles of the face and those of the body don't see,

584
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.830
I should have another on the bronze of her thigh,

585
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:38.890
the inner part of her thigh on the same side with that,

586
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:40.040
uh,
on her face.

587
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.600
But Harrison of the lens you mentioned are somewhat of the longest.

588
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:47.890
The formals just are going to show your worship bouncers,
Sandra,

589
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.440
that there they were and look to see if they had been born with her.

590
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.580
I believe in friends that don't get hot there for nature has placed nothing

591
00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:59.200
about Nokia for nature,
has placed nothing about [inaudible],

592
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:03.790
but what is finished and perfect and therefore how Chia hundred moles like those

593
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:07.570
you speak of in their,
uh,
in her,

594
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.620
in her they would not be moles,
but news under splendid stars.

595
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.513
<v 2>Uh,</v>

596
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.750
<v 0>the description is to be mindful of course,
of meritorious,</v>

597
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.760
but there is something specific about a hairy dude [inaudible] bodily hair,

598
00:44:26.911 --> 00:44:29.910
huh?
A lot of hair was taken.
Venice,

599
00:44:29.911 --> 00:44:32.640
an indication of a sexuality

600
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.200
all have a strong sexual drive.

601
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.870
These and other hints,
there will be other hints on there have been others.

602
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.430
You can look them up in my book love and the law instead of scientists of bodily

603
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:52.431
hair on Lucinia and other women mustaches and so forth,

604
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.720
look for them.
Now as you read the book and believe me,
they are there,

605
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.580
haven't invented them.
Uh,

606
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.160
these and other hints reveal a story behind the story here that I have hinted at

607
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:05.994
before.

608
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.980
What lurks beneath Donkey Quixote's courtly love style for those scenarios is

609
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:15.981
the sexual desire of an Aristocrat for a peasant last presumed to be of ardent

610
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:23.121
sexuality who promises to provide more pleasure than the women of his class.

611
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.180
That is a literary tradition behind this that reaches back to the Spanish

612
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:34.950
balance.
But he's also quite alive instead of anthesis time,

613
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.350
at least two of the ones,
conquests,
you know,

614
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.930
who don't want to answer the figure of the wand and womanizer and so forth who

615
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:47.150
first appeared in TV.
So there Molina's play.
I've mentioned the fact that the,

616
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.670
the one figure is one of the figure created in the Spanish golden age by dear.

617
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.510
So the Molina,
I better put his name on to,
uh,

618
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.320
he is the inventor of their own,

619
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.290
one figure of great,

620
00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.530
uh,
legacy then in literature and music and so forth.

621
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.280
At least two of the ones conquest in,

622
00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:14.970
in digital Molina's play the tricks there of Seville are from the lower classes.

623
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.050
One of the Pesach and the other,
a Fisher woman.

624
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.650
That dual scenario in this scene also underscores her physical prowess.

625
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.353
By the way,

626
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:29.360
she mounts her donkey by taking the little run back to get some momentum and uh,

627
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.740
leaving on it from behind and writing it as strike like a man.

628
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:39.780
It's a very sexual and vulgar gesture that you make that I find absolutely

629
00:46:39.781 --> 00:46:43.520
hilarious.
And then when Santo says,
Oh my God,
she's quite a horseman,

630
00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:48.010
she could teach a quarter or a Mexican to,
to ride a horse the way that she,

631
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.080
she leaps on it.

632
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:54.081
And she just goes on also by her smell of raw garlic,

633
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.160
uh,
which,
uh,
Jarvis translates as on digested garlic,

634
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:04.410
which reveals her coarseness and also,
but her proximity to food,

635
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.410
food and sex go together.

636
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:13.590
Now I know that of course garlic doesn't sound very sexy to anybody anymore or

637
00:47:13.591 --> 00:47:16.380
ever perhaps.
But this is the intimation,

638
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.550
the whole transformation of dual scenario.

639
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.700
We'll leave a deep imprint in the nights subconscious as we shall see in the

640
00:47:26.581 --> 00:47:28.650
episode of Montesinos his cave.

641
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:33.940
But now don Quixote on Santo are about to meet theater on the road.

642
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:37.870
This road that in part two appears to be full,

643
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.900
nor have real characters as of characters and objects playing roles or this guy

644
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.270
or something else other than what they are.

645
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.830
So the meet now the cart of the parliament of death,

646
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:57.580
which is a card carrying actors who have finished putting on a play in one town

647
00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:02.470
and go to another nearby to repeat the performance.
Hence they have not changed,

648
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.090
uh,
uh,
out of their costumes.

649
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.890
The play that they stage the they stage is a kind that you have already met

650
00:48:08.891 --> 00:48:13.210
before.
The very briefly in the resource and Marcella episode,

651
00:48:13.211 --> 00:48:15.730
if you remember that episode,

652
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:20.880
[inaudible] was said to write the out of Sacramento outdoors,

653
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:22.980
sacrum sacrament,
Dallas.

654
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.733
<v 2>MMM.</v>

655
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.740
<v 0>These are the religious place performed,
uh,</v>

656
00:48:45.741 --> 00:48:47.600
on the day of Corpus Christi.

657
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:53.000
The feast in honor of the Eucharist or communion,
celebrate it on a Thursday,

658
00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:56.770
on the 60th day after Easter.
Therefore,
it,
uh,

659
00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:00.410
it's,
uh,
um,
uh,
go here with the,

660
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:05.270
with the chronology of the novel is taking place in summer.
So,
uh,

661
00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.990
Corpus Christi a communion,

662
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.050
the Eucharist is celebrated in this,
uh,

663
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:17.110
in this feast every year on a part of the feast was the performance of this

664
00:49:18.111 --> 00:49:21.560
place.
Uh,
uh,

665
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.070
which always deal with the topic of the Eucharist,
the mystery of the Eucharist,

666
00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:31.090
the transformation or body of Christ body into blog and into wine and bread.

667
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.870
They usually have plots,
uh,
drawn from scripture,

668
00:49:38.871 --> 00:49:40.340
but also blood's drawn from,

669
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.580
from classical mythology.
This,

670
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:48.080
this outdoors weren't a medieval retention in every sense.

671
00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:52.890
And now think of what I said about the baroque going back to the middle age,

672
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.230
just jumping over back over the renaissance.
This is a medieval retention.

673
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.240
The out to Sacramento,

674
00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:03.110
there were one act plays performed on carts.
Precisely.

675
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.800
They are carrying themselves on the cart and they also carrying with the cart

676
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:13.370
the stage because the way that is outdoors where performed,

677
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:17.840
uh,
where if you have a town square,

678
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:24.370
say the church is here,
uh,
all their buildings and so forth,

679
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.790
uh,
the carts were put one,

680
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.110
if there were two or three,

681
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.840
one for each scene and then the people was,
uh,
would be here.

682
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.590
The performance to place on the carts and elaborate,

683
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:47.360
uh,
uh,
props,
um,
and uh,
uh,

684
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:52.100
and,
and scenery,
uh,
were created on the carts because he's plays,

685
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.670
uh,
represented cosmic events.
So the world,

686
00:50:55.671 --> 00:50:58.550
I mean the universe does Doris and so forth,
it would appear.

687
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.880
And then when the play was finished,

688
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.190
this was a very modest played with only one cart.

689
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.500
The cart's would move on to the next town.

690
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:11.540
So they were carrying with him the,
uh,
their stage and not only themselves,

691
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:16.340
but also their stage.
Um,
they,
they,
uh,

692
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.820
they were simply enough so that all the people could understand them,

693
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:25.330
but sophisticated in versification imagery of theological content.

694
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:26.950
God,
they don't.
Delivery.

695
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:30.820
[inaudible] was the most famous author of outdoor sacrament,

696
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:35.570
but many other poets and playwrights wrote them,
including Lopa,
the Vega,

697
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:39.320
who was the author of the one mentioned in this episode,

698
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.730
the last quarter's they'll a Morton,

699
00:51:42.731 --> 00:51:46.740
which is a real one act play by Lopez Rega.
Uh,

700
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:51.290
translate it here as the courts or parliament of,
of death in the play.

701
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.340
Man With a capital m remembers an allegorical play,

702
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:56.743
um,

703
00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:02.000
is subjected to a trial after having been tempted by the devil.

704
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.610
This is where the devil appears here.
Uh,

705
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:09.700
I know their figure is that of madness represented by the actor who spooks resy

706
00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:14.270
Nantais with this bells and bladders.
You remember this one who came,

707
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.190
who comes after they have had their dialogue and his has a stick with some,

708
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.750
the beginning they didn't have balloons because of course there was no plastic

709
00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:25.340
to make them.
So they made a,

710
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:28.250
they made these balloons out of their bladders of slain animals.

711
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:33.260
So bladders and belts and he plays,
he plays madness.

712
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.940
The most famous of these outposts was one by Calderon called the great theater

713
00:52:40.581 --> 00:52:42.280
of the world.
Uh,

714
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:47.420
whose theme was that of the world as a stage where man performs life as if it

715
00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:52.931
were a play before going on to the real life after death at the end of the play,

716
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:59.180
the one performed by these players in this,
uh,
episode of [inaudible],
uh,

717
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:03.910
uh,
who,
by the way,
we're a real company of actors,
uh,

718
00:53:03.911 --> 00:53:06.920
of the time.
It's very much along the lines of the,

719
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:10.340
of the great theater of the world.
But,
but the,

720
00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.270
the conceit here is that of a trial,
uh,
four man.

721
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:19.460
So this is what is in the background of this,
uh,
of the scene.

722
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:20.893
Um,

723
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.680
so theatricality is an important element in part because of what I mentioned.

724
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:31.770
Theatricality is part of the deceit that would lead to the same ganja.

725
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.080
Uh,
but it's also,

726
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.100
you will also find that at the end where he knows their parsimony appears as a

727
00:53:38.101 --> 00:53:43.080
puppet master death who appears here as,

728
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.250
as part of the ensemble of actors because death was an allegorical figure that

729
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:50.200
appeared in this,
uh,
uh,
uh,

730
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.540
is also important in part two and is a medieval retention.

731
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.230
So is the devil.
Uh,

732
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:01.230
everyone here is in costume including of course,
Don Quixote.

733
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.460
Reality is already play illusion.

734
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.280
There is no need for donkey halted to misinterpreted,

735
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:13.140
but notice the subtlety that the place then assume their roles.
In reality,

736
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.760
the devil begins the madness begins to play madness,
uh,

737
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:21.120
in the reality of Don Quixote.
Uh,

738
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.493
<v 1>okay.</v>

739
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.150
<v 0>The devil plays a trick on sanctuary and the presence of death even in how they</v>

740
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:30.301
go.

741
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:35.301
Wrinkled dress is frightening and a reality is buried beneath a layer of uh,

742
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:41.180
various forms of representation and man dressed as a literary character meets

743
00:54:41.181 --> 00:54:43.820
men and women dressed as literary characters.

744
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:48.020
The devil who still central's donkey parodies,
donkey,

745
00:54:48.021 --> 00:54:50.610
haughty and his fall from Racine.

746
00:54:50.611 --> 00:54:55.611
Auntie here is a madman facing an actor playing the role of madness because if

747
00:54:56.241 --> 00:55:01.100
reality were offering don Quixote a mirror of his own deranged self,

748
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:05.840
this is something that will happen over and again in part two,
we will meet it.

749
00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.400
We would meet,
uh,

750
00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:12.140
we'll find another example very soon when Gnocchi Quixote meets the night of the

751
00:55:12.141 --> 00:55:16.970
mirrors,
life is play acting as donkey Hilton says,

752
00:55:16.971 --> 00:55:20.930
using a word that you are now familiar with.
He says,
Yo,

753
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:26.170
Digo [inaudible] Badadada Luga I'll Destin,

754
00:55:27.381 --> 00:55:30.920
Ganja.
That's what it says in the original and your is those reasonably well.

755
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:35.470
He says,
and I say now that it is absolutely necessary.
There's no Quixote,
uh,

756
00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:40.570
if one would be on the thieved this in Ghana to lay one hands upon appearances

757
00:55:41.241 --> 00:55:44.840
to see if they that they are appearances.
Cervantes by the way,

758
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:48.770
is punning here because in the Spanish of the 17th century,

759
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:53.830
I party NCS also meant stage props when when God their own wrote instructions

760
00:55:56.450 --> 00:56:00.800
for the carpenters to make the stage,
he called those memorial.

761
00:56:00.801 --> 00:56:05.100
The [inaudible] answers were stage props.
So by these pumps,

762
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.660
advantage is underlying.
[inaudible] is on their lining.

763
00:56:08.661 --> 00:56:13.661
The theatrical quality of this episode on of the quote unquote a reality.

764
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:16.330
Two things,
uh,

765
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:20.660
important to remark and remember from this scene is that Don Quixote meets an

766
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:25.350
image of his madness.
Something will happen throughout part too.

767
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.670
And it is kind of a point of madness where madness reflects madness,

768
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.870
madness for us as readers do.
And the press also,

769
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:38.260
we must remember the presence of death,
which is a warning against it.

770
00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.970
The seats offered by life,

771
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:45.040
death devalues all of the allures of life with its presses.

772
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.320
And we have met before in a torso when,
uh,
they,

773
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.910
uh,
bump against the church to put it in.
Uh,
finally,

774
00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.980
uh,
the,
uh,
loop of the story here of this little story of this episode,

775
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:05.370
goals from deceit to disillusionment from Engonnia to this in Ganja,

776
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:10.600
if Mikko me Kona and the process by which our story was concocted,

777
00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:12.940
it was like a representation of representation.

778
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:18.810
The episode of the cart of the parliament of death is representation in motion

779
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.730
or actually representation even on wheels.

780
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.773
One could say,

781
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:31.770
I want to close by reading you a little vignette that I wrote as an epilogue to

782
00:57:32.591 --> 00:57:36.020
this episode.
Uh,
I've told you that,
uh,

783
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:41.090
professors and critics can hardly resist that temptation of crossing the line

784
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:47.110
and becoming writers.
And this is the by various,
my very modest,
uh,

785
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:51.280
falling into that,
uh,
into that trap.
Uh,

786
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:55.930
it goes like this is very brief and very silly.
Now I say we read it,

787
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:58.030
but I think that it'll give you a laugh.

788
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:03.870
Satisfied after recovering Sanchez donkey from the wild devil who had stolen it,

789
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.840
ingest to mock them Quixote.

790
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:13.000
Our pair got back on the road on their journey to Saragosa.

791
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.500
They had not traveled very much.
When they saw in the distance,

792
00:58:16.501 --> 00:58:21.501
a cloud of dust kicked up by what seemed like a large contingent of horsemen.

793
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:26.140
Only that from a farther mounds looked enormous,

794
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:29.590
fit more for giants done for men.

795
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:33.280
They brought Nantais and the donkey to a halt,

796
00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:38.580
shaded their eyes with their hands and peered into the approaching murky mass,

797
00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:44.350
unable to discern what it contained as when he first saw the cart with the

798
00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:47.300
players.
Don't be hot.
There was brimming with anticipation.

799
00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.840
These had the makings of a superb adventure,

800
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:54.010
fit for his new stature as a knight who's exploit had already been the object of

801
00:58:54.011 --> 00:58:56.500
a book as the strange contingent.

802
00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:01.150
Jr Don Quixote and Sandra were astonished to discover it to the cover that it

803
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:04.300
consisted of a brightly dressed man in Morris dress,

804
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:09.340
sitting atop a huge camel and covered by agreeing canopy.

805
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:11.830
He was comfortably positioned in a,

806
00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:16.060
on a lavish saddle with his legs crossed or which he cried.

807
00:59:16.061 --> 00:59:20.470
A cradled a device that our heroes could not see behind him.

808
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:22.490
Road in splendid dromedary,

809
00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:25.520
a younger man dressed as a Maurisco.

810
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:30.880
He too was covered by a parasol yellow in his case and was in a seminar position

811
00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:36.341
and creating something in a fashion similar to the man on the front who was

812
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:40.820
obviously his master.
They were surrounded by a troop of men on horses.

813
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.680
Well armed and carrying banners.

814
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.740
Both parties stopped and gaze at each other in wonder.

815
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:50.960
Lucky hot was the first to speak my dear.
Sir,
would you please state your name,

816
00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:54.980
nation and mission as I suspect by your garb and weapons that it could not be a

817
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:58.370
good one in which case I must challenge you to single combat.

818
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:03.230
The gentleman somewhat plumping,
placid in appearance did not look,

819
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.040
did not look up from the device on which he seemed to be tapping with both hands

820
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:07.881
at length.

821
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:12.881
He lifted his head and answered the night in an incomprehensible gibberish that

822
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:17.060
demand behind him on the dromedary interpreted nearly at once as follows,

823
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.930
my dear don Quixote that Amanda,
I am seeding,

824
01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.980
admitted binning Hayley author of your story and your Creator and the man behind

825
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:30.350
me is my translator who is transcribing in Spanish.

826
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.530
What I right here in this laptop in Arabic,

827
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:39.460
he said this without stopping his typing for how he don saw the whole scene

828
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:41.660
would have vanished without a trace.

829
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.440
Don Quixote and central were speechless and motionless and the tapping ceased

830
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.650
silence fell over the baron Castilian landscape.

831
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.520
The novel had finally and truly come to an end.

832
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.350
What I have here,
a few notes,

833
01:01:01.351 --> 01:01:04.990
shields from your exams that I have of things that I found very interesting is

834
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.100
not everyone.
So don't be jealous if you're not mentioning.

835
01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:08.270
You mentioned in the next one,

836
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:13.780
but Tony wrote about the lack of introspection in the Quixote.

837
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:19.980
Uh,
and that is true.
Uh,
and that,
uh,

838
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.490
he also,
but this will change in part two.

839
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:27.920
And he also said that the dose who like the Romances achievers are also like Don

840
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.540
Quixote.
And in a way that extends to us,
that was very good.

841
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:36.830
Kelsey being an author,
uh,
and the danger of insanity,

842
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:40.810
she writes sanctuary,
which is true.
There is being an author,
uh,

843
01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:45.030
as you can see what my,
my little,
uh,
uh,
attempt here,
uh,

844
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:49.430
carries the danger of insanity.
Uh,
and uh,

845
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.020
uh,

846
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.890
central she says is fat and short and then therefore closer to the ground.

847
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.720
I found that terror,

848
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:03.190
a donkey hearted doubles Vantis both our readers and authors of chivalric

849
01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:05.390
romances.
It is true.
Yeah.

850
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:09.130
So I found that to be Jasmine [inaudible],

851
01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:13.670
Spanish dolus [inaudible] Sandra,
a doubles who in interlaced,
uh,

852
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:17.330
to complete as it were,
the character of Don Quixote.
That was very good.

853
01:02:17.331 --> 01:02:21.900
I thought,
uh,
[inaudible] found various frames.

854
01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.420
Uh,
[inaudible] as is true,

855
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.750
the frame of the picture of the frame in the picture of the frame of the door

856
01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.130
there repetition of frames.
I found that to be a very,
very interesting insight.

857
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.620
Uh,
Elizabeth car.
Then you,

858
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:39.090
it makes no Quixote more believable as a character since someone else exist who

859
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:40.830
is like him.
Uh,

860
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.220
Toby interning Gnocchi hold this world into a world of dialogue.

861
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:47.670
He Sankyo both changes and preserves it.

862
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.920
So this is from your own business,

863
01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:52.050
your own feedback that I found very interesting.

864
01:02:52.051 --> 01:02:55.770
So I'll see you in the next class or this Friday.
I will be there.

865
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.850
Should you come?
I want to come see me,

866
01:02:57.851 --> 01:03:00.870
or a few of you have already come and we have had very pleasant conversations

867
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.360
and I am,
uh,
eager to receive you.
