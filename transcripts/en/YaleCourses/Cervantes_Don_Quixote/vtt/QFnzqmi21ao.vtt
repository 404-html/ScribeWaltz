WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.480
To me,
the most evocative moment,
uh,

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.700
in decky hot as we reach the beautiful city of Barcelona is the appearance of

3
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:17.070
the sea.
The sea

4
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.810
suggests the infinite,

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.630
uh,

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.810
as we approached the end and also a death death dateless night to quote

7
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:39.390
Shakespeare Castille is landlocked.

8
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.160
Uh,
and so Spain

9
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.640
defining its limits,
uh,
as the novel ridges.

10
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.270
It's an undefined it's own,
uh,
limits,

11
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.740
uh,
Don Quixote on Sancocho.
Uh,

12
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.340
most probably have never seen the seat,

13
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.550
but Advantis,
uh,
certainly had as we know,

14
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.190
uh,
and he boasts of it in this,
uh,

15
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.430
last,
uh,
chapters of the Quixote.

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There's all these details about life in the ships and of the Galley slaves and

17
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:30.620
all of that in which uses very detailed maritime,

18
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.990
uh,
terminology,
but sanctuary and,
and,

19
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.940
and not be haughty are unlikely to have ever seen the sea.
We are not,
uh,
told,

20
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.640
uh,
if they,
if they had,

21
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.610
but one I think should assume so

22
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.630
the novel,
uh,

23
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.760
which as a Java began with a cohort that will be an urban Java,

24
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.870
uh,
meaning that it will deal mostly with cities.

25
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.360
Settings will nearly always be cities.

26
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.321
Yet,

27
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:09.321
Barcelona is the only city that appears in the Quixote low.

28
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:12.090
Part two began,
uh,

29
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.240
with a visit to [inaudible] village

30
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.890
is donkey doing like any of us who went from Troy to Rome?

31
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.970
Obviously not.
Uh,
as I said earlier,

32
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.470
such heroic acts are no longer available to don Quixote.

33
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.480
Hemorrhoid can historically defining acts are not available to the whole thing

34
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.150
besides the torso is a mirror village in Spain and it endured no war like Troy.

35
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.510
And Barcelona is not the culmination of a journey and the harbinger of an empire

36
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.580
like the Roman,
which the need,
uh,

37
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.870
announcers and celebrates.

38
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.200
It is significant that in contrast to a history,
I'll repeat this,

39
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.620
a history of the novel,
which is mainly urban.

40
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.910
This is the only urban setting in Boca Hotel,

41
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.210
but it is urban with a vengeance.

42
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.300
Even with this partier,
I don't party,
which is very party,

43
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:33.020
very much something of the city.
And I'm thinking here of [inaudible],

44
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.230
which is the last volume in Marcel posts,
uh,

45
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.130
great,
uh,
novel.
Elijah sheriff's should you don't bear do,

46
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.400
which I hope you get read some day in which there are many parties at,

47
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.020
uh,
in that,
in that novel,
uh,

48
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.970
and dances and stuff.
Uh,

49
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.070
the first thing that don't get healthy and sang to endure,

50
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.070
uh,
in Barcelona is public shame as,
uh,

51
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.720
when the boys go to Rosie Nantais into throwing a don Quixote,

52
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.390
the city will mean public display of people.

53
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.100
It is also extremely significant that Don Quixote and Santiago arrive on the eve

54
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:26.920
of some Juan,
the night of the evil,

55
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:31.921
some one that is to say they arrived during carnival time or carnival like time.

56
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.880
Uh,
it is as he thought they had,
uh,

57
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.930
arrived at a costume party already costumed,
uh,
because,
uh,

58
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.890
the costume ball already costume because,
uh,

59
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.280
they are literary characters or re,

60
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.440
uh,
in fact,
by this date,

61
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.320
1615,
but by the time Cervantes is writing this 16,
13,

62
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:05.680
probably,
uh,
don't be haughty.

63
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.510
And central had already appeared in a,
in a carnival.

64
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.900
Two men disguised as Don Quixote on Santo appeared in a carnival in a town near

65
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:21.460
Lima,
Peru in 1609.
So look Quixote on Saint Joe.

66
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:25.030
We're already figures,
uh,
uh,
that,
uh,

67
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.010
costumes characters that people could dress up like in,
in the carnival.

68
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.390
And here they are entering into a carnival atmosphere.

69
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.490
The city of Barcelona will be a stage for various festivals and theater,

70
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:46.120
like representations.

71
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.660
The city is carnival,
it is theater,

72
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.800
it is acting out roles.
Uh,

73
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.710
it is the opposite of nature.
It is art.

74
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.180
Here we have little a literary Jonah's compressed on stage,

75
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.320
like the Byzantine Romance and the Novella Mariska that I explained about in the

76
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:19.100
last,
uh,
uh,
lecture.
Uh,

77
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.330
now the Byzantine Romance,
uh,
aspect or,

78
00:06:24.331 --> 00:06:27.650
or representation I already,
uh,
mentioned,

79
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.880
uh,
it's also called a Greek romance.
This is the,

80
00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:34.970
this meany Greek romance,

81
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.160
which winds up regardless as a [inaudible] gas Paris,
uh,

82
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.980
story,
uh,

83
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.210
Cervantes has compressed all of the elements of the Byzantine romancing the

84
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.500
story,
abductions,
a sea voyage,

85
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.220
just a sea battles,
uh,
uh,
people,

86
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:59.880
uh,
in costume.
Uh,
and it is also,
uh,

87
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.910
please,
uh,
all of the,
uh,
captives tail,
uh,

88
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.510
uh,
with a good ending,
however,
promised for the,
uh,
to the Muslim,
uh,
father.

89
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.423
Uh,

90
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.190
I repeat what I said in the last lecture that at this time he said,
Ron,

91
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.540
this is working on his own Byzantine Romance,

92
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:25.100
the trials of penicillium and his Monda.
So it is,
uh,

93
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.350
it is,
uh,

94
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.730
not so pricing that he should include elements of it in this part of the
quarter.

95
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.170
They knew novelistic John Crow,

96
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.160
that Cervantes is creating is a compendium of narrative.

97
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.720
Jaras remember that the,
to me,

98
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.120
the most interesting,
uh,
uh,
uh,

99
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.790
aspect of this mini Byzantine romance is when,
uh,

100
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.720
uh,
Gaspard Gregorio is dressed as a woman,

101
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.140
so as to be less attractive to his Turkish captures is kind of a baroque kind of

102
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.440
transvestism.
Uh,

103
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.100
no transvestism sort of turned around.
Uh,

104
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.990
now that story of [inaudible] Gregorio an ANA is not concluded.

105
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.330
There is no closure.

106
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.180
The reason may be that this is the only love story that has a social political

107
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:24.014
connection.

108
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.700
The whole business of the expulsion of the Maurice East and they're returning to

109
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:32.570
Spain,
uh,
against the law.
That is,

110
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.430
this is not just a story,
uh,
but part of ongoing history,

111
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.340
the novel that is the,
the novel Don Quixote,

112
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.760
like the character is coming closer to reality,

113
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.960
not to the demands of fiction or of madness,

114
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.320
perhaps closure other than death is only available in those realms.

115
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.540
There is closure is only available perhaps in fiction,

116
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.590
which it has this rounded completed forms,

117
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.960
whereas ongoing time cannot have a closure.

118
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.670
Perhaps closure is possible then only in fiction or within donkey.
This,

119
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.550
uh,
madness.
I am,
um,

120
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.480
I continue to worry about the ending of the novel gene pending ending of the

121
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.810
novel,
which must have worried around there's a lot as he moved

122
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.910
forward.
Now

123
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.170
it's Cervantes presenting a falsified Spain,
eh,

124
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.050
with this world to do citizens of Barcelona and government officials who are so

125
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:46.980
lenient with the Morris costs,
uh,
and the renegades,

126
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.480
uh,
or is it the Spain that he would like to see?

127
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.200
We will never know.
But on the whole,

128
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:56.820
there is leniency shown here,

129
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.470
even by the government officials who are breaking the law.

130
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.610
In doing so
now further,

131
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.460
uh,

132
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.590
activities in Barcelona take place at the house of Antonio Moreno,

133
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.430
Antonio Moreno character.
I'm sure that you have remarked upon.

134
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.420
And several social events take place at his house.

135
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.250
His house is now the,
the setting for,
for the action.

136
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.420
But we have left.
We have left and we'll return to the Duke and Duchess,

137
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.480
his house.
But now it's an Antonio Moreno's house.
At these events,

138
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.250
these social events take place.

139
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.720
Here we have depicted the pleasures of the bourgeois.
See,

140
00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:45.540
this is not quite a Boudreaux.
See,
it is higher than the Boudreaux.
See it is,

141
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.070
it announces the emergence of the Blue Jase as a class.

142
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.150
Now.

143
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.150
So the events here are not quite as elaborate or ornate as the ones at the,

144
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:01.590
uh,
the Duke and duchess is a palace mansion.
But then he said,

145
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:06.591
dance in which don't be haughty displace skills such as dancing that we did.

146
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:12.180
No,
we did not know that he possessed or imagine that he possessed.

147
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.690
They be speak of a past.
Uh,

148
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.280
that's Advantis chose not to fill out where it don't you hold the learn to

149
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:23.340
dance.
Where did he dance?

150
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.680
Just as we learned when the,
in the episode of the boat,
but he knows how to swim.

151
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.090
How did he ever learn how to swim?
We are not given any details about,
uh,

152
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.120
this past of don't be haughty.
We can,
we could imagine it.

153
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.920
Uh,
he acts here like an accomplished courtesan.
He is,

154
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.300
uh,
uh,
when he's at the Duke and Duchess,
his house,

155
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:53.040
the object of entertainment,
uh,
but not of cruel pracs.

156
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.200
I mean here,
this,
uh,

157
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.350
board a bourgeois half parties and suddenly a literary character emergents among

158
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:05.440
them.
It is a godsend to them.
Imagine you're having a party.

159
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.970
I'm James Bond.
Josep wow.
Everybody's excited.

160
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.180
And this is what happens at this party.

161
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.790
No,
the talking head Caper,

162
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.640
the talking head Kapor,
uh,

163
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:28.750
which is reminiscent of the master Peter Episode and his monkey remember the

164
00:12:29.301 --> 00:12:34.070
monkey who could,
uh,
divine what is happening,
uh,
to people,

165
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.990
uh,
is,
uh,
making,
I mean the,

166
00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:40.824
the,
the,

167
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.850
the whole prank centers on making literal,

168
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.630
a rhetorical figure.

169
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.980
Remember I mentioned that [inaudible] was a rhetorical figure,

170
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.380
the name of the young woman in an earlier,
uh,
story.
Uh,

171
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.620
and now we have another one here.
Here we have broad support pay.
Yeah.

172
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.080
<v 0>In Spanish possible pay.
Yeah.
In English did the,</v>

174
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.240
the definition of apple pay yeah.

175
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.870
Is a figure in rhetoric in which things are represented as persons or by which

176
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:30.190
things inanimate are spoken of as animated beings or by which an absent person

177
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:36.791
is introduced at speed as speaking or the CS person is represented as alive and

178
00:13:37.431 --> 00:13:42.220
present the kind of personification.
Thus the,

179
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.000
the end of the definition,
uh,
uh,

180
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.830
you have possible pay.
Of course,
when you have a ventriloquist with his,
uh,

181
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.480
uh,
puppet that he makes the speak,
uh,

182
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.330
a projected his voice and speak.
So that is what [inaudible] is.

183
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:00.663
So seventh,

184
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.680
this here as he does in other occasions is hinting at the disconnection of

185
00:14:06.141 --> 00:14:08.390
language from significant Haitian.

186
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.700
<v 0>It is a staging of pure voice without,</v>

188
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.380
without a source.

189
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.780
<v 0>Well,
so he is playfully,
uh,
uh,</v>

191
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.200
presenting the inner world of men as being made up of wood and 10,

192
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:35.200
uh,
because the,
uh,
the bus is made of wood

193
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.240
to made to look like stone or marble or whatever.

194
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.510
On the whole apparatus through which the student who is the assistant in this

195
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:50.380
case a speaks,
is made of,
uh,
of tin.
So,
uh,

196
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.370
here,
uh,
other than possible payer,
there is a hint.
The seventh,
this is joy.
Well,

197
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:55.761
you know,

198
00:14:55.761 --> 00:15:00.761
the inside of of man is just like this piece of wood with a thin tube through

199
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:07.040
which the voice emerges.
Um,
so it,

200
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.000
it's again one of these,
uh,
uh,

201
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.420
episodes that has all kinds of philosophical her suggestions.

202
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.920
But the most suggestive episode in Barcelona is the visit to the printing shop.

203
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.460
Now this is the acme of self reflexivity.

204
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.940
It is us if jokingly Don Quixote,

205
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.860
we're visiting his true origin in the most material sense

206
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.360
Loki hotel,
a character who emerged from books.

207
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.400
He said the place where books are literally made,

208
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
it is a kind of reductio ad absurdum because literature cannot be reduced to the

209
00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:58.810
material,
a status of paper,

210
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.000
ink and glue.

211
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.820
But you make a book with uh,
of course,

212
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.630
but to run this is delving into the very basic building blocks of his craft are

213
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:19.690
aware that these,
that is the,
the,
the,
the apparatus,

214
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.450
the machinery to make the book and all of that,

215
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:27.451
our mere concrete manifestations of it that cannot be it real origin.

216
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.100
It's real source,
but he's playing with it.
Uh,

217
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.780
the episode,
this episode,

218
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:39.490
the most be seen in relation to the scrutiny of the books and to LTC Dora's

219
00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:43.180
dream or vision about which I will speak later today.

220
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.290
They all deal with the question of the book,

221
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.110
the visit to the printing shop.
I repeat,

222
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.010
it's the last frontier of self reflexivity.

223
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.230
Here is a fictional character or observing the printing of a book about him.

224
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.780
But the book is an apocryphal one to add to the confusion.

225
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.420
It is [inaudible] book.

226
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.400
It is a visit to the origin of all reflections and representations.

227
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.030
The sign the boys hang on,
don't be haughty.

228
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:21.330
Also reduces him to do language is a label.

229
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.890
He is reduced to letters.

230
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:25.760
<v 1>Okay,</v>

231
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.200
<v 0>so this is taking this to the very limits.</v>

232
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.230
No spurious key.
Hot Day and we have a,

233
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.060
uh,
uh,
you have today,
uh,

234
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.930
a handout with the cover,

235
00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:45.490
which I may have given you before just so that you have it as a souvenir.

236
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:48.880
You can also look at it and read it as best you can.

237
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.850
A notice of the ss are made,
uh,
uh,
like this,

238
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.350
uh,
uh,
go to the,

239
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:01.860
see Jess,
you can read it,
I'm sure.
And also the,

240
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:06.400
the woodcut of the night.
It's also very interesting.
I mean,
yeah,

241
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.340
that's uh,
uh,
superiors Jihad.

242
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:15.330
They came to the attention of Cervantes when he was about in chapter 36.

243
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:18.180
We set or 37.
Uh,

244
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.660
so the moment that he learned about our began adas book and probably on Reddit,

245
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.080
he changed those donkey hotel destination to Barcelona away from Santa Rosa.

246
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.610
I'm a,
yeah.
Nina's book allows you to run this,

247
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.610
to add yet another dimension to his play evolution.

248
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.670
Later he will borrow a character from the false Quixote and making swear that he

249
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:46.110
had never seen him and Saint Joe Don Quixote Hotel Center.

250
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:49.560
You will see that as we get to the very,
to the very end.

251
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:55.200
This is the,
this is a parody,
that legal document that he makes him sign.

252
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.310
Can you imagine a legal document is fictional characters making another one sign

253
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:02.780
saying,
and of course that he,
the one giving him the,

254
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.200
the document is the real one,
uh,

255
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.490
is a parody of those legal documents are the,
uh,

256
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.350
the origin of the constitution of,
of,
of the picaresque for instance.

257
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.820
Uh,
but that is a great deal more here.

258
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.000
There is a,

259
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
metta is a matter of fictional realm where characters from two different novels

260
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.990
can actually meet and talk to each other.
The play of Ellucian,

261
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:36.210
the blurring of the border between fantasy and fiction is emphasized by these

262
00:19:36.211 --> 00:19:41.211
various layers of fiction involved when by the brilliant move by which Avantis

263
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.540
by not allowing them to go to Santa Rosa intends to correct history.

264
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.950
But of course it's a history that is a fiction.

265
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.080
There is no position from which to stand outside of the world of fiction in the

266
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:03.720
Kihatha because the fiction is manmade.

267
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.400
It is all that we can know in a way.

268
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:13.210
And I've mentioned this before,
this anticipates the philosophy of the great,
uh,

269
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.120
Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico

270
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:26.460
18th century.
The new science is the name of his wonderful book

271
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.320
because one of,
because,
uh,
uh,

272
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:36.180
main ideas was that mankind can only understand what mankind has made.

273
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:42.060
Uh,
therefore he begins his history of humanity after the flood,

274
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.920
when it is mankind that remakes the world,
not geneses.

275
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.840
And what I'm seeing here is that is that is this world of,
of,
of,
of,

276
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:54.430
of fiction is,

277
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.210
is manmade and it is all that we can understand.

278
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.910
Uh,
and uh,

279
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:05.890
so the modern self that emerges from this vision is a,

280
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:10.090
is a,
is a very light and fragile one like hamlets

281
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:17.130
or like the one proposed by Milan Kundera in the unbearable lightness of being

282
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.850
the normal that I,
uh,
that I suggest you read it.
It said,

283
00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:26.460
modern self devoid of certainty,

284
00:21:26.461 --> 00:21:31.461
certainly about himself or herself because the feeling that this miss on a beam,

285
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:36.640
this infinity receding sequence,
uh,

286
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:40.630
creates is that if anything envelops our world,

287
00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:44.440
if anything contains our world,
may yet be another fiction.

288
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.470
This is the set of vantage bore.
Gestion bought his something referring to,

289
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:51.670
but Jorge Luis Borges,

290
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.300
this isn't said Advantium bore gestion predicament in which we finance ourselves

291
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.070
and from which you cannot escape in the guilty.

292
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.450
It is what we saw in Las Meninas when we visited Alaska studio on us.

293
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.160
And by watching we became a part of the fiction of the painting and the visit,

294
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.950
the visit to the printing shop is like the visit to the studio of Belasco Sis.

295
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.130
This is the shop where fiction is made.

296
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.870
The only way out of this predicament is by an act of will.

297
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.440
Like the ones that don't get hotter performs at the end when he very activity

298
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:41.191
spurns all of the seductions and all of the constellations that his calm rates

299
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.630
offer him.
I see his near death.

300
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.370
His is an act of faith and voluntary one,

301
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.170
not an intellectual one.

302
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:58.280
Moreover,
[inaudible],
he and his,
his,

303
00:22:58.281 --> 00:23:00.130
his Quixote,
uh,

304
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:05.200
may also represent a misreading of Sarandos is Quixote by the society of his

305
00:23:07.101 --> 00:23:07.934
time.

306
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.663
<v 1>Uh,</v>

307
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:17.890
<v 0>[inaudible] presents a character that is essentially ridiculous and funny.</v>

308
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.600
And I sang Joe who is a glutton and a drunk.
Uh,

309
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.150
so it is the,
the vision of,
uh,

310
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:33.490
of the US essentially a funny book.
Uh,
it,

311
00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:35.830
miss reading that has been repeated in the,

312
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:40.831
in recent times by the so called hard school of critics have said around this in

313
00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:47.090
England that I said that the only hard thing about it is the hardening of the

314
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:48.350
critical arteries.

315
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

316
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.590
<v 0>Peter Russell and company,
uh,</v>

317
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.230
Anthony Close,
uh,

318
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.530
in a way,
uh,
said when this preempt all of them,
uh,

319
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.610
by doing what he does with [inaudible] got.

320
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.450
But the MS reading is interesting in itself.
If it is the miss reading,

321
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:13.420
it is interesting in itself.
Uh,

322
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.630
if I'm a [inaudible] book stands for that and we'd meet miss reading and I have

323
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.300
quotes from two critics,

324
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.570
one of whom you have heard before that will help clarify that potential was

325
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:30.890
reading and also situated historically.
One is,

326
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.210
uh,
Marty skull.

327
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:38.170
And I have looked all over to this corner,

328
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:43.880
this fellows first name and couldn't find that today.
Uh,

329
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.060
he wrote a book on our [inaudible],
uh,
Quixote.
He is,
uh,

330
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.440
a critic,
uh,
it,
uh,

331
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.920
who teaches at a university in California and he says he underscores,

332
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.100
uh,
reading,
uh,

333
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.620
by pointing out that,
uh,

334
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.710
that enable Yanina is book donkey Horta is actually chained and sent to jail,

335
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.230
not to Yale,
to jail.

336
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

337
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.810
<v 0>I cannot resist telling an anecdote here.
That is that my,
uh,</v>

338
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:26.730
my mother who was a professor,
a very brilliant woman who,
uh,

339
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.310
who did very well in Greek and Latin,

340
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.960
but had little facility for modern languages,
including English.

341
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.070
And she would tell her friends in Florida to impress him.

342
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.140
My son Roberto is in jail.
And,
uh,

343
00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:48.300
when the ladies did not react as she hoped,
she would say,

344
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:52.530
and he has been there a long time.
I had to,

345
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.920
I had to tell her to stop saying where I was teaching just to say that I was

346
00:25:58.771 --> 00:26:03.360
teaching up north somewhere.
So in any case,
um,

347
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.670
uh,
in our DNA,

348
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.710
this book Doki hope that you sent to jail and a mighty scholar writes physical

349
00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:16.740
imprisonment in the original text,

350
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.560
meaning in the Sorento says [inaudible] 1605,

351
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.900
with the exception of the open cage in the final chapters is displaced by a

352
00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:29.901
series of images designed to explore the inescapable you had complex and often

353
00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:35.280
10 years interrelationships between the self and the social world,

354
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.230
ropes,
strings,
nets.
You have a young Ada.
On the other hand,

355
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.440
the subject must be health forcibly in place so that it can be the recipient of

356
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:51.780
both the laws,
violence and the shame produced by exchanges with the community.

357
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.900
The subject here,
meaning gawky haughty,
he goes on.

358
00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.080
The condemnation of Don Quixote by the subordinate classes merely underscores

359
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:05.391
the ideological homogeneity to which the Spanish elites with Ariana as spokesman

360
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.690
aspired.
So you can see,
I went your Neda,
uh,
uh,

361
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.900
medical is equating [inaudible],
uh,
uh,

362
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.580
imprisoning of the Quixote with the,
uh,
with the mainstream,

363
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.700
uh,
ideology of the Spanish of the Times.
He goes on our way.

364
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.800
Edda in prisons is uh,
his protagonist because he is mad,

365
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:34.080
meaning the protagonist,
not Oh,
you're Neda,
yet he's more pressing.

366
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:39.081
Ambition is to castigate the alternative forms of subjectivity which Cervantes

367
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.520
had explored in his novel the attempt to cultivate and individualized existence.

368
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.950
The attempt to cultivate an individualized existence.

369
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.980
Ron's head on not only into the traditional constraints of shame and revenge,

370
00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.590
but finally into the twin powers of early Spanish absolutism without a year Neda

371
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:06.090
as their literary spokesman,
which work to suppress the attempt.

372
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.340
So Arianna is working to suppress these forms of subjectivity that are present

373
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:12.540
in the Quixote.
Finally,

374
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.960
the refusal to align himself with any of the hegemonic forces at work in his

375
00:28:18.121 --> 00:28:21.960
society underscores a strong sense of wondering,

376
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.200
which has been noted by critics from Luca extra Fuko in the original chaotic by

377
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:31.990
moving along the margins of the dominant culture Cervantes system.

378
00:28:31.991 --> 00:28:34.140
Kiata is not the romantic rebel,

379
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.500
which much of traditional criticism as one that him to be,

380
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.540
yet he nonetheless works to clear a space above which modern forms of

381
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:45.960
subjectivity would later appear unquote.

382
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.980
But if Carlos is not aware that the individual alternative forms of subjectivity

383
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:55.950
that he talks about our mood,
you are in origin and destination,

384
00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.300
if we are going to see them from the marketing point of view,
that he,
I presume,

385
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.680
uh,
is,
is looking at them from moreover,
he works,

386
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:07.740
I think with a utopian vision of the liberated self.

387
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.270
That's the one this would have never been naive enough to accept.

388
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:18.230
But what he says is very suggestive about the source of,

389
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.280
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
concept of the,

390
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.080
uh,
of the character that he has taken from Cervantes.

391
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.300
Manuel do run who you have encountered many times,

392
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.950
writes Gilman,
Steven Gilman,

393
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.950
whom you have also met many times professor at Harvard for many years and he

394
00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:41.480
wrote the best,
uh,
uh,
works on,
on,
on our agenda.

395
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.860
Gilman has demonstrated the coincidence between Avaya Neda's attitude and that

396
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:49.580
of post council of Trent moral.

397
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.730
It's morals which were ascetic and Orthodox are young.

398
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.610
You know,
now what the Council of Trent is because you've read it in Elliot.
No,

399
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.140
this is a retrenchment of a Catholic orthodoxy in the sprain of the time.

400
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.720
Are Your Neda would then be the representative of all of the people's voice.

401
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.970
But this does not explain why are your Neda shows himself to be so favorable to

402
00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:19.240
the Maurice course,
which he does.
He's Aragon is origin.

403
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:20.950
The irregular were against the explosion,

404
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.180
which is probable is not sufficient proof.
In any case,

405
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.500
if one accepts that are a [inaudible] book is a kind of negative collective

406
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:32.050
response by Spain Society of the Times too,

407
00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:36.930
the freedom and inner independence with which Cervantes are endowed his

408
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.900
characters.

409
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:43.530
We will then understand why serve and this did not have immediate and direct

410
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:49.291
successors and the reason why the modern novel invented in Spain by Advantis

411
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.830
would have to wait until the middle of the 19th century to be able to return to

412
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:56.410
its birthplace official Spain.

413
00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.480
Those on Honduran in contrast to the nearly underground Spain found in a path

414
00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:03.460
that goes from Rojas and the mystics to serve.

415
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.990
Aunties did not believe in individual independence and freedoms.

416
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.480
What he means.
Uh,

417
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:13.750
but Durham means here is that there is an official Spain here,

418
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.020
Orthodox and becoming increasingly Orthodox in the 16th century.

419
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.800
But there is an underground Spain that goes from Rojas,

420
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.810
meaning Fernando,
the Rojas,
the author of cellists,
Tina,
uh,

421
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.190
through the mystics,

422
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.550
Saint John of the cross and so forth who were seen with great suspicion by the

423
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:38.490
inquisition,
uh,
to serve on this.
And the,

424
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:43.210
this is a counter,
uh,
official,

425
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.110
uh,
Spain,

426
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.420
but data with Geneva represents Orthodox,
uh,

427
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.190
Spain here above this which suppresses it.

428
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.210
And that's why he gives us that view of the chaotic,

429
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.770
I hope this is,
uh,
this is,
uh,
this is clear.

430
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:04.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

431
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.450
<v 0>Cervantes is relatively mild response.
That's where I would like to put all the,</v>

432
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:13.070
the hard school of critics there with that,
the Orthodox Spain that represses,

433
00:32:13.071 --> 00:32:13.904
you know,

434
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.373
<v 1>uh,</v>

435
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:22.230
<v 0>now Cervantes is relatively mild response to our [inaudible] is in line with his</v>

436
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.490
irony.
There is a great deal of humor in what,

437
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.110
on what he does [inaudible] and we'll see it immediately when we get to LTC,

438
00:32:32.111 --> 00:32:36.430
Dora's vision.
And I run,
just like I said,

439
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:41.431
if I run this can never be so sure of himself as to be very island in

440
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:44.480
controversy and in debate.

441
00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

442
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.350
<v 0>How can they be so sure of himself?</v>

443
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.710
One of servant this is most admired traits is this restraint and self mockery.

444
00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.020
And it shows in his answered [inaudible] if you remember the 1605 prologue,

445
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.310
you remember this self mocked instead of one person who doesn't know how to,

446
00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.300
what to do about writing the prologue and so forth and so on.
And all of this,
uh,

447
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:14.310
Horyo games by which he distanced himself from his creation and all of that.

448
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.010
Someone with that position,
uh,
uh,
good.
Only due to our agenda,

449
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.430
what he did according to Gillman,

450
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.570
you sort of threw a net of irony over a million data to capture him.

451
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:26.850
<v 1>Okay?</v>

452
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:31.660
<v 0>He did say a few nasty things in the prologue,
the 1615,
he hold them.
But uh,</v>

453
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.550
of course Allie,
Anita had said terrible things about,
uh,

454
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.750
[inaudible] blocked him even because TV is in your hand on everything.
It was,
no,

455
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.133
no.

456
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.180
Now we come to this what I think is the culminating event in Barcelona,

457
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:53.070
which is donkey holders defeat at the hands.
Well,

458
00:33:53.071 --> 00:33:57.090
the night of the white moon.
Uh,

459
00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:02.310
the night of the white moon is the latest reincarnation of Samsung Carrasco whom

460
00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:06.750
we learn has been pursuing his neighbors since his failure as the night of the

461
00:34:06.751 --> 00:34:07.584
mirrors.

462
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:12.720
He's now in cahoots with the Duke and Duchess who tell him where Don Quixote has

463
00:34:12.721 --> 00:34:16.920
gone because Samsung looked for him in Santa Rosa and did not find him there.

464
00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:17.754
Of course,

465
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.690
the rules are carefully agreed upon as with the earlier,
uh,

466
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.760
encounter and Don Quixote is fairly defeated within those rules.

467
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.590
He speaks as if dead from within his armor as you lay on the ground.

468
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.280
He said,
uh,
that the narrator says Don Quixote,

469
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:43.310
Bruce Johnstone without lifting up his visor as if he was speaking from within a

470
00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:48.230
tomb in a feeble and low boys said and so forth.
Boredom,

471
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:52.500
Quixote.
After you've Doki hot,
they had been killed.

472
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.630
This would have been a possible ending,
but even in defeat,

473
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.740
but he's been defeated.
The,
this could have ended the novel too.

474
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:03.810
Why doesn't it?

475
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:09.840
Well it doesn't because he has not Jared a jet given up his persona as knight

476
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.980
errant,
uh,
has the process of his coming to himself.

477
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.770
It's not just finished.
And as I told you,
that is the,
the,
the,

478
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:20.640
he most of his most important task,

479
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.530
the task that is comparable to the hell Roy one that,
uh,

480
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.260
that nes accomplishes in,
in virtual

481
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.320
the profound suggestion of donkey halters defeat at the hands of the night of

482
00:35:34.321 --> 00:35:38.630
the white moon is that given that this night,
like the night of the mirrors,

483
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.950
a reflection of donkey Horta himself,

484
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.060
it may be that the doe is being defeated by some projection of his own inner

485
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:49.074
world.

486
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:58.130
Even part one.
Don't you hold,
this body is imprisoned in the cage.

487
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.340
Ah,
here it is as if his spirit where the one,
uh,

488
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.400
being defeated,
but it is again,
as you don't get hot,

489
00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:11.320
they were conquered by his own reflection,
by a projection of something within,

490
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.470
within his own self.
This is what is profound about this scene.

491
00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.700
It is easy to establish.
Of course,
at the night of the [inaudible],

492
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.640
the white moon not only is an image of Don Quixote,

493
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.670
remember the Luna Luna,
uh,

494
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.630
meant the reflecting part of a mirror,
La Luna,
the less pickle,

495
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.860
but also that lunatic refers to donkey hope.

496
00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:37.910
This madness,
the moon,
of course,

497
00:36:37.911 --> 00:36:40.040
it's a celestial body of reflected light.

498
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
So that song is reflecting donkey Hotez light in a way or don't the tortoise,

499
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.920
the projection of Don Quixote's spirit.

500
00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.070
I am intrigued by the,

501
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:57.380
the name of this night,
which seems to be redundant.

502
00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.070
I mean,
the moon is always white,
white moon.

503
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.220
The debris white moon seems to cancel,

504
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.280
cancel itself out to cancel itself out in,

505
00:37:09.521 --> 00:37:09.761
in,

506
00:37:09.761 --> 00:37:14.761
in its repeated white ness like the springs to mind,

507
00:37:14.991 --> 00:37:19.130
the white peril upon the white forehead at the end of Dante's Paradiso,

508
00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:23.960
white Parallon Beatrice's forehead loose cannot be seen because it's wide open.

509
00:37:23.961 --> 00:37:28.610
White Don Quixote is fight.
It's fighting as it were,

510
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:33.180
against his own nothingness that,
uh,
that,

511
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:33.980
uh,

512
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:38.750
light being that I mentioned before when alluding to hamlet and two Kundera,

513
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.340
uh,
is nothingness,
which is this white upon white,

514
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:48.370
the disappears unto itself because white can also mean absence and in,

515
00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:54.440
in,
and in that sense,
the night of the white moon can also be an image of death.

516
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.410
Is there any significance to the significance of the fact that no Quixote is

517
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:02.880
defeated by the sea

518
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.620
on the shore in an open space that is nevertheless from tear a border between

519
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:11.310
land and water?

520
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.220
Remember what I said at the very beginning about the sea evoking,

521
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:20.990
for me at least an image of death.
Uh,

522
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.570
it is,
uh,
an image of the infinite and of death there.

523
00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.850
It seems to be a correspondence to me anywhere.
But anyway,
anyway,

524
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:33.510
between the Hawaii of the,
of,
of the night and the sea,

525
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.540
so this is this dramatic,
uh,

526
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.660
the fetal lucky hotel where he has to accept the conditions set out before the

527
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:48.634
fight.

528
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:53.080
And so they begin to trudge back to her village.

529
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.210
And,
uh,
we have this marvelous pastoral interlude.

530
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.950
Uh,
don't get hotter.

531
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.960
Imagines a life as a shepherd drawn from the pastoral romances.

532
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.900
A set run.
This in a way is adding to,

533
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.640
this is what I've called a smorgasbord of narrative modes,

534
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:20.500
the pastoral,
but only as a project by Don Quixote.

535
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.850
This will be a novel,

536
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:27.220
another novel parallel to the Quixote in which the pastoral romances,

537
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.730
uh,
would play the role of the chief Valerie quants.

538
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.850
Remember that we have had a meanie Byzantine Romance and many Mareeska,

539
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:41.560
uh,
novel.
And if you,
uh,
if you remember,

540
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:46.720
uh,
on pages nine oh four,

541
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.880
nine oh five,
eh,
he says,
don't go there.

542
00:39:50.881 --> 00:39:55.881
This is the metal of where like it on the gay where we light it on.

543
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.460
The gay shepherded says,

544
00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:02.760
and Garant shepherd shepherds who intended to revive it and imitate the pastoral

545
00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:03.814
Arcadia.

546
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:09.310
They thought us new as ingenious in imitation of which if you approve,

547
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.120
if you approve it,
I could wish all Sanctu we might turn.

548
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:16.510
Shepherds are this from the time I must have lived retired,

549
00:40:16.511 --> 00:40:18.970
meaning according to what he has agreed.
Uh,
uh,

550
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:24.220
I will buy sheep and all of the materials necessary for the pastoral employment

551
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:28.150
and I calling myself the shepherd exotic skip studies.

552
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.740
And you're the shepherd Pan Theano.
We will range the mountains,

553
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.380
the woods and metals singing here and complaining.

554
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:40.381
They're drinking the liquid crystal of the fountains of the Limpid Brooks or of

555
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:44.860
the mighty rivers,
the oaks and so forth.
This is the description of this Arcadia,

556
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.830
uh,
the pastoral.

557
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:53.340
It is a hilarious metta novel that he imagines here in which the would be

558
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:55.840
shepherds don Quixote on sanctuary.

559
00:40:55.850 --> 00:41:00.850
The priest and barber and Samsung would take pastoral names that we have seen

560
00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:06.190
derived from their own,
uh,
and give names to the ladies.

561
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:10.480
Remember Angelo says he's going to call his wife Terry Sauna with the

562
00:41:10.481 --> 00:41:14.890
argumentative because apparently she is.
Jesus is fat McKim.

563
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:16.503
Uh,

564
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.900
this is the world of [inaudible] air clogs brought to Don Quixote's mind as he

565
00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:26.550
mentioned it by the episode of the young women who are preparing to,

566
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.420
to stage one of the backlogs,

567
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.780
which has been anticipated by all the references to the poet in this part too.

568
00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:34.940
And they will be more

569
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.630
resourceful also is circling back to sort of Lantus.
His first book law gala,

570
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.190
Remember,
uh,

571
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.700
which he always said he would write a,

572
00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:51.650
which he always said he would write a second part in this new normal that would

573
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:56.360
be a world of love without violence and ideal neoplatonic universe.

574
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.670
The same clash appears in the Kihatha between a fallen present and an ideal pass

575
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:04.310
that cannot be revived in his projected novel.

576
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:09.170
Not to mention that all the potential characters are too old.
Do we?

577
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:14.171
Pastoral lovers and one is a priest who got beaten all over at all.

578
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.910
So,
uh,
it is a kind of a grotesque,
uh,

579
00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:23.000
achieve,
uh,
pastor pastoral romance,
uh,
in,

580
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:27.440
in the making as the hotel is in some ways also a grotesque achieve Alaric

581
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.740
romance.
This is followed by an episode,

582
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:36.290
the episode where they run over by,
by a herd of pigs,
uh,
that,

583
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:36.940
uh,

584
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:41.940
the critics have found that that's Advantis tinker around or where to place this

585
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:44.420
episode.
Uh,
um,

586
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.230
but the important thing is that there seems to be no end to the humiliations and

587
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:52.770
Don Quixote is,
is enduring towards the end of the book because,
uh,

588
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.420
uh,
remember,
uh,

589
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:59.650
that there is nothing worse than a pig or a or a or a swine herd,

590
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:06.320
which is the word I was looking for the other day and could not find when

591
00:43:06.321 --> 00:43:07.710
alluding to that,
uh,

592
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.740
the episode where sanctuary has to pass judgment on the man who allegedly raped

593
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.110
a woman and so forth.
And man was a swine herd.

594
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.280
And so we,
they are heroes.

595
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:22.460
I returned forcing lead to the Duke and Duchess as house.

596
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:27.400
These are not satisfied with all the pranks that they have made them Quixote on

597
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.861
sanctuary,

598
00:43:27.861 --> 00:43:32.861
endure and prepare yet another elaborate one for them when they are,

599
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.060
when they hear of the night's defeat and returned to their village,
said,

600
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:38.150
Advantis inserts.

601
00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:43.151
Here is Tate meant by sit Hamot to underline the questionable state of mind of

602
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:48.380
this frivolous aristrocrats he says,
quote,

603
00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.100
page nine,
nine nine nine one nine.
And Sit Ahmed says,

604
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.710
besides that to his thinking,
the mockers,

605
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.040
whereas mine is the marked and the Duke and Duchess,

606
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:02.450
where with within two fingers breadth of appearing to be mad themselves since

607
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:06.530
they took so much pains to make it just of the two fools.

608
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:11.540
So this is a world where there has been a contamination of,
of,
of madness,

609
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.630
uh,
from character to character.
This kit with the dental teach you,

610
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.770
Nora is full of literary resonances.

611
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:23.660
The staging is elaborate with bleachers for the audience and elevated place for

612
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:28.661
the Duke and Duchess and blazing lights to turn night into day.

613
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.930
Uh,
this is such as the artifice that night is turned in today with all these

614
00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:38.760
lights,
centuries costume in a shroud of flames on,

615
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:43.560
on,
on an abundant with devils on it,
uh,
which seemed to be done.

616
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:47.460
Teske Ellucian and the lines we cited,

617
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.690
Alicia,
one of the updates recited during the year.

618
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:55.200
This kid are directly taken from Garcia lassos portrait.

619
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.880
The farce.

620
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:02.270
It's a representation of the death of the beloved in the courtly love tradition

621
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.450
and in renaissance poetry.

622
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.490
The famous deaths are those of Beatrice Dante,

623
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.050
Laura Patriarch and Isabell,

624
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.820
Freddy Garcia Lasso.
He says three ladies there,

625
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.390
death mark,
the port g of these major ports,

626
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.630
dividing their work into a before and an after,

627
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.960
before the death of Laura after the devil Laura before the death of each,

628
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.480
I'm afraid after that and so forth.
Uh,

629
00:45:36.481 --> 00:45:40.770
so this is very significant moment in the,
in the,
in the,

630
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.990
in the history of,
of,

631
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.080
of Western portrait that has to be on stage here.

632
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.060
This is the representation of arrows and [inaudible] of love and death,

633
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:56.510
but in a baroque farce involving the protagonist and with a whole household,

634
00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:59.790
it seems in attendance,

635
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:03.750
this is a prank as elaborate as a pageant in the forest,

636
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.400
it is a repetition of it.

637
00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:10.320
A central's fall in the pit was a repetition of the cave of Montesinos episode.

638
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:16.070
Sanchez body is again the object or better the vehicle for expiation and the

639
00:46:16.591 --> 00:46:18.540
Duenas are his executioners.

640
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:24.290
That is they're going to slap him around and pinch him and stick pins in his

641
00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:25.440
butt and so forth.

642
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:30.270
And this is what will allow until she got up to be revived.

643
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.340
Why,
why?
Again,

644
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.120
it seems that central has been cast in the role of the fool

645
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.890
who must suffer all the physical shenanigans,

646
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:45.590
meaning the full drawn from the carnival tradition.

647
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.360
Uh,

648
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:51.330
this is a reading of his figure that is parallel to the one of Neda made by

649
00:46:51.331 --> 00:46:56.120
turning him to a farcical,
glutton and drunk,
meaning the reading that these,
uh,

650
00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.360
Duke and Duchess and there are many have done essential,
uh,

651
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:01.410
because remember they have read,

652
00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:04.740
part one is parallel to the one that [inaudible] made.

653
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:09.430
This is why he is made to endure this,
uh,
this,
uh,

654
00:47:09.431 --> 00:47:12.390
humiliations don't be haughty.

655
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:18.470
The flames or in his dress and the lighting of the courtyard seemed to be an

656
00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:24.171
illusion to dido who burned herself to death when abandoned by Eunice don't.

657
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.140
The hottest return and impending departure are luck.

658
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:32.020
An ansys and LTC door,
again is playing the role of Dido,

659
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.200
her anger,
and her insults,

660
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:40.130
which are very colorful and actually accurately described Don Quixote,

661
00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:43.270
who's very ugly.
It looks like a candle that she says and all of these things.

662
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.050
But all of these,
all of these,
uh,
uh,

663
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:50.950
truths play into the fixture because they sound that you stay in them in spite

664
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.650
because he's leaving her.
So even this,

665
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:57.340
these truths are absorbed into,
into,
into the fiction.

666
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.760
The whole episode is thick with literary references and it's staging,

667
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.940
uh,
uh,
it is a staging of great literature,
uh,

668
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.510
and reducing it to play.
Now remember,

669
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.170
most were doing this or the Dutcher's and the Duke who are,

670
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:17.860
there's a prankster aristrocrats.
Uh,

671
00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.260
now the most remarkable passage in the whole sequence sequence of episodes

672
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:28.890
involving RTC Dora is her infernal vision is one of my favorite passages in the

673
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:33.640
whole book.
St George,
who remember,
is curious to learn.

674
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.060
What are these Laura saw when she was dead?
Uh,

675
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.710
what the afterworld was like.
He wants to know,
particularly hell.

676
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:43.240
He wants to know what hell is like.

677
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.030
Now notice that LTC notice infernal voyage is like donkey hope descend to the

678
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:53.620
cave of Montesinos and Sanchez fall into the pit LTC donors reply,

679
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.190
which she must have made up on the spot.

680
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.580
Like Dorothea the story of Princess Mikami.

681
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:05.850
Part one is a truly brilliant boast of imaginative skill on her part and of

682
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:08.360
course on Cervantes.
This

683
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:13.690
patient nine 20 in truth,
cope antics.
You Dora,

684
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.060
I could not quite die

685
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.530
since I went not to hell for her.

686
00:49:20.531 --> 00:49:23.020
I once set foot in it.

687
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:28.270
I could not have got out again though I had never so great desire.

688
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.500
Remember that those who enter hell at the entrance of hell in Nundah Telesis

689
00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:37.450
lose all hope you cannot ever get out of here.
The truth is,
I came to the gate,

690
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.720
were about a dozen devils were playing a tennis below ties in Spanish.

691
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:46.960
They say tennis.
Tennis was not in very inviting,
invented into the 18th century.

692
00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:51.160
So the Jarvis is indulging in a little anachronism here,
but it's close enough

693
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.670
in their wast coast and drawers.

694
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:59.620
There should cars ornamented with Flanders lays and ruffles of the same with

695
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:01.300
four inches of their risks.

696
00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:06.301
Bear to make your hand seem longer in which they have rackets of failure.

697
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.280
But what I wondered most odd was that instead of tennis balls,

698
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
they made use of books seemingly stuffed with wind and flux and think marvelous,

699
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:21.400
a new look.
This,
uh,
did some niche,

700
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.320
but these are the not so much wonder at us to see that we're as it is natural

701
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:27.154
for winning.

702
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.580
There's to rejoice and losers to be sorry among the games there's of that place

703
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:36.140
all grumbled,
all were upon the fret and all curse one another.

704
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.020
That is not at all strange answers.

705
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:42.320
Sanctuary for devils play or not play,

706
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:44.420
win or not win can never be contented.

707
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.270
Centuries knowledgeable about what happens in health.

708
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.240
Of course he knows the oral tradition about what is in health and,

709
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.410
and how it is true growth.
LTC Laura.

710
00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:57.790
But there is another thing I wondered at,
I mean I wonder,

711
00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.510
I had it then she has to correct herself because she's speaking in the

712
00:51:02.511 --> 00:51:06.560
precedence is,
oh no,
no.
Here's what I,
and she's making it up such as again,
I say,

713
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:11.520
I remember that,
that uh,
that uh,
dawn of day it makes a mistake,
uh,

714
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.700
also on,
has to be corrected when she's making it up,

715
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:19.090
which was that the first pass the ball was demolished and could not serve a

716
00:51:19.191 --> 00:51:19.911
second time.

717
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:24.911
And so they whipped them away and a new and old that it was marvelous to behold

718
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.390
unto one of them flaming new and new and neatly bound.

719
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.850
They give such a smart stroke that they made it its guts fly out and scattered

720
00:51:33.851 --> 00:51:37.070
his leaves all about.
And one devil said to another,

721
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:41.020
see what that book is on the other devil.
Answer it.

722
00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:44.740
If the second part of the history of donkey hotel,

723
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.660
Amanda not composed by seed Hamlet,

724
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:52.870
it's first author but by an error agonies who calls himself a native of tore the

725
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:57.950
seizures.
You have that on a cover of a,
you need us a way where that growth,

726
00:51:57.951 --> 00:52:02.510
you're the devil and down with it to the bottom of the infernal abyss that my

727
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:05.120
eyes may never see it more.
He said,
it's so bad.

728
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:09.950
I said the other so bad replied the first that had I my cell phone,

729
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.270
then take it to make it worse.
It had been passed my skill.

730
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.370
They went on with replay tossing all their books up and down and so forth.

731
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.820
There is a lot of Dante in this episode,

732
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:28.470
but the story of devil's playing a form of tennis Bellota uh,

733
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:33.510
with the souls are the heads of the dead is a traditional story gruesome,
but,

734
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.380
uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
Cervantes embroidered,

735
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:42.430
embroidered upon it by making them use books instead of a headset or soles for

736
00:52:44.121 --> 00:52:48.110
boss.
The attack on our way Janita is very funny.

737
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.970
Uh,
but the commentary on books goes beyond the Apocrypha for uh,

738
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.510
[inaudible].
Uh,

739
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:02.780
this episode reflects a change in the appraisal and the appraisal of books.

740
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.780
By the beginning of the 17th century in the West,

741
00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.500
their value has diminished.

742
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:14.300
It seems to follow an elementary economic law.

743
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.000
With the advent of the printing press,

744
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:21.440
the number of books increased dramatically.
Then the value of each decreased.

745
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:25.800
I mean,
this is basic economics,
but it is more complicated than that

746
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:32.770
philosophy move toward knowledge as the result of the experience,

747
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:39.390
not as something acquired from authoritative sources who's works were in books

748
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:46.500
in Spain,
neo scholasticism about which you have read in Elliot,

749
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:51.990
which was a revival of the medieval philosophy of the church fathers and which

750
00:53:51.991 --> 00:53:56.991
relied on syllogism and the opinion of authoritative sources had become the

751
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:58.980
ideology of the state.

752
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:04.470
Neo scholasticism doctoring,
whatever you want to call it,
and religious template.

753
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.140
It was the ideology of the Spanish crown,

754
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.040
logical argumentation and authorities supplied the foundations of knowledge.

755
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:16.400
Uh,
the,

756
00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.870
we have seen something of that and I mentioned it in the satire of doctors in

757
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:24.320
the person of doctor,
uh,

758
00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:29.350
or [inaudible] who says to Sandra,
you cannot,
you cannot deny that the,

759
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:32.640
the knowledge of medicine at the time was based in play on books,

760
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:33.750
not an experience.

761
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:38.190
So the situation in the rest of Europe was known as extreme,

762
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:42.060
but philosophical thought nonetheless rejected bookish learning in favor of

763
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:45.060
experience and individual thought.

764
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.370
The greatest exponent of these was Dick Carr,

765
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:52.260
whom I have mentioned several times in the course of the semester.

766
00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.400
I had a pre cursor review racial door in a milder or lighter kind of

767
00:54:56.401 --> 00:55:00.600
philosophical speculation was Montana.
Yeah,
I'm funny.

768
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:01.440
Grafton,

769
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.030
Grafton professor at Princeton

770
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:11.110
and Anthony Grafton,
uh,

771
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.190
opens the introduction of his magnificent book,

772
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.920
New World's ancient texts,

773
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.610
the power of tradition and the shock of discovery,
uh,

774
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.210
with these words quote between 15,

775
00:55:24.211 --> 00:55:27.630
50 and 1650 western thinkers,

776
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:32.670
theories to believe that they could find all important truths in ancient books

777
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.560
on quote graft and goes on to quote Jesuit Jose Acosta.

778
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:40.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

779
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:49.790
<v 0>Who published a,
a very important book,</v>

780
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.800
a very comprehensive book about the history of the new world goal is Toryonn.

781
00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

782
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:05.830
<v 0>E moral what art means.
Culture,</v>

783
00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:11.830
not rallies,
uh,
physical,
uh,
of the nature and moral beans.
Uh,
culture.

784
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.040
Uh,
they lost India's

785
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.420
book is from the 1590s,

786
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.880
1592 or something like that.

787
00:56:21.881 --> 00:56:24.190
I can't remember what he says.

788
00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:29.170
He quotes a Acosta who says the following

789
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.180
quote,
having read what poets and philosophers,
right,

790
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:36.310
of the torrid zone.

791
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.600
I persuaded myself that when I came to the equator,

792
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.360
you send a ship on his way to the new world.

793
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:49.630
I would not be able to endure the heat,
put it turned out otherwise.

794
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.570
For when I passed the equator,

795
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:58.350
I felt so cold that I was forced to go into the sun to warm myself.

796
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.010
What could I do?

797
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:04.600
What laugh at Aristotle's meteorology says across the top,

798
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.480
this is mocked,
by the way,
uh,

799
00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:12.880
in chapter 29 of part two,
and the episode of the enchanted boat,

800
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.410
uh,
beaning.
Dot.

801
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:19.530
The actual experience of travel demolishes traditional knowledge,

802
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:24.730
traditional knowledge being whether Saint Joe's or lice who die when they cross

803
00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:27.240
a certain line and so forth.
Remember,
all of that is mobile.

804
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.400
This is what he's behind it.
I run weekly.

805
00:57:30.401 --> 00:57:35.050
Then the proliferation of books being,
uh,

806
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.473
uh,

807
00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.750
at the other time when the authority of the book was most severely tested and

808
00:57:40.751 --> 00:57:43.450
ultimately the value there is the proliferation of,
of,

809
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.740
of books takes place at the time when the authority of the book was most

810
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:50.110
severely tested and ultimately devalued.

811
00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:52.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

812
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:57.860
<v 0>The ability to read many books did not bring one closer to wisdom,</v>

813
00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.110
uh,
both to an inordinate,

814
00:58:00.111 --> 00:58:05.111
perhaps in feed it a large amount of the library and perhaps to Don Quixote's is

815
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.120
Matt.

816
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:06.953
<v 1>Yes.</v>

817
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.920
<v 0>I believe that this is what is implicit in this marvelous passage overall DC</v>

818
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.570
Dora's infernal visitation

819
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:20.950
as customer.
He said one,

820
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.720
this deals with very complicated issues in such an unaffected,

821
00:58:25.721 --> 00:58:26.890
spontaneous,

822
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.160
and amazed and amusing way that it seems almost like a,

823
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:36.110
like a miracle.
Oh,
this is what is behind this,
uh,

824
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:40.000
episode about books being,
uh,
uh,

825
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:44.140
walked with parenting flaming rackets.

826
00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.450
We will be dealing,
uh,

827
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:52.240
chiefly with the end of the Quixote in the last two lectures.
