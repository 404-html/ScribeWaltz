WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.520
I'm going to begin by

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.170
going over briefly the episodes that I didn't get to cover in the last lecture

3
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:12.870
because we,
uh,
we ran out of time.

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
Of course I'm not going to go over every single episode in the novel,

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.120
otherwise we would be here for the whole year at least.
So,
uh,

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.300
but I thought that I,
uh,

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.930
I'd say a few things about the adventure of the dead body.
Uh,

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.550
we have moved from the brightness of the road to the darkness of the episode of

9
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:36.960
the dead body.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.620
This is another instance where appearances conspire to fool Gnocchi Halter,

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.590
although here it is as a Texas seeing artificial,

12
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:49.740
there is uh,
uh,

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.360
we thought artifice without a and he doesn't turn because he doesn't tend to

14
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:59.130
people with a corpse into characters from the you Valerie Romances.

15
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:04.050
This is what is unique about this episode.
Reality as it is,

16
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.040
it's strange enough.
So he does not try to turn them into,

17
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.000
into characters.
From that you ought to read romances,
Dokey,

18
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.830
how this reaction is still to,

19
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.000
to attack as he did the monks in the episode leading to the,
uh,

20
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.720
to the fight with the scanner.
This is another episode,

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.750
but some religious resonances and we will have a few and we have had some,

22
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.300
uh,
before the episode of the,
uh,

23
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.710
the merchants of Toledo for instance,
is,
uh,
one that comes to mind.

24
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.880
Uh,

25
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.880
it has religious resonances because it is a funeral procession and because one

26
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:46.330
of the men,
the one injured by Don Quixote claims,
uh,

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.130
to be an ecclesiastic,
uh,
after all is said and done,
it turns out,

28
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:54.810
is not quite ordained yet.
And so forth.

29
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.570
Sanctuary again fears the police because,
uh,
now a donkey,

30
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:04.860
hope it has injured a person of some note,

31
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.460
uh,
and uh,
uh,

32
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.490
Doki halting may now be excommunicated from the church for having injured

33
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:15.360
someone even who is,

34
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.770
who is going to become a priest and who's not yet a priest.
Uh,

35
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.860
so he's now,
uh,

36
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.220
not only a fugitive from justice,

37
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.000
but in some ways also a fugitive from the church.

38
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.800
Um,
now this is the episode also,

39
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.560
we're central calls don't be hot day.

40
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.950
The [inaudible] figura which try Jarvis translates,

41
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.610
uh,
as a night of the sorrowful figure.
Uh,

42
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:51.270
this is in page a one 39,
uh,

43
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.990
which brings us back,
uh,

44
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.030
two characters with physical physical defects that I spoke about before.

45
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.250
Uh,
certainly,
uh,
don't be hotels we will see in the quote has some,
uh,

46
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.400
marks and physical defects that make him stand out and lead two centuries.

47
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.380
Um,
uh,
calling him that,
uh,

48
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.160
when asked by know chaotic why he called him,
uh,

49
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.760
such a name sent you answers,
uh,

50
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.980
that because he says,

51
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.220
I have been viewing you by the light of the torch that unfortunate man carried.

52
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.581
And in truth,

53
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:35.581
your worship makes at present very near the most woeful figure I have ever seen,

54
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.460
which must be occasion either by the fatigue of these combat or,

55
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.600
uh,
uh,

56
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.760
by your want of teeth because you remember that he has lost several teeth.

57
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.680
Have you been struck by one of the stones and the shepherds?
Uh,
hit him,
uh,
uh,

58
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.663
with,

59
00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.090
so this is a part about his physical defect is injuries and,

60
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.090
and uniqueness as a,
as a,
as a physical being,

61
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.600
but at issue is also don Quixote's awareness that he's adventures will be

62
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:14.440
written or in fact that they are being written.

63
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.900
And Sanchez invention of the amputate has taken place as the text is being

64
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:21.700
composed.
The text that we read,

65
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.240
this is consonant with the issue of the novel being a working progress,

66
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.970
not a fixed text,
but one that has been made as we read it.
Uh,

67
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:38.971
this is a very significant passage that I don't think has been remarked on by

68
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.090
uh,
uh,
by criticism,
but it's page one 39 two,

69
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:46.720
one 40 at the bottom of page one 39.
Uh,

70
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.960
uh,
when south central has explained,
uh,

71
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.160
just explained that he,

72
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.130
he looks the way he looks for the reasons that I have just given.

73
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.700
And then as a don Quixote replies,
it is oh into,

74
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.730
oh into neither a reply don Quixote,

75
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.760
but the sage who has a charge of writing the history of my achievements as

76
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:11.770
thought fit.

77
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.570
I should assume a surname as all the nights of all were wont to do.

78
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.430
One called himself the night of the burning sword and other that are the

79
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:22.270
Unicorn,

80
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.100
this of the damn cells that have the Phoenix and so forth and so on.

81
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.190
So,
uh,
uh,
if you read carefully,

82
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.370
you realize that Don Quixote assumes that it is been written as they,

83
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.540
as they go,
which creates a kind of,
uh,
of,
uh,

84
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.020
in possibility.
How can it be written as they act?

85
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:50.980
Are they following a script or is the writing following what they do?

86
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.230
This is left,
uh,
unclear,

87
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.760
but it feeds into all of the meditations that you find in the novel about the

88
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.970
nature of literature and the nature of writing.

89
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.080
Now,
in addition,
in this episode,

90
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.290
death becomes a presence in the novel during the Bra at the,

91
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:17.090
in Don Quixote was taken for dead,
if you remember.

92
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.180
Uh,
which will happen again,
uh,
in the novel,
uh,

93
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.270
the soft almost dead Marty presides over the episode about his tragic love for

94
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.680
Marcella.
Uh,
so,
uh,

95
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.710
this episode highlights that presence of death in the normal death brings an

96
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:41.990
element of seriousness to this comical episodes.
Uh,

97
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.080
it lurks as a reminder of the character's vulnerability and generally of the

98
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:52.610
human need to create,
uh,
art,

99
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.680
uh,
in the face of certain extinction.
And here,

100
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.590
uh,
I want to bring,
uh,
uh,
in,
uh,

101
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.040
align,
uh,
from two lines,
from a poem by Wallace Stevens,

102
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:11.180
the great American poet,
uh,
uh,

103
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.850
about whom you will hear a little more in today's lecture.
And then,

104
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.740
and the line is death,

105
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.940
mother of beauty within who's booth alum.

106
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.570
We devise our earthly mothers,

107
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:30.170
meaning death drives,
uh,
uh,

108
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.630
humans to create a beauty.

109
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.780
So this is why the presence of death in the Quixote in a general sense is so

110
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.190
important.
Now,
the adventure of the fooling hammers,

111
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.310
uh,
we don't know what a fooling hammer is.

112
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.700
We don't know what it is in Spanish in botanist's,
they don't exist anymore.

113
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.020
This was kind of,
uh,
machinery,
uh,

114
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.100
to a spin a war or something that is driven by a hydraulic force,

115
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.720
by a river or a stream going by.
And it makes this awful,

116
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.220
uh,
noise.
Uh,

117
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.860
we continue in the darkness,
but this,

118
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.140
there is a strange noise that frightens the protagonist,

119
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.330
although Don Quixote denies that he's frightened,
uh,
adamantly.
And,

120
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.470
but this element,
this,
this episode has four elements that I want to bring out.

121
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.240
First is the story of,
of goat herd.
This Doral Ba,

122
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.750
uh,
remember Cisa one,
uh,

123
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.260
this is this episode,
uh,

124
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.980
this quinto they [inaudible] it's never ending.

125
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:41.200
Story is told the story about the,
uh,
uh,

126
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.850
about the sheep being brought across the river.

127
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.920
A sanctuary is telling the story and he tells me how to please do not interrupt

128
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:52.520
me and keep track of the number of sheep.
He said,
all right.

129
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.740
So at one point he asked how many sheep?
And you have as I can remember,

130
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.910
but that's the end of the story.
And uh,
don't be healthy.
He's very angry.

131
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.050
Why?
Uh,
and this is where,
because I told you that that was the,

132
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.860
those were the conditions and so forth.
Now this is a story that's very funny.

133
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:12.610
It's also a love story.
If you,
if you look at intuit,
uh,
between,
uh,

134
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.250
these two shepherds,
these two gut hurts.
But,
uh,
you know,

135
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:22.251
it is also a story that in which the issue of language and reality is,

136
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.090
is underlined.
Because here,
uh,
sanctuary is a demanding,

137
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.940
a kind of literality.
I mean,

138
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:33.620
literally one sheep,
you say sheep and there is one cheap,

139
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.560
you say ship station of the sheep.
You can't,
you have to use,

140
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.630
you have to count every single one language cannot abstractly say 45 sheep.

141
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.400
He has to say one sheep to sheep,
three sheep for sheep.

142
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.620
This is a very elementary,

143
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.840
a way of conceiving of language.
But this is,
uh,

144
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.540
what,
uh,
Cervantes is bringing in that this,
this,

145
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.610
this folk tale sometimes contain very,
uh,
interesting,

146
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.410
uh,
uh,
elements about,
uh,

147
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.530
the nature of storytelling.
And this is a,
I don't know if you,

148
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:11.820
if you know any of these such stories,
but I remember in my childhood,
uh,

149
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.680
hearing some of them now,
the second part we have already mentioned,

150
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.880
and it's the,
the fact that,
uh,
sanctuary defecates out of fear.
Of course,

151
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.250
Sankyo goes to the bathroom out of fear.

152
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.520
He tries to hide it from Don Quixote,

153
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.030
but Don Quixote smells it and tells him to please move away,

154
00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:33.720
that he can't stand the smell.
Um,

155
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.280
classics of Literature.
I think I said this at the end of,
of,
of the class,
uh,

156
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.430
after the lecture,

157
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.680
classics of Literature Contain the whole range of human experience,
uh,

158
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.540
including the most humble physical functions.
And,
uh,

159
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.270
this is,
uh,
an instance of that.

160
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.590
There are similar episodes in Chaucer,
I'm sure,
as you remember.

161
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:03.470
And in Dante also in inferno,
they're very,
uh,
uh,
uh,

162
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.980
eschatological,
uh,
episodes in Dante too,

163
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.210
but not as,
uh,
as humble as a,

164
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:17.211
this a instance where essential cannot contain himself and has to go to the

165
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:20.450
bathroom.
The other,
uh,

166
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.280
another element is the fact that they don't hold their beat,

167
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:28.020
sent you over the head,
uh,
in anger.
Uh,

168
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.230
this continues to round off the relationship between these two characters is the

169
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:37.910
relationship that includes tenderness and imbues anger.
Uh,
and,

170
00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:41.980
and that is very thoroughly,
uh,
developed in the novel.

171
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.310
This is something new,
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,
in a way this really invented.

172
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.370
And finally what I would like,
I would like to bring out,
uh,

173
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.580
the question of how does central,
now that there is water in the vicinity,

174
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:59.650
remedies is,
oh,
there must be water around here.

175
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.580
And how can he tell time by the stars?

176
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.590
He knows what time it is by the stars.
Well,
here we learned,
you may remember,

177
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.640
and I,
I've also,

178
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.320
I've always asked you to read for details that central says that he was a

179
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:16.600
shepherd ones.
Uh,

180
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.450
and hence he learned how to find water for his animals and fresh,
uh,

181
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.770
uh,
grass for them.
Uh,

182
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.990
I think the significant thing here is that we begin to learn about Sanchez past

183
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.680
retrospectively.

184
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.240
It's not as if at the beginning they told us all the narrator tells Sandra who

185
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:39.820
was a shepherd,
this and that and the other.

186
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.330
And then he begins the adventures to begin to learn retrospectively about a

187
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.640
sanctuary,
a activities in the past,
and how he came to be who he is.

188
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:53.020
Now these are very effective,
effective device to,

189
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.540
uh,
to fill out the character.
Uh,

190
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.310
and I want you to notice it because it would be other instances where we will

191
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.580
find out other things about Saint Joe's a past.

192
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.700
So,
uh,
so his life is filled on the goal,
not,
uh,
uh,

193
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.320
not following a conventional chronological progression.

194
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.350
Because what I want to do to take notice of I say narrative technique and now we

195
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:23.260
get,
those are the episodes that I didn't get to in the last class.

196
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.120
And now we get to the second part of the today's class,

197
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:32.200
which has to do with these three topics.
Now,

198
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.030
why does Cervantes

199
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.540
and wider say Quixote focus so much on low class types and even criminals?

200
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.340
This is something I've talked about before,

201
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.150
but I will be harping upon again today.

202
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.610
Now we have spoken about Martinez who is a prostitute.

203
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.940
But there are others,
like for instance,

204
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:59.140
the servant who beats up donkey hotter in the episode about the merchants of

205
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:03.220
Toledo,
the rowdies,
uh,

206
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.840
who toss sanctuary in the blanket,
uh,

207
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.620
undress,
who's been bitten by his master,
but who seems to be a picker?

208
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.750
Oh himself,
the first in keeper who was,

209
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.780
I've called him a retired Pico and the prostitutes or the first in we will need

210
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.550
others.
What a few other such types.

211
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.780
As we talk about the galleys laves episode today,

212
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.660
we will be attempting to answer this question,
why the focus on this,
uh,
uh,

213
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.760
kinds of character about the abundance of low class types and outlaws by the

214
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:45.760
way,
a galley slaves.

215
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.880
I say this because I'm sure that you have never heard of these before.

216
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:52.010
It's not something that we are familiar with.
Galileo in Spanish.

217
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.070
We're prisoners or,

218
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.100
or legally slaves who were forced to row in the galleys,

219
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:04.760
be they private or more,
uh,
often owned by the crown.

220
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.620
That is these,
these,
these ships move with sales.
But also with,

221
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.880
uh,
oars on the oars were manned by the Galley.

222
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:18.410
Slaves were s sat in rows inside and were whipped,

223
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.490
uh,
to a,
to row.

224
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.740
A harder and harder is a terrible kind of punishment.

225
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.880
And I can go in detail about the lengths of the synthesis there and the fact

226
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:32.930
that most of them didn't come back alive and so forth.
But,
uh,
uh,

227
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.350
that's what a galley slave is.
Um,

228
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.140
the closest I think we have is those chain gangs.

229
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:42.460
And we see occasionally in some states,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

230
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.180
prisoners going around in their striped uniforms and so forth.
Now,

231
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.190
let me anticipate some ideas and reiterate others that I haven't already

232
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:57.191
mentioned before to give her a context to what I'm going to be saying.

233
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.340
The renaissance is interested in the nature of humankind,

234
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.770
relatively independent of God.

235
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.750
Renaissance thinkers and artists focus on the characters like the wild man,

236
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:12.800
for instance,
uh,
who are close to nature.

237
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:16.760
And those reveal there'll belonging to the natural world rather than to the

238
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:19.430
social world.
The wild man,

239
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:24.431
it's an individual lost in the woods or in some cave who lives in a state of

240
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:29.690
nature away from civilization.
In Spanish literature,

241
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:34.691
the best known example is say he smoothed though the protagonist of life is a

242
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:37.910
dream.
It played by Pedro.
God,
they don't,

243
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:42.970
they'll America that I will be mentioning a often during the semester,

244
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.470
you may have heard of it before.

245
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.740
These renaissance thinkers and artists also concentrate on individuals who

246
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.750
willfully become a marginal to society like madmen and criminals.

247
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:01.390
The underlying idea is that society masks you racists or attenuates fundamental

248
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:07.700
traits of the human.
That is also,
uh,

249
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.800
an aesthetic reason.
Social individuals are types people,

250
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.460
individuals in society become types.
Uh,

251
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.180
their features had determined by social conventions attached to their station or

252
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:23.624
trade,

253
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.640
whereas marginal figures are individual in their appearance and behavior.

254
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.950
Don't Quixote and Santo,
we'll meet characters like Diego.

255
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.730
They meet under the man in green in part two,

256
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:43.060
who lead boring lives because they conform to social norms.

257
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.020
He is a rich Italian group,
uh,

258
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.050
who lives a life of ease in his estate and who lodges the night and his choir

259
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.180
for several days.

260
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.800
And it's very comfortable house on till Don Quixote gets bored.

261
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.300
Doki hotel and the picture of,
uh,

262
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.890
he meets on the other hand are not boring.
They,
they lead lives of adventure.

263
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.630
They are appealing because of their deviations.
Justice.

264
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.720
They are physically attractive because of the deformities that the bear as we

265
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:21.450
saw,
uh,
in the last class,
of course,

266
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:25.890
epic heroes,
I'm protagonists of Javari Romances led very interesting lives,

267
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:30.460
needless to say,
a full of adventures.
But those adventures took place in,
uh,

268
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.980
in this and in a distance and vague past a,

269
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:40.130
an abstract countries with generic qualities drawn from literary conventions,

270
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.110
whereas the peaker Roseanne Donkey,

271
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:48.111
hope they live in the present and live in a society that the reader recognizes

272
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.590
as his own.

273
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.830
The clash between the two is at the core of donkey hotel of course.

274
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.270
But the point is that except in his imagination,
uh,

275
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.320
Don Quixote never inhabited a world other than that of Spain in the leg in the

276
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.760
late 16th century,

277
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.600
among people involved in ordinary activities who do not violate the laws of

278
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:22.670
nature.
No one flies.
For instance,
in the guilty,

279
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.460
uh,
Oprah forms feats that are beyond human,
uh,

280
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.520
strength,
uh,
us,
uh,

281
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:35.150
happens in the epic or as happens in the romances of jewelry.

282
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.770
We are about to comment on an episode of where this clash between idealized time

283
00:19:43.101 --> 00:19:47.510
and space meet,
uh,
real time present day Casteel

284
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.850
I refer about,
uh,
to the episode about Mum Reno's a helmet,

285
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:55.860
uh,

286
00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.860
in chapter 21 and here's what your handout may be of some use because in the

287
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.650
individual part of a handout,
I have,
uh,
um,

288
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.770
um,
I have there a barber's basin.

289
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.860
I have the depiction of a barbarous basin because no one in this room has ever

290
00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:18.790
seen a barber's Beijing,
even myself,
because they are no longer in use.

291
00:20:18.791 --> 00:20:23.370
Barbara's basin is this device at the Barbara would use,
uh,

292
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.630
and it has an indentation like that to put her on the under the person's,
uh,

293
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.530
Chin and for the neck and then wash the beer and the water would fall in it.

294
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:38.150
Uh,
and uh,
so I want to go,
I wanted you to have it,
uh,
uh,
uh,

295
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.460
a depiction of that so you will not what we are talking about here,

296
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.810
why San Angelo says,
what a huge head this giant had this.
Of course,

297
00:20:46.811 --> 00:20:48.580
it's a base in like that.
And he would,
you know,

298
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.270
<v 1>so</v>

299
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.620
<v 0>there are two important elements in the mammary no helmet,
uh,
episode,</v>

300
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.080
uh,
which is one of the most,
uh,

301
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.920
famous and discussed in the Quixote because it brings to the fore the

302
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:09.550
discussions about the nature of the reel that dominates the discussion among the

303
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:10.384
characters,

304
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.620
but particularly between Don Quixote and sanctuary as they do here.

305
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.450
The first element has to do with the,

306
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.000
the first element that I want to bring out in this episode has to do with the

307
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.650
oath.
Uh,
Don Quixote made earlier in chapter 10,

308
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:32.220
which by fulfilling it would close a loop in the plot.
Uh,

309
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.200
upon seeing the barbers basing shining,

310
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.280
he remembers the oath that he made when he discovered that part of his own

311
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:42.010
helmet had been damaged in the fight with Biz Caner.

312
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.790
So he says that the opportunity now when he sees the,
the,
the,

313
00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:48.870
the basic,
uh,
uh,

314
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.770
rice is to fulfill the oath quote about which I swore,
uh,

315
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.750
uh,
uh,
the oath which I swore us,
you know,
he tells sanctuary and page,

316
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.820
uh,
uh,
one 53 when he sees the,
the basic,
he said,

317
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:03.790
this is the opportunity to do,

318
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:07.990
fulfill that oath that I made don't get hot.

319
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.020
They had sworn the following up,
uh,

320
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.060
after the fact would there be scanner I quilt.
I quote,

321
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.980
I swear by the creator of all things and by all that is contained in the four

322
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:22.981
Holly evangelists to lead the life of the great markets of mantra when he vowed

323
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.220
to revenge the death of his nephew Valdovinos,

324
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.490
which was not to eat bread on a tablecloth,

325
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.450
nor Salas himself with his wife and other things,
which I wish.
No,
I do not.

326
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.480
Now remember our allow here for expressed until I am fully revenge on him who

327
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:41.230
had done me this outrage

328
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.363
<v 1>quote.</v>

329
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:48.320
<v 0>Of course the outrage is the damage to the helmet that he can now restore with</v>

330
00:22:48.321 --> 00:22:50.270
the news that uh,

331
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.920
with a new one that approaches and that he plans to appropriate the normal

332
00:22:54.921 --> 00:22:56.060
begins to acquire.

333
00:22:56.061 --> 00:23:01.061
This is the point and inner density and substance by means of these links,

334
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.500
these connections within the plot,
one link to the other,

335
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.890
the oath and the fulfillment of the oath.

336
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.800
Now the second element that I want to bring up has to do of course with the

337
00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:21.801
confusion created by the wet shining basing that looks like a helmet.

338
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.460
Mum Breanna's helmet belongs to the traditional whole long and his various

339
00:23:29.461 --> 00:23:33.350
incarnations as Orlando Roland or learn.

340
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.700
This is the Carolingian cycle of chivalrous that I mentioned in one of my early

341
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:57.350
lectures.
Mum Helmet is one,
uh,

342
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.090
with a roller Indian literature in boy,

343
00:24:00.091 --> 00:24:05.091
Yara Doe [inaudible] form core Orlando Orlando love play.

344
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.550
Now the [inaudible] Bank kills the Morris Mum Breeno and winds his enchanted

345
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:17.921
helmet in Ariosto Orlando Furioso whom I have mentioned before.

346
00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:20.960
I will mention several times in the course of the semester.

347
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.240
Disenchanted helmet had been warm from the mortgage King Mum Brino by Donna

348
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.170
Donielle del Monte,

349
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.200
not sucky Pantheist Don Quixote misremembers and Reinaldo [inaudible] Wilson

350
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.190
when he kills the than.

351
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.080
So this is the background of Merinos Helmet,

352
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.560
uh,
in his imagination,

353
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:48.080
a donkey hold the acts like the Carolingian hero in obtaining the helmet from

354
00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:50.630
the Moorish king.

355
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:56.170
So mom Breanna's helmet has an incontestable [inaudible] Rick pedigree deep

356
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.443
pedigree,

357
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.270
which makes it all the more ridiculous that it be confused with the barbers

358
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:07.020
basing.
So you have to have this background to realize,
uh,

359
00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:10.640
the,
the,
the distance between this mum Breanna's helmet,

360
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.550
uh,
and uh,
uh,
on the Berbers basing.

361
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.750
This is why I wanted to give you that background,

362
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.680
but there are attenuating circumstances were donkey halters error,
reality,

363
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.650
contingency,
contingency.
I mean,
accidents

364
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.110
conspire to confuse him as in the case of the dead body,

365
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:39.430
the basing is not being used for what is intended for,

366
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.490
it was intended to,

367
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.910
to do the barber has it on his head to protect his new hat from the rain.

368
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.330
Remember the detail.

369
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:49.850
He has a new hat and he puts her on to protect it from the rain.

370
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.420
This is the only time by the way in which it rains in the entire hotel.

371
00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.420
If you want to know the detail.
Uh,

372
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.350
the only time when it rains it doesn't rain very often still.
By the way,
I still,

373
00:26:05.351 --> 00:26:07.680
it was very dry and uh,

374
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.170
so this is consistent with the real uh,

375
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.740
conditions of the,
of the region.

376
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.070
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

377
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.760
<v 0>So it rains,
uh,
and is being used to protect the hat.</v>

378
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.440
So the barber has it on his head.
I said to protect his new,
uh,

379
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.940
his new hat.

380
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:32.250
The poor Barbara is the victim of this is a mutation of the circumstance.

381
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:37.450
Uh,
the,
it happens with other things.
Uh,

382
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.850
in Mickey holiday,
us,
you know,

383
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:44.070
the inn was originally a stable or parts of the inward,
generally a stable.

384
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.170
In the real world,

385
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:51.230
things are adapted ad hoc for purposes other than those they were made for.

386
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.650
Their essence does not guarantee their usage.

387
00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.560
They are in flux.

388
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:08.470
Remember what Don Quixote said after the episode of the windmills about

389
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.710
mutations,
how things are in a constant state of mutation.

390
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:18.440
So reality is in a state of flux as his donkey hope they uh,
himself.

391
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:24.100
Hence he takes the shining barbers based for mom Bruno's helmet.

392
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:30.010
This episode exemplifies the modern radical doubt about the power of the census

393
00:27:32.271 --> 00:27:34.130
to grasp reality,

394
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.820
which will become a topic of the Baroque,

395
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.470
the period immediately or almost immediately after the renaissance at about,

396
00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:44.660
which I'll be talking a lot later on.

397
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.380
Remember what I said about the critical Tj cliche that the first part of the

398
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:51.340
Quixote is renaissance and second part is Baroque.

399
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.233
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

400
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.490
<v 0>but the topic of the,</v>

401
00:27:56.491 --> 00:28:01.090
our sense is not being able to really just the stern reality is one that is

402
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.980
still with us.

403
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.850
It is a sort of of doubt about the ray of that we find even today in a modern

404
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:13.590
pawn such as what as Stevens man carrying a thing,

405
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:19.140
which is the poem that you have on the other side of your handout today.

406
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.430
I bring up this poem because in one or two occasions,

407
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:28.170
the basin is referred to us.
The thing I think that shines sign,
Jill says,

408
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:33.600
as of yet lacking ontological and phenomenological specificity,
ontological,

409
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:38.730
uh,
it's been,
it's not specify a specific,
it's,
it's appearance is phenomenology.

410
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:42.690
It's not specific.
And so it's called a thing.

411
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.410
And so I always,
when I come to this episode,

412
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.200
think of this poem by Wallace Stevens was seen as being one of my favorite to
my,

413
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.050
if not my favorite poet,
he was an American port 80 79,

414
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:57.570
1955 who spent all,
all,

415
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:01.410
all of his life as an executive for an insurance company in Hartford,

416
00:29:01.411 --> 00:29:04.080
Connecticut.
Nevertheless,

417
00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:08.070
he was really one of the major American poets.

418
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.230
So man carrying thin,

419
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:16.160
the poem must resist the intelligence almost successfully.

420
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:22.430
Illustration at Brune figure in winter evening resists identity.

421
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.150
The thing he carries resist the most necessity to sense,

422
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:28.590
accept them.

423
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.680
Then a secondary parts parts not quite perceived of the off bill's whole on

424
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:37.950
certain particles of the certain solid,

425
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.410
the primary free from doubt,

426
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:46.230
things floating like the first hundred flakes of snow out of a storm.

427
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.980
We must endure all night out of a storm of secondary things,

428
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.340
horror of thoughts that suddenly a real,

429
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.830
we must endure our thoughts all night.

430
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.050
And the bride abuse stands motionless in cold.

431
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.200
I don't think the bright all views ever,
uh,

432
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.200
stance motions in cold in the hot day.

433
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.310
But I think that this poem brings,
uh,
uh,

434
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.190
dramatizes uh,
the uh,
uh,
what is,
uh,

435
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.660
happening in this episode with this thing that,
uh,

436
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.920
Don Quixote takes to be a helmet and sank,
knows is a barber's,

437
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.920
uh,
basing.
This is a Cartesian problem since it,

438
00:30:27.921 --> 00:30:32.200
since it was the character who first gave full attention to it.
How do we,

439
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.710
how do we really know the real doubt as the principal of modern philosophy is

440
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:43.530
present here already in this sense said Avantis takes leave from renaissance

441
00:30:44.621 --> 00:30:48.220
thought and poetics as in many others.
I move doors,
the Baroque,

442
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.740
the basing would be up here.

443
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.440
The basic will reappear and provoke a full fledge discussion in the,

444
00:30:56.491 --> 00:31:01.360
in among various characters about whether it is a basin or a helmet with
amazing,

445
00:31:01.361 --> 00:31:02.194
they're

446
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.510
hilarious parody of a scholastic debate.

447
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.160
The basing is one of those things that the novel focuses on and that I told you

448
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:17.050
to take notice of in connection with Albert,

449
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:21.370
his theories of our perspective because the,
the base in the scene,
in the scene,

450
00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:24.460
in the distance,
in the depths.
Uh,

451
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.120
and this is why it is difficult to ascertain what it is.

452
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.371
Now,

453
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:35.371
the second part of the chapter contains what I called Don Quixote's own chivalry

454
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.470
romance.
But I know if you remember this part,
but you should,
uh,

455
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.730
here we see don't Kihatha in the act of creating a CI Valerie Romance.
Remember,

456
00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:50.300
Santo Asks Him,
uh,
if they should just,
if they shouldn't go and,

457
00:31:50.301 --> 00:31:55.301
and try to gain some notoriety and fame by doing important things.

458
00:31:55.841 --> 00:31:59.970
And then so then,
okay,
hotel,
uh,
launches on this,
uh,
uh,

459
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.240
uh,
uh,
uh,
narrative about a,

460
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.990
uh,
chivalry romance,
which he,
which he,

461
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.010
he creates out of elements drawn from many of these romances.

462
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.580
He has been able to condense from various romance,

463
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.360
the essence of the Chivalry Romance,
the basic story.

464
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.660
This story reveals what he has in his head.

465
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.230
This probe into the mind of a character is also new in fiction here and

466
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:34.660
elsewhere,
as in the case of Kardinia whom you're going to meet right away.

467
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.400
Uh,
we get intimations of a character's subconscious,

468
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.410
not just of his actions.

469
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:46.340
This once the case in the epic that you romances of chivalry and even in the

470
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.570
picaresque here we get,
uh,
something about,

471
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.040
don't you hold this to it?
This will happen several times in,
in the novel.

472
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.900
The story of this,
uh,

473
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.670
while Rick Romance is an exercise in narrative,

474
00:33:01.671 --> 00:33:06.260
but we just said Vantis is underlining the conventions of the two.
Valerie Java,

475
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.380
the fact that there is a kind of basic blueprint or structure upon which anyone

476
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.280
can embroider.

477
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:18.790
This is true by the way of popular forms of narrative like James Bond movies,

478
00:33:18.921 --> 00:33:23.921
of which they keep making more and more and more because the basic blueprint is

479
00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:27.740
there.
And then all you have to do is to make a slight change in,
in,

480
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:30.060
in one character here.
Uh,

481
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.970
or a slight change in this kind of adventure.
And a,

482
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.630
you have a James Bond.
Uh,
the same was true with the Conan Doyle,

483
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.180
uh,
on and Jello home stories.

484
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.440
And of course as I've mentioned several times with soap or soap opera and which

485
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:48.740
is always a Latin American soap opera is always uh,

486
00:33:48.741 --> 00:33:53.741
that the poor secretary has an affair with the song of the very rich a boss.

487
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.010
And so did you can go from there.
You know,
she has a baby,

488
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.820
she doesn't have a baby.
And

489
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:06.420
so Cervantes us with the picaresque.
Uh,

490
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:10.220
and we're going to discuss it in the following a discussion of the galleys lakes

491
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:14.390
episode.
So rant.
This is concerned that the conventions of literature,

492
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.420
it's topics droid away from real life that even the new joggers new in relation

493
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:27.461
to the classics reassert their literariness by deploying this conventions which

494
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:33.101
turn into predictable systems awareness of this possibility is crucial to the

495
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.670
whole key.
Hope they are to serve Vantis entire work.

496
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.800
How convention obscures the real and shields shields us from it.

497
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.860
How literature quickly,

498
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.370
quickly retreats from two formulas like dosing,
donkey,

499
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.320
Quixote's mind

500
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.850
self reflexivity helps to point out these conventions and to show their

501
00:34:57.891 --> 00:35:01.820
disconnection from reality.
They're being self generated and self contained.

502
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.040
I am reminded here,

503
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:08.120
I don't know if you've seen the kiss of the spider woman,
but a,

504
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:13.121
it's a great movie and you remember that Molina is telling his cellmate all of

505
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:16.190
these movies that he has in his head,

506
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.510
he has memorized and there are people who have memorized the plots of many

507
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.540
movies and can condense them into a kind of a generic movie.

508
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:28.541
The way don't Quixote is creating here at kind of a generic chivalry romance.

509
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.600
This also plays into the game of mirrors that they can hottie is becoming.

510
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:36.950
It is a story within the,

511
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.110
the large story is a parody of a romance of chivalry.

512
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:48.830
It is this what is calling French composers on a Bema,

513
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.370
uh,
and in,
in,

514
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:56.390
in English is the infinitely receiving sequences that we found in Velasquez

515
00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.590
Meninas.
The story within the story,
like the painting within the painting,

516
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.260
like the play within the play in hamlet.

517
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:10.790
I first visualize this as a child looking at the label on a condensed milk can

518
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:18.330
and the label depicted a condensed milk can with the same label within which

519
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:19.740
there was another,
uh,

520
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.300
label with the same condensed milk can and so forth and so on.

521
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:28.400
And I had the vertigo of not knowing whether I was part of a larger condensed

522
00:36:28.401 --> 00:36:31.830
milk can have some uh,
such depiction or

523
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.530
guys,
they don't go to a barber shops anymore.
I don't know,

524
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.010
think it doesn't look like it to me,
but I mean some of you,
some of you do,
but,

525
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.140
but a little boys discovered this in barbershops when you sat in the barber's

526
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.970
chair and you were surrounded by mirrors and certainly you show yourself,
wow.

527
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:54.060
Get lost in an infinity of,
of reflections of yourself.

528
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:59.060
There is an infinity receding sequels
that is,

529
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.970
there is no without,
if you are within that,
there is no without,
you're always,

530
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.320
uh,
everything is within literature,
hearse.

531
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:10.530
Hence there is no authority that orders the universe of fiction,

532
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.600
which is continuous with that reality.

533
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:17.670
The only infinite being would be God.
So to posit this kind of,

534
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:23.260
so to posit this kind of abyss like universe is a form of radical skepticism on

535
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:28.110
the part of Cervantes,
on of Shakespeare.
By the way,
uh,
here,

536
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:30.840
the authority within that fiction is house of mirrors.

537
00:37:30.841 --> 00:37:34.260
I'm sure you've also gone to a house of mirrors.
Uh,
uh,

538
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:39.261
is a madman don Quixote as within the picaresque and we will get to that.

539
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.000
It is,
it will be [inaudible] the PASA mounting.

540
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.290
Another important point about this generic g Valerie Romance,

541
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:51.990
that donkey hopping,
uh,

542
00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.780
comes up with here in answer to Sanchez question,

543
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.340
is that Don Quixote reveals his worries about his lineage.

544
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:01.590
He is,

545
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:06.150
he has to acquire fame to aspire to marry a princess behind this.

546
00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:10.770
Apparently ninth preoccupation lays one of the social issues at stake in the

547
00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:11.520
novel,

548
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.520
the question of social class and privilege and the possibility of acquiring it

549
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.450
rather than inheriting it.
Uh,

550
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.320
you remember that he,
he's,
he,

551
00:38:24.321 --> 00:38:29.321
he speaks here about he will acquire enough fame by dint of his own valor to

552
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.740
married being married to a princess.
Uh,

553
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.960
even in the relationship between the night and his choir,

554
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:42.430
there is there intimations of a leveling of social classes here in this,
in this.

555
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:45.520
Uh,
and you will see as we move,
we move to part two,

556
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.450
but this will increase the Santos importance in the novel increases.

557
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.740
So this is one of the topics,
but here we get another glimpse at Oakey hold.

558
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:58.741
The subconscious he is worried about his lack of nobility is lack of

559
00:39:00.281 --> 00:39:01.690
aristocratic background.

560
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.143
<v 2>Okay,</v>

561
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.230
<v 0>now we get to the galleys leaves,
uh,
which is again,</v>

562
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.730
another famous episode,
uh,
in the keyhole.
This is chapter 22,

563
00:39:14.731 --> 00:39:15.564
part one,

564
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:20.400
because it also shows a Cervantes dealing with the question of literature.

565
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.330
Uh,
more specifically the picaresque,
uh,

566
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.740
notice by the way in this,
uh,
chapter,

567
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:34.250
the mistranslation when Jarvis renders renders Alpha witty as pimp.

568
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.380
In page one 66,
what it should be,

569
00:39:37.381 --> 00:39:41.670
go between the galleys slave who has been a go between.

570
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.340
Remember the donkey help,
they actually praises,
uh,

571
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.890
in the,
in the original it says,

572
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.290
[inaudible] is someone who arranges marriages.

573
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:56.370
I eliciting encounters between lovers and all of that,
but he's not a pimp.

574
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:01.170
A pimp,
uh,
is,
is an agent for prostitutes,

575
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.570
uh,
alcohol wipe this or go betweens,
uh,

576
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.620
have been priced throughout the ages,

577
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.770
even by Saint Augustine.
At some point,
he praises the,

578
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:19.310
the job that they do in arranging couples to meet and become lovers.

579
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:27.650
So just,
just the detail about,
about the translation.
Uh,

580
00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:30.810
I don't want to Belabor the failings of the translation,

581
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.330
which is a pretty good one.
Now again,

582
00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:37.930
why the picaresque you want to go?

583
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:41.220
And you might be getting tired of my talking about the picker rest,

584
00:40:41.221 --> 00:40:43.570
but the picker ask is the new,
uh,

585
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.640
fiction that precedes the keyhole pay precedes the ramp.
This work,

586
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.780
uh,
within which and against which he,
uh,
he writes

587
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:58.810
not only because the picaresque comes up again because not only because,

588
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.200
uh,
like the Picato,
uh,

589
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.070
he nest the [inaudible] who is the,
the main character here,

590
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.760
uh,
is a criminal bar.
More importantly,

591
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.940
because he missed the [inaudible] is an author

592
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.630
<v 2>when asked</v>

593
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.800
<v 0>if his book is good by Don Quixote,
he nas replies,</v>

594
00:41:22.801 --> 00:41:26.060
I'm on page one 69.
So good answer.

595
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.100
He says that woe be to Las [inaudible] miss.

596
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:34.110
And to all that have written north shore or shall write in that way on what asks

597
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.930
for the title.
And if it is finished,
he needs answers.
Quote,

598
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.690
if called the life of [inaudible] replied,

599
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:47.180
he knows himself and is it finished?
Both Don Quixote.
How can it be finished?

600
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:49.400
Answer,
he says,
my life is not yet finished.

601
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:55.130
What is written is from the my cradle to the moment of my being said this last

602
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.380
time too.
The galleys.
Oh,
cool.

603
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:59.703
<v 2>Ah,</v>

604
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
<v 0>picaresque novels tended to be called [inaudible] life off [inaudible] law.</v>

605
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.280
The life of UNESCO someones day is obviously a picaresque kind of novel that he

606
00:42:11.281 --> 00:42:12.390
has written about himself.

607
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:18.230
So Cervantes is poking fun here at the conventions of autobiographical writing.

608
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.280
Meaning how can you write an autobiography if you your rice?
It is not over.

609
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:27.760
It's what,
uh,
what,
uh,
he knows answers and surround.

610
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:29.910
This is spoken in front of that.
Uh,

611
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.730
so which leads in autobiographical writing as in the,

612
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.920
in the confessions of the north,
you know,

613
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:39.750
so forth to the creation of a death and resurrection kind of a scheme.

614
00:42:39.751 --> 00:42:44.260
That is,
I,
uh,
I'm speaking about the man that I formerly was until I,

615
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.960
I had a conversion by which the old man died on the new one arose and so forth.

616
00:42:48.961 --> 00:42:53.961
So this is what is behind this little repartee here between [inaudible] and

617
00:42:54.211 --> 00:42:56.600
Oakey holiday,
which is,
uh,
uh,

618
00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:01.000
a satire of autobiographical writing and of,
uh,

619
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.610
an off the picaresque novel,
uh,
specifically,
uh,

620
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:06.950
here,
uh,

621
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:11.990
he nest on this underscores the fact that there is no way to put a stop to it by

622
00:43:12.571 --> 00:43:15.240
saying that the last time he went to the gallery,

623
00:43:15.241 --> 00:43:19.140
so every time he went to the galleys he takes up the book again and writing and

624
00:43:19.141 --> 00:43:19.890
writing and writes it.

625
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.530
And he says at one point here that he doesn't mind going to the goddess because

626
00:43:22.531 --> 00:43:24.000
there he'll be able to finish this book.

627
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.990
So there is a kind of literal continuity between life and writing.

628
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.250
That is what is being made fun of in this episode.

629
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.960
Now you remember the whole background of the bicker ESCOs are giving it to you

630
00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:41.961
many times from the cell is Deena do the goose Mondale farace f 15,

631
00:43:42.121 --> 00:43:46.500
99.
Right at the time don't be,
I mean Sorento riding donkey hoppy.

632
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.300
I mean there was Mondale for Rachio.

633
00:43:48.301 --> 00:43:50.670
The protagonist is a galley slave at one point.

634
00:43:50.671 --> 00:43:54.150
So the allusion to there was Amanda for Roger here is very clear

635
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.851
now he asked them,

636
00:43:56.851 --> 00:44:00.840
[inaudible] is one of the most important secondary characters in the Quixote.

637
00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.210
This is what an oxymoron.
Secondary and important.

638
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.900
They are important secondary characters and Kerrick secondary characters that

639
00:44:09.901 --> 00:44:14.010
are not important.
Not only because it's really fun and we're,
I'm funny,

640
00:44:14.011 --> 00:44:16.410
he's really a lot of fun.
Uh,
and he will be up here,

641
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.910
but because he's one of the story tellers in the book,

642
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:26.690
hence is part of the books take on literature and the nature of narrative he

643
00:44:27.091 --> 00:44:32.091
knows is one of the many storytellers in the Quixote by mean characters who not

644
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:37.350
only tell a story or recite a poem,
but who are writing or have written a book.

645
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:43.490
They both memorable of these are of course the narrator of the Quixote who

646
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:48.580
claims not to be the author,
the Apocryphal Cdma,
traveling,
Haley,

647
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.980
the translator and so forth.
These are all characters who have written a book.

648
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:57.960
There'll be all this got Daniel [inaudible] Cervantes is considering with them.

649
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.580
The possibility of new John was new forms of literature emerging,

650
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.480
which they are at the time that he is writing and showing the mechanisms by

651
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:11.940
which a new Java is born a new job.

652
00:45:11.941 --> 00:45:15.450
I'm meeting a new kind of literature that is not merely derived or copied from

653
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:19.710
the classics as what's done or attempted to be done in the renaissance.

654
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.750
These are,
uh,

655
00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:26.250
authors like lawpay the Vega who's name I've mentioned many times,

656
00:45:26.251 --> 00:45:30.180
and I'm not going to put it on the board because you must remember who created

657
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.830
as it were,
the Spanish theater,
national theater,
the chameleon.

658
00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:38.043
<v 1>Uh,</v>

659
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:45.070
<v 0>and so he never is as complex a figure as other narrators with hope.</v>

660
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.190
They like,
see,
I made the binning heavy.
Uh,

661
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:52.120
and I remind you again and I'll good probably again in this lecture that at this

662
00:45:52.121 --> 00:45:54.220
point between the 16th and the 17th century,

663
00:45:54.221 --> 00:45:56.710
the first professional authors are emerging.

664
00:45:56.711 --> 00:46:00.570
That is authors who are trying to make a living from the writing.
Nope.

665
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:04.210
He did a very,
very well because of course you,

666
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:06.350
if he wrote so many plays on the word,
they do so well.

667
00:46:06.351 --> 00:46:10.270
Cervantes didn't do so well as we know.

668
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.920
No.
This interest in the nature of literature and the figure of the author in the

669
00:46:18.921 --> 00:46:22.570
Quixote is because the novel,
this novel,

670
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.600
the hotel is not so much about the question of the book as it is about that of

671
00:46:28.841 --> 00:46:30.790
the books in the plural.

672
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:35.890
As we saw in the episode of the scrutiny of the library.

673
00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.460
It is about the proliferation of books made possible by the development of the

674
00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:47.761
printing press and the economic factors that encourage editorial production in

675
00:46:48.281 --> 00:46:49.450
the 16th century.

676
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.060
The Quixote is the first major work to consider how the dissemination of books

677
00:46:56.741 --> 00:47:01.120
on settles received notions about the book and about authorship.

678
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.120
Uh,
this,
uh,

679
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.840
remember again turn of the century 16th to the 17th new John has new authors

680
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.500
like Mattel and [inaudible] who are professionals and so forth.

681
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:15.270
This is tied to the whole issue of the book.

682
00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.213
<v 1>Thanks.</v>

683
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.610
<v 0>No,
I'm going to go into a part of a lecture here that might get a little dense</v>

684
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.520
because,
um,
um,
uh,
it's about,
uh,

685
00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:30.280
this proliferation of books in relation to the author on the voracity of the

686
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:32.980
books.
I'll go very slowly,
uh,

687
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:38.310
because I myself feel that it is a bit dense and I don't want to confuse you.

688
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.460
And if I do,
you raise your hand in protest.

689
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.970
The proliferation of books,

690
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.620
it's accompanied by a decline in social,

691
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:55.770
in the social class of authors and have the author figures by which I mean

692
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:02.740
characters like he nest the Pasa Monday who represent authors within the

693
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:06.220
fixture.
Now take stock of this.
He has a persona is a criminal,

694
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.570
uh,
is a prisoner.
He's a galley slave.
However,

695
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:14.710
he has written a book.
This is novel.

696
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.270
I mean that someone of his social class couldn't be lower,
is writing a book.

697
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.710
So justice,

698
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:25.210
the production of many copies of a single book brings down the fetish value of

699
00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:28.830
each single copy as happens with anything.
If you have too many or something,

700
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.270
the value declines.
If you have very few,
the value increases.

701
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.090
I have a $2 bill in my,

702
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.070
with my wallet somebody gave me and I've kept it because they say it's good
luck,

703
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:43.120
but also because a few of us,
so this is the fetish value of things,

704
00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.250
uh,
that are few.
This we've learned in economic classes,

705
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.390
uh,
since we were going to high school.

706
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.330
So,
uh,

707
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:59.830
but the opposite is true of the authors and author figures relevance,

708
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.740
which increases the value of each copy of his book,

709
00:49:02.741 --> 00:49:07.741
decreases the authors now become the guarantee of the work's worth as well as

710
00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:13.150
the one accountable for it.
Before the law.

711
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.050
In the case of the Commedia,

712
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:21.090
the Spanish place where proliferation was rampant to be,

713
00:49:21.671 --> 00:49:26.380
they Lopi by Lopi became a sign of excellence,
like,

714
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:31.090
like a trademark applicable as an indication of value.

715
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.980
Uh,
two things other than place you can say this thing is the Lopez and it meant

716
00:49:35.981 --> 00:49:40.210
that it was very good
in the pickers.

717
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:46.170
Author and protagonists are conflated into one book and author became become one

718
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:47.850
as in the case of Hennis,

719
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.320
who's Reductio ad absurdum of this textual strategy has been noted many times.

720
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.480
The one that we just seen.
Um,

721
00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:02.990
and rudimentary equation could perhaps we worked out these new authors break

722
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:04.450
with the strictures of renaissance.

723
00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:09.451
We Macy's the idea of imitating the classics in the sense that they innovate

724
00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:16.270
leaving behind classical forms and themes or subjecting them to substantial

725
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:19.930
transformations.
Okay.
There are no longer like the classics.

726
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.940
They are subjecting them to transformations.

727
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:27.210
Hence the dissent in social status of the author appears to be accompanied by an

728
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:32.830
increase in inventiveness and rice in the importance of the author.

729
00:50:32.831 --> 00:50:35.150
Is that clear?
It should be clear.
No,

730
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.120
they higher the social class,

731
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.680
the less the invention because they follow me.
Masons,

732
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:46.410
they imitate the classics.
Um,

733
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.590
the Lord the author Social Class,
the greater the invention,

734
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.690
hence more value attached to the author,
uh,
which leads to the following,

735
00:50:56.691 --> 00:50:57.650
the more invention,

736
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.680
the more value given to the author he to pass a month who prides himself on

737
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.940
written this book about himself.

738
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:10.430
This explains why I said [inaudible] did before.

739
00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:16.540
This is the place why,
as Allie Mang did before with his Guzman,

740
00:51:16.541 --> 00:51:20.860
the Al Farace,
uh,
Cervantes rushes through,
right?

741
00:51:20.861 --> 00:51:21.651
His second park.

742
00:51:21.651 --> 00:51:24.740
Once he learns that [inaudible] has written a second part of the hope that he

743
00:51:24.741 --> 00:51:28.280
feels that they can hold the,
is his invention,

744
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:33.350
his and that,
that in,
in,
in every sense,
including the,

745
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:38.320
the monetary sense that he's going to lose,
uh,

746
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:43.070
revenues if somebody else writes,
uh,
uh,
if the whole thing.

747
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:44.503
So,

748
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.740
so it seems that the impact of the social economic developments on books and

749
00:51:48.741 --> 00:51:53.510
authors is undeniable,
but that is another important,

750
00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:57.680
important factor at work that issues from the content of the book themselves and

751
00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:01.130
its relation to knowledge.
I think.
I hope that you have made that clear.
No,

752
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.920
this is,
uh,

753
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.920
this is clear and [inaudible] exemplifies the lowering of social class.

754
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:12.680
Cervantes himself was not,
it was a very petty,
noble man,
poor and so forth.

755
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:13.990
So,
uh,

756
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:19.070
so [inaudible] important because he exemplifies that drop in social class of the

757
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:20.490
author.
Now I'm,

758
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.540
Tony Grafton opens the introduction to his magnificent new world's ancient

759
00:52:25.761 --> 00:52:30.260
texts,
the power of tradition and the shock of discovery with these words.

760
00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.930
Grafton is a professor at Princeton University.

761
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:37.330
The book is called New World's ancient texts,
the power of traditional.

762
00:52:37.331 --> 00:52:40.640
And the shock of discovery and according to the following,

763
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:45.100
it's very important quote.
I want you to follow it closely.
Between 1550

764
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.820
and 1650 campuses,
just the time that wanted

765
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:57.010
Western thinkers ceased to believe that they could find all important truths in

766
00:52:57.201 --> 00:52:58.160
ancient books,

767
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:03.080
so whereas the early renaissance thought that all important truths could be in

768
00:53:03.081 --> 00:53:07.530
book.
Now this has decreased
grasp.

769
00:53:07.531 --> 00:53:10.510
Don goes onto court,
Jesuit wholesale.
They are Costa.

770
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:16.990
Very common name in Spanish.
We'll say the course

771
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.130
who wrote in his,

772
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.310
this is a book about the history of the new world goalie story and how to rally

773
00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:30.330
morale.
De Las Indias.
This is Acosta,
quoted by Grafton.

774
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:34.050
Having read that,
what poets and philosophers,

775
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.390
right of the torrid zone.

776
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:41.340
I persuaded myself that when I came to the equator,

777
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:42.750
he was traveling to the new world.

778
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:46.200
I would not be able to endure the violent heat,

779
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.130
but it turned out otherwise for when I pass the equator,

780
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:54.600
I felt so cold that I was forced to go into the sun to warm myself.

781
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:59.490
What could I do then,
but laugh at Aristotle's meteorology.
Oh,
quote.

782
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.361
Ironically.

783
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:07.230
Then the proliferation of books begins at the time with the authority of the

784
00:54:07.231 --> 00:54:10.680
book was most severely tested and ultimately devalued.

785
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:16.350
The ability to read many books did not bring one closer to the truth would do an

786
00:54:16.351 --> 00:54:20.850
inordinate,
perhaps infinite enlargement of the library.
I'm [inaudible].

787
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:25.560
This is madness or to the Carter's your pants,
don't you?
Sweet.

788
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.910
I think therefore I am.

789
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:32.130
I only know that I am because I think in this way he discards the whole of the

790
00:54:32.131 --> 00:54:34.110
philosophical tradition in books before it.

791
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:38.880
These two leads in the direction of an increase in the importance of the officer

792
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:43.530
just as the classical tradition has been refashioned or denied altogether,

793
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.700
so it's received knowledge from the canonical books being questioned.

794
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:52.020
The function of books changes not only because the printing press makes them

795
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.910
available in larger quantities,

796
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:58.740
but also because they are no longer seen as reliable purveyors of truth.

797
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.810
Experience becomes a very important element in thinking in philosophy

798
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:05.460
literature,
not books.

799
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.140
Eve Acosta in the 1590s can laugh at Aristotle.

800
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.370
Why not pick up there the picaresque novel and have a good laugh or at you

801
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:19.140
Valerie Romance and be entertained or aroused instead or the key hot there and

802
00:55:19.141 --> 00:55:19.974
have a good time.

803
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:25.110
Reading books is not equated as before with the acquisition of knowledge but

804
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:26.820
increasingly with pleasure.

805
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.200
And the value of each book is dependent on an author whose ability to produce

806
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.730
such pleasure is known.

807
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.360
The scrutiny of the library and RTC Laura's dream clearly show some of the

808
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:41.000
quandaries,
uh,

809
00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:46.060
that this new situation opens up or does your daughter's dream is this marvelous

810
00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:47.850
episode in part two.

811
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:53.120
When a character you will meet her MLTC Dota has a dream and when she sees some

812
00:55:53.221 --> 00:55:58.221
devil's playing tennis and the balls are books on the racquets are flaming

813
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:04.860
rackets and when they hit the books,
the book,
uh,

814
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:07.320
explode and be our polarized.

815
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:13.110
So maneuvers and dream about what I'm telling you about and you will get to it.

816
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.040
Of course,

817
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:19.030
the book that is pulverized most easily [inaudible] your apocryphal Quixote.

818
00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.590
I said this,
uh,

819
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.400
takes advantage of this episode to poke fun at his,
at his,
uh,

820
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.320
at his rival.
So

821
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.070
this is why,
uh,

822
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.240
he missed that by Samantha is so important.

823
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:41.050
He Nest [inaudible] who is now,
who now appears,

824
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.700
and I won't have to have the quote here,

825
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:45.550
but I'm sure you remember how he is shackled.

826
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:49.030
He is covered with chains from head to foot.

827
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:54.040
He cannot move his head down to reach his hands,
not have his rants rich,

828
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:58.330
his mouth it,
it's as if you were percepts of some demonic power.

829
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:03.210
Slipperiness uh,
here I said,
Rhonda,

830
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:07.060
this is anticipating kind of a romantic notion of the author as a,
as a,

831
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:09.730
as a demonic figure.
Uh,

832
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:13.840
but the most interesting thing is that he needs the Pasa.

833
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:18.850
Monta is also a self portrait of [inaudible] because at one point,

834
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:24.730
uh,
he nets describes himself as being very unfortunate.

835
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:29.330
Uh,
and the line is obviously a itself,
uh,

836
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.680
elusive line on the part of Cervantes.
He,
uh,

837
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:37.740
he Nessa [inaudible] is a figure of Cervantes in the book lower class and also

838
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:45.661
this inventiveness that has to be contained by all of these chains that hold

839
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:48.370
him,
uh,
that holding a dom

840
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.191
in part two.

841
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:55.570
He will reappear and I can anticipate having a lot of fun with nest when he

842
00:57:55.571 --> 00:58:00.430
appears in part two.
And he is a master puppeteer.
He has a puppet theater.

843
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:04.240
And I will not ruin the plot by telling you what happens then.

844
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:08.800
But it's hilarious and it dovetails what I have,
uh,
uh,
uh,

845
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.640
been telling you about,
uh,
here now.

846
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:19.120
So this slippery slipperiness in the part of this,
uh,
author figure,
uh,

847
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:24.000
is,
is connected to all of these games of authorship.
You know,
the slippers,

848
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.140
the slipperiness of CDMA,
[inaudible],
Haley,

849
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.350
the slippery does have the translator,
uh,
who,
uh,

850
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:34.340
who has the text translated and all of that.
They're all,
they're all uh,

851
00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:39.190
contained within this figure of [inaudible].
This pick a room is bigger,

852
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:45.210
but there's one more aspect of he nester I want to discuss and that is

853
00:58:45.851 --> 00:58:49.560
containing an essay that you have in the case book,
uh,

854
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:54.400
about Hennis being crossed height.
And uh,

855
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:58.450
I am going to simply summarize it because we're coming to the end of the hour

856
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.660
and a direct you to that essay of mine if you want,
uh,

857
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:07.930
the details.
Do you remember that when he ness is introduced it,

858
00:59:07.931 --> 00:59:12.910
it says behind all these came amount of some 30 years of age of a goodly aspect,

859
00:59:12.911 --> 00:59:15.370
a sub,
he seemed to thrust one I into the other.

860
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.200
What it means is that he knows is crossed eyed Matea walking a lot or we still

861
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:23.090
say in Spanish.

862
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:27.740
Now vision of course is tied to representation.
You represent what you see.

863
00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:33.460
And He Naz being an author figure who is cross eyed is very suggestive.

864
00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:35.453
<v 1>Uh,</v>

865
00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:41.220
<v 0>first of all because being cross-eyed gifts,</v>

866
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:46.380
he miss a shifty look when,
uh,
when you say,

867
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:49.920
but you look at somebody in the eye to see if they're being sincere.

868
00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.890
If there's something in the eyes,
it doesn't have to be gross.

869
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.000
I'll be in cross side.
Then the person doesn't appear,
Cynthia,
you know,

870
00:59:57.001 --> 01:00:02.001
so I saw being cross eyed gifts Ynez a shifty appearance going to with a

871
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:07.500
slipperiness.
Also his generals like that.

872
01:00:07.501 --> 01:00:09.960
If you look at it from one side,
you'll see one eye this way.

873
01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.180
If you look at it from the other side,
the other way he's going,
yeah,

874
01:00:12.181 --> 01:00:14.580
he's going the other way.
So He's two things at the same time,

875
01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:19.230
whether you look at him from one side or the other.
So there is no oh center,

876
01:00:19.231 --> 01:00:24.020
no stable figure of [inaudible] because he is girls.
Alright.

877
01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.970
He is uh,

878
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:33.020
he has a monocular cross eyedness that is one eye is the one that goes into the

879
01:00:33.331 --> 01:00:34.200
other.
Uh,

880
01:00:34.201 --> 01:00:39.201
so therefore if you have a two lines of sight that normally meet here in this

881
01:00:40.441 --> 01:00:45.330
object and that object is represented to your mind,
oh well,
if you're cross eyed,

882
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.330
they meet here and therefore the object is distorted.

883
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.360
This is what monocular across eyedness,
uh,
uh,
uh,

884
01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:57.210
means also it leads,

885
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:01.340
it leads to uh,
uh,

886
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.060
a double vision that what is called diplopia.
Sorry for this.

887
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

888
01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.630
<v 0>So he missed softwares from this cross,</v>

889
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.290
cross eyedness diplopia or double vision.

890
01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:22.240
He sees two things at the same time and he is,
uh,
uh,
uh,

891
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:25.030
uh,
this figure of the author,

892
01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:30.031
the figure of the author who like the Cervantes or the first prologue who has to

893
01:01:30.701 --> 01:01:35.280
divide himself in two persons,
uh,
is to within his own vision.

894
01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:39.490
Because you know,
this is double.
What I'm trying to say is this,

895
01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.320
you will see that one of the topics in the Quixote criticism is perspective,

896
01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:51.451
is that reality is a scene from various perspectives,

897
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.400
the perspective of each one of the characters and that supposedly reality in the

898
01:01:57.401 --> 01:02:00.550
end of some of these hilarious his coaches at the end is the sum total of all of

899
01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:01.384
these perspectives.

900
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:06.870
What I'm trying to say is that there is no such thing that within each

901
01:02:07.751 --> 01:02:11.380
individual there is already perspective as in because there is more than one

902
01:02:11.381 --> 01:02:14.650
view of things.
I want to emphasize this.

903
01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:18.760
He makes cs two things.
He's not,
you're simply one perspective.

904
01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.720
His is him within him,

905
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:25.830
not just from all the others perspectives.

906
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:29.040
This complicates the issue a lot more,

907
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:34.460
but particularly when you take into account that he is presented as an author

908
01:02:36.571 --> 01:02:41.400
figure,
as a storyteller in the chaotic,
uh,
storytellers in that he hoped,

909
01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:43.320
they tend not to be very healthy,

910
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:48.830
you then physically or mentally and he ness is important,

911
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:54.480
uh,
because of,
uh,
of that.
So we're going to leave it at that.
And the next,

912
01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.980
uh,
in the next class,
we're going to talk,

913
01:02:55.981 --> 01:03:00.390
I know about another one of these galley slaves in passing,

914
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.380
the one that I have called in my book love and the law,

915
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.540
the prisoner of sex.
And this is the,
the,
the minor character.

916
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:12.090
This is a really minor,
minor character.
One paragraph.

917
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:15.750
If you go back to this episode of the Galley Slaves in 22,

918
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.740
the guy who is carrying on with war for women at the same time to have homework,

919
01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.720
cousins of his.

920
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:26.550
So we are going to be talking about about that and other matters that are in

921
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:29.430
your,
in your syllabus.
But,
uh,

922
01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:32.490
but I'll begin by talking about the person or have sex.
