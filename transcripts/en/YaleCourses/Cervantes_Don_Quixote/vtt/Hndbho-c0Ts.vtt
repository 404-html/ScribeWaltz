WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.300
I,
um,
I learned that over the weekend,
uh,

2
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:08.670
of the death of club Levy Strauss,

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.500
I don't know if you read it in the paper or if you know who caught Levy Strauss

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.560
was GLAAD Levy Strauss who was 101 years old and he died,

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.130
was a great French anthropologist.
Uh,

6
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.540
the founder of the school of structuralism,

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
although he would never admit to do that,
uh,
uh,

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.370
truly a remarkable intellectual figure of the 20th century,

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.720
uh,
who travels through the jungles of Brazil and,
uh,

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.190
wrote a number of very important,
uh,

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.570
anthropological books and one a and memoir called Crisco Pika.

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.930
Uh,
54 55,
a,

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.370
which is a truly a beautiful,
beautiful book.

14
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.050
And I was very moved,
uh,
reading the obituary,

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.580
uh,

16
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.140
in that he said at one point that he had learned,

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070
uh,
to pursue,
uh,

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.190
the truth doggedly and also,
uh,

19
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.490
had the idea of reviving something from the past while reading Don Quixote as a

20
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:25.090
child in a children's,
a addition obviously translated,
uh,

21
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.700
into,
uh,
into French.
So,
uh,
I thought that I would mention that,

22
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.810
uh,
beginning of the class and also,
uh,

23
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.730
as an homage to a,
to a real,
a really great,
uh,
uh,
uh,

24
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.200
figure of,
uh,
of our day.
Um,

25
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.750
I have been insisting in my last a few lectures on how said Advantis we rights

26
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.440
episodes from part one in part two.

27
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.460
And I want to begin today with some general statements,

28
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.530
statements on this theme and a few other general statements as we approach the

29
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:07.290
end of the novel.
Uh,

30
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.410
first I want to make clear that not all episodes in part two are modeled after

31
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:15.240
others.
In part one,

32
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.880
there is no antecedent really for the cave of Montesinos adventure and a,

33
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.950
which is the highlight of part two and perhaps of the whole book,

34
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.350
nor is there really an antecedent for the clubby lane,
your flight.

35
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.980
Uh,

36
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.810
so there are a number of important episodes in part two that are,

37
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.740
uh,
not model on every salts from part one.

38
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.220
You will get to see a sigh announced,
uh,

39
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.300
episodes in to that repeat or rewrite episodes.

40
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:52.470
We thin part to itself,
which is very interesting.

41
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.751
Second,

42
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:59.751
I want to emphasize that they rewritings and expansions the rewritings are

43
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.960
expansions of those,
uh,
episodes in part one.

44
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.410
They are like blow ups.
Uh,

45
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.150
one could say of episodes in part one,

46
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.420
they tend to have more characters and the actions are outrageous in comparison

47
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.060
to their predecessors.
For instance,

48
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:24.061
there is something of the fight with the Basque in donkey holders encounter with

49
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:29.740
Samsung Carrasco this guys as denied of the mirrors.

50
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.470
But the second episode is richer,
uh,
in the first they're both mounted,

51
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.450
armed and don't.
Quixote wins.
Uh,
the same occurs in the second,

52
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:44.770
but now his opponent is playing the role of uh,
at night.

53
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.430
He's outfit reflects a donkey hotel literally and metaphorically.

54
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.090
And the whole set up is carefully prepared to resemble a contest between two

55
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:04.030
nights,
uh,
done.
None of these,

56
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.720
uh,
is,
is present in the,
in the earlier episode.

57
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.680
This expansion or enlargement is consonant,

58
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.620
is consonant with the increasingly baroque aesthetics of part two.

59
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And each instance of a rewriting is like one more proof of it.

60
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.690
Uh,
one more proof of this,
of this baroque,
uh,
aesthetics.

61
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.480
Cervantes has not remained the same.

62
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.960
In the 10 years that have elapsed between parts one and two,

63
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.840
and the old Cervantes,
Eh,

64
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.090
is his own measure of development as it were.

65
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.930
I don't know if I make myself clear.

66
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:51.931
That is the set of aunties of part one is the measure for his new sense of

67
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.123
development

68
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.620
in the episodes that I will be discussing today and in subsequent lectures,

69
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:02.800
this process of expansion is itself expanded,

70
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.140
reaching the limits of representation,
uh,

71
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.740
which is again also a characteristic of the uh,
uh,
rook.

72
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.020
I also want to insist on something that I have only hinted at in previous

73
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:25.051
lectures and that you may have noticed on your own the increasing presence of

74
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.600
Virgil and he's an EAD.

75
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.300
As we move towards the end of the second part of the hotel.

76
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.970
Uh,
I will be more specific on about this one.

77
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.390
We get to the meet LTC Dora,
give my hello.

78
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.200
I've already met if you have read far enough into the book who is a parody or

79
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.690
model after died off.

80
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.540
But I just want to mention that because the Virgilian background may suggest

81
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:59.300
something important about how servant this conceived Don Quixote.

82
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.430
In his second part,

83
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.980
nes is known for his Bruton's for his sense of duty from the very beginning when

84
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.600
he carries in a crisis on his back as they leave a burning Troy.

85
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.410
I'm when he repeatedly fence of temptations died be the most memorable so that

86
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:25.700
he can fulfill his destiny,

87
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.560
which it will be nothing less than the founding of Rome.

88
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.160
And ies has,
uh,

89
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.590
the greatest excuse for leaving a woman in the whole of Western literature.

90
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.050
I've got to go found wrong.

91
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.603
Um,

92
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.760
Don Quixote cannot aspire to search a grand design,

93
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.240
but said Advantis has given him a different,

94
00:06:56.241 --> 00:07:01.241
no less serious one and one that is a consonant with the age in which he lives,

95
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.870
which is no longer the heroic age of Virgil's characters.

96
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.950
And that design is to conquer himself.

97
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.000
This is going to be Doki this task,

98
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.290
the evolution of the Mac Don Quixote towards sanitary and self knowledge is the

99
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:31.421
modern equivalent of an ess pollutants and task of founding the great city.

100
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.391
This,

101
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:40.391
it seems to me is the overall suggestion in this repeated illusions direct and

102
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:44.630
indirect to virtual.

103
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.300
Before of course,
I spoke of homer of it and Dante and,

104
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.470
and about how Vantis a field of illusions and sources had moved up from the

105
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:02.081
romances of chivalry to the core of the western tradition without abandoning,

106
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:05.120
of course,
the romances of children.

107
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.660
I also want to emphasize,
I've already mentioned it,
uh,

108
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.350
that these episodes are rewritings and in this major episodes in part two,

109
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.730
there is a strong presence of death.
One way or another.

110
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.430
Uh,
sometimes as in the pageant in the forest is a very figure of death,

111
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.790
uh,
as an allegorical,
a figure of death,
uh,
uh,

112
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.530
that you,
uh,
uh,
sure,
uh,
remember,

113
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.003
uh,

114
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.080
this is very much again and I will be emphasizing today in one of the episodes,

115
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.610
very much a part of the,
of the Baroque.

116
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.100
Before I,
uh,
I moved,
uh,
move on to some,

117
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.520
the truly outrageous episodes that I want to discuss today.

118
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.060
Let me say something about Sanchez letter to his wife and about the exchange of

119
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:08.880
letters that takes place in this section of the novel

120
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.490
said Avantis who anticipated so many things in the novel.

121
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:16.720
I think I've mentioned before,
they've Garcia Marquez,

122
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.340
the great Colombian writer said that everything that anomalies could possibly

123
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:24.870
want to do is already insolvent.
But Cervantes in these,

124
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.620
uh,

125
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.270
exchanges of letters is anticipating epistolary fiction.

126
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.000
Um,

127
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.180
the letters to the Ressa between Theresa and the counters and so forth.

128
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.070
Uh,
there are antecedents,
uh,
in Spanish,

129
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.780
uh,
for the,
uh,
for the purpose story fiction.

130
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:52.320
But here said,
run tests in a modern,
uh,

131
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:56.760
already modern novel is a anticipating that kind of fiction.

132
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.480
The epistolary novel he's wanting,

133
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:04.320
which the whole novel consists of an exchange of letters,

134
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.020
uh,
between the characters,
uh,
as a genre.

135
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.360
It became very popular in the 18th century,
as I'm sure you know,

136
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.020
in the works of authors such as Samuel Richardson with his immensely successful

137
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:22.801
novels.

138
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:27.801
Pamela 1740 and Clarissa 1749 in France,

139
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.820
there was the late [inaudible] Santa by Montis cure for,

140
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.750
by Julie Hula Nouvelle a Luis by June.

141
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:40.740
Jack who saw and lack clo a novel that I'm sure,

142
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.310
uh,
you have ready,
if not seen the movie Lillia Zone,

143
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.290
don't universe,
uh,
uh,
in Germany,

144
00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:53.670
good to the sorrows of young Werther and links Hyperion.
So I mean,

145
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.250
uh,
what said Ron,
this is anticipating here,

146
00:10:56.251 --> 00:11:00.900
it was a very popular Jonathan in the next,
uh,
century.
Um,

147
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.390
this exchange of letters in the cohort.

148
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.410
They also reflect a society in which writing has become a crucial component of

149
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:17.370
life
and,
uh,
uh,

150
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.400
communications,
uh,
of life and communications,

151
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:24.930
writing and printed documents,
a rival,

152
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.750
uh,
oral exchanges.

153
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.270
If you have been reading your earlier,

154
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.090
you will have learned that this is a society obsessed,
uh,

155
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.750
with documents,
mostly legal documents,
uh,
uh,

156
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.140
which is a class two,
which some of the letters belong.

157
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.070
Letter writing is part of the generation of,
of the,
uh,

158
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.320
production of,
of legal documents.
Uh,

159
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.230
so this is a reflection of that too.
Uh,

160
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.500
it is also here in the novel.

161
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:04.501
It is also writing within writing and the epistles are documents not processed

162
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:09.670
into the fiction,
but presented a raw,

163
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.690
I said where many it is.
It doesn't say that Sr,
uh,

164
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.300
Sandra road would that SSA and this and that and the other?
No,

165
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.700
the document presumably as was dictated by Sandra,
of course,

166
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:26.620
he doesn't know how to write a appears in the novel,
uh,

167
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.600
modern modern fiction.
We'll expand on this device.

168
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.130
I'm thinking here of Joyce,

169
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:37.330
of the fossils of corn tasa and other writers,

170
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.280
uh,
whose books are contained documents.
So just these letters,

171
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:47.290
uh,
own absorbed into the pros of a,
of the fiction

172
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.793
<v 1>now</v>

173
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.690
<v 0>Sanchez letter.
If we want to also,
uh,</v>

174
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.360
look for the antecedent in park one,
Eh,

175
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.620
is an echo of the one don Quixote wrote to Lucy [inaudible] and essential of

176
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:07.050
course for God to take with him and then a memorized.

177
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:11.520
And we have all those funny episodes in which he tries to,

178
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.970
to,
to retell it,
uh,

179
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.340
as in the first instance that his ass in that episode or those episodes,

180
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.240
uh,
the humorous,
uh,
what is humorous here,
he said,

181
00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:26.970
both sanctuary and his wife presumably are illiterate.

182
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.700
So this is an exchange of letters between,
uh,

183
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.860
characters who don't know how to read and write the whole issue of the

184
00:13:38.221 --> 00:13:42.100
production of the letter of the Dutches overseeing it and all of that,
uh,

185
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.580
is part of the of the humor here.
I us,
uh,

186
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.700
the production of the letter for dosing there was also part of the,
of the humor,

187
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.890
uh,
in,
uh,
in that episode.

188
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.690
So now we do move to these outrageous episodes that I went to,
uh,

189
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.060
discuss today and uh,
I'm sure when I mentioned what they are,
you will,

190
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.880
you will see why I used that adjective.

191
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:07.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.680
<v 0>The first is the episode involving the afflicted matron,</v>

193
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:17.190
known as counters three fall D and a three file dean of the white beard,

194
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.110
her squire.

195
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:27.090
This is one of the wildest inventions of the Duke Stewart and one of the

196
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:32.650
strangers in their whole Quixote with no possible antecedents.

197
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.690
In part one,
that steward is described as follows.

198
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.530
In page seven or five of your translation by Jarvis is this,

199
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:47.740
the Duke had a steward of a very pleasant and facetious,

200
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.770
which who represented Marilyn and contrive the whole apparatus of the late

201
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:58.250
adventure,
compose the verses and made the page act.

202
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.930
Do see now,
I'm now with the Duke and Duchess.
His leave,

203
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.790
he prepared another scene,

204
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.750
one of the pleasantest and strangers contrivance imaginable.

205
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.690
<v 1>I don't quote,
uh,</v>

206
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.830
<v 0>their stories and other internal author Luxon Song Carrasco and Master Peter</v>

207
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.570
that sandstone care Roscoe,

208
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.880
he's one who scripts adventures for Don Quixote though.

209
00:15:24.881 --> 00:15:26.900
Something that master Peter doesn't do what must say.

210
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.060
Peter is one of the authors within the Quixote.

211
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.200
So the steward not only organizes the whole pageant but also writes the verses

212
00:15:36.491 --> 00:15:38.710
as we,
as the quote says,
and,

213
00:15:38.711 --> 00:15:41.690
and plays the role of Merlin and then have to refile.
Ding.

214
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.920
He is as versatile as he knows the person won't and even more,

215
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.800
<v 1>uh,
he's a port</v>

216
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.110
<v 0>now.
Internal authors like him and Samsung Carrasco,
uh,</v>

217
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.910
in the second part get to put into action their creations as we have a,

218
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.360
as I have mentioned before,
and as you had seen the,
uh,

219
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:06.000
the results are not exactly what the plant,

220
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.310
but they do get to put them into watch.

221
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:10.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

222
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.720
<v 0>The staging of,
uh,</v>

223
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.960
his arrival as three file dean is theatrical and Baroque in the extreme.

224
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:20.821
Again,

225
00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:25.821
the intention is to astonish both with the elaborateness of the props and with

226
00:16:26.791 --> 00:16:31.020
their fearful appearance and sounds or noises.

227
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.480
So the astonish with the,
with the,
uh,

228
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.320
the act of creation.
I mean,
uh,
uh,
the creator,

229
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:45.280
creator of this Baroque,
uh,
uh,
uh,
pranks,

230
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.300
uh,
is boasting of his own,
uh,

231
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.820
ability and also as tarnished because of the very nature,

232
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.280
size and noise.

233
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:01.610
If we go to page seven or eight,
seven or nine,
uh,

234
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.210
I will read the arrival of this character.

235
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.000
And while there were those in suspense,

236
00:17:09.001 --> 00:17:13.860
they perceive two men entered the garden clad in morning robes so long and

237
00:17:13.861 --> 00:17:16.140
extended that they trail up on the ground.

238
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.890
They came beating two great drums covered also with black by their side came a

239
00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:27.180
five,
the five black and frightful lag.
The rest,

240
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.730
these three were followed by a percentage of gigantic stature,

241
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.280
not clad but mantled about with a robe of the blackest,

242
00:17:38.281 --> 00:17:40.950
the die,
the train.

243
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:45.350
They're off was of monsters length this row.

244
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:50.351
But what's good about with a broad black belt or the wish they're hung and the

245
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:54.720
measurable Symitar in a black Scabbard,

246
00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.450
his face was covered with the transparent black veil through which appear the

247
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:03.870
prodigious long beard us why he does snow.

248
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.790
He marched through the sound of draw of the row of drums with much gravity and

249
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:12.360
composure.
In short,
his huge book,

250
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.260
he stateliness his blackness and his attendance,

251
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:21.261
my very well saw price as they did all who'll be held him and we're not in the

252
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:23.100
secret.

253
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.020
Those he came with the state and appearance or force said a kneel down before

254
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:31.080
the Duke who with the rest received him standing.

255
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.210
But the Duke would in no wise software him to speak till he rose up.

256
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:41.190
The monstrous Spector did.
So.
And as soon as he was up on his feet,

257
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:45.150
he lifted up his veil and exposed to view the Horace list,

258
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.560
the longest,

259
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:52.010
whitest and best furnished beer that human eyes do then had ever be held on

260
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:56.520
straight.
He sent forth his broad an ample breasts.

261
00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.410
The Var is grave on Sun rose and fixing his eyes on the Duke.

262
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.320
He said,
oh,
of course.

263
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.810
Notice the preponderance of black.

264
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.930
And notice that as in the pageant in the forest,
uh,
these,

265
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.250
there are many superlatives.
Everything is the largest,
the whitest demos,

266
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.790
horrible.
And the intention is to,
to cause,
uh,

267
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.970
admiration and fear on the spectators.

268
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.960
Santo dives into the duchesses skirts.

269
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.910
The moment he sees this apparition.
I see he does whenever he's afraid.

270
00:19:34.911 --> 00:19:38.780
And he said the Duke and Duchess,
his house,
he did.
He think that in her arms,

271
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.730
in the pageant,
in the forest.

272
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.130
I notice also the figure of the monster.

273
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.690
I have spoken about the figure of the monster before we,

274
00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:51.650
we chose done only

275
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.510
made up of the most outrageous features,

276
00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.760
both of contrasting one like the black dress and the white beard.

277
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.320
The monster is a baroque figure.
It does not have to be ugly.

278
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:12.160
Just composed of clashing features in Calderon de la Barca,

279
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.830
the playwright that I have mentioned several times,
uh,

280
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.393
<v 2>okay.</v>

281
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.170
<v 0>In colonial America.</v>

282
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.693
<v 2>Okay.</v>

283
00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.250
<v 0>They're beautiful monsters,</v>

284
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.850
namely beautiful women dressed as men.

285
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.020
So don't confuse and figure of the monster with the romantic,

286
00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:43.260
a Frankenstein who is a ugly,

287
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:46.860
repulsive,
uh,
and,
uh,

288
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.800
sort of a dearth death warmed over type.

289
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:55.590
But this is not the case with this baroque monsters.
Um,

290
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.760
the,
the important thing in the monster is the clash of opposites.

291
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.990
The clashes between the two genders.
In the case of the Caledonian figures,

292
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.520
uh,

293
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.520
we sold that clash in the figure of the do now a of the pageant in the forest

294
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.210
such figures out the opposite of renaissance harmony,

295
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:21.510
but they are however announced in the figure of Dorothea in part one.

296
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.890
Uh,
and as in the Cave of Montesinos,
uh,

297
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.770
the pageant in the forest,

298
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.160
we have a procession that parade of freaks and the sound of drums,

299
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.940
which mark the pace of the whole ensemble,
uh,

300
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:47.470
in this theatrical shows,
the characters don't work.
They march.

301
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.030
Remember in the,
in the cave in Montesinos how all of these,
uh,

302
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.440
uh,
he re kind of women are marching in the procession.

303
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.360
And of course in the pattern and the forest,
we have a huge,
uh,
procession parade.

304
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.860
Uh,
so there's no,

305
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.090
no natural motions such as walking.

306
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.390
It is marching to,
uh,
to the,

307
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.710
to the beat of the drums and the sounds of the various instruments.

308
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.113
<v 2>Now,</v>

309
00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.530
<v 0>the most remarkable thing here of course,
uh,</v>

310
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.900
is the punishment within all of his fiction,
uh,

311
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.240
that the Duenas have suffered.
Uh,

312
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.250
the predicament of the millennials is again,

313
00:22:34.251 --> 00:22:38.420
a question of cross dressing or of Cross gendering.

314
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.513
Uh,

315
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
there mark afflictions seems to be an excess of testosterone that provokes a

316
00:22:46.681 --> 00:22:48.770
wild growth of facial hair.

317
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.070
Remember that they suddenly within this fiction,
uh,

318
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.120
how these beards,
it is described in my new detail how the,

319
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.840
the hairs I supposed to come out of the pores and

320
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:03.803
<v 2>mmm,</v>

321
00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.040
<v 0>this is wild.
This,
the third one,
they said his wildest,
you know,</v>

322
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:16.030
this is a hilarious condition and part of the mockery of ladies in waiting in

323
00:23:16.221 --> 00:23:17.570
the whole episode,

324
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:23.230
Sanchez diatribe against them perhaps reflects an attitude of the,

325
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.560
uh,

326
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.560
of the Times doing Rodriguez from whom we will hear more later mounts a spirited

327
00:23:31.131 --> 00:23:35.690
defense.
I'm using both Dwayne and Dwayne.
Yeah.
Uh,
and the Spanish is a

328
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.340
<v 2>okay.
And,
uh,</v>

329
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:49.330
<v 0>what is using your translation
is the English version Glenn.</v>

330
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

331
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.750
<v 0>Good old [inaudible].
The Covarrubias remember him,</v>

332
00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:00.700
the great lexicographer who published in 1611 that Tesoro,

333
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.250
the [inaudible] and that I,
uh,

334
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.180
warn you I would mention several times during the semester,

335
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:12.000
says the following in my own translation.
Defining the dual.
Yeah.

336
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.550
And going through all this,

337
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:18.551
because I know that this is a very strange figure for someone in the 21st

338
00:24:18.621 --> 00:24:21.800
century.
Uh,
he says in old [inaudible],

339
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:24.890
the old Castilian languages is good.
Also was done.

340
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.220
It meant an old widowed lady.

341
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.120
Now it generally means those who serve wearing long nonissue gowns to

342
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:39.940
distinguish them from verges and in the palaces honor.
Yes.

343
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.360
Our principal ladies who are widowed and the queens and princesses keep them

344
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.860
near,
uh,
unquote.
Meanwhile,

345
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:54.130
Webster defines lady in waiting as a lady of rank who is a member of the royal

346
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:58.070
household and in attendance,
uh,

347
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:02.390
of a queen or Princess,
I suppose this is me now,

348
00:25:02.391 --> 00:25:07.391
I suppose there is a sexual connotation to this category of women because they

349
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:11.720
are unattached,
attached where presumably available.
They're not young,

350
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:16.670
married and Virginia.
Why so many widows?
I mean the death

351
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.810
people died at a younger age in the 16th and 17th centuries.

352
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.670
So as he's,
men normally live a shorter life than women.

353
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.420
Even today.
Uh,

354
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.630
there are bound to be a lot of widows around.
And what do you do?

355
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.810
What do you do with his widows?
Uh,

356
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.820
where do they go through society?
Uh,
I guess some might go to a,

357
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.440
the nunnery God got d two,
the nunnery to remember Shakespeare.

358
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.880
Uh,
but others are there in the palaces.
Uh,

359
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.070
the are of rank.
They're a bit,

360
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.060
a bit like the second don't is that the female counterpart of the [inaudible]

361
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.890
donuts,
but they cannot quite go out and,
and,
and,
and start a career,

362
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.610
uh,
out at sea or the church or low.
So

363
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.800
they,
uh,
they are,

364
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.810
they are involved in,

365
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.850
in providing or facilitating sexual encounters.
There go betweens.

366
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:25.870
They tend to be go betweens as happens in the story concocted by the Stewart.

367
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:29.740
<v 1>Uh,</v>

368
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.620
<v 0>I think that,
uh,
this is the reason these sexual,</v>

369
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.160
a sideline of these widows,

370
00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:42.450
they all kinds of jokes about widows and sexuality and all of that in throughout

371
00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:45.450
all traditions.
Um,

372
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.170
and this is why they are given ingest a strong masculine trait,

373
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.360
a beard,
the opposite of the role they're supposed to play,
which is very,

374
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.650
very feminine in a sexual way.

375
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.970
So the last thing you would expect them to have a beard,

376
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.510
but also you remember from our,
my explanation of self esteem,
of duty,
nails,

377
00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:18.410
hair that,
uh,
you know,
it,
it meant also certain kinds of sexuality.

378
00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.450
Uh,
so hair in the case of the enchanted don't see now meant,

379
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:24.780
remember the,
the,

380
00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.580
the winch that had the mole on her face with some hair,

381
00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:32.630
that Gnocchi holder said she must have another one on her thigh with hair,

382
00:27:32.631 --> 00:27:36.800
it's et cetera.
It means sexual proclivity being sexually hot.

383
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

384
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:39.380
<v 0>Uh,</v>

385
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.380
these women are to be seen as sexually active but only in only in a sexual way.

386
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.021
That is,

387
00:27:45.021 --> 00:27:49.970
they are not to be loved and idealized there only to be seen as sexual.

388
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.710
And this is why the joke of having them grow hair.

389
00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:01.850
Uh,
no.
The story about the counties three fall faulty whom we encountered.

390
00:28:01.851 --> 00:28:03.440
Remember in spitzers article,

391
00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:08.250
remember the long discussion by Spitzer about the three file,
the DOR is filed,

392
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:12.260
does and all of that.
And how,
uh,
how these names,

393
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.120
uh,
are made by Cervantes.

394
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.950
The story about counters refiled is very much like that of Princess Mikami

395
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.710
corner.
Uh,
in part one,

396
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900
you remember that the total payout except that that it is madly exaggerated.

397
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.510
I mean,
there is a fantastic geography,

398
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.660
outrageously made up names.

399
00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.430
It is a Meta Meta fiction concocted by the characters of the main fiction.

400
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.130
But here in contrast to two part one,
uh,

401
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.160
the process is much more premeditated complicated and it's played out as a

402
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.830
senior theater,
not out on the road.

403
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.960
If you remember the priest and Dorothea make up the story of me,
call me Kona,

404
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:08.240
uh,
on the go.
Uh,
and that's where she makes mistakes.
Remember,

405
00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.320
uh,
the Stewart has taken his time to compose.

406
00:29:12.321 --> 00:29:16.820
This one is a whole story.
Very,
very well rotted.
Where

407
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.790
my room Sia and Archie PLR are the disease.
Uh,
uh,

408
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.240
parents my wounds.
Yeah.

409
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.153
<v 2>Okay.</v>

410
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.190
<v 0>Uh,
they are funny names.</v>

411
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:42.790
I mean the first is German town of mines.

412
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.213
<v 2>Okay.</v>

413
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.060
<v 0>It sounds very strange to Spanish er,</v>

414
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:53.410
my rooms yet with wounds to your mind's in Germany.
And uh,

415
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.970
the second refers to watch PLO go a series of islands.

416
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.010
Uh,
the,

417
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.120
these names are geographic in origin because the story has something of a joke,

418
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.010
something that the geographic fable come,
diarrhea is another.

419
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:15.070
[inaudible] is a made up a kingdom.

420
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.390
But all these names,
the funniest is antonymous.
Yeah.

421
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.873
The young woman,

422
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.520
because it is the name that takes the name of names,

423
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.940
then it is every,
it's a rhetorical figure.

424
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.940
It names [inaudible] the rhetorical figure that,
Eh,

425
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:53.220
Eh,
it's a rhetorical figure to them that which is the queen testaments of

426
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.063
something.

427
00:30:55.210 --> 00:31:00.210
Hercules' for a strong man is an Pono Masiya Hitler for an evil man is an

428
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.760
antonymous.
Yeah.
Uh,

429
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.910
from the Greek who called by another name,

430
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.470
they use of an epithet or title instead of the proper name of a person.

431
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.790
As when I'm warding Webster,
when he's owner is used for George,

432
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.950
or when instead of Aristotle,
we say the philosopher,

433
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:28.180
the use of a proper name instead of a common noun as when an eminent aura is

434
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:30.070
called the monster.
Ernest on quote

435
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.210
is something like same par excellence,
the quintessence of something.

436
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.330
So Hawaii is,
he called [inaudible].
Uh,

437
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.100
she's given the name of a linguistic or rhetorical term because cheese is made

438
00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:49.240
up of words.

439
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.110
She's a fiction within the fiction made up by the store.

440
00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.190
So she stopped to have the name of a real person because she's made up of words.

441
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.720
This is what this is,
uh,
this name is,
is underlining also,

442
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.970
uh,
Geez,

443
00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:11.971
so named because she and her story are a quintessential architype pro common

444
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.090
place
walking past El Dorado,

445
00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:17.924
whom I have mentioned

446
00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.960
<v 2>before several times</v>

447
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.050
<v 0>cause I'll go to,
it was a very
prominent,</v>

448
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.640
his moon is in the 50 seat.
He,
um,

449
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.950
he was very impressed with German criticism and so he named all of his books

450
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:51.870
same Thedo you format day sense and meaning of Don Quixote.

451
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.870
Celestina Nola,
same Pladis seen form is derived from German criticism.

452
00:32:56.871 --> 00:33:00.260
But in spite of that,
it was a very good,
uh,
uh,

453
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.270
critic and I'm quoting,
uh,

454
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.530
from his book called [inaudible] of course.
Uh,

455
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.640
and he says,
uh,

456
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.880
Don Quixote in his purity launches fourth to disenchant to save the lovers and

457
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.240
the Duenas to make them recover their original form.

458
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.580
He fights for the whole of humanity,

459
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:27.090
which is why the story is filled with a sense of the real without alluding to

460
00:33:27.091 --> 00:33:30.170
any one in particular,
because all are involved.

461
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.870
The name of the Seduce Young Woman is,
I'm Tomasia.

462
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.470
What he means is that antonymous,
she has name suggested Gnocchi.

463
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:40.730
How the fights for all so deals and punished young ladies,

464
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.620
and this is the sense of of her name,
the Prato typical one,

465
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.500
but also since the issue here is one more time of marriage on equal marriage.

466
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.880
Freedom.
Social status,
I think said lump this,

467
00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:05.180
what's his name is perhaps poking fun at himself for repeating the same story on

468
00:34:06.661 --> 00:34:09.060
the various guises throughout the Chiota.
He's saying,
well,

469
00:34:09.061 --> 00:34:13.140
this one is [inaudible] is the prototypical of all the stories.
Dot.

470
00:34:13.141 --> 00:34:16.200
All Day I Marcel and so forth that I have been telling what I'm telling you

471
00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:20.340
again,
so I'm making fun of myself by giving her these very,
very funny name.

472
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.101
Hey,

473
00:34:23.101 --> 00:34:28.101
my also be casting a resigned on ironic a glance at human nature for always

474
00:34:30.421 --> 00:34:31.890
repeating itself.

475
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.000
Young women will always be seduced by chairman young men.

476
00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:37.770
I'm trouble Willand Zoo.

477
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:41.760
This is what a name like I'm Tomasia suggests too.

478
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.133
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

479
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.830
<v 0>The rhetorical name also reveals that he's proxy,
he's standing offer.</v>

480
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.640
The steward is a learned man.
It is us.

481
00:34:53.641 --> 00:34:55.620
If we called a literary character,

482
00:34:55.621 --> 00:34:59.670
I've been thinking of what other rhetorical name could we give a literary

483
00:34:59.671 --> 00:35:03.300
character?
Anaphora for instance,

484
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.200
Anaphora is the literary,
uh,
is,
is there is the,
uh,

485
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.510
is the,
uh,
the figure of speech,
uh,
uh,
uh,

486
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:18.020
by which a,
an aura repeats over and again,
something,
uh,

487
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:22.680
as in the case of,
uh,
of the assistant of master Peter's a system.

488
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.850
When he says,
look,
look,
look,
or when the preacher says,

489
00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:30.270
repent you sinners and says it over and over again,

490
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:34.110
that is an Africa.
Uh,

491
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.280
I don't know if you agree,
you can come up perhaps live in a better one.

492
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.820
Synesthesia,
you could call and they'd already character.

493
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:45.900
These are also very good names.
Did you have a pet to name?
Uh,

494
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.170
if you have a parent that repeats the same thing over and over,

495
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:53.310
you could call her anaphora many case.
Just a,

496
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.473
just a thought.

497
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.740
But it's very funny to have a character called Anaphora is supposed to be very

498
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:01.710
funny.
It's,
it's a,
it's sophisticated joke.

499
00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:05.940
I mean not everywhere and not everybody knows what [inaudible] means,

500
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:10.170
but uh,
but it is supposed to be a funny and it is.

501
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:13.943
<v 1>Now</v>

502
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.200
<v 0>if in part one we learned to look for the story behind the story.</v>

503
00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

504
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:29.030
<v 0>In part two we learned how a story is made and the way that this,</v>

505
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.670
uh,
steward appears and the way that the story is told and is,

506
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.570
uh,
uh,
presented unrepresented is a way of showing,
uh,

507
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.480
the inner workings of the story.

508
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.980
So this is one way that we can also contrast between the two parts.
In part one,

509
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.400
we're looking for the story behind the story of what [inaudible] said.

510
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:53.850
Here we are shown the stage props.

511
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:57.120
The machinery is the station machinery,
uh,

512
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.170
through which the story is being made.
Part of it is the name of his,

513
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:04.320
of this character.
Now,

514
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:09.470
so to sum up the story made up by the stored my rules and Archie PLR are the

515
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:14.811
parents of princess and Tomasia impregnated by don't clubby one type with the

516
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:18.930
connivance of Dwayne [inaudible].

517
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.890
Now notice our clubby hall is a Phallic name.

518
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.023
<v 1>Uh</v>

519
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:31.723
Huh.

520
00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.610
<v 0>Uh,
[inaudible] is a peg.</v>

521
00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.290
Ha is a peg,
uh,
in a,
uh,

522
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.940
in a string instrument.
Uh,
now,
now they are,
um,

523
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.320
they have a little mechanism with a screw type thing.

524
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.110
Uh,

525
00:37:56.110 --> 00:38:01.110
but the old glovie has the old pegs simply stog stuck in the by pressure into

526
00:38:04.121 --> 00:38:06.850
the ward.
And hence the name.

527
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.450
[inaudible] is a very phallic name.

528
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.330
I know a joke on the part of Cervantes.

529
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.360
[inaudible] is a silly Stena type.

530
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:26.361
Remember Sestina they go between 1499 who arranges for their encounters,

531
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.260
but she falls in love herself with a young man,
which gives a story,

532
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.630
an original twist,
that kind of sophisticated twist.

533
00:38:38.631 --> 00:38:41.520
This old older woman,
uh,

534
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:45.070
has fallen in love with [inaudible] who's a very charming guy who plays the

535
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:47.730
guitar and all of that.
It is a Sushi,

536
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:52.830
vicariously had the affair with clubby hope through a antonymous.

537
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:57.140
Yeah,
so there is a,
uh,

538
00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.600
there's a clever sophistication involved in the,
in the story here.

539
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.650
Now the stories are very,
uh,
a clever awesome.

540
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.120
Now don't Cubbyhole Dawson,
Mary Antonio Masiya as he had promised,

541
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.540
but the queen dies of grief because of the disparity in social class between

542
00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:21.190
them.
He is merely a night.
He has the dog,
so she uses a night,

543
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.640
but she's a princess.
I'm Tomasi is the princess.

544
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.030
So Milan,
Bruno,

545
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.880
a giant and the on the Queens first cousin.

546
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:34.360
Who is the panda Philando of this story.
My Bruno.

547
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:47.953
<v 2>Okay.</v>

548
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:52.950
<v 0>Turns them into the ornament.
A top a sarcophagus.
Now,</v>

549
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.770
uh,
if Banfi panda,
Philando,

550
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.240
remember what the Pan Philanderer,

551
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.100
the one who had many affairs with women Pan Philanderer.

552
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.430
Milan Bruno is a bad man
from model.

553
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:08.873
<v 2>Okay.</v>

554
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.090
<v 0>Evil or bad,</v>

555
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.870
an ombre man

556
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.370
or on Bruno manly.

557
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:29.080
He's a bad man.
Milan.
Bruno.
It's also comical name.
Uh,

558
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:30.943
<v 2>yeah.</v>

559
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.420
<v 0>In any case,
this is the,
uh,
the gist of the story.</v>

560
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:42.050
Page seven one nine upon the Queens,

561
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.950
Hawker appeared mounted on a wooden horse.

562
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.030
The giant Marlin Bruno,
her cousin German,

563
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.680
who besides being cruel is an enchanter,

564
00:40:54.681 --> 00:40:59.681
also the giant in revenge for his cousin's death and in chastisement of the

565
00:41:00.081 --> 00:41:01.280
boldness of don't clubby.

566
00:41:01.281 --> 00:41:05.780
Who on the folio of Antonio Masiya left them both in chanted by his art.

567
00:41:05.781 --> 00:41:07.640
Upon the various supports a poker,

568
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:12.170
he converted into her converter,
into a monk.

569
00:41:12.171 --> 00:41:16.910
You have brass and him into a fearful crocodile,
well,
I don't know,

570
00:41:16.911 --> 00:41:19.550
metal.
And between them lies a plate of metal.

571
00:41:19.551 --> 00:41:24.340
Likewise with letters engraved upon it in the Syriac language would be rendered

572
00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:28.250
into Ken,
Diane,
and now into Castilian contains the sentence.

573
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.470
There's too presumptuous lovers shall not recover their Preston form to the

574
00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:34.340
valorous man.

575
00:41:34.341 --> 00:41:38.900
Checkin shall enter into single combat with me for the destinies.

576
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:43.280
Reserve.
This unheard of adventure for his grade valor alone.

577
00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.053
Quote,

578
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:50.090
notice the Baroque suffusing of love with death.

579
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:56.020
The lovers likeness will lie upon the tone of the dead.

580
00:41:56.210 --> 00:42:01.210
Mother don't overlook that the steward author of the story is learn it as well

581
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:09.611
as clever as we found in the pageant of the forest with all of the Dante

582
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.083
Aleutians.

583
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:17.710
And in his name of Antonio Masiya here he has contrived a truly baroque image.

584
00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:23.260
In the sarcophagus,
I have given you a,
a,
um,

585
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:28.750
a handout,
or on the one hand,
I could not,
uh,

586
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:32.690
uh,
resist,
uh,
having a,
a,
a door,

587
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:36.950
a drawing of the Duenas,
uh,
as they,
uh,

588
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.770
supposed to appear in this episode.
But on the other,

589
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:45.110
I have a series of sarcophagi guy because,
uh,

590
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.210
uh,
American tombs,

591
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:54.080
uh,
tend to be very simple.
Uh,

592
00:42:55.130 --> 00:43:00.130
there's a headstone and then the tomb is just the grass covering the body of the

593
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:04.310
casket or something is something very beautiful about it.
Uh,
dust,

594
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:10.040
we become dust and so forth and so on.
But,
uh,
in the European tradition,

595
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:14.660
the continental in the,
in the continental tradition,
uh,

596
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:19.180
tombs tend to be much more elaborate ordinate and,
uh,

597
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.090
made of stone or a hard surfaces.

598
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:27.350
They are like little buildings that is a whole architecture of tombs.

599
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.080
So what is the sarcophagus?

600
00:43:30.081 --> 00:43:35.081
Remember the Etymology I gave you when discussing the cave of Montesinos

601
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:36.763
episode,

602
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.920
Sarah Course in Greek flesh and Fargo line to eat.

603
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.200
So the sarcophagus eats the flesh of the dead body.
Uh,

604
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.430
sarcophagi were common among the ancient Greeks and Romans.
You have some here.

605
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.540
Uh,
it was a limestone coffin or tomb,

606
00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.360
often inscribed and elaborately ornament.

607
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:05.730
The point of the sarcophagus in this story is the display and the ornamentation,

608
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.520
which are the baroque elements as in the figure of the monster.

609
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.590
Remember the,

610
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:17.420
that in Montesinos cave ornament on Buddha Undark this sarcophagus was his own

611
00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:21.830
cadaver.
The statue is made of flesh.

612
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.510
It was an inversion inversion with nature play.
The role of art.

613
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:31.570
Here we have a much more elaborate kind of ornamentation.

614
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.000
How do we interpret the figures of the Monkey on the crocodile here?

615
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

616
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.930
<v 0>There are monkeys in Cervantes as we saw with [inaudible].</v>

617
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:46.910
Uh,
and also,
Eh,
the monkey that matter,

618
00:44:46.911 --> 00:44:49.520
Peter had with him,

619
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.240
I guess I said in when mentioning those episodes,

620
00:44:53.241 --> 00:44:58.241
they allude to me Macy's to representation because they like to imitate humans

621
00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:06.050
here.
Uh,
the ensemble could allude to,

622
00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.160
to lost the CROC eats the monkey as it were.

623
00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.320
Uh,
but both animals are,
uh,

624
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:20.270
the monkey on the crocodile are supposed to be demonic and symbols of

625
00:45:20.271 --> 00:45:22.100
dissimulation of fakery.

626
00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.700
This is why they grades the tomb of his lovers.

627
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.570
Now the story of antonymous yeah,

628
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.970
and don't clubby who is one of conservation and pregnancy.

629
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:40.310
I think that the pregnancy is part of the Baroque grotesquerie of the episode is

630
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:45.530
the interested intervention of the UN year of the,
uh,

631
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.110
what I mean by that is that there is something grotesque about the go between,

632
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:49.890
uh,

633
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:54.890
the older woman falling in love with a young man and at the same kind of

634
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:59.910
grotesqueness,
uh,
is involved in the pregnancy.

635
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.320
This contrasts,
uh,
you will find in the poetry for instance,

636
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:07.320
of Ltc Laura when she appears and sings a song.

637
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.340
There will be so blind lines followed by very vulgar ones.

638
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:16.050
And this is the,
I think the effect here of the,
uh,

639
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:21.040
of the pregnancy pregnancy would be unthinkable in the stories of part one

640
00:46:21.041 --> 00:46:24.710
involving Doterra,
Marcella,
Lucinda or Soraida,

641
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.870
although consummation did take place with Dorothea.

642
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:32.550
But pregnancy literalized lost,
uh,

643
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.710
removing idealizations about love.
You don't underscore it.

644
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:42.711
Underscores loves functional biological drive to reproduction.

645
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.593
<v 1>Uh,</v>

646
00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.690
<v 0>pregnancy is not very sublime.
It's not part of the,
of the,</v>

647
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:56.150
of the courtly love tradition.
It is,
uh,
uh,

648
00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:00.980
unthinkable who imagine Beatrice Dante's below it,

649
00:47:00.981 --> 00:47:04.580
pregnant or any of these ladies.
Uh,

650
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.190
so there,
there will be a,

651
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.970
another pregnancy later involving [inaudible] his daughter.

652
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:14.450
And we will discuss the episode,
uh,

653
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.050
at this stage in the Quixote.

654
00:47:18.051 --> 00:47:23.051
We are well beyond the idealized love of [inaudible] one Marcella or don Quixote

655
00:47:27.201 --> 00:47:31.810
and don't see nay.
Let's see.
Naiah has been enchanted,
took,
sorry,
like,
uh,

656
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:37.130
a country wench.
So,
uh,

657
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.460
now we come to the end of this adventure,

658
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:47.100
the end of this very well rod story that the steward has composed and whose

659
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.530
inner workings we are,
uh,
observing as we read,

660
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:58.700
we moved out to the episode of Clary Lania Globulin.

661
00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:02.450
You became such a,
or has become such an,
uh,

662
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.960
an ingrained name in the Spanish tradition that there was a very famous literary

663
00:48:06.961 --> 00:48:09.510
journal in the 30s in Spain called [inaudible].

664
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.530
Now,
uh,

665
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.760
this story brings to a close the story of the beer they're doing.
Yes.

666
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.950
And the disenchantment of Antonio Masiya and Clerico.
Now first,

667
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:29.670
the chapter begins with a mock derived of self praise on the part of Savantas

668
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.210
about his narrative techniques and characters.
Page seven,

669
00:48:37.211 --> 00:48:40.240
2021 in reality and truth,

670
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:45.990
all who delight in such histories as this ought to be thankful to its original

671
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:51.280
authors.
Sit Helmet for his curious exactness in recording them.

672
00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:55.900
I notice circumstances,
they're off.
We thought omitting anything,

673
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.770
how trifling soever but bringing everything distinctly to light.

674
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:05.200
He paints thoughts.
Discover is imaginations,
answers the salad,

675
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.620
clears up,
doubts,
resolves arguments.

676
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:13.600
And lastly manifests the least atoms of the inquisitive desire.

677
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.380
Oh,
most celebrated author or happy Don Quixote.
Oh,

678
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.340
famous Lucy.

679
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.360
Now office issues central Panza live each jointly and severally infinite ages

680
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.290
for the general pressure and pastime of the living.

681
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:34.840
Now this is very funny.
It's Atlantis bracing himself.
Uh,

682
00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:39.970
and he is praising himself,
uh,
by anatomizing as it were,

683
00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.990
the,
the,
the props of his own fiction or of his own,

684
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:48.250
uh,
the makeup of his own art.
Uh,

685
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.460
what's the rant this is doing is this missing Aristotelian injunctions

686
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:56.230
concerning the writing of history in this passage?

687
00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.670
According to left philosopher to use an internal Masiya to refer to,
uh,

688
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.520
Aristotle.
History should not concern itself with minutia,

689
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:11.790
but only with that which is relevant to the ground narratives which concerns

690
00:50:12.321 --> 00:50:17.170
itself with major historical figures,
not with characters of the ILC servant.

691
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:22.171
This is dealing with nor should history dwell on their thoughts except when

692
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:27.181
expressed in highly rhetorical speeches that are presumed to express and display

693
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:32.450
their personalities.
Now,
this is so against our modern conceptions of history,

694
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.790
uh,
that,
uh,

695
00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.930
[inaudible] this already aware of it because we,
we,

696
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.000
we do want details about the characters in the important and not important

697
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:48.040
characters in history because we,
we feel that in the details,
uh,

698
00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:52.610
you may find the truth.
No,
not in this renaissance conceptional of history.

699
00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:56.420
This is the what,
uh,
what I have just,
uh,
uh,

700
00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:00.530
giving you is the core of the renaissance poet,
uh,
of history.

701
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:05.630
Uh,
but in this mock history that Cervantes is writing,
uh,

702
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:10.690
it is precisely the particular details as well as the thoughts and imaginings of

703
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:15.830
the characters that are of interest.
The most.
The remoteness,
uh,
uh,

704
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.400
element of these renaissance poetics of history is the question of the speeches.

705
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:23.390
Because of course,
there were no recording devices at the time.

706
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.920
So when you hear a king,
uh,
deliver,
uh,
an aeration,

707
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.130
uh,
it is all made up by the historian whose art,
uh,

708
00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.640
involve the creation of such,
uh,

709
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:38.480
speeches on the part of this historical characters that would reveal their

710
00:51:38.481 --> 00:51:41.510
personality.
It was a way of,
of,
of,
of,

711
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:44.360
of delving into their psychology.

712
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:49.361
Now I know this is completely against our notions of how to write history,

713
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:54.140
but this is why savant this is underlining it here.
Uh,

714
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.650
he is interested in the details and he's interested in the imaginings and the

715
00:51:57.651 --> 00:52:00.770
thoughts of characters who are not that important,

716
00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:05.350
but are the characters who will pull people that novel that he is,
uh,

717
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.640
uh,
creating.
So,
in other words,
this tiered shows that said,

718
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:13.850
manthis is increasingly aware that is creating a new kind of writing,

719
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:19.250
which is derived from both history and jaw Hos oh,
the new,

720
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.620
such as,
uh,
the epic,

721
00:52:21.621 --> 00:52:26.420
the picaresque and the Romances of children that you ride by the way out to be

722
00:52:26.421 --> 00:52:31.130
presumed to be ordered by the second author or translator who frequently

723
00:52:31.131 --> 00:52:36.110
comments on Cedar Math work the story,
remember,
uh,

724
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.380
who's,
uh,
a more,
uh,
given to prevarications.

725
00:52:39.381 --> 00:52:43.320
So we have all of this falls on layers of irony is still oppressive,

726
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:48.180
but this is important because of what I said before,
a stories in,
in,

727
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:52.880
in part to displaying the how they are made up.

728
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:57.320
So we moved to Kerrville.
And your first,
the name of the Horse,

729
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:00.560
it is derived from Glover.

730
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:02.383
<v 2>Okay.</v>

731
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.310
<v 0>Which means a nail,</v>

732
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:15.630
but the results are an echo of glovie.
Ha.

733
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:20.370
The word that I used before that I mentioned before in reference to [inaudible]

734
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:23.520
because the clubby high itself is derived from cloud,

735
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.580
meaning something that stuck.
Um,

736
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.590
and this alludes to the steering,
uh,

737
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:32.790
peg or what I mean,

738
00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:37.500
a pilot would call the yoke of these,
uh,
through a steer.

739
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.160
This,
uh,
this horse,
um,

740
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:42.940
and Lania.

741
00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:50.720
<v 2>Okay,</v>

742
00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.870
<v 0>Len,
you know,
which mean w means ward,</v>

743
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.310
which is what the horse is made of.

744
00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:01.760
But linear or linea is it kind of would use for fire wood for burning.

745
00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:10.370
The more noble would use by carpenters to make furniture or cabinets is called

746
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:12.703
Marvetta.

747
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:18.563
<v 2>Of course.</v>

748
00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:24.640
<v 0>[inaudible] is to own wheel the word,
uh,</v>

749
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.500
and also Cervantes is on the lining that this board of which,
uh,

750
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.390
Globulin you is made.
It's not of the noblest would,
uh,

751
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.400
there's something demeaning to lay new glovie lane used to name God.

752
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.280
[inaudible] I think I,

753
00:54:40.281 --> 00:54:45.281
I kept thinking what would be a good translation into English or what a

754
00:54:45.341 --> 00:54:47.870
rendering through.
I thought that,
uh,

755
00:54:47.871 --> 00:54:52.030
the horse could be called firewood or he called me call.

756
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.710
I think that the best would be woody.

757
00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:59.020
I think that if we were to really translate everything in the book,
uh,

758
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:03.070
clubby,
then you would be called woody.
I think woody woodpecker.

759
00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.540
Uh,

760
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:10.060
but Jarvis Jarvis wisely sticks too.

761
00:55:10.061 --> 00:55:14.800
Clubby later doesn't translate that.
But that's,
that's what the sense of it is.

762
00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:16.323
Now.

763
00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:20.890
The adventure of curvilinear is derived from several or similar ones in romances

764
00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:21.724
of chivalry.

765
00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.740
So the parody of Romances of chivalry is carried out now,

766
00:55:26.741 --> 00:55:31.660
not so much by Don Quixote and his actions.
What by the Duke servants,

767
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.070
particularly the Stewart.

768
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.700
He's not only learn it and clever as I have been emphasizing,

769
00:55:36.701 --> 00:55:41.560
but he's also a reader of romances of jewelry out of course of the first part of

770
00:55:41.561 --> 00:55:46.540
the Quixote as well.
The motif of the flying horse has a long tradition,

771
00:55:46.541 --> 00:55:48.790
including Pegasus in Greek mythology,

772
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:54.480
but the figure traveled long in time and space after the Indian and Persian

773
00:55:54.911 --> 00:55:57.100
versions.
Three appears in the Arabic story,

774
00:55:57.101 --> 00:56:02.020
the Ebony Horse in the thousand and one nights from there,

775
00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:07.990
it was disseminated through France and Spain.
Uh,

776
00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.130
I won't give you the names of the titles of some of these romances in which it

777
00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:16.210
appears,
but it's a figure that appears fairly frequently.

778
00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:22.090
So obviously this reveals the stores,
uh,
knowledge of these romances of a,

779
00:56:22.091 --> 00:56:24.070
of jewelry.
Now,

780
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:29.430
what is one of the interesting features of the flight is the all encompassing

781
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:36.091
view from above that the characters have presumably have,

782
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:41.920
which is typical of the Baroque,
the baroque effort at all,

783
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:43.300
inclusiveness,

784
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:48.430
which is now available with the knowledge that the earth is round and complete

785
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:49.600
within itself.

786
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.260
The episode has a great deal to do with contemporary discoveries about the

787
00:56:55.421 --> 00:57:00.421
infinite dimensions of the cosmos of which have spoken before and the inability

788
00:57:00.491 --> 00:57:04.330
of Ptolemaic and Aristotelian cosmologies to represent such a,

789
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:05.680
such a cosmos.

790
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:11.820
Don Quixote on Sandra believe to be going through the spheres as described in

791
00:57:12.851 --> 00:57:16.870
the old cosmology.
And this is the,
of course,
they encourage this by having this,

792
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:19.330
a fire next to their beards or they're facing.

793
00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:22.000
So they figured they're going through the sphere of fire.

794
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:25.023
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

795
00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:26.003
<v 0>Uh,</v>

796
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.160
and central claims that he took a stroll among the constellations as they're

797
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.410
described in this old cosmology.

798
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:38.100
The corollary of,
uh,

799
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:41.850
the new discoveries is that the world is one on the same everywhere.

800
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:43.890
Uh,

801
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:48.890
Sandra had introduced the topic a few pages before when upon hearing the story

802
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:55.770
of [inaudible] and [inaudible] income,
diarrhea,
he says,

803
00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:00.870
page seven,
one eight.
What are their court,
our whistles,

804
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:04.590
ports and rumblings in income Dahlia two hour if saw,
I swear,

805
00:58:04.591 --> 00:58:09.160
I think the world is the same everywhere.
Santo is,
uh,

806
00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:14.030
thinks that the world is the same everywhere.
And this is what,
uh,

807
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:17.670
the view from above,
uh,
uh,
uh,

808
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:23.540
suggests glad we Lanio flight in the Kihatha is the gorilla the opposite of

809
00:58:25.531 --> 00:58:29.220
course,
of the cave Montesinos descent down.
Oh No.

810
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.120
Appropriately giving his increasing importance.

811
00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:36.610
It is now Santo who tells a story like the one donkey hope,

812
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:38.880
the toll after emerging from the cave,

813
00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:43.560
he speaks of a celestial flight down,
uh,

814
00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.700
drawn from similar flights of the spirit,
uh,

815
00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:51.720
that are available in Cicero,
some UMES Scipione as in boy,
atheists,

816
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:56.960
the consolation of philosophy and even in Louis [inaudible] still [inaudible]

817
00:58:57.431 --> 00:58:58.180
Lewis delay.

818
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:02.310
Oh miss another great port of a 16th century that is somewhere in the background

819
00:59:02.311 --> 00:59:03.144
here.

820
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:21.380
Um,
I seen other episodes in the second part.
Don't be hope.

821
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:25.760
The shows real courage.
Before,
before what appears to be actual danger.

822
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.960
So those central,
uh,

823
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:32.400
but they have played again the role of objects of the others,

824
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.340
uh,
amusement.

825
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.870
So [inaudible] episode is another prank.

826
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.290
I know that a bullseye is the word that I keep using Moodle,
a prank

827
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:51.650
at the expense of Don Quixote on central conceived and executed

828
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.030
by the Duke's minions,
particularly the steward.

829
00:59:56.090 --> 01:00:01.090
All of these pranks are a critique of me Macy's in that they are literary or

830
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:06.851
theatrical acts of representation which are presented as pitiable attempts

831
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:10.040
ultimately given up in favor of humor.

832
01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.230
These are attempts or literary representation that we Macy's and they wound up

833
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:19.450
being funny.
These I think encapsulates Cervantes,

834
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.370
his own effort in the Quixote.

835
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:27.290
They are dramatizations of his plight and answer to the problem trying to

836
01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:32.291
represent reality and they're coming up with a funny version of it.

837
01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:34.443
Uh,

838
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:40.060
but there is something else to perhaps even more important in this practice and

839
01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:42.440
in the club he linear one in particular,

840
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:47.390
while it is true than Don Quixote on central are made fun of and that they

841
01:00:47.391 --> 01:00:52.010
endure hardship and danger when the whole contraption blows up.

842
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:58.640
It is today who show courage and determination and it is day who do fly in their

843
01:00:58.641 --> 01:01:02.840
imaginations while the pranksters remained earthbound,

844
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:07.610
some like the Duke and duchess astonished and even frightened by the machinery

845
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:10.280
that they have constructed or had constructed.

846
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:12.800
I think these some sub,

847
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:16.160
it seems to miss Advantis his attitude towards the protagonist.

848
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:18.650
He may very well be ridiculous in his efforts,

849
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.030
but he's Halfords have a certain no blueness that others luck.

850
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:29.140
Justice he emerges on from the explosion and fall gives dignity also remains on

851
01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:33.860
touched in brief.

852
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:39.670
[inaudible] does afford Doki hotter a flight I'd once heroic and inspired us in

853
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:44.360
the episode of the Lions.
I repeat.

854
01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:49.361
He has demonstrated his courage even if the context is not a heroic corn.
