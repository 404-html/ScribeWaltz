1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.950
We are coming to the part of the Quixote,

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.550
the core of part one in which sort of Vantis makes a display of narrative

3
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:17.931
mastery by combining the sequential structure of the Ci Valerie Romance whose

4
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:25.761
form he's parodying with the multiple story design of collections of Novell lay,

5
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.720
the long short story favored by Italians from Boccaccio to bundle.

6
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.720
How can these two Java's,
uh,
B,
uh,

7
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.640
merged a mixed

8
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Cervantes achieves it by taking his protagonist away from the center of the

9
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:53.541
story while still engaging him in the own folding and resolution of the

10
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:01.551
intercalated tales involving Gardenia Fernando or they are.

11
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.750
And Lucinda,
we will get to that

12
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.070
today and in the next class.

13
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.420
But first I want to begin by talking about the role that memory place in

14
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.920
narrative and the development of characters.

15
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.090
In the last class we saw how interrupted stories being told by characters led to

16
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.150
the revelation of other stories not being told or being told or obliquely.

17
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.670
In all of those cases,
memory is the key element.

18
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.640
Don Quixote.
It makes up the generic g Valerie novel,

19
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.940
Generic Chivalry Romance Drawing from his recollections of the Chivalric Nova.

20
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.620
A romances that,
that he has read in the past.

21
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.440
In the episodes in the Sierra Morena.
There are three moments,

22
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.800
uh,
when memory,
uh,

23
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.320
plays a crucial role.

24
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.030
The first is when Cardenio speaks about how painful memory,

25
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.080
the memory of his betrayal by Lucinda and Fernando is,

26
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:28.680
and how he would like to evoke it,

27
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.230
if only to make him,
uh,

28
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.880
have the strength of mind to commit suicide.

29
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.510
He says in page two,
25,
Oh,

30
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:43.890
memory thou mortal enemy of my repulse.

31
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.220
Why does thou represent to me now the incomparable beauty of that my adored

32
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.993
enemy,

33
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.150
where he not better cruel memory to put me in mind off unrepresented to my

34
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.880
imagination what she did then the move by.

35
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.370
So Flager Flager an injury,

36
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.970
I may strive seaside,
do not revenge it,

37
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.000
at least to put an end to my life.

38
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.180
The agonizing recollection of those events,
of the betrayal,

39
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.680
uh,

40
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.680
constitutes the defining story of Cardenio and the source of his madness.

41
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.840
It is not just what others did to him,

42
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.520
but what he failed to do,
a decisive moment.

43
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.910
He's cowardice as he refers to it twice.

44
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.160
He says that he was a coward twice.

45
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.840
The second instance when memory plays a role is one Gardanio says that he

46
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.810
vaguely remembers the fracas with Don Quixote.

47
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.030
When denied interrupted his narrative,
the episode is like a hole in his memory.

48
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.790
This is an example of server anthesis,
uh,
psychological sophistication,

49
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.090
uh,
that car.
Then you can only remember the fight.

50
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:12.091
We don't get healthy as if it had been a dream but cannot recall what provoked

51
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.980
it.
And I quote from page two 45 in your translation,

52
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.880
got a venue here upon remembered as if it had been a dream the coral he had with

53
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:26.374
donkey hot there,

54
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.730
which he related to the company but could not recollect when it arose.

55
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.930
Uncle Carl,
then your story has a gaping hole,

56
00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:43.931
a crack at the climax that is contained within another crack Don Quixote's

57
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.603
interruption.

58
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.350
It is like this car left by a deep wound.

59
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.370
This lapse is a clear symptom of trauma we would say today cause Cardinia story

60
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.750
is full of hope of gaps and discontinuities.

61
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.570
The third instance when memory,
uh,
is highlighted,
uh,

62
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.040
is when Doterra,

63
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.200
that's Princess Mikko me Kona for gets her name.

64
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.830
Uh,

65
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.830
she plays that role when telling the story about the bogus story of her life in

66
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:26.080
page,
uh,
to uh,
55.

67
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.603
Um,

68
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.160
let's see you,
I can find it.

69
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.620
He says she's allowed to start to,

70
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.800
to start her story and she says in the first place,

71
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:46.801
you must know gentlemen that my name is he or she stopped short having,

72
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.500
forgot the name.

73
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.500
The priest has got given her but he presently helped her out for,

74
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:59.630
he knew what,
uh,
she stopped at and said,
we just don't wonder.
Madonna so forth

75
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.090
says she would make up the story,
uh,

76
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.970
basing it on her recollection of reading romances of chivalry.

77
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.470
This by the way,
is an inconsistency either in Sylvana versus uh,

78
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.120
a case or a Dodo.
Pay Us own recollections or,
uh,

79
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:23.300
when she told her her life or how her life was,

80
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.380
she said that one of her entertainment's was reading most of the devout

81
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.360
literature.
She didn't mention anything then about reading romances of chivalry,

82
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.590
but she does now.
So she would make up the story,

83
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:39.650
basing it on her recollection of reading romances of chivalry,

84
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.130
but the name was none of her invention but the priests.

85
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.780
So she quickly forgets it and it has to be prompted,
uh,

86
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.550
since as we commented,

87
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:54.530
her story is a translation of her current predicament into the discourse of the

88
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:55.400
romances.

89
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.790
Her for getting her name is also indicative of her traumatized self.

90
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.670
She has to drop assumed other roles after she was abandoned by don't Fernando,

91
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.400
which is the traumatic event in her life.

92
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.090
Her sense of identity is frail and in the process of being remade

93
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.500
now connected to all of this and perhaps the overarching memory lapse of the

94
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:27.230
mall is the loss of Santos,

95
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:30.890
his ass or Dapl as the translation calls him.

96
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.210
There is no name by the way,
in the,
for the ass in the,

97
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.730
in the Spanish origin.
But I know that in this translation on the others,

98
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.560
they call him dapple because I suppose of his color.
So,

99
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.220
uh,
remember that the,
this,
this,

100
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:49.840
the theft of the,
of the,
uh,

101
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.200
Sanchez as is left out of the first edition,
uh,

102
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.210
and Cervantes hastily restored it in the second printing a few months later.

103
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.990
Memory is not just a repository of recollections and stories from the past.

104
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.500
It is that which structures the self in the present and the archive when's

105
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.570
narratives issue flawed and misshapen.

106
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.080
No longer a true reflection of what happened,

107
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.860
but regulatory over true about a character's state as he or she talks.

108
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.560
No.

109
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.560
So it is a truth about now about the present that may be full of holes,

110
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.380
a misrepresentations about the past.

111
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.540
It is nevertheless the repository of stories about the past.

112
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.110
So it is in that interplay between that floor recollection and the present that

113
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.520
the stories are told is what I'm driving at.

114
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.840
The representation of all of this,
of this,
uh,

115
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.990
interplay of memory and narrative is the overall network of interrelated,

116
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.490
intertwined stories that take place or are told in the Sierra Morina unresolved.

117
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.030
At one Palo Meccas in after Don Quixote's battle of the wineskins about which we

118
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:25.140
will speak into in,
uh,
in the next class.

119
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.481
Now,

120
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:32.481
Cervantes was very much aware of the complexities of that construct,

121
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:38.331
that network of stories we read at the beginning of Chapter 28 and I have a

122
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.870
handout for you to take a home,
uh,

123
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.130
which is the text that I'm going to read in Spanish.
And on the back of it,
uh,

124
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.460
various translations of it,

125
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.600
<v 1>uh,
various extent translations of it,</v>

126
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.160
um,
that I have a collected,

127
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.290
<v 0>you're going to follow,
uh,
the Spanish,
uh,</v>

128
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.090
on the,
on the,
on the Spanish side of the,
uh,

129
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.060
the handout and it says no solo.

130
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.760
Uh,
this is,
uh,
um,
uh,

131
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.710
we read it at the beginning of chapter 28 after we have heard.

132
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:30.430
Got to Daniel's tail in two installments.
Uh,

133
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.960
we have these remarkable self referential mark admonition on the part of the

134
00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:39.010
narrator,
not solo ladol Sutra,

135
00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:44.011
the suit that I see it better than La Storia see know that have quinto CIP

136
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.300
solely of day.
Yeah.

137
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.540
Game [inaudible] my Storia [inaudible] yes.

138
00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:01.150
Palo Elo when Taqiyya [inaudible].

139
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.370
Now this is,
uh,
I regret to say Jarvis,
uh,

140
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.780
that translation that we are using this year.
Parents this down to quote,

141
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.750
enjoy the suites of his donkey hold as true story,

142
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.130
but also the stories and episodes of it which are in some sort of or less

143
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.270
policing,
artificial and true done.
The history itself,

144
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.510
which resuming the resuming the broken thread of the narration relates that you

145
00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:32.551
can see his bare it down by smallest version with some inundations of my own.

146
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.430
You'll have it on the back,
your read on the smallest,
which is the last one,

147
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.703
<v 1>uh,</v>

148
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.120
<v 0>in this hour age in so much in need of enjoying agreeable entertainment's,</v>

149
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:52.080
not only of his donkey hold as true and delightful adventures,

150
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:56.040
but also of the intervening episodes,
which are no less real art,

151
00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:58.780
full and delicious than the main story itself.

152
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.490
The twisted real than rabble thread of which is continued.

153
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:08.230
Thus Joses to curate was ready to offer some consolation to go to Daniel and so

154
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:12.730
forth and so on.
You can see how much,
uh,

155
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.530
Jarvis left out.

156
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.190
I want to call attention not just to what the text says,

157
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.740
but to the interruption itself,

158
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.090
which is a speech act that performs the function of interrupting in this

159
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:28.594
narratives.

160
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.810
A speech act is an act that a speaker performs when making an utterance

161
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.090
justice.
The breeze is about to reply to Gardenia.

162
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:43.650
He is prevented in smaller version.

163
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.380
Hindered in Jarvis is version by Donald J US voice,

164
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.920
which will provide part of the missing information in Cardinia was account that

165
00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:57.921
can be no comforting of Cardenio yet interruptions rarely promote comforting

166
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.560
the to the words.

167
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.480
Cervantes used to refer to the buildup or spooling up of a narrative,

168
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.540
uh,
of narratives.
Trans brings this out.

169
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.060
They are drawn from spinning,

170
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:18.090
leaning thread [inaudible] as Palo and are reasonably reasonably well translated

171
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:24.160
by smaller us.
Twisted,
real and rattled.

172
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.460
But in the original they have,
at least for me,

173
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.560
perhaps it go Spanish is my native language.

174
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:34.450
The more violent or literal infection.
In other words,

175
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.640
twisted real,

176
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.420
unraveled are common English terms.

177
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:45.670
The WHO's metaphoric origin has now faded in Spanish.

178
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.680
The words used by said Vantis applied art allegorically to narrative are

179
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:55.681
shockingly fresh and evoke more directly the physical actions they describe.

180
00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:02.230
The last three Yara is to rake out the excess fibers from the thread.

181
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.700
Daughter Sarah is to twist together many strengths in order to make a string or

182
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:11.290
thread.
And as spatter is to twist two sticks,

183
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.530
we've together to weave strings together as if as it's done in a smaller scale

184
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.590
with uh,
the needles in knitting when you go like this with the two needles.

185
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:24.160
So the two sticks are being a spar as Spanda,

186
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.190
the cross marriages Lucinda with Gardenia,

187
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:32.770
although she had been married to don for Brando and the Latte,

188
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:35.530
I don't know Fernando,
although she had been in Cardinia care,

189
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.860
replicate the positioning and actioning on action of the two sticks use for us

190
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:46.540
bar,
if you understand what I mean.
In short,

191
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.620
the relation among the stories including the main plot is predicated on blunt

192
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.750
cuts and criss crossings,
not on smooth transitions.

193
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.500
These are made possible by traumatic interruptions,

194
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.750
which jostled a memory of the tellers and drive them to reveal other stories

195
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.960
behind the one they tell and also make them disclose their inner thoughts,

196
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.580
rounding out their characters.
But in addition,

197
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.420
the whole network of stories,
which is like a quilt to continue this,

198
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.930
a metaphor having to do with cloth

199
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.070
is itself a superb display.

200
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:32.360
This play of narrative skill and of variety,

201
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.000
which is one of the aims of renaissance art.

202
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.870
But the question will always remain in spite of what the narrator says about the

203
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:46.430
relationship of all of these stories to the main story of Don Quixote and

204
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:49.550
century.
I'm sketching an answer here today,

205
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.350
but I must inform you and as you will learn in the prologue of part two,

206
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.850
Cervantes was criticized for including all of these stories.

207
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.280
And in the sequel he was careful.
He was careful to integrate them,
uh,

208
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.740
do integrate stories more seamlessly into the main narrative.
Uh,

209
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:14.050
he didn't include a story like the novel of the curious in pertinent about which

210
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:17.150
will be speaking in the next class.
Uh,
uh,

211
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.760
whose relationship to the main story,
uh,

212
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.790
is a debatable or questionable.
And we will,

213
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.850
we will talk about in the next class.

214
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.900
Now in the last class I focused,
uh,

215
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.080
we will talk about it in the next class.
Did I say the last in the next class?
Um,

216
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.530
in the last class I focus on the Fernando.
Remember when I talk about them,

217
00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:46.310
I your ass go and they say when dawn and that whole background let us

218
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:48.980
concentrate today on Durrell and Gardenia

219
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.430
got a venue,
Edward Dudley who's name I put there in case it doesn't,

220
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.950
I don't make it clear,
writes in his superb essay,

221
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.230
the wild man goes baroque.

222
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.120
He writes the following and we need to be glossing some quotes from Dudley's

223
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.970
essay.
This wild man has got to Daniel,
the soul brother of Don Quixote.

224
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.930
Unlike him,
a victim of madness.

225
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:20.150
They're meeting in the Sierra Morina occurs in an atmosphere of unspoken

226
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:23.510
attractions and donkey hot.
They already mad,

227
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.520
is driven further into the shadowed wilderness of his insanity.

228
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.820
His subsequent imitation of Cardenio madness is the high point of his lunacy

229
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.210
unquote.
He adopted,

230
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:42.110
he is referring to the episode that I quoted earlier about the meeting of

231
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:46.730
Kardinia and Don Quixote when the night seems to remember having seen Cardenio

232
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.773
earlier.

233
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.350
Now the between the two is that Gardenia is a poet in the Petrarchan a vein or

234
00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.460
gutsiness cause he last saw Wayne lag resource Tomo.

235
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.260
So there are parallelisms we don't get hold of.
But there also,
uh,
differences.

236
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.540
Dot.
Lee goes on to give a context to the figure of the wild man.

237
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.280
He says the approach to a wild man hidden in a threatening wilderness is an

238
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:19.281
archetypal pattern familiar in world folklore and one utilized by artists again

239
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:25.881
and again on quote even alludes to a modern work like Joseph Conrad's heart of

240
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.690
darkness,
which as you know,
is from 1900 the famous novel.

241
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.080
So the story of finding a one on,
in the,

242
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:37.700
in the wilderness is something that is a,
it's a folkloric,
a story.
He eat.

243
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:42.900
Dot.
Recites he goes and wolves as a kin to Cardinia in his moments of madness.

244
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:47.820
I mean,
these figures assume the,
uh,
the,
the role of,
of,
uh,

245
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.210
of uh,
uh,
he,
uh,
goats and,
uh,
of Wolf's,

246
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.610
uh,
uh,

247
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.700
two images suggest that suggest respectively the problems of sex and violence

248
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:03.630
that hunted the 17th century.
I would say that hunted all centuries.
But I mean,

249
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:07.320
he knows because he has studied stories in the 17th century.

250
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.740
Dudley claims that go cardinals problem is that he cannot talk effectively,

251
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.750
that he cannot communicate by means of the spoken word unquote and adds that

252
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:20.700
clinically got Carolinians.

253
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.730
Condition has been diagnosed as a case of Xolair anthropy Xo on therapy animal

254
00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:28.380
man man becoming like an animal.

255
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.750
That's what the relationship between don't Fernando on Cardinia,
uh,
Dudley,
uh,

256
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.820
sees uh,
a homosexual pattern.

257
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.300
He suggests that the relationship between Cardinia and Fernando shows some

258
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.620
mutual affection,
uh,
that,
uh,

259
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.740
uh,
in a way,
uh,
uh,

260
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:57.741
anticipate the relationship between the two protagonists of the novel of the

261
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:03.510
curious impertinent that we'll be discussing in the next class.

262
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.610
That is that the relationship between these two men is mediated by,
by Lucinda.

263
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:09.990
But that actually it is a real,
it's,

264
00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.880
it is a homosexual relationship between the two of them.
Um,

265
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.290
more inline with what I had been saying about interruptions.

266
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:23.780
Dudley says that in asking Cardinia to tell his story called Donkey Quixote

267
00:20:23.781 --> 00:20:28.781
anticipates the 20th century analyst who begins the cure by having the patient

268
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:34.230
tell his story and it is in the story that the cause of the madness is found

269
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.130
justice.

270
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.930
It is by means of donkey holders intervention that the cure is initiated.

271
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.430
But as he proceeds,

272
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:46.100
it becomes apparent that the real reason it is,

273
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.070
is that he's autistic.
I once above all not to be challenges.
He's in his debut,

274
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:54.640
his interpretation of the events.
I will say that it's not that he's autistic,

275
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
but that he has been traumatized and that trauma has caused something akin to

276
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:03.490
autism,
but it is not,
uh,
uh,
autism.

277
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.960
And then he says that [inaudible] plays an important role because not of there

278
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.220
appears before.
Cardenio and he has,
he admires her beauty,

279
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:16.270
but there's not lost after her.
And that in that process,

280
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.750
the cardinals a cure,
uh,
has to be gone.

281
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.660
And this is a typically a renaissance,

282
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.160
a idea of a cure by provoked by,

283
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:32.070
uh,
the contemplation of beauty.
And that this is the role that,
uh,

284
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:37.030
uh,
Dorothea place in this,
uh,
in the cure of,
uh,
Carlene.

285
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.210
Carl Daniels character's a character flaws.

286
00:21:42.211 --> 00:21:47.211
And his intermittent bouts of madness are perhaps the reason,

287
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.320
uh,

288
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.320
the reasons why Shakespeare found Cardinia compelling and wrote a play about

289
00:21:54.451 --> 00:21:55.284
him.

290
00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.620
A play that was lost by the way,

291
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.110
it is known that Shakespeare wrote a play based on current venue.

292
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.910
Remember that Quixote appeared in translation in 1611.

293
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.530
So Shakespeare had time and he did the read Don Quixote.

294
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.830
And to read this story and to write a play on,
uh,
uh,

295
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:19.570
about the,
uh,
based on this character,
well,
unfortunately it was lost.

296
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.930
Uh,
but one,
one is left to wonder,

297
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.990
what did Shakespeare find compelling in the character of Kardinia?

298
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.520
Uh,
I,
I would say that of course there is a,
a,

299
00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.790
a ham that like tendency to hesitation in,
uh,

300
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.370
in,
in Cardinia,
uh,
that may have,
uh,

301
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.740
that Shakespeare may have found a attractive,
uh,

302
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.850
of course,
uh,
uh,
could you close that window so that we don't hear this,

303
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.790
a gentleman outside,
um,
um,

304
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.630
laughing at each other's jokes.

305
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.870
You could also yell out and tell him to shut up.
But
no,

306
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:02.860
I think this is pretty good.

307
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.180
So,
uh,
one,
uh,

308
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.760
one interesting topic for a paper would be to speculate why Shakespeare wrote a

309
00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:23.390
play on,
on,
on Gardenia,
along the lines of what I have suggested here.

310
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:27.170
But you can come up with your own ideas.
And in fact,
uh,

311
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.270
a professor from Harvard,
Stephen Greenblatt,
uh,

312
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.420
I read in the paper not long ago actually,
uh,

313
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.800
he'd been an expert on Shakespeare road,
uh,
play,
uh,

314
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.980
based on,
on,
on Gardenia,
uh,
literature.

315
00:23:42.981 --> 00:23:47.981
Professors are often tempted to the line and to write literature.

316
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.190
The results are not always a very felicitous,

317
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.780
but I haven't seen greenbelts play,
so I'm not judging it.

318
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.410
Now,
that'll tell us a story as we know.

319
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:07.670
And so in the last class,
the appear,
you said used by Fernando who is dead,

320
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:12.470
Mary's Lucinda,
is there some kind of culpability in Doterra?

321
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.300
Did she not also consider at the crucial moment what a good match Fernando would

322
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:21.200
be?
Wasn't she trapped by the fact that if she resisted,

323
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:24.590
no one would believe that she had not allow for Nando in her room?

324
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.650
Like Cardenio,
she hesitates at the moment of truth.
But unlike Cardenio,

325
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.650
she makes a decision and takes action.

326
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.550
Harris is not a submissive surrender is a calculated,
a surrender.

327
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.370
When Fernando Disappears,
uh,
g goes in search of him,

328
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.510
uh,

329
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.500
but then discovers that the marriage to leucine that may not be final and that

330
00:24:52.501 --> 00:24:56.900
she may have a chance to force him to make good on his promise.

331
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.150
Remember that Fernando,
uh,
she discovers a,
has been going hunting,

332
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.430
uh,
after he,
uh,

333
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.140
left her completely oblivious to her,

334
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.750
got a venue or on the other hand is pushing land in most cowardly.

335
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.840
And Lucinda cannot bring herself to suicide at the crucial moment as she

336
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:24.500
intended to do.
Don't tell on the other hand is not passive.

337
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:29.530
She invents herself like Don Haughty and like him racist herself in social

338
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:35.060
class.
Ultimately because she does Mary Don Fernando,

339
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.470
we will see sue.

340
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.560
We will soon see the role she plays in bringing a resolution to the conflicts

341
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.120
and prepare the way for donkey holders return to his village.

342
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.500
Now,
little tell story is as,

343
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.180
as compelling as Gardenias,

344
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:58.390
but she is more composed and determined to obtain some sort of restitution.

345
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.080
Her situation is complicated by the fact that her father has done Fernando's

346
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.710
vassal and could hardly,

347
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.850
she could hardly be the one to seek revenge or compensation according to custom.

348
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.830
But by law she had recourse to both,

349
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:21.260
uh,
to revenge and compensation.
But with the help,
uh,

350
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:26.180
usually with the help of a man legislation in the wake of the Catholic kings

351
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:31.181
program to reign in the aristocracy made it a crime for noble men to take

352
00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:33.950
advantage of peasant women,
Gardenia,

353
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:39.190
or being a man and an aristocrat like Don Fernando and the Duke offers to stand

354
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:45.150
up for her clearly because it is also in his interest.

355
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:51.020
He makes the promise in strict accordance to law and costume.

356
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.360
He says that he will challenge Fernando to a duel using the word [inaudible],

357
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.030
which is a,
an old Spanish word,
uh,
for,

358
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.120
uh,
uh,

359
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.560
and which was part of a Spanish legislation in the Middle Ages.

360
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:14.000
But that had been,
uh,
uh,

361
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.910
banned by,
uh,
legislation in the 16th century.

362
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:19.380
That is by the 16th century.

363
00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.810
A noble woman were not allowed to a duel with each other over,

364
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.610
uh,
uh,
an issue.

365
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.750
But there was a lot of debate because of course the aristocracy wanted to retain

366
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.080
that,
right,
which went back to visit gothic times when uh,
uh,

367
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:41.040
when a nobleman,
uh,
took care of this,
uh,
issues,
uh,
by,

368
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.130
uh,
by,
uh,
by fighting each other

369
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.720
now that he's reassured of leucine does virgin or condition and this is crucial

370
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.470
and the questionable legality of her marriage to Fernando.

371
00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.740
Cardinia is encouraged to take action and he in and he invokes what he believes

372
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.640
to be his right.
[inaudible]

373
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.640
story is briefly interrupted by Gardenia who cannot refrain from saying

374
00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:15.330
something when he hears about his own misfortunes from her point of view,

375
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.650
this is the rest of his own story,
which he himself did not know.

376
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.150
And when he reveals a lot out there and he's identity parts of her story that

377
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:26.400
she did not know fall into place,

378
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:33.260
the interruptions are like the seams between the pieces of a large puzzle for

379
00:28:33.661 --> 00:28:34.380
Cardinia.

380
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.880
The crucial piece is the scene of the wedding of Lucinda and Don Fernando,

381
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.510
which had appeared prolifically in the foundry story that he blurted out when

382
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:47.430
donkey Quixote interrupted him.

383
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.470
The business about Queen Manasi Ma and the surgeon having had an affair.

384
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:58.230
Remember that psychotic version that he had in his mind about that the flowering

385
00:28:58.501 --> 00:29:01.080
of Lucinda,
but now he ended up,

386
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:06.081
they are begin to discern potential happy ending to their misfortunes and and at

387
00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:10.440
the intersection of their stories when they discover,

388
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.590
when they hear each other's stories,
the deleted motive,

389
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:18.480
the gap in the story concerns the legality of Fernando's and leucine does

390
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:22.020
marriage and her retaining her virginity.

391
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:27.590
It is that Chason fraught with violence and erased from Cardenas memory that

392
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:33.261
needs to be filled in the melodramatic and conclusive scene at one Palo

393
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:38.390
[inaudible] in Gardenia expresses his desire for restitution using legal terms

394
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:44.560
to describe the damage inflicted on him and leucine.
Down page two 45 it says,

395
00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.260
there is still room for us to hope that heaven will restore to each of us our

396
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:55.831
own since it is not yet 80 and eight it nor past recovery.

397
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:01.720
This is a crucial words.
The original reads BM podemos have [inaudible],

398
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.410
[inaudible],

399
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.020
[inaudible], [inaudible] and Susannah in Wa he Nosha and [inaudible].

400
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.650
The last part is a notario formula using contracts involving the assessment of

401
00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:21.730
properties and their resale value when returned to the original owner.

402
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.660
I think too that Todavia is times to sell.

403
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.680
It remains whole in its integrity is a euphemism to say that Lucinda is still a

404
00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:36.811
virgin as those this HR on don is in vocation of heaven,

405
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.600
means that once rescued from the wilderness,
the law,

406
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:45.520
both human and divine will again take effect and their story will have a happy

407
00:30:45.521 --> 00:30:49.960
ending once they have left that wild place of the Sierra Morina,

408
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.350
uh,
law will again take effect,
uh,

409
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:57.100
human and divine law.
Now,

410
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:03.930
Doterra is ogled in one of the most explicity and sophisticated erotic scenes in

411
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:08.590
the cohort that I hope you remember.

412
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:14.560
Like Cardenio little tear is first a voice heard by the barber,

413
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:18.310
the priest and Caledonia who laments her fate.

414
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.540
She is sound before she's a visible body and she will be,

415
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.030
she will become a very visible body.

416
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.190
Indeed central.

417
00:31:30.191 --> 00:31:34.050
Remember has left to fetching donkey haughty and [inaudible].

418
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.180
The priest and the barber discover the beautiful Doterra in a shady spot washing

419
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:45.190
her feet in a brook.
She's disguised as a farmhand,

420
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.180
but soon by spreading her gorgeous blonde hair,

421
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:53.410
she reveals herself as a very beautiful young woman.

422
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.520
Her beautiful harmonious body is seen in stages by the men who spying on her

423
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.240
without being seen.

424
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.870
The pleasure of voyeurism is not just seen but not being seen.

425
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.880
Doterra is the object of a converging gazes that process her by parts first and

426
00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:27.370
insistently and fetishistic Lee her feet.

427
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.560
You have all,
I'm sure even in your youthful,
uh,

428
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.550
heard about foot fetishes.

429
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:42.590
When I was a graduate student at Yale,
there was a foot kisser in the library.

430
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.370
A guy who,
who,
uh,
came,
uh,

431
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.900
if a woman was sitting at one of these desks that have a front like this,

432
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:54.380
but nothing underneath,
he would come up and take her shoe off,

433
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:59.120
kiss her foot and runaway.
And,
um,
this,

434
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.830
I don't know if he was ever caught,

435
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.140
but there was a warning about a foot kisser and sterling memorial library.

436
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.840
I tell you the stories that you remember,
or,
uh,
uh,
of,
uh,

437
00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.950
Donald Tests,
uh,
feet.

438
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.560
They're desiring gazes cut the body in parts.

439
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:20.930
If Violin at violent act of possession,

440
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.960
Dorothea who has an ensemble and bodies.

441
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.960
Perfect beauty is consumed by the men looking at her in pieces.

442
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.760
She is a version of Diana in Greek mythology and also Sinai in the book of

443
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:39.761
Daniel Women who were observed naked by voyeuristic men in Roman mythology.

444
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:46.820
Diana was the goddess of the hunt being associated with wild animals and

445
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:49.970
woodland and also of the moon.
Uh,

446
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.980
along her main attributes.
Uh,

447
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:58.360
Diana was an emblem of chastity oak groves where especially sacred to her if her

448
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:03.710
figure in art appears accompanied by a deer.

449
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:06.380
This is because Diana was the patroness of hunting.

450
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.340
The deer may also offer a covert reference to the myth of Actaeon Actaeon who

451
00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:16.130
saw her bathing naked.

452
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:23.570
Deanna transformed that down into a stag and set his own hunting dogs to tear

453
00:34:23.921 --> 00:34:26.170
him apart.
This is the,
uh,

454
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.020
Susannah or Shoshana.
Lily is one of the additions to the book of Daniel,

455
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:37.520
uh,
accepted by the Catholic and eastern Orthodox churches.

456
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.900
As the story goes,

457
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.960
that beautiful Hebrew wife is falsely accused by literals wires.

458
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.490
Uh,
she bathes in her garden,

459
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.260
having sent her attendance away to lusty elders,

460
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:56.480
secretly observed the lovely Susannah when she makes her way back to her house.

461
00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:01.610
They are cost her threatening to claim that she was meeting a young man in the

462
00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:05.810
garden unless she agrees to have sex with them.

463
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.520
She refuses to be black males and he's arrested and about to be put to death for

464
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:12.560
promiscuity.

465
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.590
When a young man named Daniel interrupts the proceedings and after,

466
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:21.720
uh,
and he finally gets the,
uh,
the two,
uh,

467
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.740
old men to contradict each other when he cross examines them and they are,

468
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.340
uh,
they are executed.
And,
uh,
so,
uh,

469
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:36.260
virtue who triumphs.
But the crucial image here is that,
uh,

470
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.110
uh,

471
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:41.730
Susana being observed ogled by the two men,

472
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:47.010
the two old men and of acting on looking at the naked a Beijing.

473
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.173
Um,

474
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:53.010
so this is what is behind this beautiful,
uh,

475
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:58.230
uh,
seen,
uh,
that I,
uh,
uh,

476
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.560
point you to inpatient to a 30 of your,
uh,

477
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.790
translation.
It is,
uh,
uh,

478
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.540
too long for me to read completely.

479
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.520
But just remember that they come,
these are Gardenia,

480
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.893
the priest.

481
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:20.610
And the Barber's Andrew is not within the three men are looking at her.
And uh,

482
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:25.650
uh,
they drew near,
so silently,

483
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:29.580
uh,
that he remember,
uh,
they think he's a,

484
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:31.770
he did not hear them,

485
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.260
nor was he intent upon anything but washing his feet,
which were,

486
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.690
which were such that they seem to be two pieces of pure crystal growing among

487
00:36:39.691 --> 00:36:41.400
the other pedals of the brook.

488
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.840
They stood in admiration of the whiteness and beauty of the feet,

489
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.880
which did not sustained,

490
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.970
which did not seem to them to be made for breaking clots or following the plow

491
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.550
as an owner's dressed might have persuaded them.
They were,

492
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.030
I'm finding there were not perceived.

493
00:36:59.031 --> 00:37:02.180
The priest who went foremost made signs to be able to,
to,

494
00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:06.720
to crouch low or hide themselves behind some of the rocks,
thereabouts,

495
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.020
which they accordingly date on,
stood up,
serving attentively,

496
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.460
attentively that the,
what the youth was doing.
And then he goes on to describe,

497
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:19.260
uh,
how,
um,
uh,
the doterra washes her,

498
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:24.200
her feed,
how her hands are beautifully,
uh,
White,
uh,
and,

499
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:29.210
uh,
on her hair cascades down to the point that it,
uh,
it,
uh,

500
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:33.960
makes a polo envious,
I'm going to say in,
in,
in a minute.
Uh,

501
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.940
uh,
eventually,
uh,
uh,
they,
they discover,
uh,

502
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.080
to her who they are on the scene and schools.
Um,

503
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.293
this is,
uh,

504
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:50.580
this is a scene that could be a renaissance painting.

505
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.163
And in fact,

506
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:57.170
Cervantes was well acquainted with Italian renaissance painting for us,

507
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:01.940
you know,
having read in the case books,
Atlantis spent,
uh,

508
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:07.410
a good deal of time in Italy and professor Frederick Data Mass Frederick,

509
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.770
they added or of Eurasia,

510
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:14.780
Chicago has written two books about the impression that Italian art made on

511
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.600
Cervantes and the,
uh,

512
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.980
imprint that these impressions left in his work.

513
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:26.490
And this is obviously one of those,
uh,
why,

514
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:30.840
why is there a version of the classical and Biblical myth?
It is,

515
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:35.370
it is a renaissance move.
Uh,
as I said,
where on the part of Cervantes,

516
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.920
this background enhances the figure.

517
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.450
He didn't hazards to figure to have her be a version of a classical myths.

518
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:48.580
It adds to her beauty and to the prestige of the creation.

519
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.060
And also it shows that art can make a depressant or a present scene be like a

520
00:38:58.451 --> 00:38:59.860
classical myth.

521
00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:04.930
And this is crucial to understand why the scene is so much.

522
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.520
Uh,

523
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.520
like those renaissance paintings don't test beauty shines through her course and

524
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:18.550
cross dressing a uncross gendering dress.
In fact,

525
00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:23.410
it is enhanced by it.
The contrast,
the HMIS lead anticipation.

526
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:26.830
You begin to see what you think is a male.

527
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.100
And suddenly as the person these robes,

528
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:35.130
it begins to show a female fish features and the graduate revelation of body

529
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:40.210
parts.
Uh,
these are all we erotic moves,

530
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:45.100
a gradual,
uh,
uh,
revelation of the body.

531
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.000
Transvestism is ramping in the Sierra Morina as you may have noticed.

532
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.910
First the breeze dresses as a princess.

533
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:56.650
Then the barber puts on the dress when the priest becomes a little squeamish.

534
00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.030
Here we have characters in drag ogling characters in drag.

535
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.430
The Barbara dressed as a woman,

536
00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:06.160
looks upon the beautiful daughter who is dressed like a man.

537
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.320
What does it all mean?
It suggests that in the disorder,

538
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:16.790
in the disordered world over the woods of this sexuality is so primal that it

539
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:23.350
empty seats,
gender distinctions.
It is a form of generalized desire.

540
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.040
Transvestism dusters rampant in the Sierra Morina.
Um,

541
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.930
when the priest,
uh,
addresses dot Altair later,

542
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:39.520
he simply tells her that she can claim to be whatever she wants to be man or

543
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:40.354
woman,

544
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.710
meaning that she can use feminine or masculine endings and pronounce a Spanish

545
00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:47.440
allows for gender distinctions in the speaker.

546
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.480
Dear Madame or dear sir or whatever your pleasure,

547
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.100
whatever you pleased to be.
This is what the translation says.
Uh,

548
00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:00.010
that is this Bob Lavalle.
This,
uh,

549
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.420
area in the wilderness is a place so far outside the law,

550
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:09.870
the genders have yet to be defined and it is even pre grammatical in the sense

551
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:15.250
that it's before these endings can determine or express gender.

552
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.690
This is suggested by the locals.

553
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.760
Avenal remember I've discussed the locals Aminos for the pleasant place before.

554
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:30.480
Like the one we found Rosie Nantais was aroused by the mayors after the Marcella

555
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.560
[inaudible] episode.
The locals are Manos,
Eh,

556
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.410
which is the perfect side for Amaryllis exchange,

557
00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:41.510
enhances [inaudible] appeal.
There are light and shade patterns.

558
00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:46.400
There's water,
uh,
that reflects on this torch.
It was,

559
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:50.480
uh,
uh,
a place,
uh,
according to translation.

560
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.830
It was a place,
uh,
through which the run a little smooth stream,

561
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:59.510
cool unpleasantly shaded by some Brocks and neighboring trees.
Uh,

562
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.470
the waters of the book's full of reflections and refractions that are,
uh,

563
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:04.670
that repeat on this thought.

564
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.260
Her image increase her erotic appeal first or feeding the water looked like

565
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.940
pieces of glass as transparent as the water itself.
Later,

566
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:16.490
her hands acquired of whiteness of snow.

567
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.940
Her golden hair would provoke the MV of a Polos of Apolo.

568
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.970
These are symmetries and reflections concurrent with the larger ones concerning

569
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:34.220
the various characters and plot stamp as the strengths and trying to establish

570
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:38.720
here the relationship between these locals or Menos on what takes place in it

571
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:42.110
and the overall pattern of these stories.

572
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:46.910
All of these episodes are made of correlations between the plot,
the characters,

573
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:51.380
the settings,
and the scenes.
Though doterra is a relative opposite of Lucinda,

574
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.050
who is arrested aristocratic but has little money.

575
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.090
Dorothea is rich but not uninstall.

576
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.180
Cratic Doterra is also kind of Daniel's counterpart,

577
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:03.770
loss as she is in the solitudes of the woods fleeing this guy's from her fate,

578
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:09.020
symmetries and order.
Contrast with the disorder caused by the best.

579
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:13.450
Tillandsia Amorosa,
the Amaryllis pettiness that donkey halt,

580
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.480
the donkey health Quixote spoke about in the speech of the Golden Age that

581
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.000
imagined golden age.
And this locals,

582
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:25.030
our manuals are shown to be a shown to be artifices that conceal desire in

583
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:29.660
assemblance of order,
but ultimately cannot contain,

584
00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.220
contain it and violence and Soules.

585
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:38.930
So I want you to have clear in your mind the what is at stake here in this local

586
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.210
some manuals and it is a violent,
uh,
uh,

587
00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.320
not overtly violent,
but it's violent,

588
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:50.120
a procession of Galatia by the gaze of these men.
Uh,
uh,

589
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.410
and the relationship that all of this has with the overall pattern of the

590
00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:57.050
stories that I am analyzing here.

591
00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:02.060
[inaudible] hurts her feet when she tries to flee barefoot and over the rocky

592
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:04.640
ground.
She's physically wounded

593
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:11.000
as she was when she lost her virginity to Fernando.
Uh,
and,
uh,

594
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:14.590
she was almost wounded again when she was,
uh,
uh,

595
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.390
the servant tried to rape her and she,
he threw her,

596
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:22.330
she threw him over a cliff.
We don't know if he's dead,
uh,

597
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:27.380
and later when her employer tried to seduce her,
these are dangerous woods.

598
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.800
Um,
so the,

599
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.060
the story of Kardinia Lucinia Fernando and Dorothea is told from at least two

600
00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:38.470
perspectives mucker Daniels under hotels.

601
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.410
It is also total in various moments and with the attendant interruptions that

602
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:44.250
are,
have been mentioning,

603
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:49.530
all is assembled under the umbrella of the main story to get don Quixote out of

604
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:51.660
the Sierra Morena and back home.

605
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.840
The stories are all United by the theme of love,

606
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.830
but considered at many different levels.

607
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.510
Now we move on to the,
uh,

608
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.620
hilarious invention of Princess Mikami corner by the priest.

609
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:10.650
And this whole episode,
uh,
uh,

610
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.230
conceived to try to get Don Quixote,
uh,

611
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:19.310
back home by inventing a fictional devalued romance in which we'll take him back

612
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:25.230
to his village because to,
to reach the,
the,
uh,
uh,

613
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.490
kingdom,
uh,
of comicon.

614
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:32.370
He will have to according to the story to tell him go about his village.
So

615
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:38.400
don't test story as prince's Mikami Kona is a translation of a real situation.

616
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.870
Javier Arrow put his name there so they can be,
you know,

617
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.760
he's a good friend of mine with whom I agree and disagree.
Always respectfully.

618
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.610
He summarizes the situation.

619
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:55.611
Dus brings me Colby corner of the Kingdom of [inaudible] is the daughter of

620
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.160
magician,
magician king,
the nok Rio,

621
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:03.870
the wise man and the Queen Hermia by means of his science.

622
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.070
The king finds out that someday the princess would be an orphan or a terrible

623
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:12.930
giant panda.
Philando.
They our first [inaudible] whom we have met before,

624
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.760
so called big o because he's queens to frighten people will assert the kingdom.

625
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.230
The king further prophesied that only one night could defeat the giant,

626
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.940
the famous Spaniard [inaudible] dilemma.

627
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:30.030
That's the synopsis that have you had,
gives us,
there is substance,

628
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.170
there is substance to characters invented by characters.

629
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.980
That is [inaudible] vista and business Mikami corner antenataly.

630
00:46:40.851 --> 00:46:42.930
Otherwise all characters invented by,

631
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.960
by the priest and performed by Doterra.

632
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.090
So this,
these characters,
uh,

633
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:56.130
invented by characters or acquire substance within the fiction.

634
00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:58.350
They are Metta fictional characters.

635
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.473
Now,

636
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.840
a panda Filando Purnaa philanders name suggests lost.

637
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.130
He is a Pan Philanderer who says what is a philanderer?

638
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.560
Philander is a man who has many love affairs.

639
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.960
So Penn generalized Philanderer,

640
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:26.400
actually if you go back to the Greek is lover of man,
but Pan Philanderer.

641
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.860
He is a pan lover.

642
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:33.160
The persistent recidivist insistent,
prolific lover.

643
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.890
This is [inaudible] giant.

644
00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:38.340
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

645
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.600
<v 0>the name Nico me Kona is at first glance funny,
it sounds funny,</v>

646
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.970
but it has several restaurants.
It has to do with monkeys.

647
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:52.620
She is from call me,
come the Kingdom of monkeys.

648
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.970
Mono is the most common word for monkey in Spanish,

649
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.650
but Mikko means monkey in a more general way.

650
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.990
What do monkeys do?
Monkey see,
monkey do.

651
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.280
Monkey is imitate humans in a comical way,

652
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.320
only form not substance.
So they are like parodies of us.

653
00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.400
If you've been to the zoo,

654
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:21.330
just stand in front of the of the monkey cage and you'll see that they make

655
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:26.640
there seem to be making fun of us by imitating us indirectly.

656
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.550
Uh,
humorously,
the issue of me,

657
00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:32.060
Macy's is brought up here by Cervantes.
Me.

658
00:48:32.061 --> 00:48:35.220
Macy's was the renaissance doctrine of imitation,

659
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.100
imitation of the classics,

660
00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:45.330
the mutation of the classic models to come closer to the imitation of reality.

661
00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:47.490
Me,

662
00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:52.490
Macy's has to do with the rep breaths and you can hear his etymological

663
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.770
relatives to mimic the mine and memetic.

664
00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.730
So,
and one can hear even a faint echo of me,

665
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:04.330
Macy's in Mikko me Kona,
but,

666
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:09.390
but Mico Macona here means that she is from the Kingdom of monkeys of a kingdom

667
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:16.120
of representation,
a kingdom of parodies.
This is what this means.

668
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.770
[inaudible] is here.

669
00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:25.771
Also do see nails rival because Santo wants very badly for his master to marry

670
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:32.410
the princess so that he can get his kingdom gs.
A copy of Gucci now,

671
00:49:32.411 --> 00:49:35.980
or an echo of Lucy now,
who's,
uh,

672
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.900
remember the Dulcinea and,
and uh,
uh,

673
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.050
Dorothea Ryan,
uh,

674
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:50.770
now they don't see now who now appears is the one that Sangio makes up in his

675
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:53.890
lie about his visit to her.

676
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:58.180
Remember the kind of brawny smelly.
Do see Neha,

677
00:49:58.181 --> 00:50:01.650
who gives him a piece of cheese,
he gets it up next to her and he says,
oh,
Geez,

678
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.110
Paul.
And uh,
she smells and okay,
Hill does this.

679
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.600
How could you smell?
You were probably married yourself on San Jose.
Yeah,

680
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:14.770
it could be because I smelled like that sometimes.
Uh,
it was all very funny.

681
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.540
But why essential tell in the light?

682
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.250
Because he's Saint Joe once Don Quixote to marry the princess.

683
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:25.180
So he's trying to bring goose in there down to make her look bad.

684
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:29.700
But Don Quixote is deterred.
This says,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Uh,

685
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.940
you must have this,
uh,
this wrong.
Uh,

686
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:39.080
now,
so remember that Donald Tan Lucinia rhyme,

687
00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:44.310
which underscores the relationship that they have at these very heavy now meta

688
00:50:44.321 --> 00:50:47.210
fiction or level to see these.
This is the mentor of fictional level,

689
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.300
what the characters are creating,
what the priest is creating,
what McCormick,

690
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.140
what Dota is creating by representing,

691
00:50:54.141 --> 00:50:58.640
by performing the story on what sanctuary is creating with his life.

692
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.850
Now we know now what is behind the live central light.

693
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.930
Remember all of these stories always have something behind them or always

694
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:06.800
telling another story.

695
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:11.801
The story being told here is that central once don Quixote to marry the

696
00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:14.450
princess,
become econ and not to marry the scenario.

697
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.550
So he's trying to make her look bad.

698
00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:22.360
There is another rhyming echo here that reveals to what extent,

699
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.610
uh,
the story that Dorothea is telling.

700
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.020
Is it a version of her own a predicament?

701
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.640
Bon Daffy,

702
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:36.641
Lando Fair Nando Banda Filando Fair Nando.

703
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:42.490
So you'll see there is a connection here and,
uh,

704
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:46.610
oral clinician connection between the two,
uh,
uh,

705
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:51.050
characters.
So,
uh,
uh,
this is,

706
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.940
uh,
this character who's lost four,
uh,

707
00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:00.340
and that,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

708
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.760
read or we'll claim,
uh,
later.
Uh,

709
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:07.550
stance is an allegory of lust itself.

710
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.330
Now,
at one point,

711
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:15.950
nearly everybody here is in this guys.

712
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.920
Some men have been in drag playing various roles.

713
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:25.700
Even sanctuary is playing the role of the squire of a bogus night.
Aaron,

714
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.710
the deep Western about this episode,

715
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:33.170
we just made a fictional levels.

716
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:37.400
He said about the theatricality of life.

717
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:44.020
This is where the Quixote leads us again to ask questions that are pertinent and

718
00:52:45.351 --> 00:52:49.940
relevant to our lives.
Is leaving,
is leaving the playing of roles?

719
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:56.470
Are we characters in somebody else's fiction as these characters are here?

720
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.420
And if so,
for instance,
are we bound by ethics?

721
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:05.150
If we are just mere characters in somebody is fiction.

722
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:11.530
There are stories within stories creating the infinitely receding sequence that

723
00:53:11.811 --> 00:53:13.340
I spoke about before.

724
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:19.330
We can lose track of the real end of the self in such a construct as I told you

725
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:22.400
a little boys used to do when they went to the barber shop.

726
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:27.120
And so all of these repeated images of themselves who,
where are you?
Who are you?

727
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:33.450
I have heard that under hypnosis we cannot be made to do anything that goes

728
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.200
against our sense of values,
against our morals.

729
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:38.581
However,

730
00:53:38.581 --> 00:53:43.581
in dreams we do transgress principles and engage in this wish fulfillment

731
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:50.810
fantasies in which we transgress principles.

732
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:56.120
Freud's interpretation of dreams published in 1900 suggests and has suggested

733
00:53:58.321 --> 00:54:00.540
for the 20th century and Anna,
uh,

734
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:05.080
an analog for literature and for this levels of friction.

735
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.340
One of those literature,
Stan,
Stan,

736
00:54:08.341 --> 00:54:13.341
among all of these states of mind in his own madness,

737
00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:17.610
don't in his own dream.
Don Quixote will go on with this madness.

738
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:22.290
We will continue to be mad and his dream in the stories that they make cup,

739
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:23.124
however,

740
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:27.480
Mikami Kona and Santo do tell their deeper desires and apprehensions.

741
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.650
The subconscious force is stronger than their will to lie.

742
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.600
They want to lie and they tell the truth.
Uh,
uh,
indirectly.

743
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.280
Uh,

744
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:44.520
these are the issues that this complex,
this complex of stories.

745
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.260
Uh,
uh,
so just

746
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:53.953
<v 1>no,</v>

747
00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:02.290
<v 0>let me talk for comic relief as we come to the end about,</v>

748
00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:07.310
and since we were talking about values and principles about an obscene passage

749
00:55:07.311 --> 00:55:08.144
in the Quixote

750
00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.830
[inaudible] Javiera claims that the rabble,

751
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:20.400
the tale that the barber burrows from the innkeeper's wife means her genitals

752
00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:25.300
and that the obscene reference to it leads to an identification of panda Filando

753
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:26.550
with the fallows,

754
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.010
hence donkey Haltech cuts off a,
follows the symbol of lost.

755
00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:37.580
I think that it is mostly just a dirty joke on the part of Cervantes who is

756
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:42.540
having fun with a keen reader that he imagines good.

757
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.220
Understand the obscenity behind this.

758
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.560
The innkeeper's wife says,
and I'm going to read it first in Spanish,

759
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:56.150
but Ami,
some tea water.
You remember that she did.

760
00:55:56.151 --> 00:56:00.860
They borrow that oxes tales that they have that she had where she kept her comb

761
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:02.270
so that the barber,

762
00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:06.650
the priests and the barber can make a beard and look different.

763
00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:13.650
But I [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] Merito Boriso swallows [inaudible]

764
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:25.690
then we went our cola
by my faith,

765
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:29.710
this is Jarvis.
You shall use my tail no longer for a beer.

766
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.670
Give me my tail again for my husband's thing is dust up and down.

767
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.920
That it is a shame.
I mean the comb,
I used to stick in my good tail

768
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:47.380
and rental reits,
I think,
uh,
overinterpreting with your friend.

769
00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.740
This is then the extended joke.

770
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:54.910
The Barber has taken away the innkeeper's wife tail into which the innkeeper

771
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:57.370
used to put his thing.
This is just translation.

772
00:56:57.371 --> 00:57:01.810
Little also referred to us as comb.
When the Barbara gave it back to her,

773
00:57:01.811 --> 00:57:02.680
she complained that it,

774
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.300
it is completely spoiled that it has lost his hair and that it will not serve

775
00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:09.030
any longer for what her husband used.

776
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.810
It have read or continues as we are going to show immediately,

777
00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:15.610
but I will spare you his proofs.

778
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:20.890
Tail rubber or cola means the loans both male and female genitals and so the

779
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:24.550
artist cool and beard has a similar meaning.

780
00:57:24.551 --> 00:57:27.970
Cervantes has created with this multiplicity of obscure meanings.

781
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.670
I don't think they were your secure at Constellation,

782
00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:36.350
the constellation of sexual images which are finally conveyed on the giant

783
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:41.350
himself.
I can't go there with her yet.
I think that the joke is very clear.

784
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:44.860
I don't think it's very obscure.
It's very clear and it's very funny.

785
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.060
I don't see how it can be extended to the giant however,
but one wonders,

786
00:57:49.061 --> 00:57:53.710
Wine Cervantes included this obscene joke in the text.

787
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:58.060
As I said,
I think he's just having fun with a reader who could pick it up.

788
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:05.190
Now the story's sub stories and interruptions in relation to memory.

789
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.740
Bring to mind.
Going back to the beginning of my lecture today,

790
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:13.210
bring to mind the issue of Cervantes says oversights,

791
00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:17.770
particularly the one about sanctuary,
stolen donkey.
What does it mean?

792
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.060
Perhaps that creation is the floor product of memory.

793
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:26.170
One critic has suggested,
as I believe I said before,

794
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:29.320
that's Advantis included errors in decky halted purposely.

795
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:34.690
I doubt it because he did try desperately to fix them within months.

796
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:40.450
But the errors are consistent with certain characteristics of the Quixote,

797
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:46.050
just improvisation and the faculty and the faulty improvisation on the faulty or

798
00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:55.171
creative nature of memory by making mistakes we create deviating from model for

799
00:58:57.131 --> 00:59:02.110
I'm saying is that the mistakes of memory as we've seen in the story is told by

800
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:04.120
the characters are creative.

801
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:10.770
What is the value of the subtexts to use that word that we found beneath the

802
00:59:10.811 --> 00:59:15.670
story's being told like the one about,
um,

803
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.780
uh,
doterra's predicament and the one that,
uh,

804
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.140
Cardinia was really telling to learn that sometimes,

805
00:59:24.141 --> 00:59:29.120
perhaps all the time as story is the deflected version of another.

806
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.763
So what,

807
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:36.910
so the pleasure lies in the gradual discovery of the story within the story as

808
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:40.700
with the entire Quixote.

809
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:46.690
All this has to do with the nature of narrative and with the nature of

810
00:59:47.121 --> 00:59:50.540
literature,
the multilayer discourse,

811
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:55.750
who's just is precisely it's hidden meanings that surface in odd ways.

812
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:03.620
Why didn't sit around this embed these stories about [inaudible] are up there

813
01:00:03.621 --> 01:00:08.150
and don't Fernando within the overall story of a guilty,
did he,

814
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:12.800
did he think that they or the main story could not stand on their own?

815
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.540
The stories are reflections of the main story as we have seen both in their

816
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:22.160
themes and by their inner structures,
the characters create other characters.

817
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:24.350
The stories are broken up on started again,

818
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.350
many characters display some sort of madness.

819
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:29.890
They are like mirror images of Don Quixote.

820
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:35.290
Mostly I believe Cervantes was searching for a way to create a new Java.

821
01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.080
He did not know yet which that would allow for this admixture the sequential

822
01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:47.990
plot of the Valerie Grumman's,
the multistory,
uh,
uh,

823
01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.820
kind of book produced by,
uh,

824
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:54.760
the Italians and new Java that would allow for,

825
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:58.760
for this admixture of main story.
And dependent or lateral stories.

826
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.060
And he did create it.
He created,
uh,

827
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:06.250
what came to be known as the novel by doing this now beyond literature,

828
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:12.611
the most significant idea behind this intermingling and the errors is to pass

829
01:01:12.871 --> 01:01:15.530
it.
That memory is the self,

830
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.160
that the self is memory with all its flaws and its holes and its gaps.

831
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.350
Remember that the novel,

832
01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.780
the Quixote begins with a willful act of forgetting that village in [inaudible]

833
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:38.590
whose name that narrator does not want to remember.
