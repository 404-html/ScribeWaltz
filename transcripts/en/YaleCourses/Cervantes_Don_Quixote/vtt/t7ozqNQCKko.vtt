WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.130
As we approach the end of the semester,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.720
we also naturally approach,
uh,
the end of the Quixote.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.630
And,
uh,
we,
we,

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.690
we move on to the consideration of other works of his as well as reactions to

5
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:24.000
his works by two major writers,
uh,
Golf Gotland border.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.860
So that'll be a next Thursday.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.860
Uh,
today I,
uh,

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.790
I will talk about the end of the great novel.

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.510
Our next class I will devote to those other works and also to serve.

10
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.660
This is death.
Uh,

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.500
but before I want to address two topics that have a sort of fallen by the

12
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:51.510
wayside,
um,

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830
humor on a savant.

14
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.850
This is a self portraits following my little essay in the casebook.

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.340
Dot.
You have presumably,
uh,
red,
uh,

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.290
other than slapstick,
uh,

17
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.020
on this slapstick kind of of humor that we find occasionally in the Quixote,

18
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.440
in the
episodes of the Indian part,

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.000
one for instance,

20
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.480
as well as some of the scatological instances,
churches,

21
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.360
the time when Santra defecates in the fueling hammers episode.

22
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.490
So this humorous is broader,
more encompassing,

23
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.600
sophisticated,
and it's,
uh,
it is laced with irony.

24
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.220
My irony,
I mean that there is a benign,

25
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:49.221
that attachment and discreet perspective from which humanity is being seen in

26
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:56.691
contrast to the mat hero don't get Hotez madness allows the narrator and the

27
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:04.530
reader to appreciate everyone's a folly.

28
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.180
Uh,
no one is safe.
Uh,
not the priest,

29
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530
the Duke graduates like Samsung Carrasco and not even the narrator himself.

30
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.590
Sanchez wisdom is another measure by which to judge other characters,

31
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.420
presumably better educated.
He is not just the wise fool.

32
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.300
Funny,
uh,
for the funny,

33
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.050
a man who stumbles upon truths by chance,

34
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.930
but the processor of natural,
uh,

35
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.960
reason which allows him to be right when others who are well-read are wrong.

36
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.750
I believe that the one who best encapsulate it surrenders his humor was the late

37
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.770
Lowery Nelson who was a professor for many years here at Yale.

38
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.080
He writes in his Savantas a collection of critical essays.
In the introduction,

39
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:10.081
he writes the following and you have a handout in which to follow my reading of

40
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.280
this,
uh,
quotation,

41
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.600
the one sign Lowery Nelson Jr

42
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.490
as the pictures of the human condition,

43
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.550
both Shakespeare and sell Vantis belonged to the select company.

44
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.430
Of those I would call universal ironist as distinct from 10 dentures from 10

45
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.990
dentures,
irony lists,

46
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.430
universal ironist contemplate the world with a kind of gentle resignation and

47
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:46.801
compassion in full knowledge of both the grand jurors and mysteries of human

48
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.410
life.
Among them,
uh,

49
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.180
I would number Chaucer checkoff CAFCA is available.

50
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.400
It is available then dentures ironist view the world from a programmatic stance,

51
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.610
connoting accusation,

52
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.970
bitter protest and Melia wrist reformation of human ills.

53
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.640
Miliaria meaning to make better among them.

54
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:16.540
I would include Florida,
Ipsen hardy and man.

55
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.130
The distinction is only approximate,
but nonetheless significant.

56
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.690
Neither attitude is qualitative,

57
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.800
qualitatively superior or justifiable.

58
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.600
Though it is perhaps the universal ironist who can view mankind with greater

59
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:33.370
tolerance and understanding,

60
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.090
it is he who can encompass a broader span of human types and human experiences.

61
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.100
It is he who can best present the inviolability and unique essence of the

62
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:47.710
particular and the individual.

63
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.810
It is precisely this ability in Shakespeare and said Avantis to create

64
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.080
particularized essence that leads us their readers to draw the general

65
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:03.160
conclusion,
to see the individual as representative.

66
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.480
Hence,

67
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.480
the seeming plenitude of humanity we find in such odd and peculiar figures as

68
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.110
don't be haughty and central Japan,

69
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.460
not to mention Samsung Carrasco the curate Marcella,

70
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.870
he nest the [inaudible] and Alice

71
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.550
particularized incident.
Essence means here I think,
uh,

72
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.700
that individual objects and specially characters are food within themselves in

73
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:38.620
there being the round.

74
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.580
This is why details are so important in the Quixote by the plenitude of

75
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.220
humanity.
Nelson means the foibles,
weaknesses,

76
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.310
and also the grand juror of these fingers.
I see,

77
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:53.270
says their mistakes there.

78
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.950
Bumps against the real are funny and counterbalance.

79
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.970
They're virtuous.

80
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.780
I only resides in the fulcrum where the two are added to each other.

81
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.710
We thought counseling each other with respect to Shakespeare though though I

82
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.930
agree with Nelson.
Uh,

83
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.190
I want to reiterate what I have said in previous classes.

84
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.800
There is a level of despair in his,
uh,
place,

85
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.100
uh,
that is never reached.

86
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Instead Avantis Savantas has a gentler perspective on the human condition and a

87
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:35.750
more optimistic one.
Uh,

88
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:40.751
I'm thinking of course of hamlet and I'm thinking of course of King Lear

89
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.350
so much for humor,
although much more code.

90
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.290
And I should have been said throughout the semester.

91
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.130
Now as for the self portraits,

92
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540
I included those texts because as I explain in the book the format of the case

93
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:08.990
book called for an interview with the author in question.

94
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.090
And since Advantis personnel available,
uh,

95
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.350
I thought that it would be,
uh,
uh,

96
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.470
best to include these texts that would make a good substitute.

97
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.910
I toyed with the idea of inventing an interview.

98
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.260
We said Advantis,

99
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.480
but I didn't think I could get it past the editors had a very staid and cereals

100
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.650
Oxford University press.
Um,

101
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.040
the things I would like you to remember from my,
uh,

102
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.070
little prologue or these that individualism led to portraiture in the

103
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:49.010
renaissance and also is,
uh,

104
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.640
that was also aided and helped by wealth,

105
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.930
that perspective and developing of perspective.

106
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.931
Think of Alberti of whom I have mentioned many times along the semester allowed

107
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:07.520
for a more realistic particularized kind of portrait,

108
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.440
showing significant details of the face and body.

109
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.460
Not all necessarily flattering,
although of course those who paid for the,

110
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.691
uh,

111
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:22.691
for the portraits wanted to be flattered that the first self portrait by a

112
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:28.841
painting that we know of was Albert Uva in which he shows he's piercing eyes and

113
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:36.050
fine hand the instrument of his craft

114
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.440
and that this self portrait announcers anticipates is better.

115
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.680
The one of Alaska's in Las Meninas where he appears in a prominent position full

116
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:53.891
of energy and self assurance in the act of painting.

117
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.040
Then there are the concomitant self portraits by Cervantes,

118
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.710
uh,
which are characteristically self deprecating.

119
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.530
Uh,
in one he talks about his,
uh,

120
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.700
the changing color of his hair.

121
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.500
In another he talks about his missing teeth and so forth.

122
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.290
So he,
he's,
he's,
he's self deprecating,

123
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:24.291
particularly with regards to the effects of time on his body.

124
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

125
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.550
<v 0>What I would add today,
uh,</v>

126
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.580
is that we should see those self portraits in relation to the 1605,

127
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.160
a prologue to the Quixote Cervantes Self,

128
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.710
uh,
presentation as author.

129
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.220
It is certainly different from Velazquez,
uh,

130
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.120
who's much more self assured and self promoting obesity.

131
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.540
But perhaps it is,

132
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.890
this is the effect of the different mediums that they are using,

133
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:01.650
painting and literature,

134
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.360
but most likely it is a difference in their personalities.

135
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.290
Now we get to Don Quixote's return home.

136
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.210
The novels plot with this repeated returns home suggests that life consists of

137
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:24.600
going and coming back,

138
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.680
sort of a compressed Elliot and these together and is made up of a series of

139
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.880
apparent repetitions,

140
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.510
ringing counters and help release both parts and with a return,

141
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.770
uh,
after a return home after a Sally actually there,

142
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.030
there are three returns,
it seems as if don't get halted.

143
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.580
The whole novel is suggesting that in fiction there are two basic plots,

144
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.180
one going out and the other one coming back,

145
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.390
one the Iliad and the other one,
the Odyssey.

146
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.480
That's too simplistic,

147
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:08.481
but there seems to be that suggestion in the combined two parts of the cohort.

148
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.310
<v 1>Okay,</v>

149
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.960
<v 0>what do these repetitions reveal?
What,
what do we learn from them?</v>

150
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.350
Perhaps not to live is to live again.

151
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.750
And that life includes the remembrance of life,

152
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.190
I suppose,

153
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:31.190
would discover and exploit over two centuries later in his great novel check.

154
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.320
Should you don't pedagogy remembers of things passed in English.

155
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.820
A great work that I hope you have the chance to read someday if you have it yet.

156
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:50.210
That is why we approach the end by returning to the beginning in the process.

157
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.890
Cervantes says,
once again,

158
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.100
underline that reality has become fictionalized in part two independent of Don

159
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.360
Quixote and that his own hero belongs to the grade fictions of the ages to the

160
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.310
great characters of ages have been mentioned in this.

161
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:19.800
And I will repeat it now.
Uh,
when I comment upon some,
uh,

162
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.750
uh,
passage,
uh,

163
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.640
said about this also in this return and I will go over it on the scores.

164
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.500
The nature of Don Quixote is victory,
which I,
uh,

165
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.930
mentioned in,
uh,

166
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.590
with regards to nes India need.

167
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.680
So as he returns,
okay,
what defines a character from the Apocryphal Quixote?

168
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.200
Don't Alvarado they terrify.
I have red nails,

169
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.760
Quixote and I can assure you that this character appears in that

170
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.380
it is as if he's memories had a life outside of himself in literature.

171
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.050
Cervantes is of course,
again poking fun at Area Neda.
Uh,

172
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.890
but the way he does is full of other suggestions.

173
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.660
As I mentioned in a previous class and I referred to the work by stiff at
Gilman.

174
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.860
The first and clearest is a don Quixote lives in a world of fiction

175
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.210
that intersects that over via Nader's,
uh,
fiction.

176
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:34.570
It is the ultimate proof that in this part to reality has become fictionalized.

177
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.310
As I mentioned earlier,
without the help of Don Quixote is fantasy.

178
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:44.311
It is out there already fictionalized characters from two different fictional

179
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:49.390
books,
meat and one asks the other to sign a document,

180
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.450
a,
uh,

181
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:57.490
and notarized document to testify that the booking which he appeared it was

182
00:13:57.491 --> 00:14:01.990
false and that he is the real one.
This is enormously funny.

183
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:05.440
At a very sophisticated level.
Uh,

184
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.220
the document is crucial,
uh,

185
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:16.590
as legality would be the ultimate way of guaranteeing that a fiction is real

186
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.750
serve.
Anthesis.

187
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.870
Perhaps remembering here the legal document out of which picker rescue fiction

188
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.383
issued.

189
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.490
Remember that I mentioned several times that the picaresque begins as the

190
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:38.350
position,
the legal document of a criminal addressing a judge.

191
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.480
And so this is not the end of [inaudible] because as you remember,

192
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.300
uh,
after Doki hotter regains his sanity,

193
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.840
he asks to be forgiven by [inaudible],

194
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.930
for having induced enticed him to write such a bad book.

195
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.250
So then they come to the last in,

196
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.880
remember we talked about the first in and now we get to the last in the first

197
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.110
in,
in part one,

198
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:13.220
remember with the prostitutes and the Fisher he served and all of that where

199
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:14.960
he's made a night.

200
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:20.130
Here we get to the last in which does not confused with a,
uh,

201
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.130
a castle anymore.
At the last end were don Quixote on central lodge.

202
00:15:25.131 --> 00:15:30.131
On the way back there room contains representations of Helen,

203
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:31.340
of Troy and Dido.

204
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:38.020
The passage I believe is one more example of services awareness,

205
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.740
uh,
of the importance of his creation.

206
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.140
This is some pages to ninth,

207
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.260
27,928 in the Jarvis translation and it goes as follows.

208
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.830
He was lodged in a ground room.
He know Quixote with paint,

209
00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.460
with painted search.

210
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.550
Search is a kind of base kind of cloth and not very instead of tapestry as it's

211
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:11.411
the fashion of country towns in one of the pieces was painted by a wretched

212
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:12.081
hand.

213
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:16.830
The rape of Helen when the daring guests carried her off from men,

214
00:16:16.831 --> 00:16:21.200
allows in another was the history of died on an s.

215
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680
She upon a high tower us making signals with have a bet half a bed sheet to her

216
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:32.531
fugitive guests who was out at sea flying away from her in a figured or

217
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.113
Brigantine.

218
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.410
He observed in the two history pieces that Helen went away with.

219
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:44.180
No very ill will for.
She was slightly laughing to herself,

220
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.310
but the beauteous Dido seem to let fall from her eyes.

221
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.080
Tears as big as one knots which don't be haughty.
Seeing.

222
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:59.081
He said these two ladies were most unfortunate in not being born in this age and

223
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:06.041
I above all men on happy that I was not born in theirs for her.

224
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:10.610
I encountered those gardens.
Neither Troy been burned.

225
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.220
Neither had Troy being burned,
nor Carthage.

226
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:16.400
Destroyed since by my killing Paris.

227
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.940
Only since by my killing Paris.
Only.

228
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:22.690
All these mischiefs had been prevented.

229
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.400
I hold a wager go Santo that here belonged.

230
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.820
There will not be either visualing house tavern in or barbershop in which the

231
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:39.050
history of our over exploits will not be painted,

232
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.090
but I could wish they may be done by the hand of a better painter done.

233
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.200
Uh,
uh,
he that did these and quotes,

234
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.790
anyone who has been to Spain,

235
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.780
especially to battery Bara hustles airport,

236
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.560
I'm very amused by the name of that airport all the time,

237
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:00.090
but I asked me is playing cards,

238
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.860
but Barbara has to simply the name of the town in which the airport was built.

239
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.990
Um,
any one who has been to Spain,

240
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:12.690
especially to my needs,
but our house airport,

241
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:16.710
no central has worn the wager for,

242
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:21.711
there are hundreds of painted and sculpted figurines of Doki hotel on central of

243
00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:29.070
every kind of for sale,
including mousepads for computers.

244
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.490
Believe me.
In fact,

245
00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:36.120
the statutes of Doki Hotel on central grace,
the plaza,

246
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:40.620
they Spania in Madrid.
If you have been to Madrid,

247
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:45.180
you have seen them.
I'm sure if you have not,

248
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:48.900
when you do,
you will go see them.
I'm sure too,

249
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.513
<v 2>uh,</v>

250
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.220
<v 0>we have several images of them.</v>

251
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.900
I believe that Spain is the only country in which there are statutes of

252
00:18:59.901 --> 00:19:02.000
fictional characters.

253
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.450
I don't think that there is a statue of the pilgrim in Dante's commedia in Italy

254
00:19:08.631 --> 00:19:12.770
as far as I know,
or hamlet in England.
As far as I know,

255
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.310
it's very,
it's quite remarkable.
Uh,

256
00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:20.690
such has been the identification of the Quixote with Spain,

257
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:25.880
Spanish culture and the Spanish language that has,
which we'll see a bit later,

258
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.500
some of its modern writers,

259
00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:30.260
some of the modern Spanish writers when I'm more know,

260
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.360
have even spoken of a religion of quick so autism really young.

261
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:36.370
They'll Quixote small.

262
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.873
<v 2>There we are.</v>

263
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.280
<v 0>Cervantes knew that his protagonist would be one with those of classical times.</v>

264
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.950
Heti assumption for an artist of the 16th and 17th century whose reverence for

265
00:20:06.921 --> 00:20:09.260
classical art was immense.

266
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.913
<v 2>Uh,</v>

267
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.870
<v 0>I don't know if we could of course foreseeing that there will be a statues of</v>

268
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:19.380
his,
of his protagonists in his town of Madrid.

269
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.210
Um,
it is a realization

270
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.310
that he hold the importance of,
of his characters in vertical,
particular them.

271
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.180
Kiata based on the accomplishment of his hero,

272
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:39.470
which as I have been saying is quite different from those of the likes of nes.

273
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:46.800
Don Quixote returns at conqueror of himself,

274
00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.490
says the Saint Joe as they enter their village.

275
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.570
And I quote now from,
uh,

276
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.240
our,
uh,
translation

277
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.980
page nine 33 open dine arms and receive likewise,

278
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.070
he's addressing the on named village as they come into the town.
Thy Son,

279
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:16.780
Don Quixote receive likewise dies son Don Quixote,

280
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.170
who if it comes conquered by another hand,

281
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.000
yet he comes a conqueror of himself,

282
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.180
which as I have heard him say,

283
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.160
is the greatest victory that can be desired,

284
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.810
unquote.
This is donkey hope,
this greatest triumph.

285
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.450
What does this mean?

286
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.500
I the most literal level,

287
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.100
it means that he has accepted his defeat at the hands of the night of the White

288
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.300
Moon,
uh,

289
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.620
gracefully and is willing to abide by the rules,

290
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.410
uh,
agreed upon before combat with,
uh,
with at night of the white moon.

291
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.900
Uh,
in that way he has conquered himself.

292
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.460
Uh,
but it may also mean what I have suggested,

293
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.320
uh,

294
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.360
that denied of the white moon is a reflection of donkey halter himself,

295
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:26.180
hence that he has vanquished,
been vanquished by his,
his,

296
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.480
his own protection by himself.

297
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.530
I think that more broadly speaking,
it means I don't,

298
00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:40.531
Quixote has come to know himself better and extend and accept himself for what

299
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:44.860
he is,
that he has vanquish with hin him,

300
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.110
his madness,
or he's about,

301
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.450
as we heard in the quotation about Helen and Dido,

302
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.840
this has not been quite accomplished yet.

303
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.480
He talks about the feeding Paris,

304
00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.980
but we have also seen that since the cave of Montesinos episode don't care how

305
00:23:05.231 --> 00:23:09.430
they as been dealing differently with reality and with himself.

306
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:14.970
So he's return is a triumphant one according to,
uh,

307
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.873
to Sanctu.

308
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.440
There is also an echo of here of the Greek Nova itself.

309
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.240
Uh,
but don't be haughty has,

310
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.060
has a vanquish himself because he has come to really know himself.

311
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.860
So we finally come to the end.
Uh,

312
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:41.010
we should begin by pondering why ends or endings are so important.

313
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:50.770
Let me summarize what Frank Kermode says in his beautiful book.

314
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.160
The sense of an ending from 1966 I will get to a long quotation from that book

315
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:03.881
that you have in a handout with the bibliographic information about the book by

316
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:06.410
Kermode.

317
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.410
By now his third Frank Kermode is an Englishman who was knighted by the Queen,

318
00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.290
uh,
an excellent critical,
the better,

319
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.150
perhaps the best Greek of the English language.
Although I see that,
uh,

320
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.403
uh,

321
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.950
tremor Rose Lee because if Harold bloom here is that I have said something like

322
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:27.470
that,
my life may be in danger.

323
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:36.310
Every time I leave this class or another class I encounter Harold bloom who

324
00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:39.370
yells at the top of his lungs hard robotic door.

325
00:24:39.371 --> 00:24:42.880
Here comes the second best critic at Yale,

326
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.600
meaning that he of course is the first to which I answer Harold.

327
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.550
We belonged to different generations and you belong to the one that is past.

328
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.600
There's a right to defend oneself
even from this night of the white moon.

329
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.670
All of us in the modern era.

330
00:25:09.671 --> 00:25:14.671
I think that we live in a world of crisis that is at the end of an epoch and the

331
00:25:17.221 --> 00:25:19.590
beginning of the next,
hence,

332
00:25:19.591 --> 00:25:24.591
we are keenly concerned with a sense of what we perceive as the impending end,

333
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.170
the sense that it can give to the past,

334
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.420
the sense that that end can give to the past

335
00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.480
and to the future.

336
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:40.010
The fictions that we create reflect this anxiety and are designed to show the

337
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.370
Concorde of the Midwest.
We just want to kermode a course,

338
00:25:44.371 --> 00:25:48.540
our condition man or women in the Midwest in the middle.

339
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:54.390
These mirrors that we inhabit,
a with the beginnings and ends,

340
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.503
uh,

341
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.230
these fictions in which there is this relationship between beginning and end.

342
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.280
Uh,
our kermode calls fictions of Concord.

343
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.580
There seems to be according to him,

344
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.560
human need to relate beginnings to end to ends.

345
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.680
Even if we are not religious believers or believers in secular versions of

346
00:26:19.501 --> 00:26:21.330
providence like Marxism,

347
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.390
providence from provi dead,

348
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:29.340
it means to a foresight to uh,

349
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.560
uh,
but most mostly providence means the care of a benevolent,

350
00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.840
uh,
uh,
God who guides our,
our,
our,
our lives and our steps.

351
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:44.100
Apocalypse is one of the fictions.
Concord,

352
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.390
it ends,
transforms and it's concordance.

353
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.000
Apocalypse is from the Greek to uncover,
uh,

354
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.730
which means revelation.
Hence the book of revelation.

355
00:26:56.731 --> 00:27:00.810
The last in the new testament prophecy is another form.

356
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.370
Uh,

357
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.750
it tells us the shape of the future connects the precedence with that end and

358
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:07.584
beyond.

359
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:13.190
We are born in the middle and according to Kermode to make sense of our span,

360
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.840
we need fictive Conchords with origins and ends.

361
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:23.160
So just give meanings.
Two lives and two poems.
I'm quote,

362
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.140
Millennia,
rhythm.
The end is near.

363
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.500
You have seen all of these uh,
uh,
cartoons.

364
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.520
What was the guy's holding the cardboard saying the end is near repent and so

365
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:41.460
forth.
Uh,
millennialism has to do with a thousand years,

366
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.870
uh,
uh,
with something lasting a thousand years.

367
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:51.290
Like those who believe that the end of the world would come in the year 1000 and

368
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.440
some,
even in the year 2000,
if you remember back in 2000,

369
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:57.450
there were all kinds of prophecies.
Of course,

370
00:27:57.451 --> 00:28:01.710
all these people who prophesied a are quick to recalculate.

371
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.540
If it doesn't happen,
they recalculate.

372
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.850
It wasn't in the year 1000 it was a since the death of Christ,

373
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.210
the thousand 33 I mean they always calculate recalculate.

374
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.520
The year 2000 came and went and we bought it.

375
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.140
Many people were waiting for all kinds of catastrophes to happen.

376
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.620
We asked them is another word you should remember.

377
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.003
<v 2>Okay.</v>

378
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.510
<v 0>[inaudible] from the Greek for 1000 if they believe that Christ will rise in a</v>

379
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.010
thousand years,
so we have beginning man or woman in the Middle East and end

380
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.870
on in the long quote that I will read now from Carol about,

381
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.780
this is how he explained it in a very charming way.

382
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.220
Let us take a very simple example.

383
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.550
The ticking of a clock.

384
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.480
We ask why did says and we agreed that it says tick tock.

385
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.950
Of course this is only in English.
In Spanish it goes

386
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.630
big duck [inaudible].
Since we are speaking English,

387
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.640
it's stick puck by this fiction.
We humanize it,

388
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:25.350
making it talk.
Our language,
of course it is.

389
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:28.320
We who provide the fictional difference between the two.
Sounds.

390
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:33.560
Take is our word for a physical beginning park our word for an end,

391
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.260
we say they differ.
What enables him to be different.

392
00:29:37.261 --> 00:29:40.150
It's a special kind of middle.
We can perceive it.

393
00:29:40.151 --> 00:29:42.280
You only when it is organized,

394
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.740
it can be shown by experiment that subjects who listened to rhythmic structure

395
00:29:46.741 --> 00:29:51.741
such as tick tock repeat identically repeated identically can reproduce the

396
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:55.810
intervals with within the structure accurately,

397
00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.080
but they cannot grasp spontaneously the interval between the rhythmic groups.

398
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.510
That is uh,
the rhythmic group is thick,
dark,
okay.

399
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.530
Each group is stick doc,
so they cannot,
uh,
uh,

400
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:16.590
as generally grasp the interval between rhythmic groups that he's between talk

401
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.640
and pick when the sec,
the,
the next group begins.
Okay.
They talk

402
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.560
the talk.
So Talk Dick.
Okay.

403
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.340
Anyone came in and listened to me now would certainly

404
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.180
conclude that I have gone bonkers.

405
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.250
That donkey hope,
this madness is really contagious.
Uh,

406
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.350
that first interval is organized and limited tick tock and the second is not

407
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:51.550
according to Paul phrase,

408
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.700
I don't know who it is that the Toc tic gap is analogous to the role of the

409
00:30:56.711 --> 00:31:01.711
ground and spacial perception after this is blurry and on differentiated.

410
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.060
Each is characterized by a lack of form against which the illusory organization

411
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:11.200
of shape and rhythm are perceived in the spacial or temporal object.

412
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.670
The fact that we call the second of the dual related sounds talk,

413
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.880
it's evidence that we use fiction to enable the end to confer organization and

414
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:25.120
form of temporal structure on temporal structure.

415
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.890
The interval between the two sounds between tick and talk is now charged with a

416
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:31.030
significant duration.

417
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.610
The clock tick tock I take to be the model for what we call a plot,

418
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.730
the plot or an organization that humanizes time by giving it form and the

419
00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:49.831
interval between talking tick represents purely successive disorganized time of

420
00:31:51.671 --> 00:31:53.740
the sword.
We need to humanize.

421
00:31:55.970 --> 00:32:00.970
That's the end of this stuff I think illustrative of a quotation,

422
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.600
so the end is meaning the end provides meaning and this is why it is so

423
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:07.834
necessary.

424
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.990
He goes on Kermode men in the Mideast make considerable imaginative investments

425
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.360
in coherent patterns,

426
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.500
which by the provision of an end make possible is satisfying consonance with

427
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:24.880
origins.
And with the middle,

428
00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:30.460
I'm quoting the plots of our poems plays and novels reflect that need for

429
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:35.410
significant endings.

430
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.790
So what is,
what is the significance of donkey hope,

431
00:32:41.791 --> 00:32:44.120
this ending or is it significant?

432
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.150
In the next to the last chapter,

433
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.900
sanctuary discards the omens that don Quixote sees in various things and events

434
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.920
as they come into the village omens,

435
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.910
which would connect the end of the novel with a future beyond it.

436
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.870
They are prophetic.
I'm calling from nine 34.

437
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:10.610
Mahlum signum malunion think signal.
This is Latin bad sign,

438
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:15.050
but sign a hair.
Floyd's dogs pursuer don't see now,

439
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.980
appears not.

440
00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:22.430
Says don't you hope they remember the hair that is running and uh,

441
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:27.320
under the Sandra actually catches because you're so tired,
so tired.
Um,

442
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.500
in the Spanish act actually says [inaudible],

443
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.430
uh,
uh,
Jarvis has given it to syntax,

444
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:39.760
which in Spanish it does not happen.
Uh,

445
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.660
the donkey healthy has abandoned syntax,
uh,
on,

446
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.051
uh,

447
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:49.970
appears to speak in tongues as if you were having a vision or a revelation,

448
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.840
which is what he's trying to find in this.

449
00:33:53.841 --> 00:33:57.830
And this bad omens is this Mullum signum that he sees.

450
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

451
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.100
<v 0>The incident shows that in his subconscious don Quixote is still in the world of</v>

452
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:09.101
dreams and of literature where this concourse ochre the prophetic would extend

453
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:14.420
that world for closing,
unending.
But as I said,

454
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:18.770
central dismisses but central dismisses this omens,
uh,
uh,

455
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.910
in a very wise way appealing to Christian doctrine.

456
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:28.490
It isn't as if [inaudible] himself where here wavering about how to end the

457
00:34:28.491 --> 00:34:31.740
novel,
but what is the meaning of the end?

458
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.920
Cervantes does give the novel.

459
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.520
There are in the Quixote three forms of potential closure,

460
00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:48.630
Cervantes closer to Quixote in three ways.
First,
donkey hope that is defeated.

461
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:53.670
Second,
he regains his sanity.
Third,
he dies.

462
00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:59.150
One could say that this scheme points were three part tide conception of reality

463
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.830
or of the worlds in which don't be hotel lifts with each form of closure

464
00:35:04.831 --> 00:35:09.831
corresponding to each of the three of giving you a handout with a kind of crass,

465
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.200
primitive representation of these three worlds as concentric circles that I've

466
00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:19.830
made myself.
And uh,
and this is why,
and it shows it,

467
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.120
but I hope that it is clear enough.
First,

468
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.930
the fictional world of chivel re no Quixote is defeated.

469
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.370
This is the realm of books.
Second present day reality.

470
00:35:32.371 --> 00:35:36.720
Don't hope the returns to being alone.
Saki high.
No,
they're good.
Third,

471
00:35:36.721 --> 00:35:38.490
donkey holder dies.
Um,

472
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.180
presumably reaches the true reality that is the afterlife.

473
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:46.450
Hence life itself was like a fiction.
Uh,

474
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.610
indicted was the femoral and made up of things of dubious substance.

475
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:56.090
It's a self contained Merkel safe fiction of Concord at possible.

476
00:35:56.131 --> 00:36:01.131
Fourth form of closure at admit of fictional level would be the defeat of your

477
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.500
apocryphal.
But let us go over the city in more detail.

478
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.353
First,

479
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.160
the fictional world of chilvery don't get healthy is defeated by the night of

480
00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:15.490
the white moon.
Hence,

481
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.780
he's quest comes to an end within his madness and within the fiction of Geo

482
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.450
Valerie Romances.
But as I said in the last class,

483
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:29.430
and I said a few minutes ago,

484
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:34.350
there are signs that denied of the white moon is like a reflection of the call

485
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:39.370
to himself or if it's madness and more profoundly of nothingness.

486
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:44.070
That was his,
he's,
he's very fragile,

487
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.020
being just very fragile self.
Uh,
this is why this,
this,

488
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.030
this night is white,
almost transparent,
uh,
ghost of Don Quixote.

489
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:59.850
Uh,
so this defeat within the world of books,
announcers or prefigures,

490
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.430
he's regaining his,
uh,

491
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.700
sanity and even announces he's death us quite so just nothingness.

492
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.020
Nothingness.
Hence it suggests death.

493
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:15.450
<v 1>Okay?</v>

494
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.320
<v 0>Then there is present day reality along.
So he,
Hannah regains insanity.</v>

495
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.630
It is like a conversion story.

496
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:28.020
The conversion story is typical.
Typically the man who,
uh,

497
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.280
uh,
the old man dies and the new mine is reborn.

498
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.540
That is the conversion story.
Uh,
so that he said death and resurrection,

499
00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.150
a involved don't be haughty.

500
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:44.151
Sleeps and awakens changed us if he had undergone a mystical experience similar

501
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:51.021
to the sleep and awakening after the cave of Montesinos episodes episode,

502
00:37:51.091 --> 00:37:52.320
which prefigure this one.

503
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:58.190
How can he know that he has now awakened to his true self and real world?

504
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.130
Don't be haughty,
had the memory of who he had been,

505
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.080
but if this life,

506
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:11.970
but if his life has no Quixote is now complete and his life is about to be

507
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:15.840
complete his life as I want to be handled.
What differentiates the two?

508
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.830
This is the conundrum of sickies mingle in Calderon's life is a dream that

509
00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:26.730
played that I have recounted to you several times where the young princess is

510
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:31.110
drug taken to the palace.
He commits all kinds of,
uh,
uh,

511
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.650
of crimes,
uh,
his drug taking back to the tower and weeks.

512
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.540
He can't tell if it was a dream,
what he experienced,
uh,

513
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.740
in the,
in the palace or if it is a reason now,

514
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.320
if he's now dreaming in the tower,
he can't tell.

515
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.290
So he's Mundos answering Calderon's play is to cut through the ambiguity and

516
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.910
will himself to be good,

517
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.080
to be good because life maybe a dream,

518
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:03.550
but it may be a rehearsal for a life that is more enduring.

519
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.390
Now,
the afterlife,
that outer circle,
Don Quixote death,

520
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:13.740
he dies by the way,
uh,
I,

521
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.180
I don't know if you have taken notice of this,

522
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.370
but he dies on married and without succession,
which is evident in the,

523
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.720
in the scene with a notary when he's dictating his testament,

524
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:29.590
because he has to leave everything to his niece and friends and so forth.

525
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.650
Again,
it is very much,
like I say,

526
00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.190
he's moonless awakening into the dream like quality of life itself.

527
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.370
It is as if all of life were like a dream.

528
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.990
He's madness was a dream within a dream and death.

529
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.140
The only access to a true permanent life.
Hence,

530
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.540
it is not only his madness that is like a dream,

531
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.290
but everything else is madness is the dream.
Within a dream,

532
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.070
only death can put an end to the play of reflections.
And in a way,

533
00:39:57.071 --> 00:40:01.900
this is why alone Saki handle has to die.
Donkey,

534
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:02.721
donkey health,

535
00:40:02.721 --> 00:40:07.721
US death is the last in a series of mock deaths that have appeared throughout

536
00:40:08.561 --> 00:40:13.390
the book and prefigure this one one at the end of part one when he's knocked

537
00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:16.800
unconscious.
Uh,
then of course in the,
uh,

538
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.720
in the cave of Montesinos Doki helped us death is the last in a,

539
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.380
in a series of mock vest.
As I've said,

540
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.650
one has to take into account that the death of Don Quixote,

541
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.110
at least within the plot of the novel,
is also a kind of return Gnocchi.

542
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.890
Hope that returns home,

543
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.670
do the Heimlich to use Freud's work,

544
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.330
the familiar to the place where he was alone.

545
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:44.340
Sukarno where he was saying this makes the entire series of episodes that make

546
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:49.120
up the whole book his madness,
like a bubble or a dream.

547
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:54.340
All the more so it is like they Barataria episodes are two central,

548
00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.810
but the dream repetitions of his current lead,

549
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:03.811
one to consider the fiction in between as something that one could dispense

550
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:04.804
with.

551
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:10.580
Do the events within that bubble occur in some sort of concert with one another

552
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.510
or either they themselves,

553
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:18.540
just a series of repetitions is there in successive sense to the novels plot you

554
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:24.340
there as sequential quality to the novel,
the temporal,

555
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.690
the temporality in the Quixote that leads to that end.

556
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.131
For instance,

557
00:41:30.131 --> 00:41:34.820
we have been able to more or less follow the months and even the days during

558
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:38.720
which the adventures take place.
But is there a sense of temporality,

559
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:40.970
of chronology,
of inevitability?

560
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.060
We know that he has to return at some point to the village as he did before and

561
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:51.530
once he's defeated,
we know that he's madness is now on the wane.

562
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:56.900
There is inevitability in the transience of his madness of this,

563
00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.060
of this invention of self.
I don't know if it's very life.
Uh,

564
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.913
on the other hand,

565
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.700
a close reading of the last chapter does not reveal anything about the death of

566
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.870
[inaudible] Ahmed.
They're winning.
Haley for instance.
Uh,

567
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.510
when did see the,
I met their billing heavy die.

568
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.440
There is no total closure in the hotel possible.

569
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.500
I think said one this place with it.
Ironically,

570
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:26.530
he knows that no matter how many times is it okay hold this dead and that Cedia

571
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.420
Metis is hanging in his pen and addressing his pen,

572
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.940
that any writer can still come up as one Montalvo did.

573
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.600
I think I may have mentioned him before.

574
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:38.090
Equatorian writer who wrote a wonderful book.

575
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.273
<v 2>Okay.</v>

576
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.930
<v 0>Cold chapters.
That's the [inaudible] does for God</v>

577
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:55.260
and a is a pastiche meaning an eh,
Eh,

578
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.980
imitating [inaudible].
This is a style.

579
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.290
So fair amount.
This,
no.

580
00:43:04.291 --> 00:43:08.870
So we will talk about that when we talk about [inaudible] the story by borders

581
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.180
in our next class.
Don Quixote.

582
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.260
Quixote is not a book that has a plot in the Aristotelian sense with a
beginning,

583
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:21.261
a middle and an end all tied together tightly in a sequence of events leading to

584
00:43:22.651 --> 00:43:23.484
a finish.

585
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.770
It is the life of Don Quixote that gives it form as in the picaresque,

586
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.870
the life of the picker who gives form to the narrative.
Uh,

587
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.230
or we can think here again of what he missed.
The PASA.

588
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.240
Monte said jokingly about not finishing his book because his life is on finish.

589
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:45.720
Poking fun at that autobiography as a convention.

590
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.480
The book has to end with his death.

591
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:52.380
Death is a form of closure that everyone understands.

592
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:58.230
It gives life shape.
Uh,
give a ago,

593
00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:02.970
Francisco [inaudible] it great port of the 17th century.

594
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.010
I urge you to read goodwill on one way to do so,

595
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:22.011
is to tell you that he wrote some of the most obscene pumps in the history of

596
00:44:22.651 --> 00:44:27.090
the Spanish language.
Also Sabal the most beautiful love poems.

597
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.110
Uh,
perhaps,
uh,
border has said that me,

598
00:44:31.111 --> 00:44:33.390
the was a whole literature all by himself.

599
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.960
He has a poem in which he about death in which he ends by saying that death will

600
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.970
organize his life.
We'll give it a meaning.

601
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

602
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.550
<v 0>So,
uh,
that provides an enter,</v>

603
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:52.860
which everything will seem to have been pointing.

604
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:58.710
I used to tell him plots or the,
the ones that will be,
they talk

605
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:04.380
unless you believe that there is a tight concert to the world and to history or

606
00:45:04.381 --> 00:45:04.591
less,

607
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:09.591
you begin to believe in providence in this sense that vantage is showing that

608
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:14.931
the novel as a form cannot be bound by this artificial shapes of art,

609
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.030
like the epic tragedy.

610
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.050
But by the shape of life was everyone understands it.

611
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.850
So baggy monster that he has created in the normal.

612
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:34.550
This is profoundly so when we take into account,
I said,

613
00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:39.410
well this his own death is near as he writes about Don Quixote's,

614
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.930
his death and we we'll be talking about [inaudible] death in the next class.

615
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:47.160
This is also the reason why that is.
For instance,

616
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.030
no closure to the story of Anna Felix.

617
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.610
We got this daughter,
uh,

618
00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:00.670
one may ask also why they're so little about don Quixote's birth and use.

619
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.800
One could say that the only life of Don Quixote that is worth knowing is his

620
00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:10.490
life as the math night.
That everything else is of little consequence.

621
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.380
So it is the life that don't be haughty authored for himself.

622
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.590
That is important in the conception,

623
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:22.070
execution and structure of the book.

624
00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:27.760
But it is a life not a completed action in the Aristotelian Sense.

625
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:34.270
Why not end the book then by making him sane

626
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:40.510
is sane donkey hotel would close the plot of Loki halters metal life,

627
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.380
his life as art and literature.

628
00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:47.720
One answer would be to say that only by making him diag and said Vantis blurred

629
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:51.860
and his diction between our daily lives and the invented lives of literature

630
00:46:51.861 --> 00:46:55.770
both have endings with significance.
So look,

631
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:59.690
your daughter's death as Don Quixote and his rebirth as a long econo.

632
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.440
It's not enough to close the book.
You also had to die.

633
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.870
But only if the main theme of the book is I'm,

634
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:13.780
I believe that it is the own reality of worldly life and our hope for a real

635
00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:16.880
life after,
after death.

636
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:22.970
Now I'm going to just mention what some authors,

637
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:27.620
major authors said about the shape of the Quixote since we were,

638
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:32.470
since we can look at it as a whole sheet.
And I,
uh,

639
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:37.600
will then we get to the author I mentioned before,

640
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.680
Miguel de Amino,
I may have mentioned him before.

641
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.020
I mentioned certainly Ortega.
You got set,

642
00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:48.610
who was the great Spanish philosopher of the 20th century,

643
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.050
Miguel de Una [inaudible].

644
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:57.190
What's a philosopher but also a writer and novelist,
the port.

645
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.230
It's thinker in general.

646
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.280
He was the president of the University of Salamanca,

647
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.130
what we would call today,
a public intellectual.

648
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.020
He was exiled by the dictatorship of premolar Rivera.
Uh,

649
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.220
and uh,
he wrote,

650
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:17.221
he was a Basque born in Bilbao in 1864 and died in Salamanca in 1936 just at the

651
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.070
beginning of the Spanish civil war.
Can you,

652
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.110
you may have heard some of the titles of some of his books.

653
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.140
They'll think Demian [inaudible] on the tragic sense of life book that I

654
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:33.670
recommend that you read.
La Rania,

655
00:48:33.671 --> 00:48:37.630
they'll Christianity the agony of Christianity and a very,

656
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:42.631
very well known novel called Nebula missed from 1914 in 1905

657
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:49.960
don't,
eh,
no published viva.

658
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:54.010
They don't be haughty essential the life of Don Quixote and sanctuary,

659
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:59.290
which is a commentary chapter by chapter of the Quixote.

660
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.300
Very,
uh,
sweet,

661
00:49:02.301 --> 00:49:05.210
generous kind of commentary when I'm,

662
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:09.760
or like to be outrageous.
For instance,

663
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:15.130
when I'm mono says that he believes or phase to believe in the real existence of

664
00:49:15.131 --> 00:49:18.410
Don Quixote on claiming that Cervantes,

665
00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.810
a mediocre writer by a stroke of luck.

666
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.690
Got to write the story written about the pair.
Buy One CD.

667
00:49:25.691 --> 00:49:29.110
I made been Benning Hailey go.
This is his conceit.

668
00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.370
So he ran.
I was against it.
[inaudible] uh,

669
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.850
Luna Muno there is no assurance that,
uh,

670
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.560
the donkey holiday we'll find a life after death.

671
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:45.280
This is talking about the death of Don Quixote,
uh,

672
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.920
stressing that perhaps this life is all there is and that it is like God's

673
00:49:53.231 --> 00:49:54.064
dream.

674
00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:55.910
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

675
00:49:55.910 --> 00:50:00.530
<v 0>So he hopes that God will go on dreaming us.
He says humorously,</v>

676
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.090
because if he stops dreaming,
we will all disappear along with the universe.

677
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.480
God gave us the desire to be immortal like him and created a symbol of it in Don

678
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.750
Quixote who does what he does because he wants to be immortal.

679
00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:25.010
So now Muno mourns Don Quixote's passing and rising against this for

680
00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:31.580
trivializing his death and he affirms that I at least don't Quixote,

681
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.850
uh,
passed on his badness to Joe.

682
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.920
You remember in the last scene there were San Angelo says,
don't die.
Please.

683
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:44.100
Level's gone now.
And,
uh,
soy de Santo,

684
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:49.120
who will carry on with the madness when I won't know it goes on to say that

685
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:54.260
Antonia key,
Hannah Denise does.

686
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.360
Mary is sensible,

687
00:50:56.361 --> 00:51:01.070
boring man who never heard of Geo Valerie Romances.
Therefore,

688
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:05.630
she inherits a key,
forces us into live at home drum,

689
00:51:05.631 --> 00:51:10.130
live devoid of adventure.
I know husband who takes out the garbage

690
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.633
<v 2>sure,</v>

691
00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:18.920
<v 0>but takes no risks.
Don't see now,
however,
or I'll,</v>

692
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:21.150
those are Lorenzo on the other hand,

693
00:51:21.151 --> 00:51:24.270
does understand her elevation to idea lady

694
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.140
and she leads men to heroic action.
That is the idea.

695
00:51:29.141 --> 00:51:33.210
The ideal of such a lady leads men to ideal action,

696
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.610
meaning to take risks.

697
00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:43.340
She and Santo keep alive according to the religion of Don Quixote,

698
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.160
which is on the wane in Spain as he writes his book in 1905,

699
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:56.560
he complaints with Spain having been defeated in the Spanish American war by the

700
00:51:57.271 --> 00:51:59.010
United States.
For him,

701
00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:04.770
it's this defeat signals the end of [inaudible] small.

702
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.860
This,
uh,
having been defeated by this upstart nation and he,
uh,

703
00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:16.070
he loans for every turn of the quixotic spirit to Spain,

704
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:22.400
one that rebels against commonplace reality and up horse mediocrity.

705
00:52:23.101 --> 00:52:24.240
On submissiveness,

706
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.290
he belonged to the store called generation of 98,

707
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:32.160
which was a collection of riders,
a group of writers.
Oh,

708
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:36.630
who all wrote about the,
uh,
the miseries of Spain at the turn of the century.

709
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:41.190
And,
uh,
particularly,
uh,
uh,
complaining about the defeat,

710
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:44.940
uh,
uh,
at the hand of the United States.

711
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.570
There is a moment in this,
in the Spanish American war that I,

712
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:53.700
that I call a quixotic moment.
It is the following.

713
00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:58.730
This is to what degree your country can absorb a fictional writer,

714
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:03.610
uh,
j,
uh,

715
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.670
[inaudible] Pasqual set Aveda ice.
They liked them.

716
00:53:08.671 --> 00:53:09.504
You want it,

717
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:14.040
<v 2>okay.</v>

718
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.040
<v 0>Got himself trapped with a whole Spanish fleet in some Geralda Quba Bay,</v>

719
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:23.550
Santiago's Bay,
Cuba,
like,

720
00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:28.570
oh Cuban base have the virtue of being very broad and with a very narrow

721
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:29.604
entrance.

722
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.110
Servera got into the bay with all of his ships,

723
00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:39.090
which are wooden or fashion and gangster didn't have much range.

724
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:45.410
The American fleet solution itself outside waiting for the inevitable moment

725
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.040
when Siddha Veda either gave up or tried to leave instead of where I

726
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:56.970
communicated with Spain,

727
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.350
they had cable at the time about his predicament.

728
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:04.320
And the Spanish government answered saying,

729
00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:09.321
we know that with your valor vigor and a an an all of your intelligence and

730
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:17.670
cunning,
you will be able to prevail.
We already you to come out.

731
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:23.540
So the Spanish fleet came out and it was a Turkey shoot.

732
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:31.630
The American fleet shot every single one of the Spanish ships instead of,

733
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:36.230
then I writes about this,

734
00:54:36.231 --> 00:54:40.220
I've read his memoirs a lot.

735
00:54:40.221 --> 00:54:44.690
He was very satisfied that at least the Americans pull him out of the water.

736
00:54:44.691 --> 00:54:45.860
He went down with the ship.

737
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:49.430
The Americans pulled him out of his water with his sword and everything,

738
00:54:49.431 --> 00:54:54.431
put him on board and treated him with great deference and a send.

739
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.610
The surviving,

740
00:54:55.611 --> 00:54:59.870
the few surviving sailors were sent as Britain as a war to Maine for a while

741
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:04.990
where he was able to visit them later set Aveda was later through food by the

742
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.420
American sued by the Spanish government for losing the fleet.

743
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:18.580
So that was a quick Sadik moment of the kind who would have applauded

744
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:26.500
so much.
[inaudible] Borges,

745
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:31.970
Jorge Luis Borges.
We're going to speak more about him in our next class.

746
00:55:31.971 --> 00:55:36.010
What he wrote,
the marvelous I say about the last chapter of the Quixote,

747
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.220
he points out,
I think I've mentioned this before,

748
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:45.580
that the one quality that Unites Don Quixote and alone Saki,

749
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:49.700
Hanno is courage.
That alone,
Saki,

750
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.060
Hanno faces death with courage and serenity.

751
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.810
So this is the one quality that they have in common,

752
00:55:56.811 --> 00:56:00.500
even if one is sane and the other one is mad.

753
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.230
<v 1>Okay?</v>

754
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.800
<v 0>Uh,</v>

755
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.800
he writes that sort of anthrax could have chosen a more astonishing episode to

756
00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:12.520
bring about Don Quixote is returned to sanity,
but shows sleeping.

757
00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:18.370
That mysterious world from which we returned when we awaken,

758
00:56:18.371 --> 00:56:20.050
not knowing where we have been.

759
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:25.600
This is what bar has picks on that go six hours of sleep,

760
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:31.020
that those six hours of sleep are like death so that Don Quixote dies and he's

761
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:34.100
wrestle.
Rick did as Alonzo Kiano,
uh,

762
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.390
board has remarks on the sort of what he calls it,

763
00:56:36.391 --> 00:56:41.391
lateral and casual way in which Don Quixote dies at the end of a sentence.

764
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.050
If you were followed the ending there sort of is at the end of the center,

765
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.240
but I mean that he died

766
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:51.850
and he writes,

767
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:56.170
it is the last of many cruelties that Cervantes has visited upon his hero.

768
00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.760
Perhaps this cruelty cruelty is a form of modesty and Avantis and Don Quixote

769
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.100
understand Castro

770
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:13.180
each other well and forgive each other rights.
Uh,
Boris,

771
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.540
uh,

772
00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:18.860
bore his claims of the whole book was written for this last scene of,

773
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:23.530
of death.
I am willing to finish,
uh,

774
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:29.100
with the image that you have on the title page of your syllabus,

775
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.620
which is of course the one by Pablo Picasso,

776
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:38.260
whom you all know.
Of course it was a Spanish painter,

777
00:57:38.261 --> 00:57:40.870
although he lived in France most of his life and all of that.

778
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:42.670
But he was a Spanish painter,

779
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:48.060
born in Malaga in 1881 and died in 1973.

780
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.870
I left the Gospel for last.
He's Quixote,
as I said,

781
00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:57.130
and as you know,
is on the title page of your syllabus.

782
00:57:57.830 --> 00:57:58.663
Uh,

783
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:03.340
I think that because whiskey hotel is so schematic because he considers him an

784
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:08.080
archetype,
an archetype,
Ferris chaotic,
uh,
by nature.

785
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.190
Notice,
of course the skeletal Racine antic

786
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:18.310
are made up of lines.
Uh,
the plump Santo.

787
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:21.003
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

788
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.690
<v 0>Um,
the donkey's ears.</v>

789
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.140
I think that the donkey's ears,
how,
what are their signature?

790
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:34.390
And in Spanish,
bull is a donkey and it means someone who's dumb.
So you can,

791
00:58:34.391 --> 00:58:36.460
you know,
your point ears like that if you're a donkey.

792
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:41.640
So this is why the donkey's ears are so prominent.
I,

793
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.860
if Picasso has injected some humor in his painting,

794
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:46.600
which I think is quite appropriate,

795
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:52.470
the windmills in the background or Don Quixote signature and the bright sun

796
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:57.820
beating down on him,
his Castille's hot sun,

797
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:01.210
which is pressing through much of the novel.

798
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:04.750
But what is not so evident,
it seems to me,

799
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:09.110
until you look for a while,
is that okay?

800
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.880
Hottest figure is like,
like Laka interogation back.

801
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.140
The figure of Oakey Horta is like an interrogation.
Mark

802
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.690
the question mark in English,
I'm sorry,
I'm translating from Spanish.

803
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.240
[inaudible] question mark.
Your languages tend to get mixed up.

804
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.860
There are advantages and disadvantages to knowing several languages.

805
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.450
So I'll leave you with that question mark of the castles.
