1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.350
I want to begin today by mentioning a virtual literary fact,

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.090
uh,
a story that does not happen,
uh,

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.180
one that only exists in the ass if of literature.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.790
Uh,
it's a make believe but literatures make belief,

5
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:28.791
but that nevertheless suggestive of the enigmatic and even a prophetic powers of

6
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:36.050
literature.
In talking the last time about Cervantes,

7
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.690
his reaction to the publication of [inaudible] Quixote,

8
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.730
uh,

9
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.730
of which he learned when he was writing chapter 36 of his own second part,

10
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.690
we failed to mention a change he made in the donkey Hotez plants to distinguish

11
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:58.710
his own book from that of the impostor.

12
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.230
You may remember that in mentioning the possibility of a third,

13
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.690
Sally at the end of part one,

14
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.640
there is a reference to some journalists in Santa Rosa.

15
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990
<v 1>Where is it?
Yeah,
so they're also,</v>

16
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.310
<v 0>you'll have a handout to help you now.
You have it already.</v>

17
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.620
We should have gotten to each one of you,
if not,

18
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.713
<v 1>sorry,
Rosa</v>

19
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.180
<v 0>and uh,
uh,
at the beginning of Cervantes is part to,</v>

20
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.130
it is against it.
The Don Quixote will go to Saragosa to,

21
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.210
to participate in the tournament,

22
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.020
which takes place during the celebration of St Georges de Saint George's,

23
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.150
the saint who was at night on April the 23rd.

24
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.710
This is where Don Quixote is headed as he sets forth for the third time.

25
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.970
But it so happens that [inaudible] Neda had also taken the cue from part one of

26
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:26.351
this Saragosa jousts and had his own Doki how they actually go and participate

27
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:28.730
in the tournament.

28
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.900
This was enough for Servantez to change Doki halters destination in mid novel

29
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.200
and have him divert toward Barcelona without passing through Saragosa,

30
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.280
which is what he does in the book.
Uh,

31
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.430
[inaudible] goes to start.
I also don't you hold this book.

32
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.780
We,
uh,
goes to Barcelona.

33
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.133
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.330
<v 0>This is all well good.
Uh,</v>

35
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.480
another instances Sylvana does his reaction to the Apocrypha Quixote.

36
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.460
What's an event this could not have known of course,

37
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.000
is that April 23rd,

38
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.740
the day of those jobs would be the date of his own death,

39
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.080
so that he avoided knowingly.
Of course,

40
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.550
having the end of his book announced his own,

41
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.100
and
now this is all live.

42
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.160
Who say a speculation on my part of fiction making on my part,

43
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.120
but such implied coincidences make me wonder sometimes,

44
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.730
uh,

45
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
is literature always an evading or a postponement of death

46
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.240
that is more to the telling of stories then the telling of stories as shared

47
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:04.750
outside,

48
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.750
they knew when she told story after story night after night,

49
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.480
forestalling her own demise in the thousand and one nights.

50
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.740
Do you remember that Shit outside that tells stories to,
uh,

51
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.200
to avoid her being a slain.

52
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.340
So she tells stories to forestall her own death.

53
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.870
So in some

54
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.290
implicit way,
perhaps only in my overheated imagination,

55
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.740
this is what happens when it said Vantis has his character swerve away from

56
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:47.161
April the 23rd so much for that April the 23rd,

57
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.800
by the way,
said bad date for great writers.

58
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.560
And is the date on which Shakespeare also died same year?
I said,
well,

59
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.130
not exactly the same day,
close enough,

60
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:04.900
the same date because England and Spain used a different calendar.

61
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:06.610
So there was a difference of two or three days,

62
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.470
but April the 23rd is also the date of Shakespeare's death.

63
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.680
So there's something magical about April the 23rd,

64
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.560
so much.
So that Aleppo Carpentier,

65
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.590
the great Cuban writer about whom I have written a great deal also died on April

66
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.960
the 23rd centuries later.

67
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.940
So we should warn all riders,

68
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.800
not,
uh,
to take very seriously April the 23rd,

69
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.070
but I'm sure that some wishing to be as great as Advantis and Shakespeare or

70
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.340
Carpentier would take it and we'd rather just die on April the 23rd to,

71
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.070
uh,
to be as great as as they were.

72
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.110
So perhaps this is just,
uh,
an Monica device,

73
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.750
something to make you remember the date of [inaudible] death to which we'll

74
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.751
return when we read his farewell in the prologue to the trials of fussiness and

75
00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:18.414
see his mom.

76
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.653
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.680
<v 0>Now let us return to the issue of the new features of part two.</v>

78
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.860
I remarked on the discussion among donkey halted the priest and the barber about

79
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:35.180
Spain's political situation and the Rv Trista's uh,
those,

80
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.710
uh,
who offered solutions to the problems at hand.

81
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.170
I remarked that the discussion should be seen in the context of my commentary on

82
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:50.171
the speech about arms on letters when I said that by the sixth things,

83
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.870
by the 16th century government had become the object of intellectual reflection,

84
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.590
uh,
and mentioned Machiavelli's the prince,
uh,

85
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.690
as a founding work of political science.
I also told you,

86
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.390
uh,
during the 16th century,

87
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:12.470
they were not a few books written about the education of the prince,

88
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.873
uh,

89
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.170
in which guidelines were offered about how to prepare a young man for,

90
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.020
for Kingship,
for being a ruler.

91
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.700
All of these preoccupations are in the background of this discussion among the

92
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:30.230
three characters.
What the discussion also indicates,

93
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.030
and this is very significant,

94
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.870
is that the Quixote part two is the first political novel

95
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.250
because the deals and incorporates current events,
uh,

96
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.900
such as the expulsion of the Maury scarf.

97
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

98
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.440
<v 0>Uh,
the Maurice goes where the Arabs who remained after the,
uh,</v>

99
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.380
fall of Granola in 1492,
of course,

100
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:14.381
there were large communities of our apps in Spain and many remained and they

101
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.070
were,
uh,
by decree and by force,
uh,
uh,

102
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.720
compelled to,
uh,
bandwidth.

103
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:23.300
Not only their religion but their practices and so forth,

104
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.120
but the customs and stuff and they were expelled,
uh,

105
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.160
from Spain at the time,

106
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:35.960
but said vantage was writing part two of the Quixote.
And this,

107
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.240
uh,
this political event is incorporated into the novel.

108
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.720
This is why I say that the,
uh,

109
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.960
the day part two is the first political novel impact too.

110
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.140
There is also a bitter satire of the aristocracy and they're irresponsible ways

111
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.290
in the figures of the Duke and Duchess that you will meet later.

112
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.280
The satire of the [inaudible] is part of these political thematic and Doki is

113
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.380
acting like an attribute to is does.

114
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.150
He does remember the idea that he has on how to,
how to fight off the Turks,

115
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.913
uh,

116
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.450
is part of the critique of the nobility even if don't get healthy is a pathetic

117
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.220
and impoverished Evalgo.

118
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.050
But here he's trying to play the role of the arbitrary stuff.

119
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.320
This is what the king should do.

120
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.270
Another new factories that three or four of the initial chapters in part two

121
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:43.140
take place indoors,
be it in donkey haughtiness or in Saint Joe's house.

122
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.210
In contrast to part one,

123
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.240
a great deal of part two will take place indoors reflecting a more urban setting

124
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.120
in the novel,
you will have the village of a torso and Barcelona

125
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.930
ins will still play a role but not as important as one Palo [inaudible] in part

126
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:04.764
one.

127
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.920
And remember the holes in the roof of that in to be in Palo [inaudible] in was

128
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:12.780
almost to still be outdoors

129
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.290
here in second part.
And the,
in part two,
there will be houses,

130
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.640
mansions,
uh,
and uh,
cities,

131
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.860
uh,
like a torso,
which is merely a village.
And Barcelona,
which is a great city.

132
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.631
The novel,

133
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:35.631
the modern novel that develops from the Quixote will be essentially an urban jar

134
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.420
dealing with cities.
If you think of Balzac,
uh,

135
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.310
because in cities there is a,
uh,
uh,

136
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.530
there is,
uh,
there are more people engaged in playing,

137
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.970
uh,
different,
uh,

138
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.720
many roles and he's a thicker social or context.

139
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.620
So we can see in this development a movement toward the city in the novel

140
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.400
or the one could say that if the remote kernel of the novel of the modern novel

141
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.330
is Lassila Celestina about which I have talked many times,

142
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.790
that work already takes place in a city,

143
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:22.500
presumably Salamanca and although much of the picker risks takes place on the

144
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:27.040
road,
there are also cities in Lhasa Deion particularly in Deguzman Guzman,

145
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.620
they'll farace being indoors but also outdoors.

146
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.680
Most of the action of part two takes place at night

147
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.100
in the dark.
We had night episodes in part one,

148
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:44.550
the fooling hammers,
the fracas at the,

149
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:47.760
in the episode with a dead body,

150
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.160
but most of it takes place,
uh,
outdoors on the road,

151
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.000
on in day light,

152
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.140
not so in part two in the darkness will play an important role in several

153
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:07.801
episodes and there are two that actually take place on the ground in caves part

154
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:11.231
to us.

155
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:16.231
We will soon see is more baroque and the buildings and darkness contribute to

156
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:19.624
it.

157
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.460
Another development in part two is it's being scripted and performed in the

158
00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:30.290
present.
Presumably as we read,

159
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.820
not in the past by see they're made they winning Haley and his translators.

160
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.970
It is ringing improvised on the go.

161
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.370
In addition and as already remarked,

162
00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:45.371
many characters have read part one which serves as the background as a model as

163
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:47.990
it were for part two.

164
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:53.590
We already had had intimations of this in part one these the novel being

165
00:12:54.591 --> 00:12:59.591
scripted and written as the novel takes place in the episode of the dead body.

166
00:12:59.991 --> 00:13:03.910
When sanctuary gives Gnocchi halted the moniker the night of the thorough full

167
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.753
countenance.

168
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.920
The Evalgo remark that the writer most of put the idea in Saint Joe's head,

169
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.300
so just in the novel has been written as the performance,

170
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:20.470
but now now we have the plans and preparations for the action being discussed by

171
00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:22.580
the characters,

172
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:28.210
particularly by sound Song Carrasco in part two part one plays a role that the

173
00:13:30.501 --> 00:13:34.850
romances of jewelry play in part one let me repeat that because it's a bit

174
00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:37.340
convoluted in part two,

175
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.200
part one place the role that the romances of chivalry played in part one

176
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.340
it is the original that the characters who have read at one donkey holder to

177
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:50.320
reproduce an act according to it.

178
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.260
<v 1>Okay,</v>

179
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.260
<v 0>so a new larger mirror has been added to the play of mirrors already present in</v>

180
00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:03.951
part one don't be haughty belongs to a previous fiction that the new characters

181
00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:07.320
who have read it want him to be true to

182
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.240
everything now is part of donkey.
This fiction

183
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.680
sandstone Carrasco is the most important new character to emerge in part

184
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:24.280
through.
He has a harsh sounding name.

185
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.290
Sounds got cool.

186
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.340
<v 0>He's a tomboy.</v>

188
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.370
The song of Bartolo Carrasco who studied in Salamanca and has come back with a

189
00:14:36.601 --> 00:14:37.680
bachelor's degree.

190
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.120
He is another of several uh,

191
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.020
university graduates in the Quixote,
the first being the priest,

192
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.400
but the most memorable one so far.
Good soft Domo,
if you remember,

193
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.670
this is a reflection of the importance of university is a university in Spain.

194
00:14:55.671 --> 00:15:00.230
You in this period,
particularly after the work of Cardinal Francisco,

195
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:01.040
he managed,

196
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.040
this is narrows about who you have read in Elliot who founded the University of

197
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.253
Alcoa.

198
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.780
There is a mild sat higher of intellectuals in the figure of Samsung Carrasco as

199
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:16.450
they,
as there is in that of,

200
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.320
of the priest in part one and throughout part to the priest was the graduate of

201
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.840
a Lesser University,
not quite Salamanca.

202
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.920
He's called Samsung to begin the part of the south tower.

203
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:29.960
He said he's called Samsung,
but it's quite small,

204
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:35.330
isn't all whose daughter giant like the sands Samsung of the,
of the Bible.

205
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.700
Uh,
but most importantly he's a jokester,

206
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.570
prankster,

207
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.110
and an avid reader of romances of chivalry and particularly of part one of the

208
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:48.824
Quixote,

209
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.020
which he seems to know by heart to judge by comments he makes.

210
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:56.760
He was also a reader of [inaudible],

211
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.060
so sound song,
spent his time at Salamanca Reading Literature,

212
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.310
not studying theology,
which is what he was supposed to do.

213
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:12.830
He is the counterpart of the Canon of Toledo in part one,

214
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.160
but he's not a solemn and pedantic like the Canon was is like the opposite

215
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.820
sign song is a reader of part one.
Part one again is to him,

216
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.760
but the romances of chivalry when to Don Quixote.

217
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.250
He wants to reenact it.

218
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.690
Josa Gokey hotel wanted to reenact and dramatize the Debra masters of chivalry.

219
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:41.350
He's planned to cure don Quixote is to defeat him within the fiction of his

220
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:45.950
madness like the priest and the barber in part one,

221
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.310
but in doing so,
he will become another Quixote.

222
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.560
He's double in a truer sense.
Then all the others in part one,

223
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.100
if part one was held together by the overarching plot of the persecution and

224
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:04.580
capture of Don Quixote by the Holy Brotherhood,

225
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.760
the barber and the priest in part to that role is played by sandstones schemes

226
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.870
to bring donkey Quixote back within the fiction that he has helped him create

227
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.280
that is Samsung has step create another fiction for or don't for Doki holder,

228
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:27.110
which is really not a fiction.
Uh,
that is that Doki Quixote is a great night.

229
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.360
Aaron already the object of a book.
So He uh,

230
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:36.260
in beause Don Quixote with this idea,
you are great character already,
you know,

231
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.140
in a,
in a book.
So you have to act accordingly

232
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.200
in part to Samsung is the main author within the book.

233
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.411
See the I made,

234
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:53.411
they've been in was a distant author at least thrice removed by translators and

235
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:55.260
transcribers

236
00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.830
sound song and others like the dukes steward whom you will meet soon enough,

237
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.820
we'll be authors within the fiction.
We read a new script,

238
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.900
the action and watch it unfold most of the time,

239
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.450
not like they intended it to

240
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.290
as author figures,
they are,

241
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.520
but particularly sounds song quite complex and modern.

242
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.750
Their intentions are rarely match the results.

243
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:26.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

244
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.470
<v 0>Much of the fun of the,
uh,</v>

245
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:33.471
of the humor in part two is following the elaborate schemes of internal authors

246
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.500
that go awry with the opposite of what they have planned actually happens.

247
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.420
Some of them spectacularly.

248
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.540
This has much to say about other ship,

249
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.810
about the creation of fiction and about Cervantes,

250
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:52.230
his own creation of the fiction of the Quixote.

251
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

252
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.650
<v 0>I see that it is quite a modern conception of the author because this is the</v>

253
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:02.250
conception that we have in the modern period of authors.

254
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.790
The whole of deconstruction,

255
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:10.110
the famous literary movement that was mostly started here at Yale.

256
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.830
I had to do with fine deconstructing authors,
uh,

257
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.300
making their intentions,

258
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.950
showing how their intentions rarely ever matched the results.

259
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.190
But that is another story.
Now,
uh,

260
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.300
Santo and,
uh,
and,
and Teresa.
Oh No,
let me,
uh,

261
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.620
so in,
in the hands of Samsung and other readers of part one,

262
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.910
the action in part two is poised between the past,

263
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.660
their remembrance of part one and the future,

264
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:44.430
their scripts based on it.

265
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.610
So it's poised in that like a balancing act between the past part one and the

266
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:54.180
future in this scripts that they have,
uh,
they delayed repair.

267
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.290
Hence it is like an action that unfolds in the present.

268
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.320
I said it's been written or just after following scripts whose development we as

269
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.360
readers can more or less follow.

270
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.840
Part two is a text in the making.

271
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.620
We learn these quite early in chapter five in the episode when Joe goes home to

272
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:21.150
convince his wife that he must accompany,
don't be haughty.
Again,

273
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.970
this is an issue that I,

274
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.840
an episode that I discussed briefly at the end of my last lecture,

275
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:29.970
but I want to revisit today.

276
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.413
<v 1>Okay.</v>

277
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.380
<v 0>So the question of translation and improvisation resurfaces here.</v>

278
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.070
Chapter Five,
part two begins in your translation,

279
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.040
the translator of this story coming to ride.

280
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:48.490
This fifth chapter says he takes it to be apocryphal because in its central

281
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:50.620
talks in another style that can be a,

282
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:55.710
that could be expected from a shallow understanding and says such subtle things

283
00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.610
that he reckons impossible,
that he should know them.
Nevertheless,

284
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.270
he will not know bid,
translating them to comply with the duties of his office.

285
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:07.270
And so went on saying on the chapter begins

286
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.000
a little further,

287
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.690
it is again reported quote this kind of language and what central says further

288
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:19.140
below made the translator of this story.
Uh,

289
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.660
say he takes his chapter to be apocryphal.

290
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.510
Let us step by step brick construct or the comment by the translator at the

291
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:33.511
beginning of chapter five suggests about the status of the texts that we read.

292
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.140
But keeping in mind that all of these gains of authorship and textuality do not

293
00:21:40.301 --> 00:21:43.000
lead to an ultimate ultimate coherence.

294
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.740
We cannot really pin down Cervantes on the issue of authorship.

295
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:52.741
How many authors are translators and we cannot pin him down either on which is

296
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:55.750
finally the text.

297
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.230
The text exists,

298
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.420
supposed to be in the original in a form that seems to be apocryphal.

299
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.070
That is that it is false.

300
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.910
Either a bogus addendum by somebody else,
uh,

301
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.650
or a falsifying re re writing of it.

302
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.720
They see the dometic write it this way or was it falsify in subways so that

303
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:24.190
sanctuary is talking like this.

304
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.510
Then it is translated into the text.

305
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:33.511
We read by a reluctant translator who alludes to his falseness but decides

306
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:37.300
nevertheless to translate and transcribe it,

307
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.690
but adding a note about his falsity,

308
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.410
it is a text that is erased.

309
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.400
I said it's been written and that should disappear as we read it.

310
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.750
Moreover,
there is a question of temporality.

311
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.210
When does it exist and in what form?

312
00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.340
The answer is that it only exists at the moment of each reading.

313
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.570
This is I think a model of how the entire of part two exists.

314
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.740
Poised,
as I said,
between the remembers of part one and the future actions,

315
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.820
action actions scripted by the internal authors of part two actions that don't

316
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:22.150
turn out to be quite like the script.
Furthermore,

317
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:25.540
the translators admonition raises the issue of me Macy's,

318
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.880
which son is the real one?

319
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.910
Is it the one he remembers from part one or the new century who has evolved

320
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.160
improving his speech and endowed with the desire for social advancement,

321
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.820
not just for wealth.
The translators,

322
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.370
quip reveals at Centro has changed.

323
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.410
That is not static.

324
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:53.950
In fact that reality in general is not static and true me Macy's to be very much

325
00:23:55.161 --> 00:24:00.010
aware of the changing nature of things and people.
So there is a,

326
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.490
uh,

327
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:05.490
an inherit provisional major to the text that we read and to the whole of part

328
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.590
two.
As we chat,
I'll suggest later.

329
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:11.720
It's part of it's baroque nature.

330
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.580
It is clear that here essential is playing the role of [inaudible] in this

331
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:22.610
chapter and his wife that of himself as he used to be.

332
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.980
This is hilarious,
which is why he corrects her mistakes when she misspeaks.

333
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:35.010
He's echoing donkey halters ideas re revealing that he has been quick.

334
00:24:35.011 --> 00:24:39.470
So taste,
but also that he has acquired new values.

335
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.570
All this comes out in the discussion of their daughter's marriage,

336
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:48.800
which are,
they are discussing,
uh,
uh,
from,

337
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.850
uh,
different points of view.
Uh,

338
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.500
she wanted him to wanting her to marry her equal and central wanted her to marry

339
00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:01.010
somebody of higher thoughts of the sun and,
and,
and so forth.

340
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.940
Santo social ambition is reflected in his intellectual improvement and swagger.

341
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.190
In part two of the key holder,

342
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.200
Sanjay will play a more central role and proved himself to be capable of things

343
00:25:15.501 --> 00:25:18.830
that would not have been thought possible by the sanctuary of part one.

344
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.910
The changes in central his elevation in status have an ideological dimension as

345
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:27.830
well as an aesthetic.

346
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:32.831
One the poor and humble can learn and advance and novelistic characters move up

347
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:38.540
and down the social ladder.

348
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.540
This element of the Quixote,

349
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.750
which is a political element to anticipates the enlightenment and ideas that

350
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:52.301
lead to concepts about social leveling that will eventually lead to modern

351
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:53.930
conceptions of democracy,

352
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.730
but it also has a profoundly Christian background.

353
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.620
We Can Recall Matthew's Gospel,
Chapter Five,

354
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.700
the opening of the opening words of the sermon on the mount.

355
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.240
I quote,
bless it.
These are the beatitudes.

356
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:15.320
Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

357
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.580
Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted.

358
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.850
Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth on quote.

359
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.470
If characters in novels will evolve,
they do.
So within a social context.

360
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.860
So this is consonant with the political character of the novel,

361
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:39.430
but this has also much to do with the development and evolution of realism in

362
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:43.860
literature,
particularly in the novel.

363
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.400
This brings me to oric our back.

364
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.660
I gave you a handout that happens to be a

365
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.200
happens to be an obituary note.
Oh,
you haven't,
you don't have it yet.

366
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.800
Happens to be an obituary note written by none other than when a Welock Renee.

367
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.270
Well,
it was a great professor here at Yale for many years.

368
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:17.190
The founder of the discipline of comparative literature in the United States.

369
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.200
Uh,
it's so happens that all of the,

370
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.310
all of the professionals and critics that I will be mentioning in my lecture

371
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:30.360
today,
where Yale professors,
uh,
uh,

372
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:35.220
Yale has been at the forefront of literary studies for many,
many years.

373
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.080
And this is a reflection of it.
I didn't plan it this way,
but it's so,
uh,

374
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.040
it's so happens.
So if you have a chance,
read that obituary,
uh,

375
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.840
a note,
but I'll give you a thumbnail sketch of our,

376
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:53.841
our bark and his theories in now the critic who put forth this theory about

377
00:27:55.591 --> 00:28:00.270
Christianity and the development of realism was a rig hour back

378
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.800
in his outstanding book,
me,
Macy's,

379
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.490
the representation of reality in Western literature.

380
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.730
First published in the original German in Switzerland in 1946,

381
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.090
the year after World War,
uh,
the end of World War One.

382
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.960
We will be,
uh,
talking about him,
uh,

383
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.950
next week when you read his essay in the case book,

384
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:29.930
which is drawn from the book me,
Macy's about the enchanted do scenario.

385
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.910
Our back,
uh,
this is my,
my thumbnail sketch of our back.

386
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.870
Uh,
who was Jewish,
was born in Berlin.

387
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.280
He was trained in the German philological tradition and would eventually become

388
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.270
along with Leo Spitzer,
who we will also meet in the case book,

389
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.440
one of his best known scholars after participating as a combatant in world war

390
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.990
and World War One,

391
00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.380
he earned a doctorate in 1921 and in 1929 became a member of the philology

392
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:01.651
faculty.

393
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:06.651
At the University of Marburg polishing a well-received story called Dante poet

394
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:11.751
of the secular world book that is still is red with the riots with the rise of

395
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:13.680
Nazism.
However,

396
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.970
our bank was forced to evacuate his position in 1934 he was thrown out because

397
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:22.920
he was Jewish exile from Nazi Germany.
He took up residence in Istanbul,

398
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.660
Turkey where he wrote me Macy's generally considered his masterwork and one of

399
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:30.540
the best books of literary criticism of the 20th century.

400
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.200
He has said in a moving a statement that uh,
he,

401
00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:36.810
he wrote such a general book because,
uh,

402
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.560
in his temple he did not have his books or his,
the journals that he needed.

403
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.770
So he just went for the big works in Western literature and uh,

404
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:49.771
so it was this terrible circumstances that had the happy result of me Macy's,

405
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:56.090
our back move to the United States in 1947.

406
00:29:56.091 --> 00:29:59.690
First Teaching at Pennsylvania State University and then working at the

407
00:29:59.691 --> 00:30:03.260
Institute for advanced study in Princeton in 1950.

408
00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:06.710
He was made sterling professor of romance languages at Yale,

409
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.620
the position that he held until his death.

410
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:14.390
While here being a professor in 1957 he died in,
in Wallingford.

411
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.730
Uh,
I'd have to say that as a holder myself over sterling chair here and yeah,

412
00:30:19.731 --> 00:30:24.590
like I feel honored and humbled to have a precursor like our back who's working

413
00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:29.090
memory.
I cherish the main,
the main idea of me Macy's,

414
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.120
a broad and profound one is about the Christian mixture of the sublime and the

415
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:39.791
low style in the new testament leading up to the emergence of realism,

416
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.020
the representation of everyday life and common people in serious literature.

417
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:51.380
We take this for granted now,
but it was not so until the new testament,

418
00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.160
this was a break away from the strict distinction

419
00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:01.870
between high and low style in the classical tradition by which the serious Java

420
00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:07.270
like epic and tragedy dealt with outstanding figures including gods and was

421
00:31:07.641 --> 00:31:12.230
written in a high rhetorical style where common speech had no place.

422
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.220
Whereas the minor John has like comedy dealt with low class people who speak in

423
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:21.250
vulgar speech and are invariably comical.

424
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.190
Our back derived his idea

425
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.510
from Saint Augustine and the church father.

426
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.390
The church fathers were those who during the Middle Ages wrote comments on

427
00:31:32.391 --> 00:31:37.210
scripture and expanded and deepened the Christian,
uh,
uh,
uh,

428
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.250
Christian doctrine.
They include,
uh,

429
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:44.780
major philosophers like Saint Thomas Aquinas who wrote in the 13th century.

430
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:47.240
There are Greek fathers and Latin fathers.
I mean,

431
00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:51.780
there is a patrol that is the writing of the fathers in Latin and another one
in,

432
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.480
in Greek Auerbach labels,

433
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.450
separable set Amo Amelie's humble sermon.

434
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

435
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.190
<v 0>This Christian responds to the crystal,
to the classical separation of styles,</v>

436
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.880
which was derived from Aristotle and Roman rhetorical theory.

437
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.930
That separation of style was derived from Aristotle on Roman rhetorical theory.

438
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:32.330
The mixture of the transcendent and the low style is exemplified by Christ's

439
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.600
passion through which the quotidian drama of mankind everyday drama among

440
00:32:38.751 --> 00:32:43.751
assumes more profound meaning life does not end in the brief span of worldly

441
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.820
existence.
Eternity is present in it as a message of hope.

442
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.850
Seth Lehrer,
uh,
writes about our buck,
our,

443
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.860
our back fines and apparently low or humble diction pressed into the service of

444
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:02.540
transcendent spirituality.

445
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.030
Developing an argument of Augustine's here on the power of the Christian word,

446
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:10.460
stripped of the trappings of classical eloquence.

447
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.470
Auerbach sees the progress of late antique and Medieval literature as moving

448
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:19.700
inexorably doors.
The synthesis of the humble and the sublime.

449
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.530
What could say that the Kihatha in bodies such a synthesis of the humble and the

450
00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:29.531
sublime Auerbach's that that to Vico Giambattista Vico he has a very nice brief

451
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:32.170
name,
easy to remember.

452
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.950
It is a great Italian philosopher of the 18th century,

453
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.700
uh,
have been burnt out to show his understanding.

454
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:48.460
Vico Vico found that,
that,
uh,
the stories,

455
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.940
the literature,
uh,

456
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:54.941
the law over people are very much a part of their culture and a,

457
00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:59.000
and has a,
a philosophy.
I'm just simplifying this,

458
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.490
that is very compelling because he says,

459
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.600
the basic argument is that humans understand only that which was created by

460
00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:07.790
humans,
not by God's.
Therefore,

461
00:34:07.791 --> 00:34:12.620
he has the story of mankind begin not with geneses,
but after the flood,

462
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.970
when man remakes on his own,
the world,
uh,

463
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.210
this is just a so that you can read vehicle someday,
uh,

464
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:25.580
as an enticement.
But of course it's a simplification.

465
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.220
Um,
now you will see all of this inaction.

466
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.890
I don't understand much better the essay on the enchanted do scenario,

467
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.150
uh,
with this background.
Having said that,

468
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:45.200
that chapter on the hot day is a very polemical one.

469
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.490
Uh,

470
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:51.260
that was very badly received by Hispanics standby Savantas scholars and it was

471
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:55.770
added to me Macy's later because of through his,
uh,

472
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.310
study of the mixture of styles.
Uh,

473
00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.930
our back comes up with the idea in the end that I think is very questionable

474
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.280
that the Quixote is mainly,
or essentially a comical book,

475
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.760
but we will get to that after you've read that,
uh,

476
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.820
that essay on a chapter that you will have read by then or are reading now that

477
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:18.100
he learned those chapter,
uh,

478
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:23.090
who in Santo tries to convince Don Quixote that this winches that come on from

479
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:27.360
Dunkley's,
uh,
includes dual scenario and a,
and a,

480
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.060
it's an episode that I will be discussing,
uh,

481
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.000
laters and episode that always makes me laugh.
Every time I reread it.
I,

482
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:35.510
uh,

483
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.510
no matter how many thousands of I love particularly one Dorothy Holder reports

484
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:45.600
that the alleged Dulcinea smelled of raw garlic.
Um,

485
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:48.540
that he was,
uh,
this made by this.

486
00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.190
But when you get to talk about that,
but that's part of the humble,
you see,

487
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.160
that's part of the realism that has to do with a comic on the humble and so

488
00:35:56.161 --> 00:36:00.440
forth.
Okay.
So I have been,
uh,

489
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.560
anticipating ideas about the renaissance and the Baroque I need is time that we

490
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:09.561
begin a more focused discussion on this period of Western art and literature is

491
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.750
useful to be able to place a workload.

492
00:36:15.751 --> 00:36:20.700
The Chiota within this periods of art and literature.
It is,

493
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.760
it cannot be the goal of our readings.

494
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:28.780
It's because it's something that helps our enjoyment and understanding of his

495
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:33.090
books.
But,
uh,
uh,
work such as Hipaa does not explain it away,

496
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.400
but no first to have a clear chronological notion.

497
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.650
Little say that the renaissance cover covers from the 14th or 15th century and

498
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:48.330
the Baroque,
the 17th century and parts of the 18th.
So we could have a scheme,

499
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.880
let me see.
I was thinking of how to,
how to,

500
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.020
how to say this is all going to be very simplistic,

501
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:59.730
this middle ages and then from the 14th.

502
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.580
So you're not gonna make it at least readable,
uh,
15th

503
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.270
and 16th centuries
parts of it.

504
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.000
This is the renaissance

505
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.160
and from here through the 18th

506
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.023
is the borough,

507
00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:33.690
which the has the further development is what he called the Rococo in one of my

508
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:35.780
quotes then,
well,

509
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:40.790
it will mention German expressionism at the beginning of the 20th century

510
00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.050
expression issue.
This is a,
do you have an idea?

511
00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.430
<v 1>Okay.
Uh,</v>

512
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.060
so,
uh,

513
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.470
<v 0>so the Rana sounds cover is that from the 14th and the 16th,
uh,</v>

514
00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.670
the for the 14th to the 16th century,
uh,

515
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.360
and the Baroque from the 17th century through the 18th,

516
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.390
the renaissance as we have seen is the period when Western thought breaks away

517
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:20.391
from medieval ideas and practices which were centered on religious doctrine and

518
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:25.851
humanists attempt to revive the classical age Greek and Roman arts and ideas.

519
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.640
It is a more secular period in which neoplatonism is one of the principle trains

520
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:33.323
of thought.

521
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:38.080
Basically the idea of achieved through love and the possibility of achieving

522
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:42.790
perfection by imitating the harmonious forms of classical art.

523
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.560
That is an inherent optimism in the renaissance and in humanism in general.

524
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.710
Because it is hoped that the revival of the classical past,

525
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:56.670
we'll Rianna mate revive the present and bring back a golden age as we saw

526
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:00.760
expressed by Don Quixote's speech.
Also,

527
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:05.350
there is a confidence there is confidence in human agency and the ability to

528
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:08.710
bring about perfection to the practice of classical norms.

529
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.240
You Tapia is one of the renaissance ideas and ideals which gain concretion in

530
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.100
Thomas [inaudible] famous book Utopia,

531
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.760
the perfect society.
It's attainable through the application of rational,

532
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:24.960
rational norms.

533
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.850
There can be a perfect ruler as prescribed by Machiavelli,
the prince,

534
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:35.120
and a perfect Kurt here as described by Castiglione in the book of the culture,

535
00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:36.720
uh,

536
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.720
and even a perfect night as presented in the romances of chivalrous 14th 15th

537
00:39:42.991 --> 00:39:47.580
century.
Nature and his representation can be harmonious and beautiful.

538
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.780
Perfect beauty is available in nature and attainable in art.

539
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.581
They buy.

540
00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:57.390
Rock on the other hand is an age in which disappointment with these ideas and

541
00:39:57.391 --> 00:40:02.391
aspirations are expressed and the perfect forms of the renaissance are twisted

542
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:07.491
and turned to generate a complicated convoluted form of art that has often been

543
00:40:09.061 --> 00:40:12.990
seen as the blending of renaissance forms with gothic ones.

544
00:40:12.991 --> 00:40:17.640
By looking back to the Middle Ages,
therefore they buy rock would be

545
00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:24.530
turning this renaissance neoclassical forms back to the Middle Ages on to uh,

546
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.790
the uh,
uh,
the gothic.

547
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:34.830
Think of the gothic cathedrals like that and think of classicism,

548
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.610
US building

549
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.763
<v 1>like that.</v>

550
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:40.990
<v 0>This is all very simplified,</v>

551
00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:45.991
but I want you to have clear ideas which you can then complicate where there,

552
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.300
where there is light in the renaissance.

553
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.440
There is darkness or at least [inaudible] the word that I introduced you to

554
00:40:53.441 --> 00:40:58.441
before in the baroque and mixture of darkness and light discussions of the

555
00:40:59.801 --> 00:41:01.270
priest and the barber with Gnocchi.

556
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.280
Haughty seemed to center on the disappointments of the age along with the game

557
00:41:06.851 --> 00:41:10.330
of illusions.
Part two is going to be that of Baroque,

558
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.010
this in Ganja

559
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:18.850
word that I mentioned before that I'm going to mention again today and discuss

560
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:19.840
in some detail.

561
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

562
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:27.720
<v 0>When the games brewed to be nothing more than that,
games have illusions.</v>

563
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:32.080
Renaissance optimism gives way to baroque this illusion man.

564
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.230
The commonplace then is that part one of the Quixote belongs to the renaissance

565
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.430
and part two to the Baroque.

566
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.110
Think of the two ages that Elliott spoke about in that quote that I read to you

567
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.070
from the book,

568
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.660
one of imperial expansion and another of imperial retreat.

569
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.060
This is an oversimplification of course,

570
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.660
but there is enough truth in it to merit consideration.

571
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.280
So I will devote some time to the concept of Baroque today.

572
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.070
In general,
what is understood,
what is understood by Baroque in general,

573
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:11.990
people have a general idea,
a vague idea.
This is very baroque.

574
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:18.020
You mean by that is something very complicated,
needlessly complicated.
Uh,

575
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.580
Webster's definition is good enough,
irregular in shape like some Paris,

576
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:26.990
actually the name Baroque comes with the names of some irregular Paris,

577
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.030
Paris,
artistically irregular in Congress or fantastic

578
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.920
as a style of architectural.

579
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:41.870
And other decoration of the 17th and 18th century,
tasteless Lee,

580
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.510
odd,
bizarre,
and grotesque.

581
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.180
You do not want to be called Baroque.

582
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:54.260
Some of his features are excessive accumulation,
difficulty,

583
00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:58.850
obscurity,
and literally darkness.
Carroll school.

584
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.230
A good example,

585
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.590
a good example is Bernini's Saint Teresa in ecstasy.

586
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:08.723
<v 1>Oh,</v>

587
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.660
<v 0>you have a problem of Chiaroscuro here,</v>

588
00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:16.563
<v 1>okay.</v>

589
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.130
<v 0>Where one sees the effects of the spiritual or the physical,</v>

590
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.370
which cannot express the sublime feeling of union with God.

591
00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.660
You can see she said,
ecstasies and the falls over clothing,

592
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:39.880
uh,
express,
uh,
this sublime feeling of union clothing,

593
00:43:39.881 --> 00:43:44.881
expressing mood by his foals body covered except for the hand and the foot.

594
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:50.050
Like I see a foot there on the face.
Of course,

595
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.150
in that moment of ecstasy,

596
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:58.300
this is certainly not a renaissance,
uh,
statute.
Uh,

597
00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:02.440
think of a Michelangelo,
the David,
something like that.

598
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:07.210
This is not because of,
of it's twists and folds and,
and,
and so forth.

599
00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:11.130
This is a,
a better Nini,
uh,
stature,
typical of the Baroque.

600
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.700
Another good example is Antonio Perez,

601
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.630
the Cavaliers Dream,
uh,

602
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:24.310
where the ephemeral nature of the reel is emphasized.
And of course,

603
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.200
the,
the Baroque,
uh,
emphasizes,
uh,
uh,

604
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:32.790
images of death and of decay.
So his,
uh,

605
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.320
uh,
turns into a theater death,
uh,

606
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:42.210
books,
uh,
and so forth.
This is a baroque dream that this,

607
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:46.140
uh,
that this,
uh,
uh,
cavalier,

608
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.220
uh,
is having his name is,
uh,
by the way,

609
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:54.750
I'm Tonio pay data and the previous one is Bernini.
Um,

610
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.390
so I wanted you to have those,

611
00:44:57.391 --> 00:45:00.510
but I'm going to give you some more examples that are close at hand.

612
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.220
So let me comment on a few quotations on the Baroque.

613
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.200
The first one is from Jose [inaudible],

614
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.830
who was also a professor at Yale for many years.
The alien and professor.

615
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.000
He died about two years ago at age,
about 98.
Uh,

616
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.563
he wrote,

617
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:30.180
it is generally agreed today that the Baroque was in Europe and artistic climate

618
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:33.240
created by the spiritual climate of the counter reformation.

619
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:36.000
Now you know what the counter reformation is having where Elliot,

620
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.290
that movement in Spain that counter the reformation in the rest of Europe,

621
00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:44.310
mostly Germany,
uh,
the council of Trent and all of that,

622
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:49.490
I go on with this climate acted like I was like an obscure force that pushed

623
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:54.880
Dorthy return to what it was before the eruption of the renaissance because

624
00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.480
return back to the middle ages

625
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:04.710
to jump back to grounds that because they had not been turned,

626
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.160
appear to be more secure in this job back.

627
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:12.710
Europeans constrained by the landscape of their own history fell onto

628
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.220
intellectual and artistic currents that were aesthetically akin to the gothic

629
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.910
and intellectually to the Middle Ages.
The gothic,

630
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:26.070
my depiction there of the Gothic cathedral on quote,

631
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:27.300
I mean Spain,

632
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.950
the renewal of scholastic thought and the retrenchment brought about by the

633
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:36.270
counter reformation in general signify this and our uh,

634
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:40.050
and lead towards the,
the,
the rock.
Because I can be of course,

635
00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:44.500
no returning history of what turns out is something completely new.
The,
the,

636
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.530
the mixture,
they very uneasy mixture of renaissance forms,
uh,

637
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:52.020
with medieval ones.
And that turns out to be,
then they will rock you.

638
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.150
I hope you follow this back and forth.

639
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.370
The next quote is from Bernay Welock,

640
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.550
uh,
whom I mentioned before,

641
00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:09.510
a great professor of comparative literature here of check origin,

642
00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.830
the concept of Baroque and literary scholarship.
This is a little more,

643
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.770
he's a little denser because he has to do with the,

644
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.780
with the critical concept of the Baroque.
What I want you to have an idea of it.

645
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:26.910
We're like traces the development of the term baroque above all,

646
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:30.070
it's transfer from art history to historiography.

647
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.270
The Tampa rock began as a term of art history.

648
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.390
He links to dissemination of the concept to the use of oss roles that that that

649
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.970
Osho Spangler makes over in the decline of the West.

650
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:47.740
The decline of the west by Oswald Spengler was a very,

651
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:50.440
very important book in the 20th century,

652
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.450
late twenties late teens,
early twenties who are 20th century,

653
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.370
the decline of the worst.

654
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:07.360
It was a book that was misused by the Nazis and so forth.
That was very powerful.

655
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.900
I see it as a synthesis of Hegel and Nicha,
but that's too much to,

656
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:16.120
to explain today.
Um,

657
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.850
on establish the relationship established with expressionism at the beginning of

658
00:48:21.851 --> 00:48:26.240
the 20th century.
Welock thinks that the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
um,
uh,

659
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:30.700
popularity of,
of the Baroque came because critics saw in expressionism,

660
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:34.120
which is a kind of poetry in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century,

661
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:37.210
in the 1920s,
very convoluted,
complicated poetry.

662
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:42.520
They saw that as a kind of return to the Baroque.

663
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:47.320
I hope this,
this very crude,
uh,
uh,
uh,

664
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.160
drawing of mine,
uh,
can help you visualize all of this

665
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:58.040
distinguishes between those who want to turn but rock into a typology.

666
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:03.400
That is that the whole of art history is a back and forth between renaissance

667
00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:04.251
and Baroque.

668
00:49:04.251 --> 00:49:07.670
Renaissance and Baroque is like all others who have tried to turn all of

669
00:49:07.671 --> 00:49:10.070
literary history to Romanticism and the enlightenment,

670
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.660
a romanticism or neoclassicism he's,
he's,
he's against,
uh,
all of those.

671
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.020
Um,
and this is the most important quote.

672
00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.480
See if I can unpack it for you.

673
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:25.510
The word here that is important is that big word there.

674
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.510
What is steam is fish Emmy's.
Synesthesia means to express

675
00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:36.800
one,
uh,
um,
uh,
sense through another.
There is,

676
00:49:36.801 --> 00:49:39.350
when you say,
oh,
it's a blue sound,

677
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:45.120
that's the same as this year or a shrill color shrill is sound and you apply it

678
00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:47.690
to color that is same as Theseus is a,

679
00:49:47.691 --> 00:49:51.200
it's a combination of sensations from various sensors,

680
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:55.490
a used one for the owner.
You understand what I'm trying to say?
Is that clear?

681
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.220
Okay.
For many other writers,

682
00:49:58.221 --> 00:50:02.720
it would be possible to see an in an individual connection between the

683
00:50:02.721 --> 00:50:06.980
emblematic image and their belief in the pervasive parallelism between

684
00:50:06.981 --> 00:50:07.761
macrocosm,

685
00:50:07.761 --> 00:50:12.620
the macrocosm in some vast system of correspondences which can be expressed only

686
00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:16.700
by sensuous symbolism.
The prevalence of Synesthesia,

687
00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.350
which in the renaissance apparently occurs only under such traditional figures

688
00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.730
as the music of the spheres.

689
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:27.820
But during the Baroque boldly hears callers and see sounds in another,
you know,

690
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.370
is another indication of this belief in a multiple web of interrelations.

691
00:50:32.371 --> 00:50:35.300
Of course,
uh,
correspondences in the universe.

692
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.510
What this means is the following in the Baroque,

693
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:44.110
there is an attempt to reconstitute the kind of unified conception of the

694
00:50:45.621 --> 00:50:49.310
universe that was prevalent in the Middle Ages and that you see in Dante.

695
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.740
And that you see in the,
in the,
uh,

696
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:55.790
in the gothic cathedrals all center on the figure of the Christian God and in

697
00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:56.720
all symbolism,

698
00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:02.060
everything connected to it in a very harmonious and satisfying hole where

699
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:06.860
everything has a meaning and a place in the baroque,

700
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:12.160
this set of correspondences tries the right are some of the act.

701
00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:16.070
The artists try to reconstruct the set of correspondences.

702
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.770
But this is a world that is no longer centered.
Remember,

703
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:22.170
it's a word that is post Copernican and he's,
he's a,
it's,
it's,

704
00:51:22.171 --> 00:51:26.660
it's a word you're in which a Galileo is producing his theories.

705
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.490
And so he said decentered world.

706
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.990
So the Baroque is an effort through synesthesia that is to express the

707
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:36.380
correspondence was between colors and sounds,
uh,
and,
and,

708
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:41.381
and so forth to reconstruct through art that um,

709
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.380
uh,

710
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:47.380
set of correspondences that harmonious world that is no longer a available.

711
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.290
And this is what gives the baroque this a tension.

712
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

713
00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:04.260
<v 0>The way that I explain that the renaissance and Baroque is think of Binaca Plaza</v>

714
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:11.530
Binaca Plaza with this columns.
Uh,
it's uh,

715
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.220
like the renaissance only got eight is an 18th century kind of neoclassicism.

716
00:52:15.221 --> 00:52:19.750
But think of it,
it is a,
uh,
that kind of classical shape.

717
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:24.190
Sterling Memorial Library is Gothic neogothic.

718
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.590
Okay.
Neogothic uh,

719
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:32.700
I often say that the Mcdonald's arches more genuine don our neogothic,

720
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:37.710
but nevertheless it's neogothic and so they have a rope would be a very eh

721
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.930
forced combination of Beinecke Plaza and Sterling Memorial Library.

722
00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.940
That would be,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the barrel.

723
00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:53.370
Now the baroque now in parts one and two of the chaotic,

724
00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:57.850
we have spoken about Baroque elements in part one,

725
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
but particularly the grotesque in characters like a merito torness the play of

726
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:08.560
illusion and reality and the multiplicity of fictional levels.

727
00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:13.750
The Carroll school,
all the episodes in the,
in the 19 self,

728
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.320
which is to cruise a combination of things to go test combination thing,

729
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:23.040
but part of one's still contains many elements of what could still be called

730
00:53:24.101 --> 00:53:24.934
renaissance.

731
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.570
This is so particularly in characters which as Marcella and Dorothea whose

732
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:33.570
beauty and perfection reflect neoplatonic ideas.

733
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.020
The same is true of some of the settings,

734
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.770
particularly the locals are menus that I've mentioned several times.

735
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:46.190
We're doterra appears washing her feet in an episode in which the classical

736
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:49.320
background seems to be derived from orbit.

737
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.990
As Tony reminded me once and I didn't give him credit for this is uh,

738
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.270
uh,
uh,
an obedient scene,
uh,

739
00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.130
and the rewriting of classical models is very much a renaissance feature by the

740
00:54:02.131 --> 00:54:02.964
way,

741
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
nature present because so much of part one takes place outdoors appears to be

742
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:13.071
plenty for an orderly except when [inaudible] gets a sudden and unexpected

743
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:16.110
sexual urge and provokes a row.
As we remember,

744
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:22.290
there is also a kind of underlying sense of optimism and mirth in part one.

745
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.320
Even when Gnocchi hope this return home in a cage which was which had something

746
00:54:28.171 --> 00:54:31.230
kind of a left about it.
Remember that he gets home on a Sunday

747
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.940
and after all the various amorous conflicts are resolved except for the last one

748
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:43.140
whose resolution is not clear because it's still going on the we withdrawals to

749
00:54:43.141 --> 00:54:45.090
Fernando and seen that we've got Daniel.

750
00:54:45.091 --> 00:54:49.260
The captive is going to Marisol either Lewis,
Clara and so forth.

751
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:53.040
Don't holders interventions have an affirmative effect in the end.

752
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.930
The commonplace about this is that renaissance aesthetics are based on an idea

753
00:54:57.931 --> 00:54:58.764
of order,

754
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.860
symmetry and perfection obtained by the mutation of classical models and the

755
00:55:04.021 --> 00:55:08.880
striving for humanly attainable goals.
Human agencies,

756
00:55:08.881 --> 00:55:11.010
self fashioning,
straight angles,

757
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:15.090
horizontal lines meeting vertical ones ordered repetition,
the columns,

758
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.770
all these are renaissance feature.
The repetition of all the stories.

759
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:23.880
It's like those columns.
Part two however,

760
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.400
is going to be much more baroque.

761
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:30.630
I have already said that much of it takes place within buildings and that it is

762
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:31.830
generally darker.

763
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:36.540
There is a Carroll school quality to it and the Chiaroscuro as I have been

764
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.730
saying,
it's typical of the Baroque.

765
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:42.360
There are more grotesque elements made up of the disparate,

766
00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:45.180
the contrasting and the ugly.
Here,

767
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:50.130
the key figure about which I will be speaking in other classes is the monster is

768
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:53.340
going to take place.
Uh,
part two is going to take place,

769
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:55.620
not in India or in nature,

770
00:55:55.621 --> 00:56:00.621
but in lavish country and urban houses they were rogue tends to be built up to

771
00:56:01.981 --> 00:56:04.140
be complex.
In part two.

772
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:09.141
We have not so much nature as architecture or what I like to call arch texture,

773
00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:15.630
a texture that is intensified.
Therefore arch texture.

774
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.370
The multiplicity of fictional levels is going to increase by the fact that the

775
00:56:20.371 --> 00:56:22.440
characters now,
uh,

776
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:27.160
no and discuss part one and by the appearance of again Neda's Apocryphal Quixote

777
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.680
is central theme and narrative device of part two is going to be disengaged.

778
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:38.140
Knew this illusion meant which could be the overarching direction and shape of

779
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:41.950
the plot.
In fact,

780
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:46.510
one could say that the whole of part two is leading to death and Ganja.

781
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:52.360
This is going to be the end of part two.
Uh,

782
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:57.430
and this end Ganja is perhaps the most important element of the Spanish Baroque.

783
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:58.560
Uh,

784
00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.860
I am going to leave it there except to point out that I have given you in the,

785
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:03.783
in the,
uh,

786
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:10.350
in the handout with the map of Spain behind you will see a quote from our grassy

787
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.890
ants,
l critical me,

788
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:19.240
which is a definition of design Ganglia that I'm going to begin the next lecture

789
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:22.870
with as I applied to the evolution,

790
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.320
the unfolding of the plot of the Quixote.
