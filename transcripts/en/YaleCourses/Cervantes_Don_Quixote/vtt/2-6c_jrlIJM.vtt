WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.250
Now,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.660
let us begin today with,

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.700
uh,

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.890
just some general issues that I think are very pertinent to the reading of the,

5
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.080
uh,
key hotel.
Uh,

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.690
how significant is it that the Quixote is written in prose?

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.320
Uh,
not inverse.
Uh,

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.460
the pros,

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
it is because it is the pros of the world of everyday life.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.270
Everyday life is prosaic.

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
And this is the life that he's been depicted in the copy.

12
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.540
It is devoid of the order and the rhythm of poetry.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.783
Uh,

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.880
hence the novel from now on will be written in prose with exceptions.

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.820
Uh,

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.650
remember my illusion in the last lecture to the divine comedy and the order of

17
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:06.651
the divine comedy and that Central Line in the very middle of the whole comedy

18
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.530
alluding,
uh,
to Dante and,
uh,

19
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.560
and the very highly structured,
uh,

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.180
nature of that poem down to the tercets and to every line when it's a,

21
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.990
when is a rhyme with his rhythm,
with this meter,
uh,

22
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.410
the same of course,
it's true of the need,
uh,

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.120
with its exquisite a forum and a non shape,

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.460
uh,
index.
Uh,
what he's represented is the,
uh,

25
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.200
I repeat that prosaic.

26
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.360
The prosaic is that which is common and ordinary are not apt to be expressed in

27
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.690
verse,
although they are,

28
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.420
as you have seen in some episodes,
uh,
bits of,
uh,

29
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.430
verse.
Now,

30
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.560
another general issue after the Marcella episode,

31
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.320
remember when Don Quixote interferes and doesn't allow anyone,
uh,
to,

32
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.620
uh,
to chase her into the woods,

33
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.510
uh,

34
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.640
we have to ponder if the key heartache you've don't get hot days a hero.

35
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.690
Uh,
if he,
if he is a,
how does he differ from Ulysses,

36
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.850
from an Esbl,
from the city,

37
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.240
from [inaudible] and other heroes of the preceding Western literary tradition?

38
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.630
Easy,
mostly a Moro hero.

39
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.610
This is something that we should ponder us.

40
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:53.910
We continue to read the novel.

41
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.750
I'm the last general issue that I like bring up is again,
the issue of irony.

42
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.330
Jose Ortega,

43
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.180
who was a very important Spanish philosopher of the 20th century,

44
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.510
the most important Spanish philosophy philosopher

45
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.750
of the 20th century.

46
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.780
He's known in the English speaking world mostly,
uh,

47
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.150
for a book called the rebellion of the masses.
Uh,
and,

48
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.220
uh,
also,
uh,

49
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.960
for he also a very important book on the Quixote Meditations on the Quixote.

50
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.810
And,
uh,

51
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.810
yet I know there that is even better now than that book called the

52
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.630
dehumanization of art,
which is about the avant garde,

53
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.920
the art of the avant garde.
He said,

54
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.450
irony is instead of saying what we think we fame to think what we say,

55
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.430
irony constitutes an unfolding is splitting up into two,

56
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.030
such as in the prologue of the quarter when the narrator splits into two,

57
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:23.110
by creating the friend,
uh,
who comes to advice him.

58
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.640
Uh,
in irony,

59
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:32.641
there is this splitting because there is a need of another who knows that,

60
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.480
who understands the do blown toned irony,

61
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.550
uh,
can become sarcastic but not instead of one.

62
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.530
Disadvantage is irony as you have already noticed.

63
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.530
I'm sure it's mild and humorous rather than a cutting or sarcastic,

64
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.940
uh,
the dialogue of,
of which the anguish,
the,

65
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.020
the book depends so much,
uh,
is essentially ironic because,

66
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.530
uh,

67
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.530
we can see the errors of both protagonists as they speak with each other.

68
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.130
Errors are they point out to each other.
The case of Don Quixote,

69
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.070
as you will notice,
uh,
once and again,

70
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.580
he points out the errors at central makes in speaking,

71
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.800
but Santo will also catch donkey hope,
the,

72
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.540
a few mistakes himself.
Now we move to a,

73
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.990
uh,
uh,

74
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.670
one of the fate of my favorite parts in the book,

75
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.000
which are the scenes in one Palo Meccas in.

76
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.770
You don't have to remember the names of these characters.

77
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.320
Name is one follow manky.

78
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.780
I'm sure you did not quite
retain this name.

79
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.550
He is the innkeeper,

80
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.320
the most important innkeeper in the first part of the Quixote

81
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.780
among the most famous and important episodes in Don Quixote.

82
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.480
Those at his ID.

83
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.210
I have already spoken about the importance of ends in the plot of the Quixote

84
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.730
when commenting upon the first in,
uh,
in which don't.
Quixote was knighted.

85
00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:22.290
If you remember Karlovic say league,
uh,
retired.

86
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:26.670
Now Professor at Columbia University wrote formally,

87
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.440
structurally,
thematically the in is an important focal point.

88
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.830
That place of configurations and Conflations Ins,

89
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.040
uh,

90
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.040
Endeca haughty or in Cervantes are derived from the picaresque tradition where

91
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:48.050
they figure very prominently in books like Lasa Ego.

92
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.280
They Doremus and Guzman,

93
00:06:50.281 --> 00:06:54.060
the Al Farace that I have mentioned here several times.

94
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.120
Uh,
in those books,

95
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.230
the ins play a similar role.

96
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.830
In fact,
as we remarked,

97
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.310
the first innkeeper was a retired Picato and he tells with relish his life of

98
00:07:13.261 --> 00:07:18.090
picaresque adventures,
uh,
where he visited or stayed at the,

99
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.280
uh,
the most notorious,
bigger ask and Poria throughout Spain.

100
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.530
<v 0>Uh,</v>

102
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.530
I also spoke of how ins provide a kind of archeology of society using that

103
00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.460
metaphor because,
uh,

104
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.940
characters from different social classes and professions,
meat in them.

105
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.190
Uh,

106
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:46.190
the one run by Huang Pal Omega is by far the most important building in part one

107
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.740
of the key hope that even more important than no Quixote's house in part two,

108
00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:56.040
there will be other buildings us,
you will discover.

109
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.433
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

110
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.840
<v 0>I again emphasize that is good to remember the names of these,
uh,</v>

111
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.150
secondary characters like one Palo Mekhi who played,

112
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.780
who plays a significant role in the novel.
They sometimes,

113
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.090
as I have already mentioned,
have interesting names.
Uh,

114
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.040
in some cases the names are interesting because they are so common as better or

115
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:25.720
alone.
So remember the neighbor who picks him up or pedal berries,

116
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.510
the priest and so forth.
In the case of one Palo [inaudible],

117
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.540
his last name,
uh,
something to do with pigeons.

118
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.540
Paloma is a pigeon in,
uh,
in Spanish.
Uh,

119
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.330
the Aka,
uh,
ending.
It's,
uh,

120
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.610
it doesn't sound very good like opening the whole tape.

121
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:47.780
[inaudible] uh,

122
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.050
so it's the last name that is mostly a funny,
um,

123
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.260
now if the road as we have come here to have a wealth,

124
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:02.970
we have arrived at the end coming on the road was for the most part is sunny

125
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.990
bright realm and this will change in the episodes after the,

126
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:11.640
in the,
in his,
uh,
in a kind of [inaudible].

127
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.830
I'm sure you've heard this word,
but I,

128
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.020
I guess I'm a determined to teach you a lot of very pedantic words that you can

129
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:23.940
use in further life,
even if you become a lawyer or something.

130
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.010
<v 0>Yeah.
[inaudible] in Italian means bright,
dark.
Uh,</v>

132
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.370
it's a combination of darkness,
right.
Uh,

133
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.100
and is normally associated with baroque art.

134
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.500
Uh,
and I will be speaking about the Baroque in,
uh,

135
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.320
later lectures because the,

136
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.860
the cliche is that this,

137
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.010
the first part of the Quixote Quixote is mostly renaissance.

138
00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:59.620
And the second part is Baroque.
This is one of those cliches,

139
00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:02.140
but so I'll be talking about,
uh,
the baroque,

140
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.720
but so it,
it is a dark place.
Uh,

141
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.680
one Palo [inaudible],
uh,
in,
uh,
people eat,

142
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.573
fight,

143
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.590
have erotic encounters and live in very close proximity,

144
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.740
very close proximity as you have noticed,

145
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.830
making for a great deal of friction,

146
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.830
real and metaphoric.

147
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.930
This case as the characters rub against each other in the very confined,

148
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:35.800
uh,
uh,
quarters of this,
uh,
of this in,

149
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.340
<v 1>okay.</v>

150
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.960
<v 0>Now I think the humor is very theatrical.</v>

151
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.850
They are like a stage and a,
in fact,

152
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:49.400
in later episodes,
uh,

153
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.540
the [inaudible] will become really a stage with characters coming in and out,

154
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:56.130
like actors on a stage,

155
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.400
a theatrical in the sense of slapstick comedy,

156
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.530
slapstick comedy because it's a comedy in which characters hit each other with

157
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:12.240
that,
uh,
stick that houses slap that goes and makes,
makes,

158
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.870
makes it sound like it's a very hard blow.

159
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.730
You hit somebody bow on,
it sounds,
it comes from the commedia Dell'arte.

160
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:25.680
Commedia Dell'arte was a kind of a spat over Italian,

161
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.633
uh,

162
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.880
<v 1>Si.</v>

163
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.880
<v 0>Oh,
of the 15th century century</v>

164
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.540
in which there was no dialogue,
uh,

165
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.420
the characters just slapped each other and kicked each other and so forth.

166
00:11:41.421 --> 00:11:43.640
I went around the,
the,
the,

167
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.080
the word in Spanish for slapstick is very,
uh,
funny.

168
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:52.640
It's called topic Carlos.
Mark topic gallows.

169
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.480
I even the native speakers didn't know that word.

170
00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.500
Mattapan sin killer.

171
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.340
He's a stick with which you hit somebody else.

172
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:10.960
And so it's a slapstick kind of comedy.

173
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.270
Uh,
this comedy involves physical violence,

174
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.070
mistaken identities,
and rowdy behavior in episode.

175
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:25.300
So,
such as these surrounded,
this place is talent for comedy,

176
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.230
which you put to good use writing his very successful enter emesis or

177
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:36.730
interludes.
Remember,
the premise is the one act

178
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.740
funny place

179
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.600
that is usually stage between acts or the larger play.

180
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.320
Uh,
humor

181
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.990
culminates in this episodes when don't keyholders imaginings,

182
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.520
uh,

183
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520
suddenly appear to Mesh with what is happening in the tawdry world in which he

184
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.020
finds himself.

185
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.230
He takes the innkeeper for a noble money whose castle as he did with the first

186
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.270
in and muddy tornness as a Damsel in love with him when she is really an ugly

187
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:22.410
prostitute on her way to meet the carrier who happens to be lodging there to,

188
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.820
uh,
the point,
uh,

189
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.940
seems to be that even the rather concrete reality,

190
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:39.030
tangible reality of the [inaudible] can be transformed by the characters needs,

191
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.374
desires,

192
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.410
and imaginings because this is as far as possible from a,

193
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.950
a castle and the characters as far as possible,
uh,

194
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.100
from those,
uh,
in the romances,
uh,
uh,
of chivalry,

195
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.870
donkey Hotez erotic desires have been aroused by the innkeepers daughter.

196
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.080
Remember,
the innkeeper has a young daughter,
uh,

197
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.140
whom we imagine as a mere teenager and it's described in the text,

198
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.740
does quote very calmly young maiden.

199
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.110
Uh,

200
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.400
this episode is the most explicit erotic display by Don Quixote in the entire

201
00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:31.900
book,
uh,
erotic in,
in,

202
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:35.440
in a sense of like explicit sexuality,

203
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.320
uh,
is the,

204
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.830
is the most explicit in the whole book.

205
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.800
Now mark,
but more than anything,

206
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.830
the episodes at the end or an instance of the social being subverted by erotic

207
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:50.734
desire

208
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.030
dot of the carrier [inaudible] uh,

209
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.740
as well as donkey Otis,
the ensuing violence involved,

210
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.770
even the law as the representative of the Holy Brotherhood intervenes and

211
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:10.970
remember brains Gnocchi hotel with a candle holder in the,

212
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.740
in the darkness of the,
of the inn.

213
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.970
What does this show that the solely made it arrows of the literary tradition has

214
00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:26.281
its counterpart perhaps is real driving force in this own least erotic forces

215
00:15:27.611 --> 00:15:31.470
that propel the characters to virus said,
rant.

216
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.590
This is not moralizing here at,
and he hardly ever does.

217
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.180
All he seems to be doing is showing the real estate,

218
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.540
worst subconscious of literature,
the counterpart,
let's say,

219
00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:46.720
of the romances of chivalry and the pastoral,

220
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.350
what lurks underneath the romances of chivalry and the pastoral.

221
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.040
This is the reason for the darkness represents all of these forces as opposed to

222
00:15:58.031 --> 00:16:03.031
the pastor or pastoral literature always occurs in daylight and the EC logs,

223
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.910
it clogs our long poems on a pastoral theme.

224
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.080
The most famous whereby Virgil,

225
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:13.630
<v 1>yeah,</v>

226
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:18.540
<v 0>the time of an AEC log is the,
the,
the time span of a day.</v>

227
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.860
So here it is the complete opposite,
the darkness,

228
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.750
revealing the real forces underneath those,

229
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.050
uh,
pastoral,
uh,

230
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.760
poems and so forth on,
on,
on,
on the,
and the romances of,

231
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.100
of jewelry.
Now,

232
00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:42.620
let me go over the cast of characters in a Hawaiian Palo MCAS.

233
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.830
As you,
I'm sure have no deuced already.

234
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.370
Cervantes relishes in the presentation of characters drawn from the lower strata

235
00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:57.600
of society and tries to give a rounded view of them,

236
00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.780
meaning that along with their coarseness,

237
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.570
they often display kindness and human understanding.
These characters,

238
00:17:06.571 --> 00:17:07.080
again,

239
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.080
are drawn from the picaresque put also drawn from the extensive juridical or

240
00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:19.920
judicial,
uh,
documents of the period.
Uh,

241
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.330
Spain generated a very extensive,
uh,

242
00:17:24.331 --> 00:17:27.530
judicial system in the 16th century,
uh,

243
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.870
with hundreds and thousands of documents stored in archives,
uh,

244
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.880
about the comings and goings of characters such as the ones we see here.

245
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.830
<v 1>Buck Cervantes,</v>

246
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.630
<v 0>as I always emphasize,</v>

247
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.890
tries to give a rounded view of this card is drawn from the Loris classes and

248
00:17:47.891 --> 00:17:52.350
also from the criminal,
uh,
classes,
uh,

249
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.230
rounded view showing that they can be kind also,

250
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.730
and they are not stereotypes.
They are individually,

251
00:17:59.731 --> 00:18:04.731
they do individualized by their moral and their physical features.

252
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.440
The best case is Marty tornness,

253
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.610
Marty turnesa character.
But who am I to speak now when my hope,

254
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:16.890
whose name I hope you will retain.

255
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.650
I've mentioned her a couple of times where I want you to remember her name.
Uh,

256
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.960
uh,
from now on,
uh,

257
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.370
they all have individual features,
uh,
uh,

258
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.930
physical as well as moral.

259
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.500
The first character is the innkeeper one part Omega in pseudo the lefthanded

260
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.720
lefty.
I'll speak about that in a minute.

261
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.000
Remember I told you to look for details and this is an insignificant detail as

262
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.880
you will see it little later.
Look for details.

263
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.140
Um,

264
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.920
his wife and the daughter.
Those are the,

265
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.990
that's the family running the,

266
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.370
in a number two,
mighty thorniness.

267
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.480
G is an historian Wench,
meaning,

268
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.640
uh,
who in spite of,
of,
of,
of her profession is kind doors,

269
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:19.340
Don Quixote on Santa's,
remember that,

270
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.640
that she gives him drink at the end when he's leaving and,
and so forth.

271
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:28.641
So he's very kind to her notice that she is from a studious.

272
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.860
There are maps of Spain in the website and I have an urgent you to,

273
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.950
uh,
to use them so that you can situate yourself.
Uh,

274
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.640
we have now met the,
uh,
uh,

275
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.590
bask or be scanner as Jarvis calls him,
who from the Basque country's.

276
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:51.210
Remember I spoke about the,
the Basques.
Uh,

277
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.250
we met the young wind sense to,
we're really from Galicia,
Northwestern,
Spain.

278
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.680
Um,
the,
uh,
uh,

279
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.400
and here we have some more from a studious,
uh,

280
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.670
the Galicians are a of Celtic origin.
There are something like the Irish,

281
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.740
uh,
they,
uh,
they play back pipes like the,
uh,

282
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.030
like the Irish.
I hate back pipes,
uh,
but the,

283
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:25.940
the deletions are known for their bagpipes.
Uh,
uh,

284
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.860
I'll,
I'll speak more about the Galician.
So as we,
as,
as,
as we go on.
But Thor,

285
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.320
this is from our studious and northern,
uh,

286
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.340
the region of Spain.

287
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.240
<v 2>Uh,</v>

288
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.470
<v 0>they are very proud.</v>

289
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:48.950
You're serious because the reconquest war against the Moore's began in a

290
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:54.100
studious.
So they take great pride in that,

291
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:57.820
that it began right away after the,
the more,
uh,
occupied Spain.

292
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.010
Uh,
so the fact that she says Durian might be a joke on the part of,
uh,

293
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:08.020
of Savannah,
this very proud of here we have an a storium prostitute,

294
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:14.300
uh,
and said when this was a,
obviously a proud,
uh,

295
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.300
Castilian so,
uh,
he,
he,
he,
he has,

296
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.420
uh,
enough,
uh,
custodians who are not exactly,
uh,

297
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.090
being as being,
uh,
one one to be proud of.
But I mean,
he,

298
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:33.250
he has,
if you a particular view of the people from various regions of Spain.

299
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.740
So muddy is,

300
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.100
is a wench from a studious.

301
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.200
She takes pride in being reliable and head professional dealings as a whore.

302
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.940
She keeps her dates in this case with catastrophic results.

303
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:55.210
Nobody.
Tardiness is,
no princess has don Quixote imagines g is responsible with,

304
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.600
uh,
within their profession and generous.
So rant.

305
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.460
This is not a moral relativist,

306
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:05.461
but he has an understanding of human frailty and the tumbles of individual fade.

307
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.590
If you read with care,

308
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.540
you will have learned that muddy Torres is a prostitute because of a series of

309
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.580
misfortunes.
Soft brought her down,

310
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.210
not because she's inherently inclined to sin.

311
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.610
And as I I've said and I emphasize she's ethical within the expectations of her

312
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:25.720
traits she delivers.

313
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.580
Cervantes also like to show how morality can be a coward,

314
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.640
coherent within a given context.

315
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:35.680
You will see this better in part two.

316
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:40.390
When there is a gang of outlaws and we thin that gang within its rules,

317
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:44.020
there are sets of,
um,
of,
uh,

318
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.000
of ethical behavior,
uh,
in his own case.

319
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.150
If you have read the,
the essay by Darren in the Casebook,

320
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.500
which you should have by now,
you will know that,
uh,

321
00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.860
the women in Cervantes,
his family,
uh,
because of financial pressures,
uh,

322
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.870
we're involved in a questionable activities,
uh,
a certain,
uh,

323
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.490
points.
And I do hope that you read that.
Uh,
um,

324
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.200
very fine and succinct essay by Neuron from which I caught it a little bit in

325
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:15.060
the last,
uh,

326
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.990
class emphasizing the fact that Cervantes was an insider and outsider at the

327
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:20.860
same time in Spain.

328
00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.090
Now I'm going down the list of the characters.

329
00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:30.091
Are they in the carrier or Mueller tier who happens to be an acquaintance or

330
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:35.050
even a relative of c?
The,
I met Dave and in Haley,
the,

331
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.860
uh,
legend author of this story.

332
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.940
It's another instance of serve anthesis for self reflectivity.

333
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.220
Here we have a character who's related to the real author.

334
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.320
Now it is true that Maurice Course,
uh,
uh,

335
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.790
fellows of Morris origin 10 tended to be carriers.
Uh,
I like this,

336
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.670
uh,
but the rent,
this is making again,

337
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:02.570
another hilarious connection between the fictional and the real worlds of his

338
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:07.360
normal.
Now going down the list of these characters,

339
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.190
and I'm doing this as if this had been a play because as I said,

340
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:13.640
the end is very much like,
uh,
like a stage.

341
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.740
There is an officer and officers from the ancient Holly Brotherhood of Toledo

342
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.060
who represents the law on,

343
00:24:21.061 --> 00:24:25.880
he's the one who hits Don Quixote on the head with a candle holder.
Uh,

344
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.720
and I explained in the last class where the holy Brotherhood,
uh,
uh,

345
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.750
is or was at the time and they,

346
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.840
it plays important role because it is the police force that is pursuing uh,

347
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.510
uh,
Don Quixote and Sandra.

348
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.290
Now finally there are better than Martinez [inaudible].

349
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.570
That's where I'm among the rowdies who participate in Saint Joe's blanket

350
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.140
tossing at the end of this episode.
Do you remember when,

351
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.100
when they go out and toss Sanko on a blanket,

352
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:02.540
a practice that was mostly reserved for animals during carnival time,

353
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:06.680
they would do it to poor dogs,
a blanket toss him like not,

354
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.360
uh,
I point to consider is that these are rowdy's,

355
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:15.740
well not inherently evil characters.
Again,
in spite of the social,
uh,

356
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.550
station.

357
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:21.550
Notice again the very common name Panadol might've fetus who happens not to be

358
00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:28.751
the current picture for the Philadelphia Phillies formerly with the Boston Red

359
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.640
Sox and the New York mets.
He said Dominican pitcher,

360
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:38.600
who's now making a comeback with the Philadelphia Phillies,
uh,

361
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.400
and who happened to be named Pedro Martinez being named Pedro Martinez is like

362
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:47.930
being called Peter Smith in,
in,
in,
in English,
or he's not,
uh,

363
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.770
uh,
unlikely that this cohesiveness would happen.

364
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.970
But whenever I get to this episode,
uh,

365
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.200
I mentioned this and wonder how many baseball fans there are in the crowd,

366
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.060
uh,
because I am,
as you probably know,

367
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:09.020
a baseball fan and also a writer I write on,
on,
on,
on baseball and so forth.

368
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:13.640
So in any case,
this better Martinez is not the picture from the Phillies.

369
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:19.570
He is a rowdy who participates in this blanket tossing of poor central.

370
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:26.330
Uh,
now these characters like donkey hope,

371
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:31.331
the himself tend to have physical defects or scars.

372
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.330
This source here,

373
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.760
if there has to be a specific source is last Saley Stena.

374
00:26:39.761 --> 00:26:44.430
I remember the work that I have mentioned several times in which the protagonist

375
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.650
is an old whore.
I'm go between,
uh,

376
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.220
uh,
who has an ugly scar on her face.

377
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.990
The faces of these characters are scarred by time,

378
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.720
by temperament,
by profession,
by crime,
by illness,

379
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.650
by class.

380
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.540
In this Cervantes is also very much like the last because he finds beauty in the

381
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.600
ugly and this is very much a part of the,

382
00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:21.350
of the modernity of Cervantes and Velasquez.

383
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.240
Um,
he finds beauty in the ugly,

384
00:27:26.241 --> 00:27:27.140
the deformed,

385
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.940
even the boosters on some of Belasco says characters,
answer,

386
00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:34.850
answer.
Vantis characters are monsters.

387
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:40.190
These characters are features that made them up to be displayed,

388
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.350
to be seen,
to be admired like Velasquez,
midgets.

389
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.070
And so,
uh,
I have asked,
uh,
uh,
Elena,
um,

390
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.030
to provide us with some examples of Alaska,

391
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:59.870
says midgets.
I am not going to remember their names.
Uh,

392
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.430
is that clear enough or should I lower the curtains?
Good.

393
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.960
Now as you can see,

394
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:11.020
the last guest has painted this midget with a book so that you can see the

395
00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:16.010
relative size as I mentioned in the last class,

396
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.320
he's very tiny indeed.

397
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.280
And that physical feature is that which,
uh,

398
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:29.230
makes him a specific individual and it is that deformity that makes him

399
00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:32.270
interesting aesthetically interesting.

400
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.510
These are others,
some of them.
How as the one in Las Meninas,

401
00:28:40.511 --> 00:28:45.190
I will see you in a minute,
kind of a,
an air of idiocy on their faces.

402
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:49.930
I see.
If they are also a retarded,

403
00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.540
uh,
Mexican,
this one,

404
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.240
that's the thing is the most famous one on his name.
I'm not going to,

405
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.630
do you remember the name of this one?
This one?
I had the name.
Yeah.

406
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.040
I think this one is El Nino.
The [inaudible] or,
or uh,

407
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.980
save osteon the Mora.
Yeah.

408
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.740
Good question.
Yeah.
These are,
these are characters in,

409
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.290
in the court.
There were used for entertainment and for amusement.

410
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.083
Next.

411
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:22.860
<v 1>Yes.</v>

412
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.070
<v 0>Yes.
This one has a,
you can see an air of,</v>

413
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.120
oh,
it is.
See in his face.

414
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:31.690
<v 1>Okay,</v>

415
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:36.520
<v 0>next.
Oh,
all right.
And then we get to Las Meninas Meninas,</v>

416
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.350
uh,
with,
uh,

417
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.550
the flat round face and that gesture,

418
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.770
that face of sort of a idiocy,

419
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:49.630
I wonder if even down syndrome or something like that,
uh,

420
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.610
such characters,
uh,
10 and were turned into,

421
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:59.530
uh,
a spectacle for amusement as is done by the way,

422
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:04.180
with don Quixote in several episodes because of their peculiar features.

423
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.950
It is their defects that make them aesthetically valuable and different.

424
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:14.250
But the case was a master are showing individuals features and suggesting a

425
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:19.210
relationship between these and the personality of his subjects.

426
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.690
He did this even in the portraits of kings.

427
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:28.710
I think I mentioned in the last class on these Habsburgs had a large jaw,

428
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.230
uh,
because of inbreeding in this,
uh,
in this,
uh,

429
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.590
lines,
um,
uh,

430
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.840
such features where are emphasized,
uh,
uh,

431
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.650
genetically.
And so he did not stop at,
uh,
uh,
and he would,

432
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:49.770
he would paint the kings like that.

433
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:54.130
It is the same as Advantis pension to characterize based on peculiarities of

434
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:55.210
body and mind.

435
00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.630
Don Quixote is thin and cerebro sanctuary is fat and physical.

436
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.040
Each however his mentor or Cerebra or physical in a particular way.

437
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.700
But while focusing on this early characters,
let us not forget,
Marcellus,

438
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.780
perfect beauty and that of other young women and men about to appear in the

439
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:21.520
novel.
These follow morals of beauty derived from renaissance art,

440
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:26.380
which in turn derive them from classical models.
Think of Botticelli is,

441
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:31.381
is Venus and the primavera variety is the norm in the hotel with frequent

442
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.160
contrast between extreme ugliness and stunning beauty.

443
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.310
You will find this in characters such as Doro Taya,
uh,

444
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:46.090
that are about to appear in the central part of the novel.

445
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.790
I think in the first character with a physical defect is one Palo Omeka himself

446
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.860
who is lefthanded

447
00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.310
until very recently left handedness was considered a defect.

448
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:05.620
And in school children were forced to use their right hands.

449
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:11.250
My basket maternal grandfather was left handed and he was a forest,

450
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.540
uh,
physically forced to use his right hand and in school.

451
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.860
Otherwise he will be beaten.

452
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:23.710
And when he went home to do his homework,
he would do it offended,

453
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.100
which is more comfortable.
And as a result he could write with both hands.

454
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:30.580
But I'm trying to emphasize that because now of course we are very far from

455
00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:34.780
thinking that left handedness is,
is it's a physical defect.

456
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.710
How many left handers here
you are a real minority.

457
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.750
Uh,
it's okay.
Um,

458
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.930
but uh,
of course now it's common.
My,
you know,

459
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.310
I have relatives who are left handed and so forth.
Uh,

460
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:59.380
but the most remarkable character in terms of physical traits is Mattie torness.

461
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.460
Her name by the way,
could suggest an inversion of virginity.
Oh,

462
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:05.720
the opposite of virginity.

463
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:10.721
Marie Maria Virgin Mary torness turns around g [inaudible].

464
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.150
This will be the reverse of a virginal.
She's in fact the whore.

465
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.890
Let me read the descriptions of moratorium is first.

466
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.920
On page one 11 of your book,

467
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.240
there was also a servant in the end and a story and winch,
broad faced,

468
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.980
flat headed and saddle nosed with one eye's squinting and the other,

469
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:37.790
not much better.
It is true the gracefulness of her body.

470
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.870
I changed that word from the translation.
The girl,

471
00:33:39.871 --> 00:33:44.660
Rachel and her buddy made amends for her other defects.
She was not seven hands.

472
00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:48.170
Hi.
From her feet to her head on her shoulders,

473
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:50.030
which Burton her a little too much,

474
00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.180
made her look down to the ground more than she cared to.

475
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.633
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

476
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.940
<v 0>Remember again the midget in Las Meninas that we just saw.
Forget it.
Uh,</v>

477
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.450
the face is broad,
flat,
the nose deformed.

478
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:08.100
Her being stooped or hunchbacks suggest her being inclined literally to the

479
00:34:08.101 --> 00:34:12.810
ground.
The base to that which is low,
not to the heights,

480
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.300
have defective ice at a touch of grotesqueness,

481
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:22.780
but also signals limitations in,
in,
in,
in Pr,

482
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.630
in perception that our,
our uh,
uh,

483
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.940
the core of what happens to the end in the dark when they can't see each other

484
00:34:29.941 --> 00:34:30.774
very well.

485
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.863
<v 2>Uh,</v>

486
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.180
<v 0>these are only her physical attributes.</v>

487
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:41.190
Later when Doki Halter Caesar's money torness we get the rest of the picture.

488
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.940
Uh,
MPages one 14,
one 15.

489
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.790
Those gene countered donkey hold his arms.

490
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.940
She being Maria Torres who caught fast hold of her by the wrist.

491
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.910
I'm pulling her towards him.
She not daring to speak a word,

492
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.430
made her sit down on the bed by him.

493
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.180
Presently he fell to feeling her smock,

494
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:07.430
which though it was of canvas seem to him to be of the finest and soft as long

495
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.380
she had on her wrist,
a string of glass beads,

496
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.890
but to his fancy they were precious oriental perils.

497
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.250
Her hair's not unlike.
Those are horses mane.

498
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:22.460
He took four threads of the brightest gold of Arabia who splendor obscures that

499
00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:25.470
of the song itself under her breath,

500
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.950
doubtless smell of last night's salt fish.

501
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.440
You fancied himself suckling from her lips and delicious and aromatic odor in

502
00:35:34.651 --> 00:35:38.910
shorts.
He painted her in his imagination,
the very formal manner.

503
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:43.690
He had red on describing his books of some princess who comes a dawn in the

504
00:35:43.691 --> 00:35:47.850
manner mentioned to visit the dangerously wounded night with whom she's in love

505
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.680
and so great.
Was the poor gentleman's infatuation that neither the touch,

506
00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:54.690
no the breath,
no other things.

507
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:59.691
The good wench had about her could own deceived him though enough to make anyone

508
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:01.650
but a carrier vomit.

509
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:02.943
<v 1>Yep.</v>

510
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.070
<v 0>Now we move here to a kind of phenomenology of ugliness or how,</v>

511
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:09.160
how does it feel?

512
00:36:09.161 --> 00:36:14.161
How the one perceive orderliness of the repulsive as Marty Dorian is more

513
00:36:15.041 --> 00:36:19.960
contingent and a secondary characterizes characteristics are itemized.

514
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:26.100
The reader is given this chance features depending on what you wore and how she

515
00:36:27.441 --> 00:36:31.270
smelled on that particular night and what her breath was like oh,

516
00:36:31.271 --> 00:36:35.430
into her last meal.
The,
the phrase,
uh,

517
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:40.710
the other things the good witch had about her is a polite circumlocution,

518
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.390
very fast Dick,

519
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.350
a way of sparing the reader of further,

520
00:36:47.351 --> 00:36:51.940
probably more revolting traits.
That's what that a phrase,

521
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:55.160
uh,
uh,
stands for,
uh,

522
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.150
there the aesthetics of the ugly and repulsive.

523
00:36:58.151 --> 00:37:00.670
It's very much contingent on temporality,

524
00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:05.970
on the passing of time that wears down bodies and endows them with undesirable

525
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.340
dope temporary qualities before me.

526
00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:14.341
These are contingent individuating particularizing in contrast to perfect models

527
00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:18.610
that are timeless contingency.
By the way,
since I'm using the word Lord,

528
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.910
uh,
that may or may not happen.

529
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.780
Possible happening by chance actually dental fortuitous conditional.

530
00:37:25.781 --> 00:37:27.670
These are definitions of contingency.

531
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:32.590
This is the aesthetic counterpart,
uh,

532
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.730
of this statement by donkey halter when he's mauled by the windmills that he

533
00:37:36.731 --> 00:37:39.310
took for giants.
Everything is subject to change.

534
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.310
It is the realm of the mischievous and chanters that alter things like warming

535
00:37:45.311 --> 00:37:48.130
up his library.
I'm turning this damn soul,

536
00:37:48.131 --> 00:37:51.550
this beautiful princess that he thinks is holding into this.

537
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.620
I do this repulsive a whore,
uh,

538
00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.330
domain donkey.
Houghton mistake is to apply the moral of beauty,

539
00:38:01.331 --> 00:38:06.300
the renaissance blonde model beauty.
We just blown,
uh,
uh,

540
00:38:06.301 --> 00:38:07.160
on beautiful,

541
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.650
a young woman to the grotesque Marie Marie Antonio's his mistake reveals
however,

542
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.930
that what he passes off as a sublime love is really lost.

543
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

544
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.920
<v 0>The episode lays bare appropriately in the middle of the night and in total</v>

545
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:25.620
darkness,
donkey,
this subconscious,

546
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.360
we should not miss the point that as a prostitute,
a,

547
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:35.160
an embodiment of lost Marie Therese is the opposite of what one would normally

548
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:40.050
consider sexually desirable.
We are,
we are here,
uh,

549
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.180
at the lowest point of,
of love this basis.

550
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:49.510
So the episodes at one Palo Vegas in fraud with erotic violence and culminating

551
00:38:49.511 --> 00:38:54.511
with Don Quixote and Sanchez violent bowel movements and vomiting are like a

552
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:57.970
phantasmagoria in which the basic,

553
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:03.270
the most basic drives behind the protagonist actions are staged as it were.

554
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.590
They are reduced to their oral,
uh,
these characters,

555
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:11.980
these protime Mary's are reduced to their oral,
anal,

556
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.570
and even genital stages.
If we're going to use the Floridian a terminology,

557
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.450
they're reduced to that basic level.

558
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.730
Don Quixote desire for the innkeepers daughter shows his physical desires,

559
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:29.710
which are surely behind his transforming,
I'll don't [inaudible] answer.

560
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:34.320
Remember,
is the,
is the young woman near Don Quixote's,
uh,

561
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.540
indicate holders a village that he turns into all scenario.

562
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:43.030
So we see what is behind that,
uh,
uh,
that,
uh,

563
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.950
turning the alone into the sublime,
the duty.

564
00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:49.720
Now don't say it's not ugly as we will see.

565
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:53.950
She is a brawny but attractive,
uh,

566
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.550
Don Quixote Quixote's lost for her.
It's typical of an opera class,

567
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.050
older gentlemen for lower class woman whom he considers sexier,

568
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.980
sexier,

569
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.750
and more sexual than women of his social class.

570
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:12.990
Spanish literature is full of situations in which a lost full aristocrat tries

571
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:17.860
to ravage a peasant woman.
Auto European literature is full of these don't one,

572
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.270
the one of the famous don't.
One tradition is such a case,

573
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.830
but there are others that I will mention,
uh,
during the course of the semester.

574
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.140
Now,

575
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:33.140
donkey Hotez and Santos bodily evacuations provoked by fear.

576
00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:38.350
Nebraska's Balson dramatize the violent forces behind their basic drives to
live.

577
00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:43.050
Remember that donkey Quixote claims to have,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

578
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:48.100
the recipe or the prescription for this Balsam that he learned,

579
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:52.930
the romances of chivalry,
that if you drink it,
it will make you whole again,

580
00:40:52.931 --> 00:40:55.390
even if you have been sliced,
sliced,

581
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:59.140
or cutting to you drink the Balsam and boom,
you are made whole again.

582
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.123
You're cured.

583
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.200
And he asks for the ingredients and he makes it and they drink it.

584
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:10.480
Uh,
and uh,
uh,
of course the,
uh,
the,

585
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.930
the results are uh,

586
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.970
horrendous because both don Quixote on central have violent bowel movements and

587
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:21.310
vomiting and all of that.
Uh,
uh,

588
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.580
this is particularly so with sanctuary who by the way,

589
00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:27.070
will defecate against soon out of fear.

590
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:31.870
If you have gotten to that nice episode with a Fooling Hammer,

591
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.320
but note that the is supposed to restore their bodies to make them physiques

592
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.780
hold again.

593
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.080
You raising the ravages of violence and more broadly of time the bowel,

594
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:50.030
some would erase those ugly physical features or scars that identify them.

595
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.360
Here,
the,
the,

596
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:55.250
the Balsam stands for something that would erase those marks on their bodies.

597
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:59.980
The marks that I have been speaking about,
ECS greeting,
uh,

598
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.140
is a mock form of purification.

599
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:09.020
The rejection of the material world that they have ingested,
ironically,

600
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:11.480
don't get hot.
It does get better.

601
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:17.090
Perhaps medically speaking,
he needed to be cleansed out.
Uh,
so,
uh,

602
00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.100
uh,
taking this,
which turns out to be,
uh,
a,
uh,

603
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:24.920
a violent laxative,
uh,
makes them feel better,

604
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:29.310
but Sanko almost dice,
uh,
because he,
he's,
uh,
he's,

605
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:33.280
uh,
he vomits and,
and,
and,
and,

606
00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.040
and has diarrhea and everything that you saw,
uh,
there,

607
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:43.100
I wouldn't,
I would return to this unsavory topic,
uh,
soon.

608
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:45.843
Uh,

609
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:51.190
now the flimsy construction of one pal Omegas in leads us to a topic that I have

610
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.010
mentioned several times before.
Improvisation,

611
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.300
every evident in Velasquez gesture,
he's improvising.
It's going to paint,
uh,

612
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.190
and discussed at length in the prologue to Don Quixote.

613
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:10.220
One Point Omeka is in is the most important building in part one and it's an

614
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:14.330
internal emblem.
I think of the books,

615
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.140
careless geneses ans structure or is deliberately careless and geneses and

616
00:43:23.341 --> 00:43:23.661
structure.

617
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:28.661
I'm equating here the [inaudible] and its construction with the composition of

618
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:31.520
the book Don Quixote.

619
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.070
The end is the one shelter the protagonist's do find repeatedly in part one,

620
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:41.330
but they enjoy no protection or peace within its walls because it is so

621
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:45.220
dilapidated that he barely keeps them out of the elements.
It is not a,
uh,

622
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:50.240
a meaningful and fulfillment of refilling endor to the road,

623
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.080
but a waystation that this is not a home they returned to and it's meaningful

624
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:56.660
and,
and uh,
uh,

625
00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:01.130
it shelters them and gives them us and so forth and it's just a waste station.

626
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.690
It's parts are in a,

627
00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:07.691
sorry state of disrepair and do not match harmoniously with each other.

628
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.840
The camera and Chung,

629
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.380
there's the word in the Spanish and the original is a Goddamn Pacom or an Giang

630
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:21.680
and the original,
uh,

631
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.310
or attic or don't get hot.
The help us.
Barry set up,

632
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.400
quote gave Eddie evident tokens of having formerly served many years.

633
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:36.930
I say Hay loft unquote Sabastian the covarrubias.

634
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.960
You must remember from my earlier lectures,

635
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:44.610
remember the lexicographer who wrote the first dictionary of the Spanish

636
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:48.270
language and Polish it and 1611,
uh,

637
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.950
says that Cameron Joan,

638
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:55.140
this derived obviously from the Latin Com Maita Chamber and he said disparaging

639
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:59.730
term for the highest spot in a house,
an attic or Luft.

640
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.170
We're old junk.
Heterogeneous by its very nature is stored.

641
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.200
This is the reason the stars can be seen through the gaps on it's flimsy roof,

642
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.720
which is why it is called in the Spanish and [inaudible] yellow is Tablo or star

643
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.700
lit loft.
That is if you,

644
00:45:17.701 --> 00:45:21.570
if you think of the of the in like this,
uh,

645
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.430
the uh,
common and John would be here.
So you put on the inside,

646
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:28.170
you can see the roof,

647
00:45:28.171 --> 00:45:33.171
which has holes and it's a story because you can see through the roof of the

648
00:45:36.451 --> 00:45:39.870
holes in the roof.
You can say it's a very primitive,
a drawing,

649
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.720
but you can see through its roof.
You can see the stars.

650
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.990
This suggests that the end was originally a small house to which additions were

651
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:53.850
made haphazardly incorporating the stable and it's Hayloft off to his living

652
00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.130
quarters to accommodate more paying guests.

653
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:01.320
Also a roof soft full of holes that the stars are visible from within.

654
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:07.070
Comically suggest that the in has cosmic connections as did Greek,

655
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:13.280
Roman and astic temples as well as their renaissance counterparts by their

656
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:18.750
alignment to celestial bodies.
In other words,
in,
in,
in classical architecture,

657
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:23.700
in astic architecture,
the temples were aligned to,
uh,
uh,

658
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.730
to the stars who are constellations,
uh,

659
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.480
so that the building would be a part of this,
uh,

660
00:46:30.481 --> 00:46:33.810
of this cosmic world.
You understand what I'm trying to say?

661
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.530
The buildings were aligned in such a way.
Uh,

662
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.460
also such as star spangle ceiling would be nature's counterpart to the elaborate

663
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:49.551
ones of certain Paris's in which solely at science where often depicted in now,

664
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.990
uh,
in the roof.
Uh,
uh,

665
00:46:55.710 --> 00:47:00.450
which is the,
the,
the closest example we have to that today.

666
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.900
Those of us who live in the northeast,
that we see it all the time.

667
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:09.600
Grand Central Station.
If the next time you go to grand central station,

668
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.470
look up not too long or they might take your wallet but look up,

669
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:18.780
look up and you will see that the the roof has drawn on it,

670
00:47:18.781 --> 00:47:22.980
all the constellations it is as if there were no roof as if you could see

671
00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:25.080
actually the stars and uh,

672
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:30.110
well that is a device used in renaissance,
uh,

673
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.520
palaces.
And so it is an ironic,
uh,

674
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:39.250
Ellucian to it that the roof of this,
uh,
very,
uh,

675
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.280
humble building is a star lit against the background of the INS ramshackle

676
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.500
improvised architecture.

677
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:52.090
Such solutions are hilarious and highlight that it is no architectural jewel

678
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:54.940
built following a careful plan and classical models.

679
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.120
It would seem as if during its construction,

680
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:00.490
which was gradual and rule by chance,

681
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.880
everything in it has been transformed by contingency.

682
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.700
That is contingency again and the passage of time,

683
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.230
many years it says in the quote that I read you the provisional nature of its

684
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:16.150
furnishings.
It's evident in Don Quixote's bed,
which quote consisted of four,

685
00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:21.151
not very smooth boards upon to not very equal trestles on called predictably

686
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.960
during the free for all provoked by mandatory,
there's no terminal appointment.

687
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:30.790
The mural driver climbs on it and makes it collapse.
Quote the bed,

688
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.190
which was the little feeble and its foundations,

689
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:35.590
none of the strongest being unable to bear.

690
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:39.700
The additional weight of the carrier came down with them to the ground.

691
00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:40.660
You remember that scene?

692
00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:45.661
I'm sure the improvised patchwork architecture of Palo [inaudible] in reflects

693
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:52.500
that of the structure of the Quixote part one with its interpolated stories of

694
00:48:54.341 --> 00:48:57.140
what you are going to read some very soon said.

695
00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:02.190
I know also Cervantes is notorious errors and even donkey halters practice of

696
00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:08.800
letting crossing mantis when dictate the direction of his journey.

697
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:14.170
Now Dickie Haut,
there is the only classic,
uh,
uh,

698
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.910
that,
uh,

699
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:20.470
about which there is a whole bibliography about his errors or classics.
You know,

700
00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:23.380
they say that homer fell asleep here and something happened and the audience is

701
00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:27.260
not perfect and this and that,
but,
but,
uh,
the,
uh,

702
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.280
the errors in the 1605 Quixote tutorials part of it and a lot has been written

703
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:33.634
about them

704
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:41.220
because improvisation can lead to errors and there are quite a few in part one,

705
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.500
let me list some of them.

706
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.440
There are errors that the characters make that cannot be attributed to
Cervantes,

707
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:55.090
but to their haste that used to hate to the characters,
the characters,
the,

708
00:49:55.091 --> 00:49:59.040
their carelessness.
But all of that is within the fiction.
Uh,
uh,

709
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.170
these are the errors that later on you will find a Donald or makes what?

710
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:07.330
Playing Princess McComb Yukoner Don Quixote.
It makes a few.
In chapter four,

711
00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:10.930
he says that seven times,
it's times nine is 73.

712
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.630
This could be a type later,
later,

713
00:50:13.631 --> 00:50:18.160
he says that the biblical Samsung remove the doors of the temple when it was the

714
00:50:18.161 --> 00:50:19.640
gates of the city of Gaza,

715
00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:24.130
that Samsung ripped off when there are other kinds of earth that can be blamed

716
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:28.520
on set Avantis and his editors.
For instance,

717
00:50:28.521 --> 00:50:31.010
let me just taking chapter titles and numbers.

718
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.340
The title of chapter 10 reads,

719
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.560
not in your translation where it was fixed,

720
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.800
but in the original it reads concerning what further be Phil don't get hotter

721
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.460
with the gallon Basque and the danger in which he found himself with a ban of

722
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:47.750
Galicians from Django was,

723
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:53.150
but the episode with the baskets over and the fracas with a young Winston's does

724
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:56.240
not come on to five chapters later

725
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.140
after the resource to and Marcella interlude.

726
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:05.740
Chapter 44 appears in Roman numerals as chapter 35 and so on,

727
00:51:07.691 --> 00:51:08.524
Blah.

728
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:14.050
The grandest mistake was the theft of Sanchez Donkey,

729
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.180
which you have not reached yet,

730
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.780
but in chapter 25 the reader finds out that central's donkey,

731
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:24.290
it's not just missing,
but that it was stolen.

732
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.790
After 12 chapters,
we started worried about the lost or recovered donkey.

733
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:30.800
He reappears gradually.

734
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.840
His trappings are mentioned until in chapter 46.
Here is,

735
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:40.460
he is there again,
miraculously,
uh,
uh,
in the,

736
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:41.540
in stable.

737
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.710
This is all in the first one that Aquestt has 1605 addition when they like

738
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:51.280
Questa [inaudible] was the publisher of the 1605 edition.

739
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.330
Actually the very first printing was six,
late 16 or four,
but it,

740
00:51:55.410 --> 00:52:00.410
it was giving the 16th if you want to be really pedantic,
but it's in 1605,
uh,
uh,

741
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:01.860
data,
this Kevin,

742
00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.650
this is all in the first one that request the addition,
the print cups,

743
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:10.250
the princess addition.
But in the second 16 or five printing,

744
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:15.550
it's also well that printing a new printing has to made a also a hundred Acosta.

745
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.830
The theft of the donkey appears in chapter 23 and his recovery in chapter 30 and

746
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:25.670
Cervantes has added a series of,
of paragraphs to justify all of this.

747
00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:28.040
These are hilarious paragraphs.

748
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:33.710
The writing in these added passages reads very much lecture.
Advantis is pros.

749
00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.890
Uh,
to me,
they're not to other scholars who think that the,

750
00:52:37.891 --> 00:52:38.900
this is somebody else writing.

751
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:43.250
So editors have incorporated them into the final version of the novel,

752
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:48.350
a critic name later up,
things that the additions whereby the editor,

753
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.770
uh,

754
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:54.770
and believes that all these mistakes were put in Nicky haughty on purpose by set

755
00:52:55.061 --> 00:52:57.410
of answers.
Once you have something like this,

756
00:52:57.411 --> 00:53:01.340
there are critics who can claim anything,
uh,

757
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.200
that it was not a case of careless improvisation,

758
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.920
but a plan to simulate it.

759
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.870
The issue is moot for me in either,
in either case we'll,
or not the mistake,

760
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.140
the mistakes reveal a hasty Shari composition and imperfection and lack of

761
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:25.350
finish as it were and fits with the topic of improvisation introduced in the

762
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:28.110
prologue when donkey hot,

763
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.060
when the narrator or Cervantes,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

764
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.530
claims that he doesn't know what,
how to write the prologue and,
and,
and,
and,

765
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:41.680
and presents himself as someone who's not in total control of his creation.

766
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:43.763
Now

767
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:50.850
back to [inaudible] in,
I hope you have understood my,
uh,
my,
uh,

768
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.320
equating the improvisation on the,
the,
the ramshackle,

769
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.730
uh,
uh,
character of the inn.

770
00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:03.820
And that of the 1605 Quixote now central's blanket tussling.

771
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:07.350
I must mentioned the last event,
uh,
in,
in,

772
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:12.510
uh,
because central never forgives.
Gnocchi halter for not defending him.

773
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.720
Uh,
and his failure,

774
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.550
the failure of his master to act is something that cast doubt in his mind about

775
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.610
donkey hope.
This courage Gnocchi,
how they justify I said,

776
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:27.210
because he claims that he's not supposed to enter into battle against commoners.

777
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.000
And that drafting Nantais froze.

778
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:33.570
The importance of this episode is that said vantage is building up the

779
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:35.700
relationship between his two protagonists,

780
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:39.660
which will deepen in the next episodes.
First one.

781
00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.980
Central helps to cure Doki hotel when he's wounded by the shepherds defending

782
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:44.814
their sheep.

783
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:50.030
And later when Don Quixote angry at Santo for laughing at him strikes his choir.

784
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.590
Remember when Lucky Hilti hits him over the head.

785
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:57.060
This deepening relationship is one of the great virtues of the novel.

786
00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:02.270
Cervantes diff displays a profound and carrying knowledge of human nature and of

787
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:06.180
the transformations of human relationships.

788
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:10.890
It's something to learn from the book.
This is new for a fiction.

789
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.870
Uh,
their relationship to sends the social differences between them.

790
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:20.871
And becomes profound and complicated because of these paths that they

791
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:26.100
occasionally have.
The following episodes follow the same pattern,

792
00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:31.550
don't Quixote on Sankyo mistake where they see with catastrophic consequences.

793
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.280
It's the same pattern establishing the episode of the windmills.

794
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:38.490
The first is the battle with the herds of sheep.

795
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:44.190
That I hope you found us hilarious as I always do when I reread it,

796
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:50.130
Loki hold again fool by a real world that seems to conspire to look like what he

797
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:52.200
has in his head.
In this case,

798
00:55:52.201 --> 00:55:56.580
the sheep reflect what you must have read in Elliott about the importance of

799
00:55:56.581 --> 00:56:00.750
sheep harm farming and of the wool industry in because still is still very

800
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.584
important.

801
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.740
And I have been suddenly in a custodian town and a whole sea of sheep come by.

802
00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:12.360
They are being herded to the north or to the south of the case.
May Be,
uh,

803
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:16.680
uh,
woo was a very important product of,

804
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:21.790
of Casteel as you've read,
uh,
in Elliot.
Uh,
and of course this,

805
00:56:21.791 --> 00:56:25.930
this cheap in the distance could look like,
uh,
like an army.

806
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:31.120
Uh,
so Cervantes is,
is,
is,
is,
uh,
reflecting here,

807
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.680
not only the,
the,
the,
the reality of everyday life,

808
00:56:35.681 --> 00:56:40.330
but also the broader social economic realities of the Spain of the period.

809
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:41.890
Uh,

810
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:46.720
he tried to attempt donkey on or translate everything that reminds him of the

811
00:56:46.721 --> 00:56:49.460
world of Romances of chivalry into their languages.

812
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:53.860
Arguments with sanctuary and others about the nature of the real are one of the

813
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:57.160
sources of humor in an old course here.

814
00:56:57.161 --> 00:57:01.360
Cervantes display his own gift for linguistic invention and parody.

815
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:04.300
The names of the knights involved are hilarious,

816
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:09.600
as is his description of the imaginary battle has an epic mock epic quality

817
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:15.010
donkey Hartej hurt by stones,
whose names,
almonds.

818
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.240
They're called at one point,
understate their ability to hurt,

819
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.900
loses teeth as he had before last part of an ear.

820
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:28.240
These are the scars of time on his body that have mentioned before his body is

821
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:29.980
diminished as the work progresses,

822
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:34.990
contributing to his story appearance and leading to the name that Sanctu gives

823
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:36.490
him in the next episode.

824
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.390
Notice that donkey Quixote kills several sheep and that he has again been

825
00:57:42.581 --> 00:57:44.800
involved in a fight.
Hence,

826
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:48.940
he has committed crimes that come under the jurisdiction of the holy
brotherhood.

827
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.440
So besides the disputes about the real and the parody of the romances of

828
00:57:53.441 --> 00:57:54.274
chivalry,

829
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:58.450
it must be noted that no Quixote on sanctuary criminals who are fugitives from

830
00:57:58.451 --> 00:57:59.284
justice.

831
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:05.380
Now I want you to notice,
I'm sure you did that.

832
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:09.310
No Quixote on Sangio vomit on each other here.

833
00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:14.620
And I,
uh,
I want to ponder,
uh,
about,
uh,

834
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:19.210
this,
uh,
a little,
uh,
uh,
episode.
Uh,

835
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:23.290
we already saw the purging involving the characters evacuations,

836
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:26.500
but here I believe that there is another suggestion.

837
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:30.430
I was going to read you that passage where the time is short,

838
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.100
but I'm sure you remember it.
Uh,

839
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:38.250
vomiting here and in the end suggest the existence of concrete if re,

840
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.440
uh,
concrete if repulsive,
uh,

841
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.430
language of pure meanings.

842
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:51.040
The mouth a emits concrete,
concrete things,
a language who's effected repulsion,

843
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:54.850
mutual repulsion.
But that is never a form of communication.

844
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.480
One vomit elicits that,

845
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:03.130
that it is nevertheless a form of communication.
One vomit elicits the other.

846
00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:08.170
It is in this sense,
it pure language and ironic fusion of words and things.
If,

847
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:08.750
what?
If you,

848
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:13.750
if you think that words merely reflect reality vomit is reality itself expressed

849
00:59:14.831 --> 00:59:18.130
as words is what I'm trying to say.
Uh,

850
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:22.040
vomit contains objects,
not science on producers.

851
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:26.540
Bodily effects us.
When,
uh,
uh,
in the case in,
in,

852
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:30.980
in the next episode or when Don Quixote smells doc,
uh,

853
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:34.480
Sanchez feces,
uh,
and older,
uh,

854
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:36.643
uh,

855
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:41.710
expression on the part of sanctuary and he asks him to move away the,

856
00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:45.950
the,
this consideration of language dove tails with all the,
the,

857
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.940
all the meditation is about language and literature that are in the book.

858
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.970
Um,
I need,
he's very appropriate.

859
00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:56.710
I think that it should occur in an episode where it is,
whether it's such a,

860
00:59:57.030 --> 01:00:01.190
a marvelous display of literary language and the description of this battle on

861
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.540
all of these nights.

862
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.780
So we have that literary language and then this concrete language of vomit when

863
01:00:08.181 --> 01:00:11.540
they express,
uh,
each other,
uh,
uh,

864
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:16.300
in such a way.
Uh,
I think that,
uh,

865
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:21.290
uh,
I'm going to leave the next two episodes,
uh,
for the next,

866
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.080
uh,
class,
the one about,
uh,

867
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:28.860
the dead body because there is very significant,
uh,
uh,

868
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.190
a moment there when sanctuary names.
Okay.
Hope the,
the,
the,

869
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:37.130
the night of the sorrowful figure and also the,

870
01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:40.310
one of the fooling hammers to which I have just alluded because of this

871
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:45.380
hilarious moment when Santo defecates out of fear.

872
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:50.590
Uh,
and,
uh,
and so we shall move on with our,
uh,
uh,

873
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:55.610
next series of episodes too.
We stay close to the core of part one,

874
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:57.110
the core of part one,

875
01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.040
which are the episodes that take place in the Sierra Morina.
