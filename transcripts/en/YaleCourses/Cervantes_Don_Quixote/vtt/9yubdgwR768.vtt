1
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.370
Let me begin by repeating my last point in,

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.970
uh,
last Tuesday's lecture.
The,

3
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:12.540
uh,

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.540
birth of don't get hotter is an act of self invention by a man of 50.

5
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.220
And remember that fifties,
a very advanced age in 1605,

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.970
he feels free to create himself beyond family births and need in this,

7
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.800
the novel is directly opposed to most previous literature,

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.160
particularly the romances of Chicory where they were miraculous births and the

9
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.920
picaresque very much in particular the picker asking in which family background

10
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.970
and need determined the life of the protagonist or so he claims as he tells us

11
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:55.320
life,
uh,
is,
is poverty.
Uh,

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.360
on the,
uh,
uh,
the family,
uh,

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.730
background weighs heavily on the rest of his life.

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.680
In the case of the Pickerel,

15
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.940
Don Quixote is beyond family and social determinism.

16
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.130
In most bring your stories,

17
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:16.131
young people leave home in search of adventures that will give substance meaning

18
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.610
and individuality,
individuality to their lives.

19
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.040
Can you think of another old protagonist before Gnocchi?
Haughty.

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.840
How old was the pink,
the pilgrim in the divine comedy?
I think it was 33.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.380
How was Odysseus in the Odyssey?

22
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.540
How old nes and the need.
So let's Tinnitus.
True was old,

23
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.600
but she shares the limelight with young lovers.

24
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.320
Donkey hotter as I think I said in the last class is beyond Freud,

25
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.170
beyond the family romance.
In fact,
though,

26
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:56.430
we learn a great deal about him in the first chapter.
We learn nothing of his,

27
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.450
of his parents.

28
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.010
His genealogy is literary the books that he has read.

29
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.440
Uh,
the most innovative aspect of Don Quixote,
uh,

30
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.660
is the characters self fashioning as,
uh,

31
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.760
Steve Greenblatt would put it in,
in,

32
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.510
in a book called Renaissance self fashioning a,

33
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.570
the reader witnesses this self transformation,
uh,

34
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.130
in all its level from the mental to the physical,

35
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:29.190
from one don Quixote thinks to what he wears.

36
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.000
He not an author names him,

37
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.190
his horse and his lady,

38
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.420
his is a life that will be molded like a work of art.
Life are,

39
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.100
uh,
will imitate art.

40
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.820
But what is the significance of this self invention,
uh,

41
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.260
of this resurrection?
I said,
where

42
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.770
renaissance humanism emphasize the power of human agency.

43
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.100
Uh,

44
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
it is the beginning of a liberation from a God centered conception of the world

45
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.030
out of humankind.
Remember the Lucaj quote,

46
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.780
uh,
about the today being the first,
uh,
story,
uh,

47
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.130
of a world that has been abandoned by God.
So in this world,

48
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:26.080
abandoned by God,
man creates himself.
Don Quixote creates himself

49
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.030
and know Lugarda della [inaudible].

50
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.480
This is the first sentence of the book.
Uh,

51
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.870
Jarvis translates in a village of Lemont Chia,

52
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:42.220
the name of which I purposely omit their lived long ago.
Uh,

53
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.900
this is a sentence by the way,

54
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:47.770
that most limited native speakers of Spanish know by heart,

55
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.700
even if they haven't read the rest of the keyhole.
Uh,

56
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.630
and the,
the disclaimer,
the cool you're known,

57
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.530
but a Nokia or go to that to me is also used in conversation to say,

58
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.890
I don't want to remember this.
Uh,

59
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.960
now it is known the way that English speakers,
no,

60
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.160
it was the best of times.
It was the worst of times,

61
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.280
a tale of two cities or call me Ishmael,
uh,

62
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.360
the beginning of Moby Dick,
uh,
and so forth.
Uh,

63
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.740
in the Quixote literature appears as I've been saying,

64
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.780
I said realm of self legitimation and the display of wit and capacity for

65
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.394
invention,

66
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.790
which is what Cervantes appears to be affirming in the first sentence of the

67
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:39.610
book.
He does not wish as a narrator,

68
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:44.611
he does not wish to remember the place in Manchuria where Don Quixote lived.

69
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.150
It is a display of authorial will.

70
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.760
The sentence is full of other implications.
Uh,

71
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.410
there is the echo of the opening of traditional stories as well as that of

72
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:04.411
official document that our test to ones being by stating we're one is from in

73
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:12.001
the stories in such a such a country long ago and the country is named or my

74
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:15.490
name is such and so,

75
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:19.270
and I live in such and such a place and was born in such and such a place,

76
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.390
illegal document to make such a statement is once a strongest form of grounding.

77
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.820
Uh,

78
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.560
but here willfully omitted that place name that is erased by the creative.

79
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:36.370
We'll have the author,
I know [inaudible],

80
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.640
I don't want to remember it.
Uh,

81
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.420
against the traditional formulas,
uh,

82
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.250
in which it is given the origin,
this origin,
this place,

83
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:52.330
this village,
this Lou Gehrig as his calling in the 16th century Spanish,

84
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.850
uh,
to which,
uh,

85
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.860
the protagonist returns several times and definitively at the end is not named.

86
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.250
It is us as eve here the source where non determining as the age of Don Quixote

87
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.990
is non determining in his subsequent adventures.

88
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.830
This is perhaps the reason why the origin,

89
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:19.880
which is also a destination because knowing how they will return to die at home.

90
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.570
Giving away the plot here,
sorry.
Uh,

91
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.950
this is the perhaps a recent way the origin which is also a destination is left

92
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:32.810
blank deliberately effaced uh,
from the store.
It is,
it is a non place,

93
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.940
although many towns in Spain claim to be the,

94
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.390
the town in which,
uh,
Loki hope there was born.

95
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.510
Now Don Quixote has name and other names we have already or have already spoken

96
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.970
about,
uh,
Kosaki Hala Hannah.

97
00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:55.970
And by now you have read all of these variations of the potential,
uh,

98
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.720
potential variations of the,
of uh,
along Soki harness,
first name.

99
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.790
Uh,
Eh,
the point is,
is it's also one,

100
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.600
uh,

101
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.160
prevalent throughout the book the fluctuations of language in reference to

102
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:12.770
meaning and to truth.
If language is so shifty,

103
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:16.310
how can we express the truth in language?

104
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.090
Uh,
Spitzer,
Leo Spitzer,

105
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.320
a great German critic who worked,
uh,
uh,

106
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.950
in this country for many years,
uh,

107
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.970
and taught at Johns Hopkins University in the piece on linguistic perspectivism

108
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.870
that you will read in your casebook makes much of this and he makes much of this

109
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:42.530
with the knowledge of the linguist and philology philologists that he was,

110
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.250
you will,

111
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.250
you will see a language and its vagaries also constitutes Cervantes point of

112
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:55.121
view about what is commonly accepted as the truth and how the truth can be

113
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:01.220
commonly accepted in a medium,
a shifty,
uh,
as,
uh,

114
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.570
as language
but the blurry name,

115
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.720
the whole [inaudible] so and so forth.

116
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.900
It's also a way of playing with the absence of determinism as being from the

117
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.910
Manchuria and non place.
A,
I said,

118
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.940
we're a name and a place marked the characters in the epic and in the Romances

119
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:25.630
of chivalry and even the picaresque novels,
I'm,
are these,

120
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.590
the goals of Gore Lasa [inaudible] storm is,

121
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:33.200
is the river that goes through Salamanca by the way,

122
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.070
in which the picker was supposed to have been born.
Goose Monday,

123
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:41.030
Alpha Rashi place there,
his name Al Farace,
but not,

124
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.250
not in the Kihatha significantly.

125
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.770
Now Don Quixote names is lady do scenario.

126
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.660
They'll torso and Rosina Auntie in the first case,
uh,

127
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:56.160
the lady he follows literary convention,

128
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.970
her name rhymes with Melly where,

129
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.270
who is the,
uh,
one of the protagonist of a is Tina.

130
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.710
The beautiful young woman.

131
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.560
And dual say means sweet in Spanish.
So,

132
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.890
uh,
you can see the,
the,

133
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.240
the origin and the intention behind naming Douchey,
Neha,

134
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.250
that while the horses name reflects something,
something of his reality,

135
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.740
the Nantais,
the raw thing,

136
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.540
anti meaning he was at Racine,
a work horse before,

137
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.360
and this is before in Spanish or Rossie.
Manti.

138
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.280
The name does reflect in a very direct and comical way because of this

139
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:46.080
director's precisely,
uh,
the reality about this.
Uh,
this nag

140
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.660
don't be Hotez.
Capacity for naming as we will see is quite extraordinary.

141
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:54.550
He's a man of words and of the word,

142
00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:01.050
but the crucial point here is that he's naming himself his lady on his horse as

143
00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:05.320
part of this process of self invention.
Uh,

144
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.210
like Adam giving names to things in the garden of Eden or God giving names to

145
00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:15.010
things.
This is part and parcel of the process of self invention.
I repeat.

146
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:17.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.660
<v 0>Now we move on to chapter two,
which is one of the most to me,</v>

148
00:10:22.661 --> 00:10:27.661
remarkable moments in all of literature the protagonist has created himself and

149
00:10:30.071 --> 00:10:35.071
he leaves at dawn the beginning of a new day of a new life and sets out on them

150
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:39.040
on Teal plane alone.

151
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.850
It is a willed beginning from zero,

152
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
from a voluntary severing of ties with any possible determining force except for

153
00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:52.090
the loss of chivalry and for literature.

154
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.200
It is a moment of freedom of freedom,

155
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.530
achieved freedom from the past.

156
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.380
But as he goes along the,

157
00:11:02.381 --> 00:11:06.520
he anticipates Don Quixote anticipates the literary texts that would be written

158
00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:11.260
about the exploits that he is in the process of accomplishment,

159
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.620
accomplishing all that he thinks he's in the process of accomplishing.

160
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.450
There is a gap of course,

161
00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:21.451
between the high flown rhetoric of the romances of chivalry that he uses and the

162
00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:27.760
little plane is a plane up of which he gallops or trucks Frawley.

163
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.253
Uh,

164
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.340
but this is precisely the gap between literature and reality between writing and

165
00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:38.341
experience that will be at the core of serve anthesis exploration of the nature

166
00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:41.020
of writing,
uh,

167
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.620
the present and the writing of the tech's hands.

168
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.150
Somewhere in between the reality and these high flown rhetoric,

169
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.420
uh,
the,
the,

170
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:55.421
that are parallel on simultaneously in their appearance in the book.

171
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.690
This is quite remarkable and it may pass on notice,

172
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.000
but I want you to take notice of it.
Uh,
uh,
is,
uh,

173
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.390
on the translation where using pages 26,
27 a don Quixote,

174
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:14.740
I see goals or on the plane,
uh,
have Montiel,
uh,

175
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.800
says to himself who doubt but that in future times when the faithful history of

176
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:26.950
my famous exploits all come to light,
the sage who writes them,

177
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.840
when he gives a relation of this,
my first Halley so early in the morning,

178
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.610
we'll do it in words like this,
quote,

179
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:42.150
scar scarcely had the Rudy or Roddy fevers spread the golden tresses of his

180
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:43.611
beauty,

181
00:12:43.611 --> 00:12:48.611
his hair over the face of the widened spacious Earth Ans Kearsley had the

182
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:54.151
painted birds with the Sweden mellifluous harmony of their fork tongs saluted

183
00:12:55.031 --> 00:13:00.031
the approach of Rosie Aurora who quitting the soft couch of her jealous husband

184
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.080
and so forth and so on.
Uh,

185
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:08.130
these using all of these references to classical mythology to refer to himself

186
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:12.520
as he projects the text that will be written about him.

187
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.293
<v 1>Now</v>

188
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.090
<v 0>he arrives at the,
we know,</v>

189
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.000
and this is a effect to remember

190
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.120
from the episode in the,

191
00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:31.121
in that donkey hotel leaves home on a hot Friday in July.

192
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.760
How do we know this?
We know it because they serve fish.

193
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.680
Do Don Quixote at the,

194
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:46.681
in explaining that the eating of red meat is for bitten on Fridays by the

195
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.530
Catholic Church.
It was until the 1960s of the past century.

196
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.630
So it is clear because it is a hot day and it is the month of July that this is

197
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:57.040
a hot Friday in July.

198
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.600
This specificity of time and place is a new feature of fiction of this realist

199
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.223
fiction.

200
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.710
As we saw the romances of chivalry took place in vague fabulous countries and

201
00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:13.420
times,
not techie holiday,

202
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.730
which derived from the picker Escott pension for the particular in everything.

203
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.270
It is the birth of what we know as realism,

204
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.170
whose origins and intention I spoke about in the last lecture,

205
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.220
interest in society or its lowest level and the acquisition,

206
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:35.050
acquisition of aesthetic value by the sordid,
the ugly and the dirty.

207
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.880
Now the heat,
uh,
by the way it would presumably,
and it says,
so in the text,

208
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:48.340
uh,
contribute to don Quixote's madness according to theories of the,

209
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:51.130
of the time,
which are probably not altogether wrong.

210
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.590
If you're out in the desert in the heat,
you might lose,
uh,
uh,

211
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.600
your census to put the weather.

212
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.510
The weather is important for other reasons in the Quixote,

213
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:09.950
a specific whether or not the fabulous weather mists and all of that in the

214
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:11.960
romances of chivalry,

215
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.560
both parts of the novel take place in a vaguely framed summer

216
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.730
in part because a heat contributes to don Quixote's madness,
as I say,

217
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:27.731
but also because it makes it logical for everyone to be outdoors on the road.

218
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.480
We'll see a little bit more about,
uh,
uh,
Hawaii people are on the road.

219
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.990
Um,
the song song,

220
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.330
the very important issue that begins in these early chapters already of light

221
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:42.650
and visibility,

222
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.760
being able to discern objects and make them out and,

223
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.950
uh,
which leads to disputes between the two protagonists about the nature of what

224
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:59.360
they see.
Uh,
if you have been to Spain and took a steel,

225
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:03.920
you know that uh,
the air is clear,

226
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.220
it is a hot and dry and the visibility is uh,

227
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.630
uh,
very,
very good.

228
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.750
This first in is crucial because it sets up one of the most important places

229
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.400
where the action will develop ins as you will soon discover.

230
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.410
Waystations stations are waystations where all sorts of meetings take place and

231
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:29.390
hilarious scenes develop.

232
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.070
The Quixote follows the loose structure of the adventure book,

233
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.660
like the Romances of chivalry that he parodies but also like the pickers.

234
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.100
So it needs the,

235
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:45.210
these inns us waypoints were characters from various origins and classes meet

236
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.100
the income provided kind of archeology of society and moveable home,

237
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.610
four characters away from home.
What I mean by an archeology of society,

238
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.650
he say you see at the same time,

239
00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:02.651
but I swear you make a cut on the earth to study the various layers.

240
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.260
Uh,
the,

241
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.970
the here you see there is layers of social classes or pressing at the same time.

242
00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:12.010
In the end,
this is where the ind provides what I call an archeology of,

243
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:12.973
of society.

244
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.510
It is not the end that we encounter for the first time.

245
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:22.511
Don Quixote's ability to transform a crass reality into a literary elution.

246
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.680
Although he has done some of that in naming of course his,
his horse,

247
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.150
that process that is highlighted by the fact that he is confronted with the

248
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:36.200
extreme of crassness of crassness,
no ordinary women.

249
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.310
Those he turned into damn sauce but horse,

250
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:46.150
not ordinary travelers but swine hurts the lowest of the lowest.

251
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:51.270
The people who dealt with pigs were the lowest of the,
um,

252
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.120
there is a group task contrast between the innkeeper,

253
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.200
their horse and,
and,
and the 19th ceremony for instance.

254
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:02.850
It's a clash of extremes.

255
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.930
Is there an element of a noble meant in Don Quixote's doggit perception of the

256
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.490
ugly.
Beautiful.
Is there an element?
Uh,

257
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.760
is this one of the reasons the book has endured once a desire to a noble a

258
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.360
reality with one we'll do,

259
00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:28.440
we begin to glimpse here in the madness admission to force them to reality,

260
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:29.670
his perception of it,

261
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.390
but also notice that because he treats the horse with deference,

262
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.990
they are kind to him as is the innkeeper.

263
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.570
It is a constant.
Instead [inaudible] work that lower class people,

264
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.280
even criminals can be kind in given situations.

265
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.310
There is no class determinism instead of making criminals evil.

266
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.180
Uh,
uh,
quite the contrary,

267
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.360
he's over all the is over.
Oh,

268
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.960
vision of humankind is a positive one.

269
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.310
No one is completely evil in Cervantes.

270
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:17.270
In this he is very different from Shakespeare and he's sober conception of the

271
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:19.620
human.

272
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.090
If we are going to believe my very dear friend Harold and his version of

273
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:25.850
Shakespeare and Shakespeare,

274
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.860
the invention of the Human Cervantes says view of humanity is not a somber and

275
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.060
you will discover this as you read the book.

276
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.660
It is also at the end,
however,

277
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.160
that Don Quixote is turned for the first time into an object of amusement.

278
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.900
The innkeeper plays along to have something to laugh at that night,

279
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.930
uh,
are not the innkeeper and the other guests in need of amusement like the idal

280
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:58.040
reader.
That's Advantis addresses.
Uh,

281
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.360
here is another level of which don't be haughty is going to provide a amusement.

282
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.820
The ceremony of the Knights of Don Quixote is a parody of those in the books of

283
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.980
Cherry in the romances of chivalry.

284
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.160
But do we not begin to notice in this scene a certain degree of cruelty toward

285
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.900
Don Quixote on the part of other characters and of Servantez himself?

286
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.660
There is.
So this is something that Jorge Luis Borges has degraded.

287
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.680
Argentine writer has remarked upon there certain crooners sometimes in in the

288
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.750
way that that Cervantes portrays his characters.

289
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.140
There is a hint that trying to do the good can be ridiculous and that no good

290
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:43.810
deed goes on punished as it were,
but it,
this is so chiefly,

291
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.800
I think because of Oakey.

292
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:49.810
Horta is a living anachronism he has of justice that are outmoded.

293
00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.450
Now in the original,

294
00:20:53.451 --> 00:20:57.680
the contrast between Don Quixote on the other characters is achieved by means of

295
00:20:57.681 --> 00:21:00.590
the manners of speech and dialectical contrasts.

296
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.800
We will see that in a minute in his fight with the basket.

297
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.290
I call him what Jarvis cost him something else and we'll get into that in a

298
00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.850
minute.
Okay.

299
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.850
Hold a speech turns to the our cake when he speaks about matters of chivalry,

300
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.330
he uses our cake words drawn from the romances of chivalry.

301
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.330
<v 2>MMM.</v>

302
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.180
<v 0>This is a very important part,
uh,
of,
uh,</v>

303
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:30.870
surrenders his achievement that is lost in the translation,
but that the,

304
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.140
uh,
English,
uh,
reader can gauge.

305
00:21:34.141 --> 00:21:37.260
That is the differentiation between the characters are among the characters by

306
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:38.220
the way they speak.

307
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.810
You can gauge it by thinking of a novel that was very much influenced by

308
00:21:42.811 --> 00:21:43.644
Cervantes.

309
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.770
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Speech marks the characters by providing

310
00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:53.940
their social station and even region of origin.
And we will see that in a minute.

311
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.730
Uh,
I read the adventures of Huckleberry Finn as a child,
first in Spanish,

312
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.400
and of course they didn't translate into the Spanish that dialect differences

313
00:22:05.401 --> 00:22:09.720
between Jim and Hawk and so forth.
I still like the normal very much.

314
00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:14.160
And then when I read it,
once I had learned English in college,
I was astonished.

315
00:22:14.161 --> 00:22:17.370
It was like another book.
Uh,
and I had a,
uh,

316
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.600
a great deal of difficulty understanding Jim's a speech.

317
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.160
This is prevalent in the whole taste.

318
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.680
Perhaps the first novel in which this is accomplished.

319
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:30.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

320
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:35.550
<v 0>The inkeeper is himself like a literary character and a kind of haughty in that</v>

321
00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:41.030
he tells of his youth,
which is a youth,
uh,

322
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.220
youth misspent as a picker row.
Uh,

323
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.380
as if it had been a romance of chivalry.

324
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:49.450
He uses the rhetoric of the romance of chill.

325
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:53.680
Everyone has of jewelry to tell of his life of,
of petty crime.

326
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.170
And,
uh,
uh,
he's a minor,

327
00:22:56.171 --> 00:22:59.390
don't want who's seduces widows and stuff like that.
He,

328
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.910
he says with great pride and he mentions the places where is he,

329
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.000
where he had been as if,
as if they were great places.

330
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:12.300
And they are really the most notorious and Poria work we're pickers met in

331
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:13.144
Spain.

332
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.003
<v 2>Uh,</v>

333
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.910
<v 0>so he took them play Don Quixote's rhetorical game and he's kind of,</v>

334
00:23:19.911 --> 00:23:24.880
when I came verted mirror image of Don Quixote here,
uh,

335
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.110
you have to read carefully is around,

336
00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:30.040
this is very subtle in creating these characters.

337
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:34.270
And here we have this character,
uh,
sort of,
uh,
uh,
marking,

338
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:38.500
but at the same time,
uh,
using Don Quixote's,
uh,

339
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:43.060
uh,
rhetoric,
uh,
to transform his life,
uh,

340
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:48.020
into something important.
Uh,
so,

341
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.350
but so,

342
00:23:49.351 --> 00:23:54.170
so there is a kind of a synthesis in this character between the rhetoric of the

343
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:56.180
romance of chivalry and the picaresque.

344
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.040
This is what's the renders achieves through these,
uh,
very interesting character.

345
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.170
Now,
the [inaudible] is obviously a kind of baptism.

346
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.630
Uh,
it is a parody of similar ceremonies in the romances of Chabrier's.

347
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.310
I've said,
uh,
it is true that it is a parody,

348
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:21.311
but in the fictitious world on Don Quixotes creating it has a certain aura of

349
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:23.120
sacredness.
Nevertheless,

350
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:28.510
the act completes the process of self invention that began in the first chapter.

351
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.850
It legitimizes it within that world.
With this,

352
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.470
with the ceremony of his being knighted courses be knighted by a ridiculous

353
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.420
retired big row in this,
in surrounded by horse and so forth.

354
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.450
But nevertheless,
in the,
it has an aura of sacredness,

355
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:47.240
and he finally achieved knighthood.

356
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.240
Now the two episodes in the road after the 19,

357
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:57.860
intensify moral issues that Don Quixote's madness brings up.

358
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.970
Why,
why does this madness bring up,
uh,
uh,

359
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:06.260
these moral issues?
Because in his madness,

360
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:10.880
he refuses to abide,
to recognize and to accept social conventions.

361
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:16.390
And that way he highlights the arbitrariness of such conventions,

362
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:22.100
uh,
mad men and children do that by asking why,
why,

363
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.910
why,
why,
or by acting as if they don't care.
Why.

364
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.430
And then bringing out that these conventions are indeed conventional.

365
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.020
And this is why Gnocchi holder will once and again,
uh,
uh,
create,

366
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.260
uh,
more of a crisis

367
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.580
with one.
I'll doodle.

368
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.040
I doodle is the fellow who flogging,
uh,

369
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:54.500
undress his servant,
uh,
for having,
according to him,

370
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.940
for having stolen from him,
some of his,
uh,
animals.

371
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.500
Uh,

372
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.090
with one I'll do [inaudible] dokey hotel trusts in a kind of honesty that does

373
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:08.620
not exist anymore or perhaps never existed except in the books of,
of,

374
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.970
of chivalry.
Uh,

375
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.980
his intervention makes matters worse as we know.
Uh,

376
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.780
this is the first of several episodes in which the reader's seems to be invited

377
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.410
to judge,
uh,
who is right.

378
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:30.130
And the rest there are hints that undressed may very well be in rogue that role,

379
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.570
uh,
and that he may have indeed stolen from his master,

380
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:39.300
in which case,
according to the laws of the land,
I'll do the,

381
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.110
had every right to flog him.
In fact,

382
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.510
when undressed appears later on and he will re up here,

383
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.480
he is on his way to Seville.

384
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.600
That's a telltale sign because [inaudible] was the center of picaresque life.

385
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.890
Now think of Seville,
us being a,
a very,

386
00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:02.940
very important port in Spain because it was through Seville.

387
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.660
Read your Elliot that Spain communicated with.

388
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:11.520
It's overseas and Pyre.
Everything came in through Loserville,
which is,

389
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:15.630
you know,
up there,
we're lucky me river that you're protected in that sense.

390
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.960
So really was a teaming port and ports are always full of corruption and uh,

391
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.250
uh,
and the like,

392
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:26.940
because of all of the exchange of goods and the various peoples who are there.

393
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.060
So Seville was known for being a center of bigger as life.

394
00:27:31.061 --> 00:27:33.450
So these details around this throws in there when,

395
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.830
when undress appears later and he's going to civilian job,
this is a bigger,

396
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.850
so he may have been,
uh,
uh,

397
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.790
so he may have been guilty when I'll do go whips him.

398
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.583
Uh,

399
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.510
Don Quixote is applying a justice that is anachronistic because by this time

400
00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.390
Spain had a very well developed and thorough,
uh,

401
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.550
criminal justice system,

402
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:06.810
very thorough and very well developed.
Uh,

403
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.470
all of these matters,
uh,
found their way.
Uh,

404
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.560
it was a litigious society almost as much as the United States is a litigious

405
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:16.320
society nowadays.
Uh,

406
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.100
so the way that he intervenes is totally anachronistic.

407
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.500
Now with the top level merchants,
uh,

408
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.210
the conflict texts on a more philosophical,
even doctrinaire CAC,

409
00:28:29.211 --> 00:28:31.230
he didn't know it is a hilarious episode.

410
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.740
This is where he appears before these merchants and says that they have to

411
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:38.280
declare that [inaudible] was a beautiful lady in the world.

412
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.670
And,
uh,
at a distance,
he's saying this and one of them who is a,

413
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.740
who is a bit of a jester disadvantageous interject.

414
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:49.230
You have to see how these people said,
well,
wait a minute,

415
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.780
could you at least shows some kind of a picture or something that we can gauge

416
00:28:54.781 --> 00:28:55.614
this by?

417
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.790
Because she may have some stuff pouring out of her eye and don't be older,

418
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.470
says not important or MRI.

419
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.460
And then he charges whether the reverse in Antioch falls and all this is totally

420
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:09.300
hilarious,
uh,
episode.
Um,

421
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.900
but uh,
can one belief but one cannot see,

422
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.730
see what is behind this episode.

423
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.450
What is the role of sensorial experience in questions of believe?

424
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.650
Isn't there also potentially a social religious subtext here?

425
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:36.590
Is it not likely that these merchants from Toledo are Jews or converted Jews?

426
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.950
There's Jews who have been forced to convert.

427
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:46.830
Then is then is the test of which they are being subjected,

428
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:51.130
not playing with the issue of conversion of forced conversion.

429
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:56.560
It also seems to allude to fierce debates in the 16th century about religious

430
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:57.394
images,

431
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:02.620
which the Protestants did not allow and the Catholics did and,
and so forth.

432
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.710
This is a,
the stakes are getting higher.

433
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.060
And as I explained in an earlier lecture,
Servantez presents,
it's higher stakes,

434
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:14.000
always in a light rain.
And a very humorous episode was still this,
uh,

435
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.910
issues are there
now.

436
00:30:18.911 --> 00:30:22.060
Don't get hold.
Of course,
it's beaten to a pulp by one of the servants.

437
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:26.410
This is the ultimate insult and humiliation to be bitten by a commoner,

438
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.990
uh,
after I haven't been betrayed by [inaudible],

439
00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:34.390
they just cannot really move from a truck to a gallop without falling.

440
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.760
And you will see that,
that similar things happen in,
in,
in,

441
00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:40.810
in,
in the future.

442
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.640
So Don Quixote is picked up by Pedro Alonzo.

443
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.770
Notice the common names.

444
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:52.540
Cervantes gives very common names to where he common people,
Pedro alone.

445
00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:55.510
So it's like being called Peter Johnson or something like that.

446
00:30:55.511 --> 00:30:58.210
So these parallels is one of his neighbors.

447
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.230
He picks him up and noticed he's kindness,

448
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.000
not only in picking up poor,
uh,

449
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.440
along of Hannah as he sees him or his neighbor,

450
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.620
but also in waiting until dark before going into the village to that people

451
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:16.360
would not see don Quixote in this condition.
Again,

452
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.920
it's an act of kindness on the part of,
uh,
uh,
a very low class,

453
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.880
a character.

454
00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:26.660
This is what I was saying before about a characters in Cervantes,

455
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.360
no matter what their social class,
being able to perform these acts of kindness,

456
00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.710
there are echoes of the Good Samaritan and so forth.
And the Bible,

457
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:39.280
if you want to see biblical echoes in the Quixote.

458
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.970
I have to tell you a brief story.

459
00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:45.520
When a close relative of mine was in the hospital,

460
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:48.100
very ill and I used to go see him.

461
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.880
I used to spend the time sometimes,
uh,

462
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.450
reading the Kihatha and I would get on the elevator sometimes with Mikey Hoff

463
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.080
like this,
and there will be ministers who are also,

464
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:01.660
we're also there to see dying patients.
Uh,

465
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:05.470
most of them actually likes to say African American ministers.

466
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:10.420
And they would see me with the book and I would not,
uh,

467
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.830
as if our knowledge in that I was one of their cards.
Uh,

468
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.640
so,
uh,
so,
uh,

469
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.260
now don Quixote's matter than ever because of the beaten,

470
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:26.810
he has been administered,
uh,
and,
uh,

471
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.380
he begins to return home.
Uh,

472
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:34.120
the return returns home always problematic.

473
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.320
Presumably one is returning to the familiar to the county,

474
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:44.090
but now the house is going to turn into some very uncanny,

475
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:48.090
uh,
place.
Uh,
uh,

476
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:53.950
it is the house where most remember is also the of the abode of the books.

477
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.810
It houses the books that are the source of Loki Jihad.
This is madness.

478
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:03.440
So it is the familiar,
uh,
the home,

479
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.360
but also the place where the source of his madness is contained.

480
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.000
It is also the place of resource battles as we learn where he would get up in

481
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:17.640
the middle of the night and begin slashing,
uh,
with his,
uh,

482
00:33:17.641 --> 00:33:21.950
with his sword.
And as we will see in a minute,
and as I'm sure you read,

483
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.730
it is a very malleable place.
Uh,
this house changes.
Uh,

484
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.490
I see if the county were also the uncanny are playing here.

485
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.640
The background on my commentary here is this is the great essay by Freud on the

486
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.900
uncanny become kindly,
uh,

487
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.480
he's theory being that the uncanny is the canny,

488
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.740
the familiar becoming suddenly unfamiliar,

489
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.110
not something totally unfamiliar with the familiar becoming certainly
unfamiliar.

490
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:54.410
And this is what is happening here,
uh,
with his,
uh,
with his house,

491
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.960
uh,
houses,
uh,
and shelters,
ins,

492
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.680
palaces,
and all of those are very important in the Quixote.
And I,

493
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.570
I,
I,
I urge you to take a notice of them,

494
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.110
uh,
now,

495
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.640
either here or after the scrutiny is where the hotel was going to end according

496
00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:19.980
to one of the theories that is contained in your,
in your book,

497
00:34:19.981 --> 00:34:21.560
the essay by men in their speed dial.

498
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.360
I will talk about that at the end of the scrutiny.
But this is,

499
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:29.410
this is a very important point that I want to make today to do or to speak about

500
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:32.000
that in any case,
uh,

501
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.930
this return home brings up the issue of repetition.

502
00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:38.620
Uh,
uh,

503
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:43.600
which leads to the philosophical question of whether they can be repetition and

504
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.740
the aesthetic problem of representation.

505
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:49.910
Because representing is also always a form of repetition,
repeating something.

506
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:51.643
Um,

507
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.070
and the issue of representation is at the core of the questions about literature

508
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:01.370
that's Advantis brings up throughout the whole book.

509
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.820
It also dovetails with donkey hold his own project to revive the heroic age.
Can,

510
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:11.780
something can be revived,
can be,
can it be,
repeat it.

511
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.513
Uh,

512
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.140
the return also allows for a fuller analysis of Don Quixote is madness.

513
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:22.100
The housekeeper underneath related ventures of Don Quixote is prior to his first

514
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.963
Sally.

515
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.560
The needs recounts how he would read for two days and nights with straight

516
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:29.060
without rest.
We're upon,

517
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:32.270
he would draw his sword on flail I see in the battle until exhausted.

518
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.220
Steady.
They return allows us to learn more about the etiology,

519
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.640
the origin of donkey hope.
This is a madness.

520
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.610
Uh,
the literary madness is not sufficient for Cervantes.

521
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.950
Uh,
and so he seems to have the need us.

522
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.340
Remember when I mentioned that,

523
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.750
what are the sound once book by the doctor that I mentioned who wrote examining

524
00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.593
Haniel's.

525
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.880
This gives us some details about don Quixote's fees,

526
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:08.130
physical qualities,
and all of that that make the,
the,
uh,

527
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:13.130
the,
the,
that make him,
uh,
uh,
prone to madness.
For instance,

528
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.470
he's,
he's thinness.
The dryness of his skin.

529
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:21.830
Dry Constitution in the theory was humorous of the time of medicine at the time,

530
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.330
made him,
uh,
uh,
uh,

531
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:29.840
a candidate for the kind of madness that here this is because,
uh,

532
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:35.100
Cervantes on like Dante who's divine comedy is thoroughly allegorical,

533
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:36.643
uh,

534
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:41.340
Sarandis only free flirts with allegory but always seems to avoid it.

535
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.260
What I mean is this is not an allegorical madman.

536
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.480
This is a particular madman with a specific illness,

537
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.310
not an every man who can easily be subsumed in the week at the beginning of the

538
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.480
divine comedy.
And they'll met.

539
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.370
So they'll come in Nostra Savita Nostra we tie in the middle of a journey of our

540
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:03.990
lives.
This is,
this,
this particular,
uh,
Matt Man,

541
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.520
this is why all these details about his life at home are given his diet and all

542
00:37:11.191 --> 00:37:15.660
of that.
Our details around this are given to justify to his madness and just the

543
00:37:15.661 --> 00:37:16.620
literary madness.

544
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.640
Now the book burning and the walling of the library will be curious for donkey

545
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:28.800
holders,
madness,
but both are also filled with all kinds of implications.

546
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.180
But through both parts of the,
of,
of the novel,
uh,

547
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.050
the characters will be,
uh,
searching for cures for donkey Quixote.

548
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.610
Uh,

549
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.900
and here obviously the burning of the books and the walling off of the library

550
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.480
are a part of the,
of the cure.

551
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:50.100
You eliminate the source and you eliminate the illness.
Now,

552
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.770
the inquisition of the library or the scrutiny of a library is one of the most

553
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:57.460
famous episodes in the Quixote.

554
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.500
And of course one of the favorite ones of literary critics and historians

555
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:04.690
because he deals with books.
Um,

556
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.720
again,

557
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.310
it is conjecture that the end of the library episode would have been the end of

558
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:16.311
the Novella of Don Quixote if indeed what's Advantis proposed to write was a

559
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:19.760
long short story about,
uh,

560
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.470
don't get this man who goes mad from bleeding too much,

561
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.610
etc. And then this novella would end here.
Uh,

562
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:29.510
and that would have been it.
He wrote many of those shortened oilettes.

563
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.410
We published 12 of them in,
in 16,
13.
He called them extemporary stories.

564
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.320
It is conjecture,
but you will read it in many industry doll,

565
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:40.780
uh,
uh,

566
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.120
essay that this was going to be the Hilton and that Cervantes,

567
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:47.560
uh,

568
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.360
took stock of the fact that there were the character and the situation had great

569
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.830
possibilities and continued from then on.
Uh,

570
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.960
he's normal.
Uh,

571
00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.880
now one can buy all the way back.
I get back to that in a minute.

572
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.400
Uh,
that the,
the Eh,

573
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.890
the inquiry of the library is of course,
uh,

574
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.780
a satire of the Spanish inquisition.
This is clear.

575
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.620
They put the Spanish inquisition also for bid books,

576
00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:24.700
picked up books and burned books.
So,
uh,

577
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.470
it is a mile of satire.

578
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.490
I hear the English edition is represented by uh,

579
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.350
uh,
the niece who's 19 years old,

580
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:39.610
the housekeeper,
a village priest at Barbara.

581
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:44.500
I mean these are not exactly a high intellect and the inquisition,
uh,

582
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.690
they positions officers were so,

583
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:52.820
so this is a satire instead of anthis even against menacing institutions like

584
00:39:53.461 --> 00:39:58.210
the inquisition,
these always mild.
It's always mild,
never,
uh,

585
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.460
very,
uh,
uh,
bitter.

586
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:06.090
Now details that are somewhat important about the,
the,
the,

587
00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:08.800
the scrutiny of the library is that notebook in it,

588
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.730
in the library was published after 1591.

589
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:18.090
So that allows us to surmise that the hotel was written after 19 1591.

590
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:24.970
The chapter is the bibliography that Cervantes refused to provide in the

591
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:29.380
prologue.
Remember when his friend says you don't have to,
you can make it up.

592
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.460
Well,
this is the,
this is the bibliography.
Uh,

593
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:35.351
of course,

594
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:37.890
he couldn't have given this radiography in the prologue because it'd be

595
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.750
biography made off of romances of chivalry is not a very,
uh,

596
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.190
authoritative bibliography.
I said,
worry is not Aristotle,

597
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.960
Plato and Saint Thomas Aquinas,
but I'm at least their gala and so forth.

598
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:55.240
Uh,
so,
uh,
what he's giving here are the sources of donkey Quixote's madness.

599
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.350
And,
uh,
he's,
he's caring.

600
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.740
He's protagonist literary genealogy.
This is the,

601
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.420
the family background that he refuses to provide about Loki Hotez,

602
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.680
quote unquote real family.
Now,

603
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:16.300
what has donkey,
how to read?
Well,
devalued romances,
but also renaissance.

604
00:41:16.301 --> 00:41:18.970
Epic's,
uh,

605
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.300
pastoral romances and some serious poetry.

606
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.600
What is missing from this library?

607
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:33.500
Religious books,
classics and religious books.
Uh,

608
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:38.530
there are no devotional books in this library as one we'll find in the library

609
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:43.340
of Diego than me.
Danda a character in the second part,
uh,

610
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.240
who says that he has devotional books.
Now,
of course,

611
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.920
most American readers are astonished that there is no Bible,

612
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.600
but this is Catholic,
Spain and in Catholic countries,

613
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.370
we don't read the Bible.

614
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:03.020
We read devotional books or hear the Bible in sermons from the priests.

615
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.180
So of course it's this.

616
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:09.770
If this were a library in New England or in Old England,

617
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.130
they would have been a bible,
but no Bible,
uh,
here at all.

618
00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:18.020
But no devotional books either.
What's these means?
Is that along Saki.

619
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:20.600
Hannah is a belated human,
is that,

620
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:23.480
it's a humanist that came at the end of humanism,

621
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.780
lack Cervantes himself a Christian with a weakness for a frivolous literature,

622
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.170
but not very piles or devout.

623
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

624
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:41.920
<v 0>Although it is true for a human is there are no classics here either.</v>

625
00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:47.170
They're very little poetry.
Although Don Quixote's throughout the,

626
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.890
the novel seems to know a lot about poetry and even composers and poetry.

627
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.870
There's nothing by the Great Gfsi Lasso,

628
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:59.070
the important Petrarch on style part of the 16th century in Spain who was a

629
00:42:59.741 --> 00:43:03.940
model of poets and to whom Don Quixote alludes all the time.

630
00:43:03.941 --> 00:43:06.040
Somehow it is missing this,

631
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:08.870
this library does not give the whole range of the rant.

632
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:13.100
This is readings or even of Don Quixote's is uh,
uh,
uh,

633
00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:18.160
reading what prevail are the romances of chivalry,
about whom,

634
00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:23.180
uh,
about which I spoke in the last class for them,
uh,
for lucky did,

635
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:28.181
they represented a world of absolute values in a fake pass and place,

636
00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.180
<v 2>uh,</v>

637
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.240
<v 0>where there is no fish fish.</v>

638
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:37.670
Your don't break between the imagination desire and the real,
uh,

639
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:43.030
now in fact is that very few romances of chivalry appeared in Spain after 1565

640
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.720
said lantus was born in 1547.
This book appears in 1605.

641
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.050
The action supposedly takes place in the 1590s.

642
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.470
So in this don Quixote is also a bit out of fashion.

643
00:43:57.471 --> 00:43:59.360
These romances or chivalry seems to be,

644
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:02.900
seem to be already a little out of fashion,
but things move slowly.

645
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:08.000
And the fact is that many characters in the novel appear to have read the

646
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:12.290
romances of chivalry and to be very conversant with the romances of chivalry.

647
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.390
<v 2>Um,
so,
uh,</v>

648
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.620
<v 0>what else do we have?
Pastoral Romances,</v>

649
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:26.540
Pastor Romances,
uh,
where stories of fake shepherds,

650
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:31.530
people playing the role of shepherds from the backlogs,
logs of antiquity,
uh,

651
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.630
involved in amorous adventures,
uh,
uh,
in,
in,
in neoplatonic,
uh,

652
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.040
fashion going through a,
a beautiful,
uh,

653
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.080
in beautiful natural settings that corresponded to the who to the purity of

654
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:48.900
their love and this and that.
And yet they could lead to tragic consequences.

655
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:49.734
And this is as you will,

656
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:54.690
as you will see in the Marcel Andrew [inaudible] episode that is coming up very

657
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.430
soon.
Uh,

658
00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:01.670
these romances of pastoral Romances I know are the furthest away from the modern

659
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.700
sensibility.
One can imagine a modern,
uh,

660
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.960
chief Valerie Romance.
But I mentioned,

661
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.510
I talked about James Bond and the Fleming movies and all of that,

662
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.570
but he's almost impossible to think of a modern pastoral.
It's not,

663
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.580
not impossible,
but very improbable.
Um,

664
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.730
but this is one of the roles that don't get hot.
They could have chosen to play.

665
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.960
And in fact,
later on in the novel,
he will try to become a shepherd to,

666
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.720
he will think of becoming a shepherd to now,

667
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:36.380
whom does set Avantis surprisingly include among the authors in the,

668
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.720
uh,
in donkey health library

669
00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.940
set of vomitus himself.
He had said,
well,
I'm just himself.

670
00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:52.770
Uh,
they got a lot there.
The Jarvis rights.

671
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.630
Michael,

672
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:58.630
this Advantis said the Barbara that's Advantis has been a great friend of mine

673
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:02.820
these many years and I know that he is better acquainted with misfortune and

674
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:07.490
stand with poetry.
His book has somewhat of good invention.
It,

675
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.260
he's talking about Cervantes is pastoral romance.

676
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:14.160
Like he proposes something but concludes nothing.

677
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.110
We must wait for the second part,

678
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:19.290
which he promises perhaps on his amendment,

679
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:24.030
he may obtain that entire partner and so forth.
Uh,
so this is,

680
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:26.490
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
a wink,

681
00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:31.590
a of this to the reader in which he's inviting us to sort of fall in the same,

682
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.670
uh,
error as don Quixote blaring literature and reality.

683
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:42.930
This is what happens when said Vantis the author whose name is imprinted on the,

684
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:47.240
on the cover of the book a within the fiction of the book,
the,
the,

685
00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.000
the distinction between fiction and reality to be doing literature in reality is

686
00:46:51.001 --> 00:46:54.670
blurred.
And Cervantes is,
is,
is,
is,
is,
uh,

687
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.750
intimating that the reading of Literature in general can lead to such,

688
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:05.010
uh,
uh,
uh,
confusion.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

689
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.990
all of these,
as I will explain in a minute,

690
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.780
all always the self referential things are very funny,

691
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:14.910
but they have behind a very serious,
uh,
ideas.

692
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.693
Now

693
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:25.100
notice also the irony that both the priest and the barber are steeped in the

694
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:32.140
romances of Chivel.
They are readers of the romances of jewelry.

695
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:34.870
They know them very well.
They defend some,

696
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:38.320
and the priests speaks of having even begun to write one.

697
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.380
We will find more readers.

698
00:47:41.381 --> 00:47:45.550
So the romances of chivalry and more potential riders of romantic romances of

699
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:47.650
chivalry through the novel.

700
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:55.730
I notice the elaborate lie that the niece comes up with to explain the

701
00:47:58.561 --> 00:48:03.470
disappearance of the library from the house.
It is a,
it is astonishing offenders.

702
00:48:03.471 --> 00:48:07.240
He has don Quixote's,
the maybe it runs in the family,
uh,

703
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:11.070
and an old man riding a snake leaves a trail of smoke.

704
00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:17.490
I hope you,
uh,
you noticed this,
a marvelous passage,

705
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:22.140
uh,
where,
uh,
the niece says,

706
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:27.180
uh,
uh,
well the,
the incubator says that it does,

707
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.130
that it was a devil.
The Carter,

708
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.640
he was not the devil said Denise on page 55,

709
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:37.910
but an enchanter who came on one night up on a cloud after the day of your

710
00:48:38.191 --> 00:48:40.800
departure is gs addressing donkey haughty,
uh,

711
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.960
hence and alighting from a serpent on which he wrote,
entered into the room.

712
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.320
And I know not what he did there,
but after some little time out,

713
00:48:49.321 --> 00:48:53.400
he came flying through the roof and left the house full of smoke.

714
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

715
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.250
<v 0>And when we went to see what he had been doing,
we saw,
we saw neither books,</v>

716
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.570
no room only.
We were well re the only week very well,

717
00:49:03.571 --> 00:49:08.571
remember both I and mistress housekeeper here that when the old thief went away,

718
00:49:08.761 --> 00:49:13.761
he said with a loud voice that for a secret and meaty e board to the owner of

719
00:49:14.011 --> 00:49:17.580
those books.
I know the room.
He had done it.
This shift in this house,

720
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:21.000
we should sue be manifest.
He told us also that he,

721
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:24.780
he was called the [inaudible] free stone.

722
00:49:24.781 --> 00:49:28.370
He meant to say quote Don Quixote Sad.
Okay.
How'd it doesn't?
Of course,

723
00:49:28.371 --> 00:49:30.840
that's in question.
The reality.

724
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.170
He just questions the mispronunciation of the name of the enchanter.

725
00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.050
What does it mean that the needs to tell this lie?

726
00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:43.130
The physical disappearance of the library walled off by the housekeeper and the

727
00:49:43.131 --> 00:49:47.980
niece is an instance of the world of reality conspiring to increase Gnocchi,

728
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:51.170
hottest madness.
And of the uncanny,
the familiar,

729
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.680
the house becoming unfamiliar.

730
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.250
He came and began looking for the,

731
00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:03.340
for the room and running his hands through the wall and couldn't find the door.

732
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:04.933
Uh,

733
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.870
it has been said that there is a contradiction in this action of walling off the

734
00:50:08.871 --> 00:50:10.970
library when there are no longer any books in it.

735
00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.660
But Don Quixote does not know this.

736
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:19.400
And also it would have been difficult to explain to him that the books had been

737
00:50:19.401 --> 00:50:23.300
burnt or given away.
They were burned.
They were his property.

738
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.780
So they have committed a punishable act,

739
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.590
the barber that breeze the knees and the housekeeper,

740
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:33.590
a covering their own actions with a fiction ally,

741
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.560
embellished by the nieces wild imagination,

742
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:41.030
which is contaminated by the romances of chivalry themselves.

743
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:45.890
This reveals,
notice that said one,
there's us and pillows,
but Geez,

744
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:50.240
a reader romances of jewelry.
We learned through this,
uh,
speech of hers,

745
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:53.600
that she is a reader of romances of jewelry and that,
uh,

746
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.560
she suggests that that Ci to,
uh,
uh,

747
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.620
read is romances probably sneaking into her uncle's library and reading them.

748
00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:04.040
They're secretly,

749
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.930
you see how much Cervantes can suggest without saying it directly.

750
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:11.803
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

751
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:16.920
<v 0>Now and more significant contradiction is that while the library is walled off</v>

752
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.940
and the book burned,

753
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.630
the character's continued to speak to the Quixote from within the fictions of

754
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:25.590
jewelry.
They,

755
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:30.810
they both cure and making more insane or they trying to cure him by because they

756
00:51:31.691 --> 00:51:35.560
realized that he can only be spoken to from within his own mat world.

757
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.470
Um,
Eh,
eh,
Claudio,

758
00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:44.290
a very famous critical unfortunately passed away about a year ago.

759
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.120
Uh,
uh,
since that Don Quixote is enveloped by a written context,

760
00:51:49.121 --> 00:51:51.220
the literary journals or the romances of jewelry,

761
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.700
which to him historically was historically true,

762
00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:59.440
structured by potential adventures that await him home foreseen but appropriate

763
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.870
by virtue of that genre.
Because after this,

764
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:04.540
Don Quixote does not read another book.

765
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:11.460
He doesn't even read the book about himself as the characters in part to do when

766
00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:12.670
you get to part two,

767
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:17.020
one of the fun parts of part two is that the readers,

768
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.870
I mean that the,
the,
the characters are they the,

769
00:52:19.871 --> 00:52:24.490
the protagonist and counter have read part one
on,

770
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.240
they expect Don Quixote to act according to how he acted in part one.
But okay,

771
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:30.370
hold the,
has not read it.

772
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.800
Sandra has an ear of course because he can read.
But uh,

773
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:39.490
so Bodak yellow does not read another book after,
uh,
after this,

774
00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:41.350
no central enters the scene.

775
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.180
So he represents European peasant dream from time in memorial.

776
00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:51.700
Saint Joe,
by the way,
is a very common person type of name.

777
00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:54.850
The only one I can come up in English is Wilbur.

778
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:59.140
I think that a farmer in English would be called Wilbur.

779
00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:03.630
I mean it's an Smith.
Remember that?
A,
that a comic strip.
Uh,

780
00:53:03.631 --> 00:53:06.580
I would imagine someone being called Wilbur.
I Dunno why,

781
00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:11.470
but that's what I imagined.
Centuries is a very,
very common name.
It gives us

782
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.130
a,
chuck always eludes me.

783
00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.673
<v 2>Uh,</v>

784
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.850
<v 0>it gives us the last name,
Sanchez in Spanish that many of you have heard.
I'm</v>

785
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:31.620
Sanchez in fact,
uh,
um,
when it has not,
of course you need the accident,

786
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.750
uh,
Spanish names.

787
00:53:33.751 --> 00:53:38.751
That means belonging to the family of century like Johnson Davidson,

788
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.970
the easy in Spanish gonsalo becomes Gonzales.

789
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:47.760
Grober ego becomes Rodriguez.
Martine becomes Martinez.
You see,

790
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:51.060
I told you you were going to learn tidbits about Spanish culture and there is
one

791
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.740
how Spanish,
not all Spanish last name.

792
00:53:55.741 --> 00:54:00.630
How this common Spanish last names like Mine Gonzalez,
uh,
now.

793
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:03.210
So Sanchez Sanchez,
uh,

794
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:08.130
he banned some means what we belly,
belly gut.

795
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.300
Uh,
it,
it refers to his,

796
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:17.450
to his eating habits and to his being very much in touch with the matter with

797
00:54:19.431 --> 00:54:21.660
the earth.
Um,

798
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.250
now of course he could represent is common sense in contrast to Don Quixote's

799
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:30.060
flights of fancy and I mean common sense,
the sense of the common people,

800
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.960
whereas Gnocchi whole days,
a voracious readers,
centuries illiterate,

801
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.580
he has in his head all the oral law.
Uh,

802
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:43.020
however he expresses this through his friendliness or,
uh,

803
00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:48.310
uh,
proverbs as you will see soon,
uh,

804
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:53.390
brothers that are the source of folk wisdom on which the fascinated humanism,

805
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.300
the humanist,
by the way,
because they,
they thought that the pro,
the proverbs,

806
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.610
the roughriders were a form of,

807
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.840
of common philosophy of the people and that that philosophy could potentially

808
00:55:04.921 --> 00:55:08.430
contain as much wisdom as regular philosophy.

809
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.110
That is a book of proverbs in the Bible and a philosopher,
philosophers,
uh,

810
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:18.060
have used such a,
uh,
snippets,
uh,

811
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.480
like [inaudible] in France,

812
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.770
the 17th century who wrote mcsema maxims.

813
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:32.310
Lover.
Could you Nikki levies diggy say Vishu is nothing but vice.

814
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:37.170
This guys said [inaudible] Shuko in his first and Maxime Nichie wrote,

815
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:42.030
uh,
such a short snippets,
uh,
to,
uh,

816
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.620
but these are the common people's expressions of wisdom.
Uh,

817
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:49.440
he essentially will repeat them over and over.
And again,

818
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:53.310
[inaudible] he drives monkey hot.
They matter because of,
of of them.

819
00:55:53.311 --> 00:55:57.480
He can't take it anymore.
Now in terms of literary history,

820
00:55:57.481 --> 00:56:02.440
essential issues from the world of comedy of the theater of the pickers,

821
00:56:02.441 --> 00:56:06.930
kind of sell Astena some who have wanted to do an allegorical reading of the

822
00:56:06.931 --> 00:56:10.740
Quixote.
Uh,
see it as a,
the pair as an allegory of,
of,

823
00:56:10.741 --> 00:56:14.370
of mine and body Don Quixote in mind,
Sanchez the body.

824
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:20.220
But the most remarkable thing is that with his appearance,
uh,

825
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.690
the novel's a world becomes one of dialogue dialogue between central and

826
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:26.890
Oklahoma.
Now

827
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.330
what is most significant about central,

828
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.690
and this will become even more evident in part two,

829
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.200
is that without readings or refinement,

830
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:43.590
he is nevertheless endowed with sufficient wisdom to live and make valuable

831
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.290
judgment,
carbon sense,

832
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:50.770
sense of the common people as a sufficient quantity of mind.

833
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.070
This is quite a modern,
uh,

834
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:59.100
idea leading up to democratic and egalitarian notions that do not reachable

835
00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:04.240
flyer until the enlightenment in the 18th century.
And in,
in,

836
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.190
in philosophers like,
uh,

837
00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.690
show a sun dress sense,

838
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:15.670
his limitations.
And indeed influences his master,
uh,

839
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:20.410
and his attitudes.
And you will see he engages in dialog.
We don't Quixote.

840
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:21.580
And although respectful,

841
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:26.581
he holds his ground because he has a sufficient wisdom to do so.

842
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:32.650
Now,
so with sanctuary,
the,

843
00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:37.950
the,
uh,
the novel seems to be complete.
Uh,

844
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:42.280
the cast is complete,
uh,
and,
and,

845
00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.570
and the second Sally,
we'll begin here.
And the second Sally,

846
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.750
uh,
is where the hotels,
we know it really begins if,
if,

847
00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:55.580
if it was going to be a short story and Savannah this extended it to become the

848
00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.760
Quixote.
It is here that the Quixote as we know,

849
00:57:57.761 --> 00:58:01.750
it begins with sanctuary in place.
So in a sense,

850
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:06.850
Don Quixote is its own source.
Again,
self legitimation.

851
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:12.970
Now,
uh,
the adventure of the,
of the windmills I have a little bit more,

852
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:18.010
uh,
this is a signature episode of the Quixote.
As you know,

853
00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:19.380
you have seen it everywhere,

854
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:23.410
represent that everywhere you go to the Bata has airport in Madrid and you will

855
00:58:23.411 --> 00:58:28.090
find a thousand little trinkets that you can buy with the windmills and Don

856
00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:29.470
Quixote and so forth.
Hawaii.

857
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:34.010
It's the first adventure where the two characters,
uh,

858
00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:38.890
disagree about the nature of what is being seen.
Uh,

859
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:44.050
it is,
uh,
uh,
uh,
tremendously,

860
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:48.240
uh,
funny.
Uh,
it has one of the most tremendous,
uh,

861
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.570
one of the funniest lines in the whole book for me when Don Quixote.

862
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:57.850
So look at those with giants and he goes on and on about the giants and with a

863
00:58:57.851 --> 00:59:00.980
pause that,
uh,
uh,
that,
uh,

864
00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:05.990
good comic who would be able to use Sanchez,

865
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:10.780
what giants.
He just didn't see any giants.
He sees windmills.

866
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:16.180
And then so don Quixote,
uh,
uh,
uh,
charges,
uh,

867
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:20.920
and with a catastrophic result that you,
uh,
that,
you know,

868
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.183
uh,

869
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:27.490
now there are other things that are important about the scene.

870
00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:29.100
It,
it sets,
uh,

871
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:34.300
the four part structure of most scenes that will follow a one donkey hotel.

872
00:59:34.621 --> 00:59:39.530
Sanko see something.
Do they argue about what it is?
City don't get.

873
00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:44.420
Hotel takes action for discussing the aftermath of the adventure,
what it was.

874
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:52.200
And there is the moment also,
uh,

875
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:55.940
when donkey haunting,
uh,
says,
uh,

876
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:59.720
something quite profound after this,
uh,
adventure,

877
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.333
uh,

878
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.870
in trying to explain how the giants became windmills,

879
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.740
he says,
bs friends,

880
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:12.860
they 60 piece friends sanctu answered,
okay,

881
01:00:12.861 --> 01:00:16.550
hold that for matters of war are of all others.

882
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:20.030
Most subject to continual mutations,

883
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:23.820
but don't get hope that he's saying he's quite profound,
is that reality is,

884
01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:25.370
is in a state of flux.

885
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:30.260
So things may appear to be something now and be something different a moment

886
01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:33.190
later.
So He's,
he's,

887
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.080
he's interpretation is not foolish at all.

888
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:39.920
He also alludes back to the disappearance of his library.
I mean,

889
01:00:39.921 --> 01:00:44.060
these things can happen.
Hey,
my library and disappear.

890
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:49.120
This giants come become windmills and I could be,
uh,

891
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:53.840
on,
on seed it now.
Then the next two episodes,
uh,

892
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:58.660
are,
um,
a very,
uh,
interesting,
uh,

893
01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.650
uh,
on,
uh,
one is the fight with the,
what Jarvis calls.

894
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:08.650
They'd be scanner a Basque Biscayne,

895
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:14.210
or these are people from the Basque country,
the Basque country,
uh,

896
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:19.010
of the Basques occupy,
uh,
parts of Spain and France.

897
01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:24.210
The very proud people because they presumably were never invaded.

898
01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:26.540
First of all,
they have been there since the beginning of time.

899
01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:29.900
Their language cannot be traced back to Indo European sources.

900
01:01:29.901 --> 01:01:33.500
They don't know where it came from.
There,
there and there.
The Romans couldn't,

901
01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:36.020
couldn't take them over and the Arabs couldn't take them over.

902
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:37.340
So we're very proud of that at other,

903
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.200
very proud of their aristocratic background.
I know about this because my family,

904
01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:46.520
most of it is Basque and a Itchy,
watery eyes,
a Basque name.
So even today,

905
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.380
even today,
they are a bear,
a fright,

906
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.150
frightening people.
They have a,

907
01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:56.060
there is this group Will Atallah you may have heard in Spain,

908
01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:01.280
it is a separatist terrorist group that blows up,

909
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:06.170
uh,
uh,
things and kills people and so forth on both the Spanish and the French

910
01:02:06.171 --> 01:02:09.960
government have been fighting them because the Basque this group,
uh,

911
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.430
want autonomy from Spain and France.
They want their own country.

912
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.260
So this is a background,

913
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:20.470
this is the first of several characters you're going to meet in the book from

914
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.630
regions other than Castiel.
Uh,
I remember Spain is,

915
01:02:25.631 --> 01:02:29.700
is made up of several regions,
several cultures and languages.

916
01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:33.750
And the Basques are the furthest away from other cultures in the Spanish

917
01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:38.100
peninsula because they don't have a Roman background.
Uh,

918
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:42.670
their language is,
uh,
as,
as it has nothing to do with romance,
languages enhance.

919
01:02:42.671 --> 01:02:47.671
He speaks funny and part of the humor in this episode is the way he speaks very

920
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:54.771
broken Spanish and how he acts was a sense of self assurance and heartiness and

921
01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:02.410
so forth because he is Basque.
Um,

922
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.390
I am going to stop there and read just a couple of things from the background

923
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:09.960
readings and because I want to speak about the lost and found manuscript and all

924
01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:14.310
of that in relation to the,
uh,
uh,
self reflective,
reflexive and is in there.

925
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:18.990
Now I know that and I don't want to do it at the end.
When you and I are tired,

926
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.710
I wanted you to consider,
uh,

927
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.990
this is a way of uh,
uh,

928
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:32.490
encouraging you to read Elliot Elliot in periods pain.

929
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.260
These contrast that Elliot,
uh,
uh,

930
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:40.710
sets up here between Castille and Aragorn,
the crown of Aragon.

931
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.220
Therefore we this rich and energetic urban Patricia.

932
01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:48.360
It was deeply influenced by its overseas commercial interests,

933
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:50.220
mostly in the Mediterranean.

934
01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:55.770
It was imbued with a contractural concept of the relationship between kings and

935
01:03:55.771 --> 01:03:56.604
subjects,

936
01:03:56.850 --> 01:04:01.050
which had been effectively realize in institutional form and it was well

937
01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:05.390
experience in the administration of Empire.
It was there still are,
they cut.

938
01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:09.410
The lands are very good businessmen in all of these respect.

939
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:14.470
It contrasted strikingly with Midi evil cause still from which he said well,

940
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.520
uh,
came.

941
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:22.020
So the queen where in the early 14th century,

942
01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:26.520
the crown of Aragon was cosmopolitan in outlook and predominantly American title

943
01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:27.630
in its inclinations,

944
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:32.850
Contemporary Castille tended to look inwards rather than outwards,

945
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:37.910
inwards and was oriented less toward trade than war.

946
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.380
Fundamentally,

947
01:04:40.381 --> 01:04:45.381
Castille was a pastoral and nomadic society whose habits and attitudes had been

948
01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:49.860
shaped by constant warfare against the morse,

949
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.270
by the protracted process of the reconquista.

950
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:59.271
The reconquest still awaiting completion long after it was finished in the crown

951
01:05:00.241 --> 01:05:01.074
of Aragon.

952
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.380
The point that I want to suggest here is there an echo of this nomadic warlike

953
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:12.450
quantity of customers in the novel itself where the characters are on the move,

954
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:16.410
Doki hotel,
Quixote and Sanctu and all the other characters who are on the move.

955
01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.740
This is reflection of this character of Castilian society as Elliot describes it

956
01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:24.424
here.

957
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:29.500
This is just to give you an idea of how productive the reading of Elliot can be

958
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.790
for this book.
The other,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

959
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:37.870
texts that I want to to read is from Manuel do rounds essay,

960
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:42.700
uh,
on the life of sort of Lantus or is at the beginning of a case book.

961
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Now this is just a very brief life of around this one cannot go much further

962
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:53.320
even though there be many biographies because there are no documents were very

963
01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:56.520
few documents to be found.
Now of course there were more,

964
01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:01.540
much more documents than he checks me as case.
Uh,
but nothing new has been fun.

965
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.300
And,
uh,
I think that what is important,
uh,

966
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:11.770
uh,
do things are important in what,
uh,
Duran says here,
one,

967
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:15.340
he suggests more than sestad Cervantes.
I think I've mentioned this before,

968
01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:19.600
belongs to the first generation of writers who are professional writers.

969
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:25.150
Before you had aristocrats and you hire the clergy who could write because they

970
01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:29.710
had the leisure time to do it.
They were idle,
uh,
readers

971
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:36.130
and writers,
uh,
not Serratus,
serratus depends on,

972
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.780
on,
on,
on aristocrats,
uh,
in the,
in the,

973
01:06:39.781 --> 01:06:43.540
in the old style of,
of,
of the nbcs who gives you money.

974
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.710
But it was very unsuccessful that way and it was very poor.
And the,
the,
the,

975
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.890
the,
the,

976
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.490
the publisher swindled him out of money and he was poor and he worked on was in

977
01:06:54.491 --> 01:06:58.330
jail and so forth.
As you have read in that snippet,
it was in jail for his,

978
01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.900
he's accounts who are not too clear and when he was doing as a tax collector and

979
01:07:01.901 --> 01:07:04.960
all of that.
So these are the first professional writers.

980
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.330
And the second point is,
uh,
even more important,
uh,

981
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:12.483
uh,

982
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.410
which is about how said went this was both inside and outside Spanish society

983
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.960
instead of Lantus.
But if if said,
this is [inaudible] speaking,
he sort of,
one,

984
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.240
it's Advantis biography teaches us anything.

985
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:30.790
It is that he was at the same time inside and outside the mainstream of Spanish

986
01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:32.680
life as an insider.

987
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:37.710
He took part in the battle of Lepanto and wrote at last at least two successful

988
01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:41.080
books don't get hauled down the exemplary novels.

989
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.580
This is certainly much more than the level of achievement of a more of most

990
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:49.420
middle class.
It algos of his time as an outsider.

991
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:52.840
He was always poor,
almost in the point of being,

992
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:58.600
to the point of being destitute and not infrequently in jail.

993
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:03.580
He lacked influential friends in a society where nothing could be done without

994
01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:05.830
them.
And without money.

995
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:11.320
He was often unable to protect adequately the female members of his family.

996
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.380
The influential critics and writers of his time did not recognize the of his

997
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:16.160
work.

998
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.120
His accomplishments as a soldier and as a loyal member of the administration

999
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.700
were ignored.
While he's,

1000
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.200
while he's every minor transgression was punished harshly.

1001
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:32.600
This is a,
a good point about set a month,
this,
uh,
this,
uh,

1002
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:37.630
figure who's both inside and outside society and hence can provide these deep

1003
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:40.310
probe into that society.
