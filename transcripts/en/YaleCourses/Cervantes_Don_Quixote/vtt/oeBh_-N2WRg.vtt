WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.720
We're going to begin today by,
uh,

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.810
going to the end of my previous lecture,
uh,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.870
and taking up again the topic of he ness of being crossed eyed to,

4
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.490
um,
to give you my final thoughts on that.

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.260
Uh,
then we are going to us promised,

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.280
move to the character among the galley slaves that I call the prisoner of sex.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.110
And,
uh,

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.250
finally move on to the Sierra Morina to the woods and to the complicated,

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.640
uh,
stories,
uh,
that,
uh,
take place.
Uh,

10
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.623
there

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.550
now we said that he neces cross eyedness if such a word exists is a monocular

12
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:01.240
and convergent monocular meaning of one eye.
One eye goes into,
uh,

13
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.190
the other.
So it,
this,
uh,

14
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.170
does not allow him to perceive reality clearly,

15
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.980
but slanted by the,
uh,

16
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.620
conflicting angles of his visual access.
It is,

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.520
it is a sword and this is the main point of what I'm trying to say is a sort of

18
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.550
innate or congenital internal perspectivism prior to any perspective is in based

19
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.560
on the multiple points of view provided by several characters.

20
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.110
Um,
perspective is in instead of Lantis,

21
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:41.490
which as I've mentioned before,

22
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:46.491
is the topic of Cervantes criticism presuppose the unified visions of several

23
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:53.211
characters who view or something like the like mum Breanna's helmet,

24
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.370
I.
E.
The barbers,
uh,

25
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.750
basing and disagree on what that happens to be.

26
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.110
Each sees reality in a way that represents his or her point of view and his or

27
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:10.470
her way of being,
but he ness has been crossed,

28
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.390
I'd suggest to me that such individual visions are already an obstruction.

29
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.830
And the hasty assumption,
the assumption that each one,
uh,

30
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.510
that each look is singular and represents only one individual,

31
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.100
but being cross eyed,
uh,

32
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.350
means that within each individual they are conflicting views and therefore

33
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.470
conflicting ways of seeing.

34
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.430
And this is very much in line with the way that Cervantes characters behave at

35
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.550
all to themselves often.
Now.
Uh,

36
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.400
so the global result is not a unified Barack conflicting vision,

37
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.420
uh,
within each of the character.

38
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.470
And I said that this,
uh,
kind of double vision is,

39
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.360
is it's called diplopia.

40
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.370
So awful sounding word of Greek origin.
I grew up,

41
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:07.204
yeah.

42
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.160
So,
uh,
the,

43
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.200
the new model I propose based on this observation that he does his cross eyed

44
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:28.580
and giving it the importance,
uh,

45
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.790
is that is a new model of conflicting,
uh,

46
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.800
of conflictive being a conflicting being within him or herself,

47
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.660
uh,
capable of seeing simultaneously,

48
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.470
uh,
in two ways.
Uh,

49
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.830
if there were already an internal dialogue of sorts within each of the,

50
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.870
of the characters,
this condition should Vantis,

51
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.650
uh,
represents as is usual with him.

52
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.040
Uh,
in a very funny way.
Uh,
when he nest,

53
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.000
uh,
uh,

54
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.960
who was the first who jumped free.

55
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.350
Remember after they took away the chain,

56
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.820
he leaped free and does embarrassed.

57
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.430
And I'm quoting upon the plane and setting upon the fat,

58
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.870
the fallen commissary,

59
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.030
he took away his sword and his gun with which leveling it first at one,

60
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.150
then at another without discharging.

61
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And he cleared the field of all the guard on quote being crossed eyed.

62
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:45.050
It's what I'm suggesting here.
Uh,
allows heinous to a guard,

63
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.080
each one of the guards at the same time or one after another with one eye is

64
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.980
looking at one with the other eyes,

65
00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:55.610
looking at the other with a sword in one hand with a gun in the other.

66
00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.380
And this is I think the way that said this is representing this double vision of

67
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.320
uh,
of heaviness.
Uh,
if you,
if you,

68
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.470
if you don't read those lines carefully,

69
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:10.640
you missed that subtle point that he needs to,

70
00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:13.240
can do that because he is cross darling.

71
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.390
So with that,
having said that,

72
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.340
I move on to another prisoner who has,
uh,

73
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.940
been generally overlooked but uh,

74
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:31.530
and who occupies all of one paragraph.
It is the,
the,

75
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.560
the prisoner or the galleys slaves that I call the prisoner of sex.

76
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.900
Uh,

77
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.900
and it shows a Cervantes is remarkable ability to create a character with a few

78
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.530
brush strokes.

79
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.190
And I am going to read and guide you to page one 67 where the passage is

80
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:58.514
contained.

81
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.390
He has been asked us all the others why he is going to the galleys and he

82
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:11.460
replies,
I am going for making a little too free with two,

83
00:06:11.461 --> 00:06:15.800
she cousins German of mine and with two other cousins,
German,

84
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:18.470
not mine.
This is of course 18th century English,

85
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.560
meaning that he was making it.

86
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.740
I said we're with two cousins of his and two of the girls who were cousins of

87
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.430
each other but not office.
I continue in short,

88
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.890
I carried the just so far with them,

89
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.270
with them all that the result of it was the increasing of kindred.

90
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:39.320
So intricately the no cashless can make it out.

91
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.910
The hole was proof upon me.
I had neither friends nor money.

92
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.790
My windpipe was in the utmost danger.

93
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.870
I was sentenced to the galleys for six years.
I submit,

94
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.790
I submit it is the punishment of my fault.
I am young.

95
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.680
I'm life may last and time brings everything about if your worships and your

96
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:05.681
cover letter has anything about you to relieve us actually in the original is to

97
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:10.160
relieve these poor wretches you takes distance from the others,

98
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.440
God will repay you in heaven.

99
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.620
And we will make it the business of our prayers to be,

100
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:20.621
seek him that your worships life and health may be as long and prosperous us,

101
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:25.580
your goodly presence deserves.

102
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.540
<v 0>So he,
he has,
he has,
he has been,
uh,
uh,</v>

104
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.840
sentence to the goddess because he was having simultaneous affair with four

105
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:42.640
women,
two of whom were his cousins on to others who are not,
uh,

106
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.160
we're cousins to each other on how to progeny,

107
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:51.250
a series of children whose family ties were difficult to untangle.

108
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:57.440
They were cousins,
uh,
brothers and sisters and so forth and so on.

109
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:58.310
And as you can imagine,

110
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.380
<v 1>okay,</v>

111
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.060
<v 0>now the historical reasons behind this on Cervantes is very careful in,
in,</v>

112
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.510
in,
in couching all of this,
uh,

113
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.170
stories in very precise historical reasons is that men were needed for the

114
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:15.650
galleys of the time,
uh,

115
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.300
because of Spain's,
uh,
overseas,
uh,

116
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:25.050
adventures.
Uh,
and so sentences,
uh,
where,

117
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.090
uh,
change to send more prisoners to the galleys.

118
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.960
And the age limit was Lord,

119
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.780
I think it was two 16 or something like that.
So,
uh,

120
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.030
these are,
this is the reason behind it.

121
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.780
Now he is brazen and to George by his being good in Latin.
Oh Gosh,

122
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.320
I forgot to read that.
And the other,
the,
at the,
at the end,
uh,
uh,

123
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.100
where he says the one of the guard says that he's a good Latina who do that he's

124
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.360
good in Latin and so forth

125
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.930
and wearing a robe.
It shows that he's a law student.
Uh,

126
00:09:05.931 --> 00:09:10.520
and this is very,
uh,
significant.
There were many law students at the time,

127
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.960
uh,
and they were masters of rhetoric,

128
00:09:13.961 --> 00:09:18.830
conceal logistic thinking and arguing of course.
This being the,

129
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.080
uh,
uh,
skills that a lawyer's presumably,
uh,

130
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.000
develop.
Uh,

131
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.330
the kind of syllogism that we,
we've got.
You're too young maybe to remember,
uh,

132
00:09:32.331 --> 00:09:32.840
when,

133
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.840
when President Clinton was being quizzed about his relationship with Monica

134
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.780
Lewinsky and he,
uh,
answered one of the questions.

135
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.730
It depends what it is,
is,
uh,
being evasive.

136
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:51.680
He wanted to have everything defined he was just using.
So,
uh,

137
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.330
the other precise,
uh,
um,
uh,

138
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.940
legal background here is that he,
uh,

139
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.810
has engaged in what was called complex fornication.

140
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.260
There was simple uncomplex,
fornication,

141
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.680
simple fornication was a consensual sex between two individuals of different

142
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.580
sexes.
Um,
who our own married.

143
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.870
That is simple for niche,
uh,

144
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.520
complex fornication.

145
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.440
You can imagine one of the partners is married,
two of the,
uh,

146
00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:35.870
of the partners are married to other people.

147
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.080
They are of the same sex and so forth and so on.
And of course,
the,
the,

148
00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:45.140
the sentences for complex fornication,
uh,
increased.

149
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.490
You see,
and,
uh,

150
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:54.550
here he has engaged in complex fornication because he has a committed incest,

151
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.990
having had sex with his cousins,
two of them for good measure.

152
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.260
So,
uh,
but

153
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.370
<v 1>yeah,</v>

154
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.280
<v 0>he's a legal training is,
uh,
evident here in the,</v>

155
00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:17.281
he's trying to turn what is a criminal case,

156
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.520
insist to put it in modern terms into a civil case.

157
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.060
It's a question of inheritance law.
Oh,

158
00:11:25.061 --> 00:11:28.600
how are we going to figure out the inheritance when these children,

159
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.500
when the children's family ties are so complicated.
So,
as you can see,

160
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.250
he has subtly in his discourse,
tried to uh,

161
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.820
diminish his culpability,

162
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.410
but of course he is a guilty Oh,

163
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.250
incest and therefore has been sent,
uh,

164
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.810
to the maximum sentence six years in the,
in,
in the galleys.

165
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.640
Um,
so he shuffles a question,
uh,

166
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.810
uh,

167
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.280
do a question of inheritance law and you will be hearing a lot about that today.

168
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:03.970
Uh,

169
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.970
what is the case of incest criminal case incense is to make love,

170
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.400
uh,
uh,

171
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.120
or to engage in sex with someone you cannot marry.

172
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.340
According to Canon law,
I don't know,

173
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:22.630
being religious law and according to cannon law,

174
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.440
uh,
uh,
there are all kinds of prohibitions.

175
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:28.330
But customers you are not supposed to marry,

176
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.470
although dispensations can be obtained from the church and all of that.

177
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:33.850
Of course,
you cannot marry your mother.

178
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:38.310
You're going to marry your sister and so forth.
But it goes down to your,
your,
uh,

179
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.600
for your customer.
You cannot marry or none.

180
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.760
All of that is under the prohibition of an instance.
But certainly here he,

181
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.610
uh,
has been guilty of,
uh,
of incest.

182
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:52.660
And this is why he is being sent to the goddess.
You also notice that he says,

183
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:55.240
well,
this is the proper punishment for my crime.

184
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.860
As if he knew him being already a budding lawyer and say,
I accept this.

185
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.630
And uh,
he says,
uh,
well,
life will go on.
I'm young.

186
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.200
I'd come back from the galleys and so forth,
which was very unlikely,
um,
uh,

187
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.900
that he come back,
uh,
alive and then he disappears.
But not before,

188
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.123
uh,

189
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.810
jumping on donkey haughty and taking the basic from his head and whacking him a

190
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:24.760
few times with it.
That's the last we hear of these.

191
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:29.761
A prisoner of sex who is a kind of libertine in the making and he and the

192
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:33.880
others,
uh,
disappear into the woods,

193
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.650
into the same woods where Marcella disappeared right away and into the same

194
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.540
woods into which Don Quixote and central are going to,
uh,
go,

195
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.550
uh,
uh,
also running away by,
uh,
from,
from,
from the law.

196
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.090
So notice again what I said at the beginning.

197
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:55.080
House advantage has created this rather,
uh,
uh,

198
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.290
complex characters in just one paragraph.

199
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.330
And by just his speech,

200
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.630
what he says and how he says it.

201
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.840
So now we go into the Sierra Morina,
uh,

202
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.870
an inter,
uh,
uh,

203
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.930
what is really the core of part one of the cohort which is made up of all of

204
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:22.210
these,
uh,
stories,
uh,

205
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.290
that we will be hearing about in the next few classes and that you are reading

206
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.450
now.
Uh,

207
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.880
they're running away from the Holy Brotherhood about which I've spoken several

208
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:38.170
times before.
Uh,

209
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.670
because they are fugitives from justice and this is the overarching plot.

210
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.540
They are running away from justice in reality.
They're running away from justice.

211
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.720
That is in the real time of the period.
They are,
uh,

212
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.430
in fact that you will see later when they are captured,
uh,

213
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.790
being pursued by the holy brotherhood.
Uh,

214
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.590
they are uh,
uh,
uh,

215
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.380
they are criminals who in some way are uh,
uh,

216
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.590
expiating the sins in,
in,
in the woods.

217
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.890
The woods are kind of labyrinth or revision of hell.
A remind ful,

218
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.810
uh,
in some,
uh,
aspects of Dante's inferno,

219
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:24.020
some of its features such as the s parody of the landscape,

220
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.250
the cracks and so forth.

221
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.240
They are a far as possible from civilization.

222
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.650
It is a world of disorder and madness.
It is also the desk,
blah,

223
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.800
the unpopulated which,
uh,
in,
uh,

224
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.250
Spanish law meant,
uh,
areas,
uh,

225
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.720
not covered or protected by the law,
the desk Polo.

226
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.400
These are areas where the law and where the power of the state of the crown did

227
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.150
not reach their one.
This uses that,
uh,

228
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.630
those areas,
uh,
to send his characters into,
into,
into,

229
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:17.390
into danger,
into confusion and into wireless.

230
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:19.843
<v 1>Now</v>

231
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.580
<v 0>the Sierra Morina will be the setting over a series of tightly related episodes</v>

232
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:34.330
all dealing with the question of love and more mundanely with the issue of

233
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:36.710
marriage.

234
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.860
<v 0>Now the interpret stories that come after the Marcella and we saw stow episode,</v>

236
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.800
which prefigured them and Rosina this disastrous frutation,

237
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.740
uh,
makeup as I said,
the core of the park,
one of the Quixote,

238
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.600
these stories peak and a resolve for the most part together with the main plot,

239
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.470
the plot involving Loki Hotel Sanko,
uh,

240
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.800
which I as I said,

241
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.660
resolves itself when he is captured and sent back home.

242
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.980
This is a set of narrative strands tightly woven around two of the principal

243
00:17:22.411 --> 00:17:24.240
drives in the book.

244
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.630
One Donkey halters love quest for Dulcinea and the series of crimes and

245
00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:34.701
misdemeanors perpetrated by the Algo and his squire that lead to his pursued an

246
00:17:36.361 --> 00:17:37.194
apprehension.

247
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.650
The interpolated stories have in common with a central plot and with the

248
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.380
Marcella and we taught them interlude and with each other,

249
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:52.010
the perpetration of offenses do passion with the results with which result in

250
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:57.171
injuries to honor body on property and what the result in need for restitution

251
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.360
recompense requite all pardon or revenge

252
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.360
in all of the marriage neumes as the inevitable and most appropriate form of

253
00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:11.510
reparation,

254
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.990
as well as the most effective kind of narrative closure.

255
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.840
Marriage is also in this context a form of punishment.

256
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:26.883
<v 1>Now</v>

257
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:32.650
<v 0>these stories involve potentially only quote marriages and most of them contain</v>

258
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:39.531
violence of some sort on equal in the sense that the individuals involved come

259
00:18:40.761 --> 00:18:44.600
from different social classes and,

260
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.890
and that difference is what motivates some of the many of the conflicts,

261
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.923
but not all.

262
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.080
But although peanut law again looms over the episodes,

263
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.980
the peanut low applied to criminals like Don Quixote on Sancocho,

264
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.340
uh,
uh,

265
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.680
the most developed legal aspect in them in this store is derived from Testa

266
00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:12.690
mentoree law,
uh,

267
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.130
sampling already an issue in the Marcella Crisostomo conflict.

268
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:20.170
You remember how much importance was given to the fact that they have both

269
00:19:20.171 --> 00:19:25.171
inherited wealth and how they had inherited she being a woman,

270
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.110
he being a man and so forth,

271
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.900
inheritance and marriage codes,

272
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.660
both regulating succession,

273
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.690
drive and constrained the characters,

274
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.440
restitution and compensation cooperate to make whole what they damage in the

275
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:46.290
process of channeling their desires.
Do you remember you,

276
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.790
if you know something about law,

277
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:52.770
you know that to make you whole is to bring restitution,
uh,

278
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:57.120
to you for some damage,
uh,
or lost that you have incurred.

279
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.550
So the same,
uh,
symbolic topology,

280
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:08.790
a reappears that we have seen already between the,

281
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.450
the,
the road on the,

282
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:15.470
in now here it is between the woods and the in between the [inaudible] and the

283
00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:20.320
wilderness,
which will be also a good way to translate this Pablo,

284
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.340
the wilderness

285
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.060
and the going back and forth from one to the other is punctuated often by

286
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:32.380
interruptions in the narratives interruptions that we will consider carefully

287
00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.790
later today.

288
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.890
Marriage has to do with the law of course,

289
00:20:38.891 --> 00:20:43.630
as well as with the closure of stories.
Uh,

290
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.990
thought it is an important structural issue to structural in terms of narrative

291
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.393
structure.

292
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:57.030
Marriage is the ending of many tales and place on the married and lived happily

293
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:01.420
ever after,
so to speak.
The end of many tales.

294
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.340
That's the how things are resolved.
Our order is restored,
uh,

295
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.250
and succession is insured.

296
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.630
The questions of love and marriage,
which,

297
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.780
which were important issues both from a,
uh,

298
00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.450
social and literary point of view surface.

299
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:24.220
Here I in the episode of [inaudible] Marcella,
I underline through,

300
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.700
uh,
stories of young people,
the young people.

301
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:31.810
I have written their names here and I should get out of the way.
Uh,

302
00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:36.350
so that we have them clear Scada,
Daniel,
Lucinda,
Fernando and Donald [inaudible].

303
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.520
I forget often to say don't Fernando,
but it say,

304
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.740
it says don't Fernando in the text because he is entitled to the Dome.

305
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.020
Um,

306
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.840
now these are decisive episodes in which advantage is dealing with love and

307
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:56.680
marriage and a significant point in western history,

308
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.450
both social,
it both in social and literary terms

309
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.690
is love and integral or even necessary part of marriage or his marriage.

310
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:10.630
Principally the social and economic contract.

311
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.130
Do young people have the right to choose whom they marry?

312
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.780
All of these questions have obvious answers today,
but not then.

313
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:23.890
And not for a long time.
Even narrow one into the 20th century.

314
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:27.820
In some societies,
marriages were arranged.

315
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.580
A,
I remember Gaietry Spievak,
uh,

316
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.900
well known critic a theoretician,
uh,

317
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.340
telling me she's from India,

318
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:44.910
that her mother had only heard her father's voice once in another room before

319
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:50.500
the day,
which she married him.
Uh,

320
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.770
the arrangements were being made and she heard the voice of this man who would

321
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:58.120
be her husband for the rest of her life.
Uh,

322
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.680
these are things that seem very,
very far from our,
uh,
lives,

323
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.110
uh,
today,
but not at the time.

324
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.520
The issue of marriage was being debated in the 16th century.

325
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.570
And he will continue to be debated through the centuries.

326
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.690
And it is an important topic in Cervantes because it has to do with social,

327
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:22.330
legal and also with,
with,
with the show of love

328
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.280
now significantly it is now that sanctuary learns to his astonishment,

329
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.960
do see Nass real identity.
Ah,

330
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.860
she is the daughter of a,
of of Lorenzo called Trello.

331
00:23:38.861 --> 00:23:42.190
Of course he knows who this woman is.

332
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.460
Is that do Sudan?
Uh,

333
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.710
the story of donkey halters logo for her is the background for the stories of

334
00:23:56.961 --> 00:24:01.961
Cardenio Lucinda Fernando under [inaudible] because Don Quixote's love of,

335
00:24:02.311 --> 00:24:04.070
well,
don't sell Lorenzo could have,

336
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.440
could have led to an unequal marriage that of an Aristocrat,

337
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.770
even if a minor or is to grab with a country last,
uh,
which is,

338
00:24:14.771 --> 00:24:17.390
uh,
on an equal marriage.
As I've,
as I've already said,

339
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:22.070
is one of the constants in all the stories in the Sierra Morina and reflect,

340
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:27.790
reflect the society in flux where there is these incipient class mobility.

341
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.560
The 16th century in Spain was called by a Medico Castro,

342
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.130
great historian and critic,
a conflictive age.

343
00:24:42.131 --> 00:24:46.060
And part of the conflict was this social effervescence,

344
00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:51.090
this social instability about which I'll speak more in the course and the course

345
00:24:51.371 --> 00:24:52.204
of the semester,

346
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.540
I'll don't say appeals to Don Quixote or Alonzo Kiano because of her manly

347
00:24:59.681 --> 00:25:00.520
qualities,

348
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.920
which he draws forms into sublime courtly love.

349
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.060
It was sublime.
Courtly love,
beauty.
Geez,

350
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.460
Mandy,
in the sense that we will learn,
she's brawny,

351
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.370
uh,
strong used to hard labor,
uh,
in,

352
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.030
in the fields.
I think that this is the fetishistic appeals.

353
00:25:24.031 --> 00:25:27.620
She has four for them for,
uh,

354
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.430
for Loki Halter that,
uh,
uh,

355
00:25:30.431 --> 00:25:33.400
as opposed to the women here in his class once suppose who are,

356
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:38.530
who are civilized,
done and,
uh,
and so forth.
I'll don't saw,
uh,

357
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.570
would be a more sexual I in a more physical,
uh,

358
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.640
an open way.
So,
uh,
this is what it is.
I think behind,

359
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:52.240
uh,
his infatuation with her.

360
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.200
<v 0>What does Don Quixote's love of?
I'll don't sir,</v>

362
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.490
tell us about love.
I don't start.

363
00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:08.240
Don't see now this is one of those lessons for life.

364
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:14.220
I told you in the first lecture you might learn in reading the Quixote.

365
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.280
Quixote is also about live your lives.

366
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.920
What we learned from donkey Hotez passion for Odomzo,

367
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:26.590
whom he turns into those scenario is that when in love we invent the object of

368
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:33.491
our desire and that that object depends on the projection over our own inner

369
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:38.710
demons.
So this is something to learn for life.

370
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.910
I told you,
you,
uh,

371
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.410
<v 1>quite a few things.
I'll be pointing out others,</v>

372
00:26:46.411 --> 00:26:51.411
but this is perhaps the most important and urgent for you to learn,

373
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.000
at least today.
Okay.

374
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.200
That'll settle the cast of,

375
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.670
of main characters in the stories in the Sierra Morina so that we can untangle

376
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:06.600
this as much as we can because it can get complicated.

377
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.130
And I'm going to also,

378
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.400
or unraveled is social economic background behind all of this.

379
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.560
Let us begin with Gardanio.

380
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:21.720
[inaudible] the name suggests a Garda.

381
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:24.420
They know it means purple.
Yeah.

382
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.950
<v 0>Bright Purple,
bright purple with passion</v>

383
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:35.260
in terms of literary history.
Cardinia is a minor Orlando Furioso.

384
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:41.310
The audio's those protagonists in the poem of that name who goes Berserk when he

385
00:27:42.071 --> 00:27:46.420
suspects that are and Angelica has betrayed him with middle row,

386
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.460
uh,
you more.

387
00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.570
This is that famous poem Orlando who you also that I have mentioned several

388
00:27:55.571 --> 00:27:58.050
times and if,
or a literature major,

389
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.610
a literature person you should read at some point

390
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.680
got Lanio is mad.
As a result of the lovers threesome,

391
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.680
he roamed nearly naked and image of his savagery of his regression to the world

392
00:28:14.351 --> 00:28:18.190
of,
of nature.
He's a wild man in the renaissance tradition.

393
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.380
The renaissance,
the figure of the wild man appears often.

394
00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:29.250
Madness and love are embodied in Cardinia as they are in the math night in don

395
00:28:30.401 --> 00:28:34.960
Quixote because Cardinia was also a double of Doki haughty.

396
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.110
And in fact,
uh,

397
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.040
Doki Hata has a feeling of the uncanny when he meets Gardenia for the first

398
00:28:44.621 --> 00:28:49.600
time.
He says,
I'm boring.
Uh,
from page one 83,

399
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.760
don't be haughty.
Quote,
advanced to embrace him and held him in a good space,

400
00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:59.761
very close between his arms as if he had been acquainted with him a long time.

401
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.693
How quote

402
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.300
perhaps he had been acquainted with God venue,

403
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.660
being acquainted with himself and this is what the line suggests.

404
00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.330
So look,
Quixote discovers in Cardinia.
Okay.

405
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.920
Sort of a of double cause then you is a poet.

406
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.210
We discovered this because of the,
uh,
of the uh,

407
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.230
um,
little bag they find oh,
rotten in the,

408
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.680
in,
in the woods.
Don't get held down.

409
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.740
Santo a that contains a book of poems and texts by Gardenia.

410
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.140
He is,
uh,
he is,
uh,
we have again,

411
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.040
literary texts read in the novel as we did with green sauce,
almost song.

412
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.740
Remember that episode like Resource Tomo,

413
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:53.830
Daniel is the Petrarchan or [inaudible] poet,

414
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.250
sick with love,
but through Arca,

415
00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:01.260
the great Italian poet about whom you have heard is the

416
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.670
one could see almost the creator of modern poetry,

417
00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.860
14th century and Garcia Lasso,
whom I have mentioned before,

418
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:13.570
I think,
but ignored.
I mentioned them again.

419
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.080
A disciple of pay truck was the great Spanish Boyd,

420
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.980
the Great Spanish Board of the 16th century who brought about a whole revolution

421
00:30:30.981 --> 00:30:35.750
impolitic language in the Spanish language 16th century cause last relief from

422
00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:40.751
about 1501 to 1536 live very short life solo.

423
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:45.170
Quixote is very happy to have found this text and I'm very uh,

424
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.080
curious about who the author might be,

425
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.730
where our son Joe is very happy to have found a hundred gold coins.

426
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:55.550
And as you may have noticed,

427
00:30:55.551 --> 00:30:59.090
sanctuary is not very interested in discovering who the owner of the bag is

428
00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:03.430
because he doesn't want to have to return the uh,
uh,
the money

429
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.650
<v 1>now</v>

430
00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.420
<v 0>got a venue and Lucinda</v>

431
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.873
<v 1>okay.</v>

432
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.310
<v 0>Belonged to the low nobility.
They are either logos,</v>

433
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.400
I don't Quixote with sufficient wealth to make their marriage a desirable.

434
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:25.383
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

435
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.790
<v 0>both would gain,</v>

436
00:31:26.791 --> 00:31:31.610
she would gain social status because convenience status is higher and he would

437
00:31:31.611 --> 00:31:33.510
gain wealth because she is rich.

438
00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:40.030
Like Marcella Harris state would become kind of Daniel's dowery guarantee in

439
00:31:40.971 --> 00:31:42.680
succession and reassuring,

440
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.440
reassuring prospect to her parents because she is a woman and there will be,

441
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.970
again,
that's indication of what I said.

442
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.640
There will be some concern about the legacy being lost.

443
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:02.090
We added capital.
Would him boot even improve the lineage?
Of course,

444
00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.260
Doro payer
on the other hand

445
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.040
is a,
is a,
is a commoner.
She is the,
uh,

446
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:17.220
the rich farmers daughter and she far below don't Fernando's status on marrying

447
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:25.771
her would anger don't Fernando's father because she is his vassal.

448
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.790
Her name.
As you may have already noticed,

449
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.250
rhymes with Dorothy Neha,

450
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.760
you will see other instances where Cervantes uses a rhyme,
uh,

451
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:44.030
echoes of this nature to establish connections.

452
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.120
So running we don't see now there is something of a mirroring or echoing effect

453
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.510
here.
A version of what donkey halters and dosing.

454
00:32:52.511 --> 00:32:56.420
There's romance could have been,
I told you,
same,
you know,

455
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:01.570
relationship except that the hold these hold the Duke that is Fernando's father

456
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.890
is so wealthy that while the increase of the state would be welcome,
it would be,

457
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:14.750
uh,
it will not be much of an incentive.
Now.
So much,

458
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.050
uh,
for Cardinia for now and Lucinda,

459
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.890
now I moved to Fernando or don't Fernando who is the most,

460
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.390
uh,
really complicated of these characters.

461
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:31.660
He's not exactly a hero.
No.

462
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.870
He is the character most vexed by judicial and economic pressures.

463
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:37.880
Uh,

464
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:43.090
who are the source of most of the troubles here having seduced or out there and

465
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:46.580
married Lucinda under false pretenses.

466
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.250
He is guilty of a stupor of rape

467
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:56.330
and the priest at some point clans to denounce him,

468
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.990
whereupon he will become a fugitive from justice like Don Quixote.

469
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.640
Fernando's actions have sent Gardenia under if they are into the wilderness and

470
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:11.051
left leucine that in a dangerous situation from which is she also wants to

471
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:12.890
escape.
Uh,

472
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.940
but she's abducted by Fernando in that story that is told sort of laterally.

473
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:20.750
And if you could,
this would have gone into this story.

474
00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:25.210
We would have had an endless sequence of stories.
Uh,
uh,

475
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.800
so it's just left hanging.
What happens to her when she's,
uh,
uh,

476
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.170
abducted from accumbent and so forth and so on?
Uh,

477
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.700
don't Fernando is it on one type thinking of don't wound the seducer

478
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.930
first appeared in western literature in a play by till.

479
00:34:42.931 --> 00:34:46.280
So the Molina Spanish play right of this 17th century,

480
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.680
uh,

481
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.590
who Fernando has caused injury to [inaudible] family.

482
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.340
It's not just to them individually,

483
00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:00.370
to each one of the young people by compromising their honor and a state meaning

484
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:02.840
their social status and economic position.

485
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.860
There is an implicit costs and in policing it please,

486
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:12.500
it's subtle but strong cause,
uh,

487
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.120
for,
for Nando's,
criminal actions don't,

488
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:20.730
Fernando is an anxious,
say dumb.

489
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.210
I have the word here.

490
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:31.340
It comes from the word say wounded in Spanish,
which means second.
Okay.

491
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:36.620
Second Dome means a second born son.

492
00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.870
Not to explain,
don't Fernando's socioeconomic status.

493
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.860
Ima expound a little bit on a Spanish institution,

494
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.870
the [inaudible],
which is that work out here,

495
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.740
even the Middle Ages,

496
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.750
Castilian law had elaborated the institution of the Majora go and entailed state

497
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:15.370
the mass of wealth and property whose integrity and continuity was guaranteed by

498
00:36:15.951 --> 00:36:20.330
exceptional testament three laws and entail state,

499
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.750
uh,

500
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:27.750
in law is to limit the inheritance of property to a specific line or of EHRs in

501
00:36:30.581 --> 00:36:33.220
such a way that it cannot be legally transferred.

502
00:36:33.221 --> 00:36:36.400
I'm just giving you the definition from Webster's because not everybody knows

503
00:36:36.401 --> 00:36:41.170
what it entail.
State is,
as the name implies,
Majora,
Asco,

504
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.880
he hold my daughter,
my daughter,
he ho,
my son,

505
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.780
my your eldest son.
Okay.

506
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.570
My ass go.
The,

507
00:36:53.571 --> 00:36:57.560
my euro Roscoe consisted in the privileging of firstborn males in matters of

508
00:36:57.561 --> 00:36:59.390
inheritance.
He,

509
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:04.660
the first born son inherited the title and the bulk of the endowment they might,

510
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.220
your ass go was an entire,

511
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:12.310
an entire mint entailment device to ensure the accumulation and retention of

512
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:16.640
wealth within one family by preventing it this personal through marriages.

513
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:21.160
Because if you had three songs and each inherited the same and each barrier,

514
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.890
different woman,
of course,
then that,
uh,

515
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.690
the state begins to be dispersed and diminished

516
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.770
by the middle of the 12th century.
The king allowed the establishment of my,

517
00:37:33.771 --> 00:37:36.340
your ass goes that comprise the entire villages.

518
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.860
Am I your Asco could also be a royal grant from the king as reward for some

519
00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:44.620
special deed in the theater.

520
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.390
[inaudible] this is a word or something.
You better learn as I told you,

521
00:37:49.391 --> 00:37:53.920
they were going to learn some details or Spanish history and culture,

522
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:58.810
essentially seven books.

523
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.833
<v 1>Uh,</v>

524
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.910
<v 0>she,
the party,
this is 13th.
Thank juries,</v>

525
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.950
Legal Code that is a foundation of all Spanish law.

526
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.383
<v 1>Uh,</v>

527
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.090
<v 0>the legal foundation.</v>

528
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.920
[inaudible] Roscoe was ultimately grounded because how do you ground this?

529
00:38:19.921 --> 00:38:21.820
And you know what,
why the first born

530
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.400
by making specific mention of God's command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac,

531
00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.880
his first and most beloved son.

532
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.140
So the ultimate authority was the Bible.

533
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.310
The Partido [inaudible] is also explicitly allowed the stater.

534
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.260
That is the one who,
uh,

535
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.690
whose legacy is being passed down to four bit.

536
00:38:50.691 --> 00:38:55.691
His air from alienated the inheritance by sale or other means or obliging him to

537
00:38:55.941 --> 00:39:00.630
pass it on to his own firstborn son.
And uh,
uh,

538
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.770
this legislation continued in the 16th century.

539
00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:08.840
Commoners were allowed to,
uh,
to begin.
Uh,
my euro goes,
uh,

540
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.260
and uh,
and and,
and so forth.
Um,

541
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.440
so the proliferation of this man,

542
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:20.450
your ass goes generated a class of second donors or second born sons who are

543
00:39:21.981 --> 00:39:24.500
left out of the patrimony.
See what I mean?

544
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.100
If only the firstborn could inherit.
And of course,

545
00:39:28.101 --> 00:39:30.320
families had many sons and daughters and so forth.

546
00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.420
There were a lot of second donors.

547
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.633
<v 1>Hm.</v>

548
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.980
<v 0>They had the social status.</v>

549
00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.340
They're usually illustrious names conferred upon that,

550
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:45.350
but no financial substance or position in society and an uncertain future.

551
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.030
Eliot writes in Imperial's pain page one 14,

552
00:39:50.031 --> 00:39:52.610
where I think you must have gotten already,
I hope

553
00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.400
just under these two groups of magnets writes Elliott grandees and Tiepolos who

554
00:40:00.591 --> 00:40:05.360
formed the elite of the Spanish aristocracy came a group which differed from

555
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:09.860
them in having no corporate entity entity of its own butch,

556
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.600
but which nonetheless enjoyed an acknowledged position in the social hierarchy.

557
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.000
This group consisted of the second donors,
the younger sons of the great houses,

558
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.100
this process,

559
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.920
no title of their own and we're generally victims of the mighty Roscoe system

560
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.850
which we serve the bulk of the family wealth do the elder brothers,

561
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.060
since they resources tended to be limited,

562
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:37.330
they were likely to develop themselves in particular to careers in the army or

563
00:40:37.341 --> 00:40:41.770
the church or to serve the crown as diplomats and administrators on quote.

564
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.360
The term second dome by the way,

565
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:49.990
by virtue of its suffix is [inaudible] is the rogatory ground Doolan.

566
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.450
If you know Spanish is a Lumex alone,

567
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:58.550
someone who spoiled [inaudible],

568
00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.570
a flirt and [inaudible] and nerd,

569
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.870
lazy bones and so forth.

570
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.910
Some of these are not very nice words for you to learn in this class

571
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.790
but it clearly points to the embarrassing position you see.

572
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:20.180
I'm trying to give you the background so you don't understand.

573
00:41:20.181 --> 00:41:21.470
For Nando's situation

574
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.190
it clearly points would be embarrassing position of someone who can because of

575
00:41:27.191 --> 00:41:29.190
his heritage act with self sufficient,

576
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.980
the self sufficiency of his class but has little substance to back it up.

577
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.920
The way out of the situation was contained in the refrain of the times.

578
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.970
IGLESIA martyr or Casa.

579
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

580
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.950
<v 0>We will encounter it later,
uh,
in the cup too.</v>

581
00:42:07.951 --> 00:42:12.480
Stale when it is applied to the sons of a man.
Uh,

582
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.910
it meant that the second dong good go into the church,
um,
uh,

583
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.290
obtaining a position of some importance,
uh,
uh,

584
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.590
because of his family's connection,
Mara,
you could go out to see,
uh,

585
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.240
to seek,
uh,
adventures and to seek wealth,
go to the colonies and so forth.

586
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:31.391
Or Casa.

587
00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:35.800
They attach himself to the court or to the court of a Grundy of someone who's is

588
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:36.643
employed.

589
00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:39.123
<v 1>Uh,</v>

590
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.200
<v 0>so cut off from their parents' legacy is the second donors became a social and</v>

591
00:42:45.201 --> 00:42:50.150
econ became social and economic climbers anxiously trying to make up for the

592
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:54.950
deficiency in status.
In this pain of the 16th and 17th centuries they make,

593
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.790
they became a class unto themselves,
a laborious one.

594
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Once you say desperately seeking social and economic advancement,

595
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:10.180
don't Fernando situations and actions betray all the features of this class

596
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:15.640
though Fernando is dumb.
The second son of Duke,
Ricardo.

597
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.060
In fact,
the text reads in Spanish only Jose wounded and Duke,

598
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:24.320
the Duke or second son.
Um,
it only,

599
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.370
it meant all of the songs who were not the first born.
You don't.

600
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:30.500
And it wasn't only the second son,
but also the third,
the fourth,
the fifth.

601
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:34.900
They were all,
uh,
uh,
uh,
second donors.
Uh,

602
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.540
so the second dog is essentially he who is not first the only position with

603
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:43.340
entitlement.
One Cardinia appears in Fernando's home.
Remember,

604
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:46.180
he is someone by the Duke,
uh,

605
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.390
explicitly do with a companion with his older brother who is in line to be the

606
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:52.610
father successor.
And it's already a marquees.

607
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.610
Don't Fernando Ingratiate himself with a visitor,

608
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:57.800
a wins and wins him over to his side.

609
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.250
Gardenia was hacking rival or someone who reminds,

610
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:06.251
don't Fernando of the role that he would be called upon to play if he chose Gasa

611
00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:10.910
rail to join,
uh,
the house over Grandy.

612
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.830
He could be a competitor in that by becoming the ally of his older brother,

613
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.650
he could come closer to wealth and power.

614
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.840
Don Don Fernando himself prevented as he is by law from acquiring them from his

615
00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:28.880
father,
don't Fernando.
He's the odd man out.
Literally number three in this case,

616
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.100
uh,
which is worse than non second.

617
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:37.250
So he lowers Cardinia away and soon finds himself as his rival for Lucinda's

618
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.210
favors.
He said,

619
00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:43.530
Doug [inaudible] could have an economic motive to when he said users out there,

620
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.860
even if he leaves her at first.
In fact,

621
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:51.180
when he does agree to marry her later,
uh,
dot.

622
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.370
Fernando is potentially founding a state that could have conceivably it could

623
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.820
become [inaudible] its own if it is rich enough and wealthy enough.
So,

624
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:00.743
uh,

625
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:05.280
restitution takes on a whole new meaning when viewed from this perspective.

626
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.520
So readers of Cervantes is time,
uh,

627
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:15.120
would have easily and immediately recognized all the testamentary conflicts

628
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:20.121
involved in different Anderson's actions and how the law impinges on his frantic

629
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:25.620
love life.
It is,
it's on Saturday.
That drives him to this frantic,

630
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.690
uh,
love life.
The economic,

631
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:32.850
social,
and ultimately judicial context.

632
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:37.050
That was the background of the Marcella [inaudible] episode is greatly expanded

633
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:41.310
then here to encompass deep social and economic issues.

634
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.580
In Castille during the 16th century.
The uh,

635
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.870
judicial situation is,
is accurate

636
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.570
and precise.
The source of the conflict in which Don Fernando,

637
00:45:54.571 --> 00:45:58.080
Cardinia leucine down the road there and tangle is very precise.

638
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.210
The impending marriage of Leucine,

639
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:03.750
Don Cardinia is one that is again,

640
00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:08.400
dictated by circumstances as well as by mutual attraction.
Gardenia.

641
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:12.960
Since that Lucinda is a maiden as,
uh,
as well as,
uh,
born,

642
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.860
uh,
uh,
not only well born,
but as rich as I am,

643
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.870
the description he gives of their youth and early love is like the implicit

644
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:26.871
blueprint of the marriage of Marcell and resource Tomo only that it was never,

645
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:31.320
uh,
uh,
uh,
it was nearer to taking place.
Actually,

646
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:35.360
their marriage was very near to dig in place when Fernando injuries.

647
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:40.940
But the ambition of social advancement first postponed the marriage because,

648
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:46.620
because Cardinia,
his father feels that he should go,
uh,
an answer.

649
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.610
Uh,
the Dukes,
someone's,
um,

650
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:54.780
and then leucine does.
Parents are,
uh,

651
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.960
I'm very interested in her marrying a know Fernando because it will be a leap in

652
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:05.580
social class.
So,
uh,
in fact,

653
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.710
uh,
Gardenia accusers,
Lucinda,
of,
of being,
uh,

654
00:47:09.711 --> 00:47:14.320
of acting out of economic and social interest.
And this is the,

655
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.680
and this is why she,
uh,

656
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:21.830
she left him and this is the source of his feeling of betrayal that has sent him

657
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:24.420
into the woods.

658
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.300
Now we continue with the cast.
Doterra,

659
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.940
Doterra is the victim of a Nando's treachery,
but she's not a passive character.

660
00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:38.530
I told you the run this is a women characters tend not to be passive.

661
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:44.140
And her actions are also dictated by the economic and legal determinations that

662
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:45.100
drive the others.

663
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:49.830
She's the daughter of commoners who are however old Christians,
and this is the,

664
00:47:49.831 --> 00:47:54.831
the character's boast of this at a time when being suspected of having some

665
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:01.410
Jewish or Moorish blot background could be a disabling condition in the pain of

666
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:04.750
the time.
So they are a proud old Christians,

667
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:09.250
wealthy and so capable of social,
uh,
advancement.

668
00:48:09.251 --> 00:48:13.900
Her father is cleaner,
low,
the rich say great name,

669
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:18.340
uh,
Glenara doe the rich and,
uh,

670
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:22.360
and he and [inaudible] mother have great ambitions for their daughter.
In fact,

671
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:25.420
uh,
when,
uh,

672
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.860
Dorothea makes up a story that we'll talk about soon when she's,

673
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:33.310
this has princess Mikami Kona,
uh,
uh,

674
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.630
she reveals that she is fearful of,
of,
of,
of,
of,

675
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:41.890
of Fernando taking away,
uh,
her,
her wealth and ci,

676
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.330
if you remember her characterization in detail,
she's the one who ran the farm.

677
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:51.160
She says it.
She's the one who,
who did all,
all the administrative work in,
in,
in,

678
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:53.420
in,
in,
in the form.
So while do not,

679
00:48:53.421 --> 00:48:57.520
there is a woman and a vassal cheese when aware of her rights and legitimate

680
00:48:57.521 --> 00:49:01.840
aspirations,
not to mention what an asset her own physical beauty can be.

681
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.410
We'll be talking about her physical beauty in the next class.

682
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.770
When Fernando sneaks into her chamber,

683
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.070
determined to possess her by any means,

684
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:16.690
she makes the decision to surrender,
motivated by love,

685
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:20.980
pragmatism and greed.
In telling her story to the priest,

686
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:25.981
the Barbara and Cardenio doterra repeats what she told herself at that crucial

687
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.820
point.
She says,
well,

688
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.433
I shall not this.

689
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.590
She's telling the story of what you thought at the moment of Fernando was

690
00:49:35.591 --> 00:49:40.120
pressuring the issue.
When he snuck into the room,
she told her said,
well,

691
00:49:40.121 --> 00:49:42.640
I shall not be the first who by the way of marriage,

692
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.400
has arisen from a low to a high condition,

693
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:50.440
nor will don't Fernando be the first whom beauty or rather blind affection has

694
00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:54.310
induced to take a wife beneath his quality.
Since then,

695
00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:58.960
I neither a make a new world nor a new costume.
Sure,

696
00:49:58.961 --> 00:50:02.920
I may be allowed to accept this honor,
which fortune throws in my way.

697
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:07.750
Even though the inclination he shows for me should last no longer than the

698
00:50:07.751 --> 00:50:11.800
accomplishment of his well for in short,
in the sight of God,

699
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:16.120
I shall be his wife besides to ride,
reject him with disdain.

700
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.530
I see him prepared to set aside all sense of duty and to have recourse to

701
00:50:20.531 --> 00:50:21.364
violence.

702
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:26.080
And so I shall remain this honor and without excuse when I'm censored by those

703
00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:31.140
who do not know how innocently I came into this straight for what reasons can be

704
00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:36.080
sufficient to persuade my parents and others that this cavalier got into my

705
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:40.790
apartment without my consent.
So she,
uh,
she,
uh,
she,
uh,

706
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:45.860
draws her balance and Ron and decides that the best thing is simply to consent.

707
00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.110
Uh,
of course she has,

708
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:52.560
she has made him swear that they're going to marry a,
and he has,
uh,

709
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:53.810
he has,

710
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:57.470
she has made him swear in front of her maid who was the one who let him in that

711
00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:59.870
he would marry.
And in this pain of the time,

712
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:04.550
I won't talk about this much more a secret marriages,
uh,
were allowed.

713
00:51:04.551 --> 00:51:06.890
Meaning if you told,
uh,

714
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:12.010
your beloved in the darkness of night in a fit of passion that you wanted to

715
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:14.840
marry her.
And she said,
yes,
you were,

716
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:20.210
you were married because God is everywhere and God is listening.
So therefore,

717
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.080
presumably you are married.
Of course,

718
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:28.340
the temptation not to,
uh,
uh,

719
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:32.880
abide by,
uh,
by this,
uh,
uh,
marriage vows.
Oh,

720
00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:33.860
what's great.

721
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:38.860
And the debates about it and the council of Trent as we will have reason to

722
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:44.570
discuss it in,
in classes,
uh,
uh,
concerning other marriage situations in part two.

723
00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.350
We're great.
So don't,

724
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.760
is faith when the following both religious doctrine Castilian law,

725
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:54.940
which condoned premarital sexual relations relationships after [inaudible] such

726
00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:57.770
as the one she has forced know Fernando to make,

727
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.510
he has to want to marry her not only before God will be for herself and her

728
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:06.760
servant when she plead her case at the end.
Doterra invokes this oath,

729
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.570
appears to don't Fernando's conscience and assures him that by law he's not

730
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:15.500
compromising his or his family status because nobility is transmitted by the

731
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.390
father,
not the mother,

732
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:20.990
not the mother's blood in Castiel as we had occasion to see in the case of

733
00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:22.400
Greece and Marcella,

734
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:27.790
she convinces Don Fernando with the speech that that has this much verve as

735
00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:32.600
Marcella's.
Uh,
and it's also couch in forensic rhetoric and terminology.

736
00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.830
So this is what is behind,
uh,
this,
uh,
the,
the,
this,

737
00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:43.540
the legal socio economic background of these,
uh,

738
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.270
of these stories about which we'll talk more,

739
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:51.540
but I'm now going to speak briefly and in conclusion about one important aspect

740
00:52:55.841 --> 00:52:58.510
that I mentioned before under is interruptions.

741
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:01.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

742
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.030
<v 0>You will have noticed that all of these stories,</v>

743
00:53:04.031 --> 00:53:07.340
so the many of the stories are interrupted at some point.

744
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:13.210
The whole novel is interrupted in Chapter Eight when the narrator claims to have

745
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:14.780
run out of text.

746
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:20.420
So that is perhaps the most famous interruption in western literature.

747
00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.640
But there have been many other interruptions.
The,
the,

748
00:53:24.641 --> 00:53:28.380
the story Marcella and we source them or been told by Rivaldo and I'm bras,

749
00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:30.630
you and others,
it's interrupted several times,

750
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:36.300
but the most and also that we have the,
the,

751
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.580
the proleptic interruption,

752
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:43.610
very funny interruption of central telling his story about the,

753
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.330
uh,
uh,

754
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:50.130
and her boyfriend and the goats starting to cross the river and all of that.

755
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:53.630
Remember that interruption.
But here we have,
uh,

756
00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.290
other interruptions.

757
00:53:55.650 --> 00:54:00.650
The most important and the most spectacular is that of Cardenio.

758
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:02.850
Cause Daniel says,

759
00:54:02.851 --> 00:54:06.180
and I won't read you the text because you have it there and you must remember
it,

760
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.960
that he will tell the story,
but he will not be interrupted.

761
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.670
He does not want to be interrupted with questions or anything.
Uh,
so that,

762
00:54:14.671 --> 00:54:18.900
that is the precondition for,
for his telling the story.

763
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:20.940
But of course,

764
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
at some point he mentioned [inaudible] and that,

765
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:31.080
uh,
is simply
too much for them,

766
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:35.160
Quixote to resist.
Uh,
and he breaks in and,
and,

767
00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:40.170
and interrupts a gardenia and Cardinia goes berserk.

768
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:41.580
He Goes Berserk.

769
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.880
And he brings up this story about Queen Manasi Ma having been had an affair with

770
00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:52.080
this lowly surgeon,
surgeons at the time did not have a very high status.

771
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:56.250
And of course our tax don't be on sanctuary and runs wild.

772
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:00.240
Um,
what,

773
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.080
what is behind all of these interruptions?
And there others,

774
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.400
what is behind all of these interruptions is that they allow

775
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:14.990
for a certain truth to come out because it's a rant disease showing that stories

776
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:19.570
have a sort of a,
of self generating a thrust,

777
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:24.480
uh,
uh,
that they follow a certain,
a script.

778
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.910
And that day they,
uh,
the veil,
the truth instead of telling it,

779
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.200
uh,
and that are less,
the teller is interrupted.

780
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:37.140
The truth does not come out.

781
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.380
So what is the truth here?

782
00:55:40.381 --> 00:55:44.160
The truth here in the case of Cardenio is that he has this,

783
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:49.730
this paranoid fantasy that Fernando has already possessed Lucinda and that

784
00:55:51.751 --> 00:55:55.830
therefore Lucinda is not fit for marriage with him.

785
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:57.990
It is unclear whether this happened,

786
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.840
but the story that Guy Daniel tells translate it into literature is that this

787
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:05.550
Queen Madonna Sema had this affair with the surgeon.

788
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.120
The idea of the surgeon of cutting a is obviously a story of the flowering that

789
00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:18.411
is deep in his mind and that Lucinda has been deflowered by Fernando.

790
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.030
So,
so he has,

791
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.110
he has transformed the story in his fantasy,
uh,
into that,

792
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.270
uh,
uh,
uh,
do that,

793
00:56:29.271 --> 00:56:33.790
a paranoid fantasy that what it reveals truly what is in his subconscious.

794
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:38.870
This is similar to what we had in the case of of donkey hot.

795
00:56:38.871 --> 00:56:42.970
They're making up that Val Valerie romance that in telling the story in this

796
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:46.840
case,
interrupting the story in reveals another story.

797
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:53.400
What the Quixote as a book shows you chose those is how to read stories.

798
00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.630
It is a primmer on how to read stories.

799
00:56:58.631 --> 00:57:01.960
So this is the second lesson for life that you learn here

800
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:06.670
even,
or particularly if you're going to be a lawyer,

801
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:12.810
why lawyers do not allow witnesses to go on speaking for a long time.

802
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:18.010
They're taught to interrupt them because,
uh,

803
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:22.700
a witness can go on and lead the story,
get away,

804
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.870
and uh,
create,
uh,
uh,
facts that don't exist and so forth.

805
00:57:26.871 --> 00:57:30.310
And the story that I always tell when I get to this point is one that happened

806
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:33.550
many years ago and that you are too young to remember,

807
00:57:33.551 --> 00:57:37.870
but it's a story of Susan Smith.
You may not have heard of Susan Smith.

808
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.800
She lived in a,
in a town in South Carolina.

809
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:47.300
She had two children and she claimed that she had been stopped at,
at,
at a,

810
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.790
at a traffic light in her town.
Uh,

811
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:54.990
a black man had a gun into her car and,

812
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:59.410
uh,
um,
Bush they're out and run away with her children.

813
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:04.390
And she came on TV tearfully for almost a week.

814
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:09.480
There was a whole manhunt or over the United States to try to capture,

815
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.920
uh,
this,
uh,
abductor of the two children who of course,

816
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.700
uh,
claiming that he was black out it,
you know,

817
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:23.730
racist component to this whole thing until the certain Cherif

818
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.030
broke into her story and ask her questions.

819
00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:33.130
And it turned out that Susan Smith had driven her car with her two children into

820
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:35.290
a lake,
gotten out and kill the children.

821
00:58:35.291 --> 00:58:38.590
And this made the car disappear because she had a lover.

822
00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:44.290
They certainly Fernando of the south of the South Carolina town who was wealthy

823
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.200
and a man about town debonair,

824
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:50.770
but didn't want to marry a woman who had two children.
Susan Smith was divorced.

825
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.630
So this came out when she was interrupted after she hadn't been on TV.

826
00:58:55.631 --> 00:58:58.030
Tearfully telling the whole story.
So,

827
00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.830
so if you interrupt a story being told the story,

828
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:04.900
gathering momentum from within itself,

829
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.950
you may get the real story to emerge.

830
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:14.520
And this is what happening in the interruption of all of these stories,

831
00:59:14.861 --> 00:59:18.070
which happens over and again in the Quixote.

832
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.880
So what is most important to remember from this interrupted tails is to look for

833
00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:27.470
the story not being told

834
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:32.600
or for the story being told.
Oh,
bleakly

835
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:39.400
as we did when considering donkey holders invention of the generic g Valerie

836
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:40.573
Romance,

837
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:45.700
which was a roundabout way of speaking about his own and societies and about his

838
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:51.140
lack of social status.
This is why in the psychoanalytic session,

839
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:55.190
the analyst will interrupt you and ask you questions.
Oh,

840
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:59.480
what did you say about mommy?
What did you say about Daddy?

841
00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.030
Mm.
And doesn't let you go on.

842
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:05.360
It's in that give and take that the truth may emerge.

843
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.950
So this is what the store is the,
the,
the book is,
this book is,
uh,

844
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.480
is telling us,

845
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.980
we will see this narrative device up here again when Doterra,

846
01:00:15.981 --> 01:00:17.410
this guys has princess me.

847
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:22.450
Kona makes up a story that is really that of her own turbulent love affair with

848
01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:24.261
Fernando.

849
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:28.280
She cannot make up a fictional story without this emerging in the background.

850
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:33.690
And there,
there are little details that betray that does a story.
Uh,

851
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.320
so the Quixote is among many other things,

852
01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.500
a book about how to read,
how to interpret the stories.

853
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:47.720
And in life we are surrounded by stories,
uh,
of all kinds,

854
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.700
not just in literature.
