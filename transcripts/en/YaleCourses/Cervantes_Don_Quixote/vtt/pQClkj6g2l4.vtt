1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.060
I have been speaking in the last lectures about the ending of part one,
uh,

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.170
of the Quixote.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.030
And today we finally get to the end of the novel.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.890
Uh,

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.750
I remind you again that although you have both parts bound as one book,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.890
we all have bonus one book.
Uh,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.310
this is the end of the novel set Avantis set out to write that he had no

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.990
specific plan to write the second part,

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.180
which would not be published anyway until a decade later in 16,

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.960
15.
It's very easy,
uh,

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.020
to make the mistake that what we're coming to now is a provisional ending.

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.310
Uh,
so,
uh,

13
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:56.460
avoid that mistake.
Uh,

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.640
it is very easy to make because of the book being bound together and also

15
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.410
because of the very nature of the ending of part one is so,
uh,

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.990
complicated.
Uh,

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.610
it is also easy to fall in that mistake because you know that part two is coming

18
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:16.830
as part of your course and that you're going to read it,

19
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.910
but not the readers of the 1605 Quixote in 16,

20
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.440
oh five did not have a second part that they knew they were going to read.

21
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
So I want to dispel the notion that this is a provisional ending.

22
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.340
This is the ending of the novel.
I said Avantis uh,
conceived it.

23
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.390
There are critics who seem to see in the ending,

24
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.730
uh,
hence that it around this planned a second part,

25
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.590
but there are a,
they are a best,
uh,

26
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.480
hints because second parts were often written,
uh,

27
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.730
in the 16th century.
Second parts of chivalric romances had many parts.

28
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.460
The cell is,
Dina had many second parts.

29
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.870
They last Saturday you had second part's the goose vondale.

30
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.700
Farace also had a second part.

31
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.330
So it is a conceivable to do see in some of those hints that possibility dot.

32
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.340
Cervantes thought of writing a second part,

33
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:18.170
but it is not part of the plan of the 16 or five key holiday,

34
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.390
which stands on its own or was the assigned to stand on its own as a book.

35
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.360
It is almost impossible,
uh,
to buy it today,
uh,
separately,

36
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.283
of course

37
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360
now ending the Horta is a difficult thing to do because it is no ordinary story

38
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.230
with a clear beginning that is the birth of the hero for instance,

39
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.350
and a linear plot in which the protagonist pursues a goal that he either

40
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:54.351
attained or fails to attain Hennessy's defeated or he dies.

41
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.150
It is not a love story like the subordinate stories that we have just seen being

42
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:08.071
resolved at the inn in which the lover's get married and presumably live happily

43
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.250
ever after.
Mickey Hotel,

44
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.720
as we have seen from the start,
from the prologue to be specific,

45
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.730
is a metta novel,

46
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.960
Metta novel and novel about the writing of a novel.

47
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.990
Among other things like,
um,

48
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.760
kind of met Archie Valerie romance in that it is a parody overachiever,

49
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.940
Valerie,
a romance novel.

50
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.030
It's a novel that includes and all about the writing of the novel.

51
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.860
This is quite common in avant garde fiction in the 20th century,

52
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280
but it is the first time that it happens in the literature in the Quixote to

53
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.080
have this,
this,
uh,
dimension,
uh,
of,
of,
of,

54
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.400
of criticism of the novel,
uh,
included in the novel itself.

55
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.190
So,
uh,

56
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.030
so the business of bringing it to a close is a complicated one that involves

57
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.330
closing several narrative strands plus the commentary or mid and novel part

58
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.230
about the composition of the novel.

59
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.390
Can I just come to the end and say the hero fail,
died,
got married?
No,
no,
no.

60
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:29.100
You still have to deal with all of these,
uh,
uh,

61
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.250
commentary on the writing of the novel,
which is part of an hour.

62
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.580
How do you end that?
How do you close that?
Um,

63
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.550
I want to,
uh,

64
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.240
I will anticipate that you have already read that ending because the only

65
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:50.500
possible ending to that narrative level is the prologue.

66
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.180
<v 0>With all of its hesitations about how to write it,</v>

68
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.500
which means with all of the problems about how to close the book,

69
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.690
the last episode of that Meta fiction or level is the prologue.

70
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.210
MMM.
Because,
uh,

71
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.520
closing the book,
uh,

72
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.840
which we literally do when we finish has many implications.

73
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.410
The most important of which is that it implies or includes a statement by just

74
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:29.310
doing it about the structure,
about the shape of the book.
Endings,

75
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.840
as I've mentioned,
are very important.

76
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.760
And I believe that I mentioned the best book on the subject,
uh,

77
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.020
by frank mode with a k kermode the sense of an ending.

78
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.450
So brief,
but very,

79
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.830
very smart book that I recommend if you're in the literature that you pick up

80
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.690
Sunday,
Sunday on read.

81
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.080
So closing the book actually got to the end and you close it as many,

82
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.040
uh,
implications about the,
the,

83
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.440
it's a statement about the structure of the book,

84
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.720
the very fact that it has an engine that you can close it.

85
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.260
These are the reasons why we do have several endings or closures and why the

86
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:12.950
prologue has to be the final or overarching one,

87
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.490
which necessarily suggests circularity and self enclosure.

88
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.670
If you come back to the beginning and make it the end.

89
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.250
Um,
and this secularity and itself self enclosure,

90
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.530
uh,
we saw is one of the characteristics of their normal,

91
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.390
the Quixote,
which is a fiction based on fictions and in which there are,

92
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.340
uh,
uh,
oh,

93
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:45.341
there seem to be no way out of a fiction because even the very author whose name

94
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.940
is on the cover is contained within that fiction.
Miguel.

95
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.970
They said Advantis it's contained in the scrutiny of the books.

96
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.680
Remember his novel,
like Galatia is mentioned.
And then,
uh,

97
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.650
they saw me that I wanted this away,
that I was in the capitalist.
Stale.

98
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.750
That's one of rant.
This is last names.

99
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.830
So he's also an allusion to himself during kinetic or Toledo.

100
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.460
The story that you read for today,
because I said the story that is contained,

101
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:15.080
so even the author whose name is stamped on the cover is within the,

102
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.943
the fixture.

103
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.890
So I will discuss several episodes that constitute partial endings,

104
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.250
but reminding you that the ending is the prologue.

105
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.320
The first of those episodes has to do with the enclosure with the enclosure of

106
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:37.850
Don Quixote.
I'm playing with the word and closure,
by which I mean he's caging,

107
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.280
caging,
Don Quixote's a little form of closure.
You close it in,

108
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.950
it takes him out of circulation for good as the character that he invented

109
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:50.330
himself to be.

110
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.460
So I'm seeing even in the act of and closure of the character,
a form,

111
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.910
a kind of ending,
a formal enclosure.

112
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.250
Now don't get hotter.
It's an outlaw.

113
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.650
As we saw in the arrest order read by the,
uh,

114
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.830
holy Brotherhood trooper.
Remember the one who can read very well,

115
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.850
who apprehends him after they freakers at the end,

116
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.730
being a criminal,
uh,
uh,
others,

117
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:27.731
particularly the priests have to argue Don Quixote's case to prevent the Holly

118
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.430
Brotherhood from taking him prisoner.
Remember,

119
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:36.431
his crime is against the crown because the galley slaves were under the purview

120
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:39.860
of the crown.
So he would've,
he would have been taken by the Holy Brotherhood,

121
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.560
arrested and perhaps even executed.

122
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.360
Remember the Sanchez at some point that he can hear the arrows of the holy

123
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.110
Brotherhood buzzing around his ears because of course,

124
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.370
sanctuary in a commoner is more a to be arrested by the holy brotherhood.

125
00:08:58.321 --> 00:08:59.670
Where else do you hope to be in?

126
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:03.750
And he got to go perhaps thought that he was above the law.
But in any case,

127
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.450
uh,
the other,
uh,

128
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:11.160
the priest particularly have to argue,
uh,
that Don Quixote,

129
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.640
uh,
be,
uh,
released,
uh,
uh,
sort of,
uh,

130
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.900
uh,
uh,
on their cost,
in their custody,

131
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.720
releasing to the custody because the,

132
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.680
the priest argues very persuasively like a lawyer,
uh,

133
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.940
being insane.
Don Quixote,
they would never be kept in jail,

134
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.350
would never be convicted.

135
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.630
The insanity defense existed in Spanish law since the 13th century.
So,

136
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.080
uh,
an insane man would be released.

137
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.660
<v 0>Again,
again,
look,</v>

139
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.110
not that's insanity puts him above or beyond the law.

140
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.160
It is his most significant characteristic as a literary character and being

141
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:57.750
insane.
He accepts no law,

142
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.590
but why is it caged and not simply arrested and taken home in shackles

143
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.140
sitting on a [inaudible]?

144
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.420
Why is it that at the end of the health is freedom has to be denied in such a

145
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.510
spectacular fashion.

146
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.860
And I mean spectacular because it's caging of Don Quixote and his caring being

147
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:22.680
carried home in this cage is a spectacle.

148
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.800
There are two plot strands that are winding up here.
First,
donkey,

149
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.280
hottest quest,
and second,

150
00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:38.420
the priest and the barbers own quest to return to return him home,

151
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.000
possibly to be cured.

152
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.860
This is what justifies the charade,
uh,

153
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.100
of the masks.
Pragmatically,

154
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.900
the forest is staged because if don't get hot,
the recognizes the barber.

155
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:54.531
I'm the priest.

156
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:59.531
He will catch on about the plan to return him home and he might resist,

157
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.840
but there is more to it.

158
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.360
It is really only at the level of fiction that donkey halted.

159
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.380
The character that he himself has created can be captured alone.

160
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.630
So he,
no,
the uh,
the dial go,
they're modest in,

161
00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:21.890
I'll go from that place in la,
man.
Jack can be arrested or apprehended,

162
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:24.270
but not donkey holiday who is,
uh,

163
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.620
an invented literary character or less.

164
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:30.110
It is within the world of his fiction.

165
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.660
Hence the make believe.

166
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

167
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.950
<v 0>And this is the,
the scene of the caging.</v>

168
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.590
In page four 15 of the Jarvis translation,

169
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.550
they made a kind of cage with Poles gradewise large enough to contain don

170
00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:51.740
Quixote at his ease.

171
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.800
This is the bottom of page 15 and immediately Doki hope they and his companions,

172
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.700
we don't lose the servants and the officers of the Holly Brotherhood together

173
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.620
with the innkeeper all by the contrivance and direction of the priest covered

174
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:12.970
their faces.
And these guys themselves some one way,

175
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.040
some another so as to appear to Loki harder to be quite other persons or those

176
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.840
he had seen in that castle.

177
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.290
This being done with the greatest silence.

178
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.920
They entered the room where Don Quixote,

179
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.950
La fast asleep and not dreaming of any such accident and laying fast whole of

180
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:30.701
him,

181
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:35.701
they bound him and a hand and foot so that when he awakened with a start,

182
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.080
he could not stare,
not do anything,

183
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:42.400
but look around him and wonder to see such strange visa charges about him.

184
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.760
And presently you fell into the usual conceit that is disordered imagination was

185
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:52.130
perpetually presenting to him,
believing that all these shapes were gobbling.

186
00:12:52.131 --> 00:12:56.500
So that enchanted castle and that we thought all doubt,
he must be enchanted.

187
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.970
Since he could not stern or defend himself all precisely as the priest,

188
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.610
the projector of this strategy and fence it,

189
00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:08.611
it would fall out central alone of all that were present was in his perfect

190
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:11.770
census and his own figure.
And though he wanted,

191
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:16.300
but little of being infected with this master's disease jetty was not at a loss

192
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.680
to know who all these counterfeit goblins were,

193
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.640
but he did.
He does not open his lips or delete.

194
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.110
So what he surprised with what,
what his surprise,
uh,

195
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.340
an imprisonment of his master meant talking about century.

196
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.533
Uh,

197
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:45.570
the irony here in this episode is that Don Quixote has communicated to the

198
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:52.090
others the freedom to act out whatever fantasies they have.

199
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.580
Isn't this contradictory?
He is caged for giving them,

200
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:03.090
allowing them the freedom to cage him in a way he has contaminated them with the

201
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:07.060
imaginative freedom that he practices.

202
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.900
This theme began with the story of Dorothea becoming Princess Mikami corner and

203
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:14.200
her acting out at you,

204
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:19.201
Valerie romance invented on the spot by the priest and performed by her as the

205
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:25.060
priest invents his whole charade.
This whole charade,

206
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.180
which is like a brief theatrical piece or interlude taking place in the darkness

207
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:34.210
of the inn is like the episode of a nightmare.

208
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.370
Don Quixote Awakens to find himself bound on,

209
00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:43.371
surrounded by what seemed like gobbling support him in the cage was,

210
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:47.380
is this a dream or is this reality is a dealing here,
uh,

211
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.460
said run test with a theme that was a very common in the 16th and 17th centuries

212
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.690
and that was made famous in a play called life is a dream by a playwright called

213
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.340
[inaudible].
You may have heard of it.

214
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.090
This is a play from the 1630s,

215
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.300
but you can see that the theme is,
uh,
is here,
uh,
of

216
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.370
real life or is this a dream?

217
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:27.371
He has gone from being a asleep to finding himself surrounded by this strange

218
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:29.650
figures,
uh,
in,
in,

219
00:15:29.651 --> 00:15:34.610
in the darkness of the ins of what could it be if not some sort of a nightmare.

220
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.340
So he leaves as his enchanted in the cage.

221
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.230
Donkey Horta is like the prisoner.

222
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:47.231
He is in the sense that because prisoners were paraded through the streets as a

223
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:51.920
lesson to other prisoners were routinely,

224
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:56.921
I think even up through the 19th century paraded through the streets of towns in

225
00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:01.850
cards or,
or,
or,
or walking,
being flogged and so forth.

226
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.210
As a,
as a,
as a lesson to other,

227
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.160
part of their punishment was,
was uh,

228
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.520
their punishment being made public.

229
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.730
So he was not unusual for them to be broadly mostly writing a donkeys and stuff.

230
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:20.360
They were paraded through the towns,
but also in carts.
Um,

231
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.520
he is also,
uh,
uh,

232
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.440
like a circus freak show.
That's what,
uh,
uh,

233
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.900
shows and you will see one a or two in part in,

234
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.150
in the second part of the chaotic traveled around in carts.

235
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.590
And in fact a place where,
uh,

236
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.330
staged in carts in the,
in the,
in town squares throughout Spain.

237
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.260
That is the company came in the cards and the cards opened up and became the

238
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:55.900
stage.
So,
uh,
the cart here is,
is,
is an important,
uh,

239
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.100
uh,
uh,

240
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:01.670
and significant means of communication of taking Gnocchi around as a prisoner

241
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.800
and also as some sort of a freak show.

242
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.970
It continuation of the theatrical episode of the terrain to,
uh,

243
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.170
to put him in the cage.

244
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.600
So this emphasizes that theatrical quality that I,
uh,
that I,

245
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:18.760
uh,
uh,
mentioned.

246
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.190
An important part of the terrain is the prophecy contrived and delivered in

247
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:29.210
dramatic,
highly affected tones by the barber,

248
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.360
which for tells of the future of Don Quixote has night projecting a potential

249
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.920
ending to the story on that fiction or level,

250
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.980
which satisfies no Quixote like the priest.

251
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:42.200
The Barber is an author,

252
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.290
but also an actor besides I cannot do justice in my,

253
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.810
particularly in Jarvis is 18th century English and with my Cuban accent.

254
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.850
But uh,
this is the,
uh,
this is the,
uh,
the prophecy by the,

255
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.750
by the barber [inaudible] four figure.

256
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.940
Let not the confinement you are under a flicked you for it is expedient.

257
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:09.421
It should be.

258
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:13.980
So for the more speedy accomplishment of the adventure in which your great valor

259
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:15.060
has engaged you,

260
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.550
we shall be finished when the furious Manchego and the lion shall be coupled

261
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:25.551
with the white turbos and dove after having submitted their stately next to the

262
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:30.930
soft matrimonial yoke from which on heard off conjunctions shall spring into the

263
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:32.280
light of the world.

264
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.250
Bribe Brave Webs who shall emulate the tearing Clauss of their venues.

265
00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:38.084
Sire.

266
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:43.250
And these shall come to pass before the pursuer of the fugitive nymph shall have

267
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:48.330
made two rounds to visit the bright constellations in his rapid a natural

268
00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:50.190
course.
And though,

269
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.250
oh the most noble and obedient squire that ever had sore in sorting belt,

270
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.550
beard on face,
on smelling nostrils,
be not dismayed.

271
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:01.920
And our afflicted to see the flower of night.

272
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:06.921
Aaron tree carried dose away from denies for ear long before long is so pleased

273
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:10.920
the fabricator of the world,

274
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.100
thou shall see myself so exalted on sublimated that Thou shall not know thyself

275
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.530
and shall not be defrauded of the promises made thee by Thy Noble Lord.

276
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.790
And I assure you in the name of sage,

277
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:27.450
it mean Ddo Niana mentored Ranjana from the word in Spanish,

278
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:29.850
men Theda for lie.
This is the,

279
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:34.851
the sage that die wages shall be punctually paid thee as thou will see in

280
00:19:36.251 --> 00:19:37.030
effect,

281
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:41.760
fall on there for the footsteps of the Valeros and enchanted night where it is

282
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:44.970
expedient for you to go where you may both rest.

283
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.290
And because I am permitted to say no more God be with you for I return,

284
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.060
I will know whether,

285
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:56.750
so this is the prophecy invented on the spot and delivered by,

286
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.100
uh,
by the barber who is,
as we can see,
uh,
quite,

287
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.170
uh,
uh,

288
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:09.710
quite a ham himself and also quite able to imitate the speech of [inaudible],

289
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.260
uh,
uh,
uh,
romances.

290
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.650
This is the peak of play acting in the chaotic,
by the way,

291
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:24.000
you can see in the prophecy that this is a projected ending of the novel that is

292
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:28.920
Donkey Hotel Lucy.
Now we'll marry and have children and so forth.

293
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.600
So you see,
this is the projected ending within the fictions of,
of,
of,
of,

294
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:38.070
beyond even the fictions,
uh,
Don Quixote has invented.

295
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.630
So this is yet another level of those levels that the novel,
uh,
uh,

296
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.480
shows throughout,
created by characters.

297
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.400
This is the peak of play acting in the Quixote culminating performance than

298
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.230
that.
Among other things displace Cervantes,
his talents as a playwright,

299
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.930
but particularly a playwright of the interviews,

300
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.240
the funny skits that he wrote,
one Paloma is in,

301
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.910
which has been used as a court of no,

302
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.380
and I said debating meeting room where they debate what the base in is and so

303
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:16.381
forth is now transformed into a theater as don Quixote is finally dismissed from

304
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:19.930
it.
These two is one of the endings.

305
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:24.310
So the 16 or five Quixote and the novel has several as I mentioned.

306
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:29.160
And as we saw in the last class when I discussed the restitution made,

307
00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.030
uh,
excuse me,

308
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:35.650
we have a visitor in the class and insect who is crawling in the middle of the

309
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:39.830
room and uh,
who ma,
uh,
I,
uh,

310
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.800
this is,
uh,
this is,
uh,
uh,
an added show free of charge,
uh,

311
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.310
by this,
uh,
by this bug.
Uh,
Elena,
maybe you can capture it.

312
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.790
Shall we kill it or not know?

313
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:03.370
What is it?
The,

314
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.270
it came out of Toby's bag.
Well,
I'm sorry.

315
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.640
Well,
if you can possibly,
uh,
pay attention to my lecture.

316
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.850
Hmm.
So,
uh,
yes,

317
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.660
please,
please let,
let us make a pause here.
Uh,

318
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.090
an interlude while Toby,
the vulnerable

319
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.930
delivers us from this monster

320
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.620
who is very elusive.
It seems

321
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.700
we've got four,
he doesn't crawl up your pant leg.

322
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.540
Is your film all of this

323
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.270
okay.
As it Kelsey is leaving the area.

324
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.433
Oh No.

325
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.870
Oh,
grab with your hand.

326
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.863
Thank you.

327
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.490
Justin Q was,
I had planned it.

328
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.540
So,
uh,

329
00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.780
so this is one of the endings of the 1605 Quixote.

330
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.240
And the has several as I mentioned.
And as we saw in the last class,

331
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.040
we discussed the various restitutions to those who had suffered damages.

332
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.520
This ending is the most consistent,
uh,

333
00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:00.290
the prophecy with the fictional world generated by Don Quixote and now inhabited

334
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.860
by all the characters around him except for central,

335
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.510
who knows what is going on,
but prudently chooses not to intervene.

336
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:10.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

337
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.420
<v 0>So now we go on the road on,</v>

338
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.780
we meet one of the most memorable characters in part one,

339
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.150
the Canon of Toledo,

340
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.900
who is traveling with a retinue and meets,
uh,

341
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.930
these very strange caravan carrying in Don Quixote and stops to find out what

342
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.210
this is all about.
And after he does,
uh,
they,

343
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.270
uh,
the Canon Doki Hilton,
the priest engage in a,

344
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.690
in a discussion about commonplaces of literary theory about the romances a of

345
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:50.220
chivalry.
Uh,
and about the,
uh,
mostly,
uh,

346
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.560
Aristotle's poetics.
Uh,

347
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.670
now the relevant background texts.

348
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:03.530
Here are the philosophy and p poet.
Deca.
Bye.

349
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.520
<v 0>Alonzo Lopez being Siano known as [inaudible] Siano.
Uh,</v>

351
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.680
1596.
In Spanish we write philosophy or today with an f,

352
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.570
that's just the old fashioned spelled.
Okay.

353
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:20.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

354
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.420
<v 0>And Lopa the Vegas out of 10,
where will they,
instead of [inaudible] 1669,</v>

355
00:25:25.421 --> 00:25:28.030
which is of course Polish after the Quixote,

356
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:32.320
but which deals with topics that are very relevant to this episode.

357
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.740
Um,
philosophy,

358
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:40.650
antiwar Attica is a book in which helping Siano x pounds,

359
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.770
uh,
uh,

360
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:47.310
literary theory mostly derived from my risk Donald's poetics.

361
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.790
And
now,
uh,

362
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:56.670
it is one of the great ironies of literary history that Cervantes was wildly

363
00:25:58.511 --> 00:26:00.370
innovative in narrative fiction,

364
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.380
but exceedingly conservative in the theater except when writing is brief,

365
00:26:05.381 --> 00:26:06.700
comical interludes.

366
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.130
I don't have to emphasize now how he was wildly innovative in narrative fiction

367
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.800
about the theater.
Uh,

368
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:19.390
this episode is a vicious critique of Lopez.

369
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:24.410
The Vega is enemy Lopez Omega because Lobelia Vega wrote plays that will not,

370
00:26:26.831 --> 00:26:28.030
that would not,

371
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.690
did not follow Aristotle's a poetics,

372
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.540
the rules of a unity of action and the place and have time.

373
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.500
Everything had to happen in one day,
in one place,
and there was 21 plot and,
and,

374
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:47.160
and,
and so forth.
Uh,
Lopez flaunted all of this,
uh,
uh,

375
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.160
uh,
rules on his place where,
uh,
uh,

376
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.730
historical place that,
uh,
that,
uh,

377
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.630
where dubiously accurate about the history.

378
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:00.570
He just made it up like Shakespeare.
Uh,
he was a,

379
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:05.430
a great innovator who wrote thousands of place and,
uh,
who couldn't care,

380
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.850
couldn't care less about the rules.
Uh,

381
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.330
he invented the Spanish national theater,
uh,

382
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.910
by not following the rules.
Uh,

383
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.230
but there were those like Cervantes himself who criticized him for that.

384
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.350
Uh,
and he replied in 16,

385
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:27.190
oh nine in this very hilarious poem called the,
uh,

386
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.220
the new art,
uh,

387
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.780
about how to make place at this time.
The,
the,
the,

388
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:38.520
the title is very polemical that you can see out of art is supposed to be

389
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.740
eternal.
And he says,
new art do art is an oxymoron.

390
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.290
Art cannot be new or old.
It's always the same.
Supposedly if you follow,
uh,

391
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.740
the poetics,
uh,
red comedies at this time now,

392
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.930
not in the past now.

393
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.770
And so a Lopa was wildly innovative and he,
uh,

394
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.730
as I've mentioned before,
uh,
just,
uh,

395
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.920
took over the Spanish theater and said,
Vantis

396
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.320
plodding place that followed the politics,

397
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.040
did not have much success.
He,
he,

398
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.580
he did write an and have had a few stages it staged and then he had the

399
00:28:17.581 --> 00:28:21.570
interviews,
also a stage and a book of,
of these appeared.

400
00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.900
And I would speak about that when I speak about the transition between the first

401
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:29.280
and second and second part.
But it is the,
uh,
an irony that said,
run this.

402
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:33.930
It was so innovative and the pros was so conservative.
So he's using,
of course,

403
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.621
the,
the,

404
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:39.080
the cannon and the priest to criticize local yoga for all of this irregularity

405
00:28:39.081 --> 00:28:43.680
just in his place.
Uh,

406
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.850
Peter Russell,

407
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.910
who's a very reputable English [inaudible] scholar writes quote the discussion

408
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.160
among the three characters,
um,
about,
you know,

409
00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.990
a theory has little bearing on the kind of discoveries about fiction that's

410
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:03.810
Advantis has been making empirically in his book,

411
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:08.670
hardly a word he said in it,
for example,
about comic writing.
It is true.

412
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.800
I think that Russell,
he's right.

413
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.790
That's advantage considered all of the theoretical issues that kind of put
forth,

414
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.940
but that in practice he did not adhere to any of them except,
uh,

415
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.030
that have various,

416
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:25.500
the militude that the novel does not deviate from the mutation of nature.

417
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.570
That is,
character's never engaged in supernatural actions and that actions,

418
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.310
uh,
under there no actions that are beyond the credible,
that is very similitude.

419
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.180
Uh,
they're most interesting.

420
00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:43.780
Part of the discussion is when the and hope they explore the possibilities of

421
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:45.130
the romances of chivalry,

422
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:50.340
which in the end the Canon winds up pricing because they afford the possibility

423
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:55.240
of introducing variety,
which is a one,
one renaissance,
uh,

424
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.540
principal does Advantis did follow besides the cat on himself confesses that he

425
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:07.410
has written the,
the first hundred pages of evolve Vallourec Romance.
Uh,

426
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:11.300
this is hilarious.
He is,
uh,
uh,
uh,

427
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.500
the critic of few violin rig romances.
So this is a typical Savante and twist.

428
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.420
We have seen that it was the priest who read out loud the novel of the curious

429
00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:25.400
in pertinent and hear the cannon since I myself replied,

430
00:30:25.401 --> 00:30:28.670
the cannon was once tempted to write a book of night,

431
00:30:28.671 --> 00:30:33.560
Aaron Three in which I purposed to observe all the restrictions I have mentioned

432
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.910
and to confess the truth,
I had gone through above a hundred sheets of it.

433
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.750
And to try whether they answered my own opinion of them,

434
00:30:41.751 --> 00:30:46.370
I communicated them to some learning and judicious persons who are very fond of

435
00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:47.270
this kind of reading.

436
00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.830
And two other persons who are ignorant and regarded only the pleasure of reading

437
00:30:51.831 --> 00:30:55.700
extravagances and I met with a kind of a probation from all of them.

438
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.923
Nevertheless,

439
00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.730
I would proceed no further as well in regard that I looked upon it as a thing

440
00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:03.410
for into my profession as,

441
00:31:03.411 --> 00:31:07.640
because the number of the own wise is greater than that of the prudent.

442
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.720
And though it is better to be praised by the few wise than mark by a multitudes

443
00:31:12.721 --> 00:31:13.554
of fools,

444
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.140
yet I am willing to expose myself to the confused judgment of the giddy vulgar

445
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.440
to whose lot of the reading of such books for the most part,
for

446
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:34.370
they key hot a donkey Hartej,
uh,
for his part us in reply,

447
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:35.683
uh,

448
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.740
makes up a Valerie interlude based on the story of the night of the lake,

449
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.040
just wide remarkable.

450
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.210
And it's with which in a sense he wins the debate,

451
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.270
<v 1>uh,</v>

452
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.960
<v 0>both accounting and the Quixote,
our offers as,
as,
as,
as the barber.
The,</v>

453
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.850
the priests and so forth.
Uh,

454
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.070
now there is a very elegant joke in bedded in all this discussion.

455
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:09.100
Um,
the cannon I maintain is the idol reader.

456
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.970
Uh,
the district,

457
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:16.360
the Torah that's Advantis addresses in the prologue,

458
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:19.750
remember that he really says this [inaudible] idal reader.

459
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.640
Uh,
the,
the,

460
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:27.690
the joke is that canons were supposed to have cushy jobs that allowed them time,

461
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.050
the time to read and develop themselves to other leisurely activities via they

462
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:35.884
can only go

463
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.040
<v 1>was</v>

464
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.950
<v 0>and still is the way of saying cushy life</v>

465
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.800
panels were in charge of reading Canon law.

466
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.980
They were in charges and there were supposed to read Canon Law and pass her

467
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:03.540
judgment.
I kind of always church law that is,
uh,
uh,

468
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.130
when we talked about incest and the prisoner of sex,

469
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:11.780
who would determine what is insist and what is not whom you can marry and whom

470
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:16.340
you cannot marry and worry is a sin and noticing and so forth.
Uh,

471
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:20.680
Canon law is very,
very important.
It's not to us anymore.
Uh,

472
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.850
and the separation between crime and sin is beginning in the 17th century and

473
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.500
doesn't really,
it's not quite accomplish until the 19th century,

474
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.550
if you know what I mean.

475
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:33.770
But cannons had all the time in the world to sit around and read and so there

476
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:35.030
was supposed to be,
you know,

477
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.980
well fed fat and they were capable.
Uh,

478
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.820
then they had the time to read romances of chivalry and pass judgment assists.

479
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.360
All of these figures of authority in Cervantes are always slightly ridiculous.

480
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.910
Uh,
um,
uh,

481
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:57.400
they have some floor or another,
but here is jet,

482
00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.470
another author,
another internal author.

483
00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:05.250
We have seen many in the [inaudible] a donkey,
how to himself,
the priest,

484
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.051
the Barbara,

485
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:10.640
we just so she knows the Pasa Montay CDMA telling Haley,

486
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:14.490
uh,
the translator,
uh,

487
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:18.080
we have a resource to them or Cardenio,
uh,
and so forth.

488
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.900
That Quixote is literature within literature,

489
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.120
literature with its own internal rules discussed not from the outside.

490
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.850
This is what is important here.

491
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.120
The characters are discussing the nature of the work within which they appear

492
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.990
there is to say that there is a seamless continuity between theory and practice.

493
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:43.190
At the level of discourse,
but not at the level of ideology.

494
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:48.610
That is to say the novel does not comply with the theory propounded by the

495
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:53.810
Cannon of Toledo,
but flows from within it's own practice.

496
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.280
Notice that the Canon has not finished the novel that he begun,

497
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.980
and that he also confesses that he's never finished.

498
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.540
The reading the novels that I began reading,
it never gets to the end.
Uh,

499
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:08.960
I think that's a fantasy is pointing out here,
uh,

500
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:13.961
the difficulty of finishing a novel and finishing this novel in particular.

501
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.590
Uh,

502
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.880
and that is more important than all the commonplaces about Aristotelian theory

503
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:24.580
that the characters discuss a little background on,

504
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.910
on Aristotelian theory,
although,
um,

505
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.560
I think that the best thing to,

506
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.200
uh,
to,
to approach,
uh,
this,
uh,

507
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.540
passage of the Kingdom of Tornado,

508
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:44.541
which of course has generated a lot of criticism because all you have to do is

509
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:50.610
give a scholar a set of rules that were being propounded on a novel on scholars

510
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:55.230
think that art is written following rules.
It is a dilution of,
uh,

511
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.830
of scholars and critics.
Uh,

512
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:03.290
but none of these theory can contain the narrative,

513
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:07.410
the experiments in narrative that we have been observing indic Quixote,

514
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.040
all of the various levels of fiction.
Uh,

515
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:12.840
all of these intertwined stories,

516
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:18.140
all of these very wild and at the same time disciplined experiments about the

517
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:22.170
nature of fiction that we find in the Quixote.

518
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.060
All of that surpasses any theory that,
uh,
that,
uh,

519
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.770
was,
uh,
expound that,
uh,
in the,
uh,

520
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:35.280
Spanish golden age in the 16th century or in Europe,
in the 16th,
uh,
sanctuary.

521
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:40.110
So we cannot be here a blinded by,
by,
by the philosophy,

522
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.070
Antigua,
poetic carbide,
Aristotle's boy.

523
00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:47.071
It takes by Plato and all of those discussions because the poetics of the

524
00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:52.250
Kihatha are contained in its own practice,
not a,
and it's,

525
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:56.610
some practice includes the discussion of its own politics,
but it did,

526
00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:00.540
it does not take the theory from outside and applies it to the Quixote.

527
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.210
That would be a foolish what,

528
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:09.450
what happens in the 16th century,
uh,
in,
in,
in,

529
00:37:09.451 --> 00:37:14.260
in,
in literary theory in the 16th century is the,
the,
the,

530
00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:17.670
the world worn debate between Plato and Aristotle.

531
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:24.050
Plato was the first spoil sport in the history of criticism because he thought

532
00:37:25.621 --> 00:37:28.540
that art was,
uh,
uh,

533
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:30.810
a negative influence in the republic.

534
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:35.610
And he wanted to banish the ports because art,
uh,
appealed to the emotions.

535
00:37:35.611 --> 00:37:40.560
And because art was based on imitation,
it couldn't be a itself,

536
00:37:40.561 --> 00:37:45.090
it was always any mutation or a of something.
Uh,
so,

537
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.170
uh,
although,
uh,

538
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.230
neoplatonism as important in other realms of 16th century,
uh,

539
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.610
uh,
literature,
uh,
that view of,

540
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.740
of art and poetry,
uh,

541
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.350
was countered by Aristotle's,
a critique of,

542
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.330
of Plato in which he departs from the,
uh,

543
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.380
by his point of departure is his baseline is that humans are,

544
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:14.100
tend to imitate.

545
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.870
Imitation is part of the human condition and are therefore,

546
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:19.890
uh,

547
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:24.890
art is inherent in the human animal because he imitates and it's,

548
00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:29.150
we are all Mikami.
Micardis if we remember that Princess,
we gonna be gone.

549
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.730
I was about Emmy Tatio boss about me,
Macy's.
Uh,
we are all,
uh,

550
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:38.200
uh,
uh,
monkeys,
mutate a,
we imitate just like monkeys.

551
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.690
And this is what Aristotle really propound said,
imitation,
uh,

552
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.410
is a good thing.
And that in mutation,
uh,

553
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:50.460
in art leads to a pleasurable in intellectual,
uh,

554
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:51.683
uh,

555
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.110
pleasure of an intellectual process that he favors that is at the base of

556
00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.400
Aristotelian theory.
Now I startled then in their politics,

557
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:04.120
gives a series of rules that the basis on his own practice of reading the epic

558
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:08.890
and the theater,
uh,
that is applied or the lady Shirley,

559
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.690
sometimes in the renaissance,
the renaissance,
a penchant for,

560
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.910
uh,
uh,
reviving the classics.

561
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.590
That is basically what is at stake here is parallel to what I mentioned in the

562
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:24.040
last class about the rules of government that are being drawn up.

563
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:27.010
Then from Machiavelli on,
it's very much a part of,
uh,
of,

564
00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:32.510
of the renaissance who tried to draw up rules and the rules of behavior that,
uh,

565
00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:37.230
uh,
we're containing Baldessari Castiglioni,
the coacher.
Uh,

566
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.280
these are all parallel movements,
but in the case of the Quixote,
uh,

567
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.300
none of this theory,
uh,
is ultimately relevant.

568
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:49.480
It is contained within it.
It is discussed,
uh,

569
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.790
but uh,
it is,

570
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.690
it does not drive the book and it's not drive,
uh,

571
00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.760
it is not control.
The poetics of Samantha's is poetics.

572
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:04.600
In the Keyhole,
which surpasses all of that,
uh,
uh,

573
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.550
by quite a bit.
So I will not,
uh,

574
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:14.300
expound very much beyond that.
On the,
uh,
uh,
uh,

575
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.480
on the,
uh,
the precedence for installers,
poetics.
Uh,

576
00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:21.700
there's a lot of criticism and one of those who has written eloquently about it

577
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.410
is,
uh,
uh,
easy.
Riley who,
uh,

578
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.880
who you have met in your,
uh,

579
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:32.970
in my case book in the essay about life and art and so forth in Oklahoma.

580
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:37.330
He has written a book,
he wrote a book,
he died not too long ago,
Riley,

581
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:41.880
um,
about,
uh,
the theory of an oval instead Cervantes,

582
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.830
his theory and all that,
which is a classical [inaudible] criticism.
Uh,

583
00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:49.360
but I think that ultimately what I have said here today,

584
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:52.210
it takes care of it now.
So lantus is of course,

585
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.530
expounded on literature and,
and,
uh,
in other books,

586
00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.810
he has a long poem called [inaudible] boy used to buy mass,

587
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.230
which is a book of literary criticism about the,
the,

588
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:07.540
the literature of his time and in the prologues through his various books he

589
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:12.130
expounds on,
on criticism,
uh,
and uh,
and so forth.

590
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.320
Uh,
but the problem is,
uh,

591
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:18.440
as with all writers of fiction,
that's advantage

592
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.570
has this theory of peer always in dialogue,

593
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.610
in a dialogue among various character.

594
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:28.510
So you cannot really pinpoint him of what is what,
what's the rant?

595
00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:32.830
This is preferences in all of this,
but I think that the,
the,

596
00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:36.110
the points to remember is that the kind of is a slightly ridiculous,

597
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:40.700
ridiculous figure that we cannot take him as a figure of authority who has given

598
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:41.211
us deploy.

599
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:45.890
It takes over the Quixote by any means that he himself has tried to write a

600
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:48.260
romance of Javari.
Now,

601
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.780
another element that express it in this episode is the critique or the criticism

602
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:55.130
of the romances of jewelry.

603
00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:00.050
They were criticized severely in the 16th century by and figures as important to

604
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:01.640
us,
Erasmus of Rotterdam,

605
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:06.280
another one of these renaissance figures that I have mentioned before,
uh,
uh,

606
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.320
Beavis and others criticize the romances of chivalry for there being potentially

607
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.280
a,
I'm a bad influence on society,
uh,

608
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:21.110
in terms that that Cervantes echoes mockingly India Quixote when he says that

609
00:42:21.111 --> 00:42:24.560
he's written the book to do,
are worried with the romances of chivalrous.

610
00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.930
So there was,
uh,

611
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:31.730
there isn't this episode too also an echo of those debates about the romances of

612
00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:35.740
chivalry because as I mentioned,
they were quite popular at one point,
uh,

613
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.490
aided by the fact that they could be,

614
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.700
they were printed and distributed in relatively large numbers,

615
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.050
large numbers for the period.
So this is what,

616
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:50.330
this is what is at stake in these episodes involving the Carnival Tornado,
uh,

617
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.780
which I think are also preparing us for the ending of the book,

618
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:55.940
which as I said is the prologue.
It is one of the,

619
00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:01.010
the most sustained takes on the poetics,
uh,
of,

620
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:01.903
uh,
of the,

621
00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.560
of that you've ordered romances and on point the and literary theory in the,
uh,

622
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.350
in the audit.
So the important thing to remember is very similitude surrenders,

623
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.430
never deviates from very similitude.
That is,
uh,

624
00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:18.770
the characters never engage in anything that is supernatural or do something

625
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:21.450
that is beyond what common sense would,
uh,

626
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.010
the common sense of a normal reader who would,
uh,

627
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.480
would allow so much for this episode,
which is,
uh,

628
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.490
which has,
uh,
as I said,
I listen to it a lot of cases.
It must,

629
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:36.290
you can imagine and that I find very entertaining because a,

630
00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:39.470
I think that the figure of the candidate is really a very funny one.

631
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:44.300
You will see that,
uh,
religious figures,
uh,
appear in that cohort.
They,
well,

632
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.810
the priest has been around the whole first part.

633
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.790
Others will appear in part to,
uh,

634
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.590
one in particular who is depicted in,
in,
in very negative terms.

635
00:43:57.591 --> 00:44:01.720
As you will see that Canon is not the kind of,
is a very learned,

636
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.250
very well read and,

637
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:07.040
and funny in a his own contradictions.

638
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:12.620
Notice of course that the whole debate takes place over dinner,

639
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.480
I mean over lunch or whatever.

640
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:18.500
This picnic that they have organized in this Nice Valley with food that they

641
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:23.501
have obtained from the [inaudible] and these locals or manuals where we will

642
00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:27.860
find a pastoral interlude.
Uh,

643
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:33.430
we just another one of those stories that repeat previous ones towards the end

644
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:34.380
of the day,

645
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:39.380
it is again a way of lending substance to the book by this inner references.

646
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:46.410
The episode is like a new version of the resource Domo and Marcella episode,

647
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.370
but it also recalls parts of some of the intertwined love stories.

648
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.880
Leandra is a young beauty in her father's care who is desired by many men and

649
00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.100
how many of the goat herd and unsettle him.

650
00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.870
Another goat herd Alejandra's principles,
suitors.

651
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.280
They appear to be perfect candidates to marry her as in the earlier story of

652
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:09.060
Crisostomo and Marcella,
they're both well off and so forth.

653
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:14.510
Then there appears to be sent in a La Rosa who rules her with his wireless and

654
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:18.630
lies,
uh,
Bill because underwrite is no Marcella.

655
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.880
She allows herself to be seduced by the center that are Rosa,

656
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:27.150
who is a modern man in that he has made himself almost literally the way that
he,

657
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.640
that he uses a three sets of clothes.

658
00:45:29.641 --> 00:45:33.120
He has three suits and he shuffles them in such a way that it appears that he

659
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:38.120
has many and he is Emilio Glorioso,
Terman Latin,

660
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:42.080
Eh,
uh,
self glorifying a soldier,

661
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.830
soldier Mueller's Lordosis from classical comedy.

662
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.230
This is a solely who goes around boasting of all of his great feats of arms and

663
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:55.770
showing scars that he has from battles as,
as,
uh,

664
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.390
as he does us be centered.

665
00:45:57.391 --> 00:46:01.980
A La Rasa does here he plays the guitar and so forth,

666
00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:05.880
and this is a way that he woos her.
They run off to the wild,

667
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.500
the same kind of landscape that we found in the Sierra Morina where she's robbed

668
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.640
but surprisingly not sexually ravaged,

669
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.950
which is a Q,
a curious detail that I have not been able to ever to understand.

670
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:24.240
What does that reveal about you sent on Rosa?
That,
uh,

671
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:25.343
I mean,

672
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:30.930
it may be as bad as that he was impotent and that all of these don't,
one like,

673
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:35.210
uh,
uh,
uh,
adventures that he seems to be engaged in a really a,

674
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:36.690
a cover for that.

675
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:41.780
But I find it amazing that she has been left untouched,
uh,
and that,

676
00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:46.410
that satisfies her father very much,
but the story is left on finished.

677
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.770
It hasn't,
it hasn't concluded.
No one knows what it's going to happen.

678
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.530
And I wonder,
I have under why.

679
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.980
And I think that the reason is that we are now coming to the end of the novel

680
00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.810
and what it's being narrated is kind of a precedent and a present cannot have a

681
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:05.580
conclusion because,
uh,
current events or current,
uh,
not,

682
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.880
uh,
and to,
and to,
to bring them,
to give them a conclusion is,

683
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:13.770
which is an artificial way of,
uh,
of,
of,
of finishing them.

684
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:18.170
I think that's the only way to explain this unfinished story.
Uh,

685
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:22.830
that is just left on finished.
We come to the end.

686
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.790
Uh,
finally the priest Barbara Sanctuary,

687
00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.310
no Quixote arrived back in donkey halters on a Sunday.

688
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:36.130
Is this significant?
It is the day of rest of leisure or feasts,

689
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:40.120
consonant.
Perhaps we don't get hopeless arrival in a cage.

690
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.150
A see we as if we were part of a affair.

691
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.530
But to me the most moving and interest in detail is that Don Quixote does not

692
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:55.090
know where he is.
If you go to page four 58 at the very end,

693
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.910
all this discourse at the top of page four 58 or this,

694
00:47:59.911 --> 00:48:04.630
this course passed between Sancho Panza and his wife,
there is a panser.

695
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.910
You will see that her name changes throughout the book.

696
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.020
This is another one of the run.
This is careless mistakes.
She goes,

697
00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:13.060
one I'm dear is and so forth.

698
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:18.730
While the housekeeper and the knees received donkey haughty and having pulled

699
00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:22.000
off his clothes,
laid him in his own bed,

700
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.840
he looked at them with isis queue not knowing perfectly where he was

701
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.780
after all these adventures,
home is no longer familiar.
Do Don Quixote.

702
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.340
Uh,

703
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:45.730
it is not if it ever was the abode of the county,
but,
uh,

704
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.400
of the uncanny instead of curing him,

705
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:52.840
it seems to me bringing him home has made him madder than ever.

706
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.860
Perhaps the circularity of the event coming back again has made him dizzy to the

707
00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:02.650
point that he cannot recognize even his own bed.

708
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.150
This is what I found very moving.

709
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:07.780
He's in his own bed and he can't even recognize it.
Now.

710
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.060
He will again get out of it,

711
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.960
although we would meet him in it at the beginning of part two,

712
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.490
but not quite soon in the fiction of part two.

713
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.720
He will get out of it.

714
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.730
But a long decade later in real history,

715
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.740
I was going to wind up today by talking about link it and cartel ego,

716
00:49:29.741 --> 00:49:34.000
which we were supposed to read for today and I'm going to do very briefly,

717
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:39.160
but uh,
uh,
we will come back to be exemplary novels,
uh,

718
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.530
again,
uh,

719
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.080
to his cousin regarding quarterly or perhaps a little more and also because we

720
00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:49.450
will be reading several of them.
1613

721
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.720
is the date of the novella is a hymn Pladis called here.

722
00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:00.520
This is the edition that you're using.
I assume exemplary stories.

723
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:04.870
It's impossible to find a good title for it because no veil loss at the time

724
00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:10.130
meant short nols or long short stories.
But today we,

725
00:50:10.131 --> 00:50:13.930
if we say exemplary novels,
do you think of La longer novels?

726
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.410
Short stories that were the,

727
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.870
the term didn't really emerge until the late 18th century,

728
00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:22.900
early 19th century with the appearance of newspapers and all of that.

729
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.380
So this is why there is no way,
no good way of translating it.

730
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:31.650
And when does a Spanish speaker reads a today he's misled by the title in the

731
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:36.530
wheel as a him.
Pladis uh,
the point is,

732
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:39.350
I said Avantis became well known

733
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.460
because the Kihatha did so well and publishers were,

734
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.380
became interested in publishing his works for a change.

735
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.980
They had already fleeced him with the Kihatha,

736
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.500
so they were ready to do so again with other books.

737
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:59.330
So he was able to publish this collection of stories that as I told you in an

738
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:02.930
earlier class,
does not have the overarching fiction,

739
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.731
uh,
that,

740
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:09.731
that the camera on and other such books have all the characters leave the city

741
00:51:10.041 --> 00:51:13.880
because of the plague.
Get around or get together somewhere.

742
00:51:13.881 --> 00:51:17.690
And then each one tells a story on a different day.
This is the,
the camera on,

743
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.410
um,
uh,
fee over arching fiction.

744
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:25.970
This was an exemplary novelist.
Doesn't have that.
It is a one man show.

745
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.340
12 stories with a prologue by beginning the set of,
under this

746
00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:36.650
set of anthesis.
I have mentioned favor the long short story.
Uh,

747
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.490
like the several ones we have encountered intertwining the Quixote and

748
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:44.990
individually in the novel of the curious impertinent.
Uh,

749
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.140
and uh,
he had a few in reserve.

750
00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:53.141
Obviously us as we recall the papers that someone left at the,

751
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:58.130
in a one omega is in including at least a couple of stories by,
uh,

752
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.670
by said,
wow,
these were stories that were circulating in manuscript.

753
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:06.110
Remember that I told you that story is still segregated in manuscripts in,
in,
in,

754
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:09.980
in spite of the development of,
uh,
of,
of printing.

755
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:11.443
Uh,

756
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:17.050
in the book he collects stories with varied diverse themes and styles.

757
00:52:17.451 --> 00:52:19.940
It is like a series of narrative experiments,

758
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:23.810
some like [inaudible] or a keen to the picker risk,

759
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:29.240
others,
uh,
to the Byzantine Romance.
Others are love stories,

760
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:34.430
etc. We're going to be reading several here.
They are superb.

761
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:39.260
I think that even he of Andis had not published the Quixote.
He would still be,

762
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:43.850
will it become a major author by just this collection of short stories.

763
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.060
You'll see the glass graduate and all the others that we're going to read that

764
00:52:47.061 --> 00:52:48.760
are really excellent,
excellent.
Uh,

765
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:52.210
stories now think are not deep uncle quarterly.

766
00:52:52.211 --> 00:52:54.560
You is obviously a of a picaresque,

767
00:52:54.561 --> 00:52:59.561
thematic and ambience and it takes place in the center of picturesque life.

768
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:03.463
Sayville

769
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.780
but he does not follow the autobiographical form of the bigger ask.

770
00:53:08.781 --> 00:53:11.020
And that's said ranters made fun of through,
he needs to pass.

771
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:15.430
Amonte remember when he says,
look,
how can my life be over if,
uh,

772
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.530
having the book be over?
If my life is not over,
he's making fun of that.

773
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.160
So he does,
uh,

774
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.020
you will see that he does use it in the dialogue of the dogs at the end.

775
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:28.230
But you will see in what,
uh,
experimental,
uh,
fashion.

776
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:34.130
I to me the point is that [inaudible] don't buy the diminutive green Canadian

777
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:36.151
quarterly.

778
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:41.151
You become big curls because it is already a literary character,

779
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.320
a literary character.

780
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:50.520
Like so they become bigger as the same way that donkey hope that becomes a,

781
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:56.160
uh,
at you voluntary,
uh,
enact.
You could.
And uh,
there is,

782
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.050
there are hints of this in the,

783
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.390
in the first in when we learned that the,

784
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:06.390
the innkeeper of that first in had been a peaker and he tells stories,

785
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.150
uh,
un Un un,

786
00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.120
are we getting the sense that some of these bigger roles that the innkeeper,
uh,

787
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:19.220
assembled within those Emporio vigorous life that I mentioned had chosen the

788
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:21.103
life.

789
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:26.240
It was not that they were just simply poor boys who were out looking for a way

790
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:29.760
of living,
but that they had chosen that life that they had,

791
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:32.610
as they said in the 60s,
in this country.
They had dropped out,

792
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.680
I said were dropped out of society to become a bigger,

793
00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.910
and this is I think,
what is the case of [inaudible] and cartel,

794
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:45.570
who at the end decided not to be pickles anymore and that is the end of their

795
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:46.404
adventures.

796
00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:51.150
It is not that they go to the galleys are their nab or they have to write a

797
00:54:51.151 --> 00:54:54.240
story because they are married to the mysteries of an arch,

798
00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:58.950
a priest and so forth.
As in alluding to [inaudible],
the Torah missed.

799
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:00.901
I think that the,

800
00:55:00.901 --> 00:55:05.901
all the other very significant element here is money polios brotherhood money.

801
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.460
Paula is the chief,
uh,

802
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:13.490
criminal here who runs a whole brotherhood in very well organized fashion.

803
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.480
He's a,
again,
one of these figures of authority who is slightly ridiculous,

804
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:23.490
uh,
and he surrounded by a bevy of petty criminals,

805
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:28.680
prostitutes and pimps,
all of whom have their own features,

806
00:55:28.681 --> 00:55:30.360
physical features that,

807
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:33.660
remember when I talk about the physical features and some of these characters,

808
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:37.050
and it is not a somber,

809
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.750
sordid life that is depicted as a speaker,
as Clive and the country.

810
00:55:40.751 --> 00:55:45.150
It seems like a lot of fun.
Everybody is having fun.
The,
even the,

811
00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:49.980
even the prosecutor comes,
uh,
complaining about her,
her pimp,
uh,

812
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:54.240
beaten her up at the end.
She actually reveals that it was really an s and,

813
00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:56.450
m a Sadomasochist,

814
00:55:56.451 --> 00:56:00.220
a little mutual game sexual game that they were playing.

815
00:56:00.221 --> 00:56:04.770
So there's nothing evil in all of these.
Piggers is very much a,

816
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:08.190
so as I've told you,
even the worst characters,
uh,

817
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:13.250
have some good and I never totally evil and certainly none of these are totally

818
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:18.960
evil.
Um,
clip Alito is her pimp name and it is,

819
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:23.130
it means that he is bald probably from some venereal disease,

820
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:24.550
mean said what this deals with the,

821
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.770
with the most sorted but in a way that does not read as a sordid story.

822
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.240
And I think that,
uh,

823
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:36.540
I think also what is interesting here is that money polios Brotherhood seems

824
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:41.850
like the blueprint for society,
that it is the,
it is the,

825
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.150
the kernel of,

826
00:56:43.151 --> 00:56:47.740
of society where rules are being created and where there is a kind of self

827
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:48.600
enclosed,

828
00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:53.740
a atmosphere created by those rules as if this were the,
the,

829
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.050
the,
this was the beginning of laws.

830
00:56:56.051 --> 00:56:59.680
And the beginning of a certain mode of speech and so forth.
This is,
I think,

831
00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:02.350
what is,
uh,
uh,
behind this breeze,

832
00:57:02.351 --> 00:57:05.380
brotherhood is one of the renaissance topics about utopia.

833
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:08.740
This is a counter utopia.
And referring now to Thomas more,

834
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.470
another one of those renaissance figures that I want you to remember,

835
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.600
but you utopia.
What means is that he said,

836
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:15.340
well ordered society in which everything is,

837
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.970
everything has been thought of and advanced and there are rules and this is what

838
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:20.830
money polios brotherhood is like.

839
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:26.070
It's a counter utopia that is organized with the world rot,

840
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.770
uh,
sort of,
uh,

841
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.950
Polish of a work of fiction.

842
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.870
So we will return to this in,
uh,
our next classes,

843
00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:43.090
which class,
which will come after Tuesday's exam.
