WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.610
We are moving towards the end of part one.
Uh,

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.630
the first,
uh,
that is the 1605,
uh,
Quixote.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.410
Uh,
and as we move towards the end,
uh,
you will notice,

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.130
I'm sure you will have noticed there are the,

5
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:23.330
there are a number of returns and repetitions,

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.073
uh,

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.080
which give a density to the fiction by being crossed referenced as it were

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.650
within itself.
Uh,

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.710
meaning that there are characters who reappear and,

10
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:41.910
uh,
incidents that are,

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.420
if not repeated exactly as before,

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.990
recall previous incidents.

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.710
There are three such character and or incidents,
uh,

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.530
one of which I will discuss,
uh,
in detail.

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
And two others that I will just mention briefly here at the beginning of today's

16
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.320
lecture.
These are the galleys slaves.

17
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.840
One to two is undress,
and three is the,

18
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
the post Prandial speech.
Now,

19
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:22.050
the Galley slaves,
uh,
are,
uh,
mentioned,
uh,

20
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.220
again,
uh,

21
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.280
when the priest and the barber bring up the incident to explain their presence

22
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.580
at the indoor or the presence,
uh,
in their,

23
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.680
uh,
meeting Don Quixote.
Uh,

24
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.200
they say that they were supposedly assaulted by these,
uh,
uh,

25
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.550
free,
uh,
prisoners,
uh,
as they were on their way,

26
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.150
not the person who has brought the,
uh,
uh,
Barbara and,
uh,

27
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.030
and presets as they were on their way,
uh,

28
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.560
to collect some money sent from America.
Uh,

29
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.580
they do this to embarrass the night and to persuade him that what he has done,

30
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.490
uh,
is not right.
That in fact,
uh,

31
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.560
it is a crime that the priest gives a proper legal interpretation to Don

32
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.670
Quixote's actions.
Uh,
he,
uh,

33
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.740
has committed a crime against the crown because the galleys leaves were under

34
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.860
its jurisdiction being that they were being sent to the galleys that they were

35
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:34.550
on the road and done.
They were being guarded,
uh,

36
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.640
by agents of the crown as opposed to other branches of,
uh,

37
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.360
of justice.
And,
uh,
remember that because of regional,

38
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.240
uh,
uh,
independence,
uh,
in Spain,
uh,

39
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.670
there were various kinds of,
uh,
of,

40
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.850
of police,
but,
uh,

41
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.760
these are the galley slaves were under the purview of the crown,

42
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.290
which makes Don Quixote's crime,
uh,
much more,
uh,

43
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.240
much the worst
these repairs.

44
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.160
The second mention of the incident of the freeing of the galleys lifts,

45
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.500
which is where Gnocchi hold these in fact nabbed by the Holy Brotherhood,
uh,

46
00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:26.050
precisely for that crime.
Uh,

47
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.660
I will speak about this later,

48
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.960
but notice that the characters who are presumably out to bring don Quixote to

49
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.600
reason and go to bring him home,

50
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.880
go in and out of his madness,
uh,

51
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.840
participating and expanding it with their lies,

52
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.310
the participating and expanding with her lies his dilutions.

53
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.080
Notice that there is an elaborate lie here that the priest us come up with.

54
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.910
This is one of the larger themes of the Quixote that all those society cannot

55
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:11.131
cope with his madness because it shows the arbitrariness of laws from outside of

56
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.274
them.

57
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.200
Members of society are themselves towing a very thin line between their

58
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:25.201
compliance with societal laws and norms and acting insane,

59
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.330
insanely themselves.

60
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.620
Ultimately at,

61
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.590
and this may very well be beyond anything that's a rant,

62
00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:41.591
is intended to do the figure of Don Quixote being a mad individual questions.

63
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.661
The very core of the rules and regulations that sustain daily life don't get

64
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.200
Hortense most or regional feature as a character of fiction is his being insane.

65
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.990
It gives them a transcendence,
the certain kind of trust sentence.

66
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.280
He is the truly the first insane protagonist in western literature and there

67
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.660
have been others since,

68
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.810
but none with this kind of transcendental form of a madness,

69
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.820
so that's the first of the returns

70
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.320
to undress

71
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.590
and the rest returns.

72
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.700
Remember that undressed was a young man that was being flogged by Huang.

73
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.640
I'll do though and don't be hope to intervenes and so forth.

74
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:44.270
I'm sure you remember this episode which took place during doggy hotels.

75
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.280
First Sally and the rest returns and reveals that would know Quixote did for him

76
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.390
made his situation worse.

77
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.980
This is parallel to the mention of the Galley slaves because it up that donkey

78
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:02.660
holders actions have had the opposite effect of what he intended.

79
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.001
In both cases,

80
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:09.830
he defends himself by saying that he was upholding the laws of chivalry,

81
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.640
which are superior to the laws and costumes of the time in which he lives.

82
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.770
But the interest in detail here,

83
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.800
the significant detail here is that I'm dressed is on his way to Seville,

84
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.430
which as we now know is the center of picaresque life.

85
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.500
It's a real,
it's a center of picker risk life and you will,
uh,

86
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.900
we'll have this reinforced when you read,
uh,

87
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.170
by the next class.

88
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.320
I hope the exemplary story ring kinetic and core Collegio which takes place

89
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.600
precisely in Seville.

90
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.743
<v 1>So</v>

91
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.590
<v 0>the fact is that his return shows,</v>

92
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.233
uh,

93
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.390
or suggests retrospectively that he was Picato all along,

94
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.550
that he was probably guilty when I'll do low flogged him.

95
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.840
So these returns cast light retrospectively on the previous previous episodes,

96
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.480
as I said,

97
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.480
they established this kind of inner world of references in the fiction Santo has

98
00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:42.390
to give undressed something to get rid of him.

99
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.090
The appearance of characters,
uh,
they'll,

100
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:52.091
the reappearance of characters is a narrative device that Advantis we'll use

101
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:54.870
more frequently in part who,

102
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.750
which is a more tightly structured,

103
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.220
a novel and the return of characters is something.

104
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.290
Dot.
Some of set of Andis is,
uh,
followers in the 18th century,

105
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:11.670
like Henry fielding.
Uh,
we'll,
uh,
we'll use a,
if you have read,

106
00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:14.370
if you remember your Tom Jones for instance,

107
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.050
the third reputation is the postprandial speech.

108
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.800
This is a word that I'm sure you will never forget after this class.

109
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.410
It is in Webster's dictionary,
so he's not a enrich.

110
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.070
Our share as it may sound to you

111
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.220
is opposed.
It's an after dinner speech.
Now,
this speech about arm,

112
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.260
this is the speech about arms and letters

113
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.350
this week about arms.

114
00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:44.520
Our letters is the repetition or the near repetition of a similar previous

115
00:08:44.521 --> 00:08:48.900
incident.
As I'm sure you have noticed,
the speech of the Golden Age,

116
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.200
that donkey halted delivered to the goat hurts right before the Marcella

117
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.520
Marcella episode.

118
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.310
<v 0>This beach on arms and letters hearkens back to medieval debates like those wine</v>

120
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:09.840
against water,
clerics against nights on so forth.

121
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.660
These were,
uh,
uh,

122
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:17.810
topics for rhetorical exercises like those four topics for a debate between

123
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:23.070
debating teams.
Nowadays it was a set topic,

124
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.840
arms against letters.

125
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.190
This is the reason why don't Quixote,
uh,
delivers the speech.

126
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:33.760
One of the reasons where he delivers his speech is part of his storehouse of

127
00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:35.500
topics that he has in his mind.

128
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.490
But he's also true that Cervantes did practice both arms and letters and that he

129
00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:48.640
valued both as did don Quixote himself.

130
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.350
That topic in the speech also,
uh,

131
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:58.410
refers to utopian models of behavior rose codafide by the renaissance.

132
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.760
<v 0>The courtyard the night,</v>

134
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.150
the port or man of letters on in Spain,

135
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.180
the saint where models of department by Lazada I have rest than s out of his

136
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:18.980
name.
Belinda Sadek Castiglione,

137
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.580
uh,
who wrote a book,

138
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.070
you are getting progressively a list of important renaissance books that are,

139
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.040
that,
uh,
that you must keep in mind,
uh,
when reading as Advantis,

140
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.990
uh,
Castiglione [inaudible] is 1478,

141
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:44.991
1529 he published the book of the Courtier in 1528.

142
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:49.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.940
<v 0>It is a book in which these modes of behavior are codafide is ideal modes of</v>

144
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.654
behavior.

145
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.380
<v 0>The answer to that debate.
I mean,</v>

147
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:05.520
the result of the debate is that the idea is don't get held his own idea,

148
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.020
uh,
of a reflective man of action,
which,
uh,

149
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.100
will,
uh,

150
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.630
then following will be personified in the captain who becomes the captive in the

151
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.540
next,
uh,
tail.

152
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.470
This is the current debate between the politically committed individual and the

153
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.600
intellectual in the ivory tower to establish a,
uh,

154
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.740
a clear cut distinction.
You know,

155
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:39.741
there are these debates about whether you want to be a checking him out or you

156
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:43.350
want to be a,
a great,
uh,
intellectual.

157
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.710
Uh,
so it's,
it has a sort of a contemporary relevancy,

158
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.470
uh,
but it is essentially a topic,
uh,

159
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.670
of the Times.
Um,
now again,
the folk was,

160
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.360
is on the intersection between literature and current history between fiction

161
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:11.170
and reality are medical Castro,
who's name I am going to mention several critics.

162
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:15.340
I don't have put their names here so that you know,
uh,
how to write it.

163
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.630
I Medical Castro.

164
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

165
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.540
<v 0>Road in a book called [inaudible].</v>

166
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:30.090
Cervantes is thoughts or Toronto says a way of thinking through,

167
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.660
and this is ideas publishing 19,
25.

168
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.370
It's a book that I believe that I mentioned before,
but if I didn't,

169
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.240
it is the,

170
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.240
one of the best books are the most important books about Cervantes ever written

171
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.360
because in that book are Medical Castro dispelled the notion that set of

172
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.900
[inaudible] was as the phrase,
uh,
when,
um,

173
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.560
he may Henio level.

174
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

175
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.920
<v 0>You remember the word,</v>

176
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:08.010
the wording Henio from one of the earlier classes with examined the hen yours.

177
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.370
Remember the book by Workday,

178
00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:15.371
they sell one the doctor and remembering Henio isn't the title in Haniel.

179
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.300
So Hidalgo Don Quixote in Hanni your Lego.
That was,

180
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:24.301
that meant that Cervantes was an own learned that wit and natural that he's a

181
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.600
Toronto says,
uh,
Oh,

182
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:32.170
a hot innate ability as a great narrator and so forth.

183
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.120
He really lacked culture.
Uh,
this was a romantic idea.

184
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.390
The idea of,
of,
of the Creator who,
uh,
who,
uh,

185
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.260
who invents out of nothing,
uh,
his,
uh,
books and stories and all that.

186
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.700
Uh,
it was also a very nationalistic greeting or sort of lantus because those

187
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:50.200
critics say,
you know,
this was the,

188
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.150
this is the spirit of Spain expressing itself through Cervantes.

189
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.710
I want to go craft,
throw,
uh,
demonstrated that this was all hogwash.

190
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.371
Dot.

191
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:05.371
Cervantes was steeped in Italian Renaissance literature and thought and that

192
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.210
therefore he was no [inaudible] label at all.

193
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.900
Well,
in that book a medical culture rights,

194
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:21.070
I quote the debate between arms and letters is the harbinger of the importance

195
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.510
that learning and reason acquire over traditional life.

196
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.130
Being intellectual,

197
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.160
armed with theoretical reason is getting ready to intervene in the fate of

198
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.900
Europe unquote sort of that the intellectual,

199
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.820
uh,
arm with a theoretical reason is getting ready to intervene in the fate of

200
00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:46.070
Europe.
In other words,

201
00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:51.071
government will not be just left in the hands of kings and aristocrats who's in

202
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:56.621
ruling countries was based on traditional knowledge and practice passed down by

203
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.550
a tradition.
But the practice of government,
uh,

204
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.350
is becoming the object of serious and sustained reflection.

205
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.690
It is the birth of political science as a discipline that we are witnessing

206
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.290
witnessing in the 16th century.
And that it is reflected in donkey Hotez speech.

207
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.920
Uh,
in this regard.

208
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.980
The figure to keep in mind is Niccolo Machiavelli,

209
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:32.000
Niccolo Machiavelli 50 14,
69,

210
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:35.360
15,
27,
and his famous treaty school,

211
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.380
he'd bring cheaper the prince,
which was written in 15,

212
00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:42.680
13 and published in 1532,

213
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:48.000
which is really the founding work of political science.
I know that you,

214
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.440
you may have a vague idea about Machiavelli mostly centered on the cliche that

215
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.850
the urns justify the means and so forth.

216
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:59.630
I'm sure you heard that and attributed as a machiavellian idea.

217
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.960
Uh,
but his book is much more than that.
It's very complicated,

218
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.250
complex and influential and important.

219
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.090
One of my Cavelli's models by the way,
was Ferdinand of Aragon,

220
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:18.170
whom you have met extensively while reading your Elliott

221
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.810
for a cunning ruler when you,
uh,

222
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:30.070
how to apply the rules of government Castro ads with regards to,

223
00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:36.200
uh,
uh,
don't get notice.
Speech by the way,
got Troy is a very common last name.

224
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:41.201
He has nothing to do with the Castro cast room in,

225
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.000
in Latin meant a military encampment.

226
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.980
So therefore it was very easy for there to be many catheters in Spanish.

227
00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:52.280
So that's why so many of them,
um,

228
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.930
gastro ads with regards to donkey hotels,
speech,
he says the following,

229
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.180
I want to quote a medico catheter again.
He says,

230
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.410
we are again faced with the essentially serve antionne dualism,
epic,

231
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.440
heroic fantasy versus reason and reflexive criticism at a point in his speech,

232
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.310
donkey heartaches claims.

233
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:14.690
But let us leave this aside because it is a labyrinth with no easy exit,

234
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.050
the fulcrum of Cervantes soul,

235
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.690
where both planes intersect.

236
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:25.691
Each other heroic fantasy and reasonable effort belongs to both those,

237
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.410
this theme dwells within him.
I'm still pulling a medical.

238
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:35.411
Castro dwells within Savantas being of a primarily formalistic neck nature,

239
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.590
but it is also the mold for the sociological preoccupations of the renaissance

240
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.133
or

241
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.410
however don Quixote does favor arms over letters as he says.

242
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.470
The fact is that he has just won the battle with the giant of which the speech

243
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.400
is a kind of celebration.

244
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.250
So he opt for arms,
uh,
over letters,

245
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.860
uh,
perhaps,
uh,

246
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.370
perhaps with Cervantes himself who always had a fondness for his life as a

247
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:15.300
soldier,

248
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.920
as you no doubt noticed in reading the tail of the captive.

249
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.430
So we get back to our speech,
um,
dinners topic.

250
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.650
This is the second again.
I said postprandial speech by Don Quixote.

251
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.260
The first was concerned with the golden age,

252
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.270
the Russian critic on Theoretician Mihail Bactine who won't have mentioned

253
00:18:40.271 --> 00:18:44.110
before.
And I forgot to put his name,
but I'll put it again.

254
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.080
This is all of course an approximation.

255
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.420
There's name from the Russian.

256
00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.890
<v 1>Don't confuse him with this guy's Mikhail Bakhtin</v>

257
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.860
<v 0>in his book,
[inaudible]</v>

258
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.510
gives a great deal of importance to dinners because his metaphor for the novel,

259
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.360
well,
what the novel is like,
Eh,

260
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.340
is the dialogue and dinners are essentially dialogic.

261
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.710
His,
uh,
uh,

262
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:27.540
there is a book on Bactine called the dialogic back teens dialogic imagination.

263
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:33.100
Now Francois [inaudible].
Oh,

264
00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:37.230
I see.
Yeah.
Francois [inaudible] is yet another renaissance figure.

265
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:41.760
You must keep in mind he was French for a change,
not Italian,

266
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.470
and lived between 1494 and 1553.

267
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:51.471
He wrote this outrageous stories about Gargantua and punter grow cause you may

268
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:54.750
have heard about,
um,

269
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.760
then writes the following that I cannot resist quoting,

270
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:04.570
but Kim wrote a with a great deal of verb and,
uh,

271
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.510
uh,

272
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.520
about elements of popular culture that were incorporated into,

273
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.950
into literature.
He says,

274
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.180
I think he learned a lot from [inaudible].

275
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.180
So much so that he doesn't write about Cervantes because he may have been

276
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.073
redundant.

277
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.790
Eating and drinking are one of the most significant manifestations of the

278
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:31.120
grotesque body.
He's talking about the body,
the Gore Tex bodies of this,

279
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.120
of these characters in
the distant.

280
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.200
The distinctive character of this body is it's open on finished nature.

281
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.660
It's interaction with the world.
You can think of Saint Joe here,

282
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:51.760
these traits are most fully and concretely revealed in the act of eating.

283
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:57.100
The body transgressors here,
his own limits,
it swallows,

284
00:20:57.101 --> 00:21:02.101
devours wrens the world apart is they're enriched and grows the world's expense

285
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.680
you encounter of man with the world which takes place inside the open,

286
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.590
uh,

287
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:16.590
counter don't know which takes place inside the open biking rending chewing

288
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:22.300
mouth.
I'm going to read that sentence again as we got and I got my mouth,

289
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:23.960
got a little,
uh,

290
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.430
the encounter of man with the world which takes place inside the open biting

291
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:34.471
rending jury mouth is one of the most ancient and most important objects of

292
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:38.890
human thought and imagery here.
Man.

293
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:42.700
Tastes the world,
introduces it into his body,

294
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.410
makes it part of himself.
Mine's awakening consciousness.

295
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:51.970
Could not,
but concentrate on this moment could not help.
Borrowing from it.

296
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.970
A number of substantial images determining its interrelation with the world man

297
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:02.320
counter with the world in the act of eating is joyful,
triumphant.

298
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.510
He triumphs over the world,
devours it without being devoured himself.

299
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.960
The limits between man and the world that erased two man's advantage on quote,

300
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.130
if you can see in all of this,
in all of the scenes of eating,

301
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.980
of which there will be many more in the,
in part to uh,
uh,

302
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.800
particularly sanctuary is involved,
uh,
in this,
uh,
uh,
uh,

303
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.570
joyful away.
Uh,

304
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.170
the barrier between me and reality is broken when I incorporate reality into

305
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.700
myself.
Make it a part of myself like eating it.

306
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.670
And this is what is celebrated in this Postprandial,
uh,

307
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.010
speeches.
Uh,
uh,

308
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:49.030
for Bactine dinners are the privilege,
location for dialogue,

309
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.080
dinner,
celebrate the end of work and the defeat of the world,

310
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.340
which is in fact consumed animals,
vegetables,
wine,

311
00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:59.020
which is like the blood of the earth.

312
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.300
Wind loosens the tongs and the truth comes out on garden.

313
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.290
Remember that phrase,

314
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:08.640
the Latin phrase that I taught you before in we know ready us.

315
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.200
Why?
Uh,
Plato's symposium on,
I'm sure you have read,

316
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.790
uh,
and it's called really the banquet,
the last supper,

317
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:23.791
all mark ritual locations where the truth is to be spoken over food or after

318
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:29.530
food.
There are of course,
two other,
uh,
uh,

319
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.390
uh,
functions of the mouth that are not mentioned here.

320
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.200
Uh,
but the dual occasionally come into,
uh,
uh,

321
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.340
the erotic and the aggressive,
the erotic.
I don't have to,

322
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.170
and I won't go into here,
but it's too obvious.
Uh,

323
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.290
the aggressive of course,
uh,
the bite,
uh,
to spit.

324
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.660
And as we have seen in an earlier episode episode to vomit on somebody else as

325
00:23:56.661 --> 00:24:00.800
we saw in the dialogue of vomit after the episode of the,

326
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.690
of the sheep.
So,
uh,
this is,
uh,
uh,
I am,
I am,

327
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.250
uh,
I am assuming you're back Tinian uh,
sort of,
uh,

328
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.180
uh,
uh,

329
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.880
persona as I make these comments because he was so interested in this,

330
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.800
in this bodily functions.

331
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.970
So the truth has prevailed in the resolution of all the conflicts and Don

332
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.050
Quixote celebrates,
uh,
with his speech and he,

333
00:24:31.051 --> 00:24:34.200
the madman has been the vehicle of that resolution.

334
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:40.260
There's speech also serves as the transition to the captives tale in which,

335
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.670
uh,
which will be narrating episodes of war,

336
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.770
uh,

337
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:51.030
to corroborate a donkey halters ideas.

338
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.720
In fact,
uh,
uh,

339
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.760
the captive stale will narrate that battle called the battle of Lepanto who's

340
00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:05.570
anniversary we are celebrating tomorrow.

341
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.780
The Battle of Lepanto occurred one October 7th,

342
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.990
1571.
So this is what I told you in the last year,

343
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:21.050
end of last lecture to ponder and see if you could come up with what anniversary

344
00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:24.660
was being celebrated this week.
It is the battle of Lepanto.

345
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:31.530
This suggestion was that once the various conflicts were resolved,
donkey hotter,

346
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.310
celebrated by his speech on arms and letters through Bactine,

347
00:25:35.311 --> 00:25:37.650
we concluded that this was a moment of truth,

348
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.740
ironically represented through the scene of the dinner.

349
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.910
There seems to be a whole tendency in the Quixote as we approach the end towards

350
00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:50.730
the truth

351
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.270
that culminates in the story of the captive,

352
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.260
which is based on [inaudible] own life on episodes of recent Spanish history.

353
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:08.750
But more importantly,
episodes in which Cervantes was present.

354
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.940
Good.
Servantez circling back to himself,

355
00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:18.700
be a part of this move towards the truth.

356
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:26.580
Is it a shift away from literary stories?
Uh,

357
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.450
do stories based on his own life?

358
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.760
And what does that mean?
As [inaudible] has said,

359
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.900
this is the second critic.
I am,
uh,
mentioning,
uh,

360
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.370
he's my friend.
He was my colleague at Cornell.
And of course,

361
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.810
Moron doesn't mean more on a,
as it does in a,
an English.

362
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.370
Uh,
so it is perfectly okay to have such a last name in Spanish,

363
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:57.000
although for poor said Yacko whom I love very much.

364
00:26:57.001 --> 00:27:00.930
It's been retirement now in Spain.
It was the by the bane of his existence.

365
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:05.870
When professors,
when the students are Cornell,
said,
I'm going to morons class.
Uh,

366
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.740
but what could he do?
Uh,

367
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.690
well he mostly went down by [inaudible] Adderall.
You,
I wrote,

368
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.320
you have means brook.
So some more.
In any case,

369
00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.540
see the ACO model and I don't know you taste this event.

370
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.400
This has moved to create art with the truth to create art out of lived

371
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.970
experience.
Of course we might add here.

372
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.610
That's an event as a self,

373
00:27:28.611 --> 00:27:33.611
as author has been presented as a sort of thin and biggers and shifting fiction,

374
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.540
uh,
and that would stand behind it are these snippets of autobiographical,

375
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.640
uh,
revelation,

376
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.310
a underlined by these self solutions like those two,

377
00:27:45.311 --> 00:27:50.311
his pastoral romance lag Galatia in the scrutiny of the books episode and to

378
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.110
link Canadian Cortadito as donkey hotel leaves lives in.

379
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.970
This is the story of reading for next Thursday.
Everything is,
is,
is,
is,

380
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.700
is made to,
uh,
to,
uh,
to be coordinated in this course.

381
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.950
This a story of [inaudible],

382
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.180
which the innkeeper says is among the papers.
Somebody there left.

383
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.330
I wonder who that somebody would be,
uh,

384
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.320
will be included in the exemplary novels,
the book that you have,

385
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.330
and you will be reading that story for next Thursday.

386
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.980
So this is one of those snippets of,
uh,
uh,
uh,

387
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:29.360
uh,
uh,
uh,
Ellucian's to,
uh,

388
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:34.410
himself,
the real author of the keyhole.
So the,

389
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:38.610
the captive stale is the combination of the group of intertwined stories,

390
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.620
not the quite the last one,
but it is the combination of the,
uh,

391
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.380
group of intertwined stories.
Uh,

392
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.440
it is wining in which religious conversion incubates a synthesis of contraries.

393
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.120
That's our past is not just social barriers,

394
00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.900
but even to sense the neoplatonic convergence,

395
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.890
typical of renaissance plot.
Uh,
this is,
uh,

396
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.330
I will unpack this in,
in other words,

397
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.210
this story entails not just an unequal marriage,

398
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.630
that is social inequality,
social,
uh,

399
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.430
uh,
uh,
clash,
uh,

400
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.150
but in marriage that crosses racial and religious boundaries.

401
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.580
So the union at the end,
it's not just the neoplatonic union of Renaissance,
uh,

402
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.150
uh,
ideas,
uh,
uh,

403
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.390
these union through love.
Uh,

404
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.720
but it is kind of,
uh,
uh,

405
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.080
I mean it's a more on a Muslim and risk.
Paris,

406
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.900
the Vietnamese a Spaniard and a Christian,
uh,
their,

407
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:50.460
their union is more trusting dental,
uh,

408
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.480
because it involves a union of these two,
uh,
religions.
Uh,

409
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.770
the Kale I maintained could be seen as the counterpart of 16th century Spanish

410
00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:08.281
mystical poetry in which courtly love about which I've spoken at length here.

411
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:18.090
And petrarchan converge conventions are adapted to express religious fervor and

412
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:23.800
union,
not merely with the beloved but with God in Spanish.
Mystical poetry.

413
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.190
Uh,
the desire for union is not just with the beloved,

414
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:29.200
it is the desire for union with God.

415
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.660
I'm alluding here mostly to the poetry of Saint John of the cross,

416
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.000
1542,
15,

417
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:42.001
91 and mystic and one of the greatest parts of the golden age of any age.

418
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:52.220
The concluding a.
So what I'm saying is that this,
this,
uh,

419
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.270
capitis,
stale with is a fusion.
Uh,

420
00:30:55.271 --> 00:31:00.190
these religious fusion is sort of akin to this mystic poetry in the Spain of a

421
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.690
16,
uh,
sanctuary.

422
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.430
And it is a combination of all these stories because it is much more trust and

423
00:31:05.431 --> 00:31:08.800
dental what is going to be overcome.
It's much more transcendental

424
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.430
now.
That is a,
as you will see at the end,

425
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:16.630
they're concluding an unfinished story of one we that I a a who was a kind of

426
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:21.190
minor don't want and Leandra who's a bit of a fool,

427
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.530
uh,
and uh,

428
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:29.130
is unfinished because it's resolution would a convergence with the end of the

429
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:35.570
novel.
And uh,
of course the current event,
uh,

430
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.390
cannot have a,
an end because it is current and ongoing.

431
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.050
So that's why that story is left,
is left on finished.

432
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:47.230
But that is one that we will probably talk about in the next class because it

433
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.770
really very near the very end of the,
uh,

434
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.150
of the novel and I mentioning,
uh,
mentioning it,
uh,

435
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.460
she was so as not to leave any of these stories on my,

436
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:03.460
now the captives tail falls,
the traditional formula.

437
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:08.200
It has like a biblical residences.
The protocol song,

438
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.390
the father who sets his on off to life.
And remember here we learn,

439
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.110
uh,
we encounter that Iglesia Mar or reality,

440
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:22.050
a saying that I mentioned that the young man to go to the,

441
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.910
if you particularly if he doesn't,
it's not an aristocrat.
Uh,

442
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.420
he should be joined the church,
uh,

443
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:33.160
go out to seed so you get venture or join the retinue or the how of a great,

444
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.970
uh,
uh,
aristocrat or if possible,
the king.

445
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.520
Um,
this story illuminates retrospectively that of,

446
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.390
uh,
of Don Fernando.

447
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:50.750
It has provoked controversy among critics because of his religious,
uh,

448
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.090
background.
Uh,

449
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.080
Francisco Marquez Bigger Noya who was a professor at Harvard,
uh,

450
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.930
for many years and is also my,
he's retired now in Seville.

451
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.650
Um,
and uh,
who was also my friend,

452
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.240
but he was no friend of [inaudible].
You will see,
uh,
they were there,

453
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:15.400
debated over this,
uh,
uh,
story.
Uh,

454
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.380
mark and eny claims,
for instance,
according to [inaudible] dot.

455
00:33:22.381 --> 00:33:26.670
Soraida a typically serve Antionne character like Marcella and Dorothea

456
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.990
exercises,
her desire for freedom within a religious context,

457
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.680
but is not motivated by religion per say,

458
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.130
religion.
I,

459
00:33:38.131 --> 00:33:42.900
he becoming a Christian merely allows her to be free even at the expense of

460
00:33:42.901 --> 00:33:47.160
bringing grief to her father.
Uh,
he,
apple,
uh,
which I,

461
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.490
I noticed that in your translation is conflated as a,
he bought apple.

462
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.410
It's the Spanish is he more out the

463
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.783
door?

464
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

465
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.760
<v 0>Monaro your claims on the contrary,</v>

466
00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:09.610
that the whole tale takes place within a very precise,

467
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.580
within very precise theological guidelines,

468
00:34:12.581 --> 00:34:16.630
which she presents by quoting mostly from Saint Thomas Aquinas.

469
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:23.020
His point is that the issue of baptism is dealt with in a very strict

470
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.280
theological way.

471
00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:29.610
So rather has not been baptized as the cup says because he has not been in

472
00:34:30.161 --> 00:34:35.110
mortal danger and the baptism of adults in the Catholic church should take place

473
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.940
after they're learning about the faith except if faced by a life threatening

474
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.541
danger.

475
00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:45.541
So if [inaudible] observes that this has been very closely followed in the,

476
00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:47.650
in the book,
the same is true,

477
00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:52.000
he maintains regarding songwriters use of her father's wealth and her leaving

478
00:34:52.001 --> 00:34:57.001
him behind in grief conversion to the Christian faith justify doing violence to

479
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.060
nature.
That used to say to relatives,
he could quote,

480
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.810
I quote a CDR Comodo tomorrow your conversion to Christianity justified any

481
00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:11.800
break with natural relations of kingship if this came into conflict with the

482
00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:16.801
duty to convert that anyone who had learned of Christian doctrine had unquote

483
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.900
all the sounds plausible,

484
00:35:19.901 --> 00:35:23.980
but it is hard to imagine surroundings as a theologian and wanting to mediate

485
00:35:23.981 --> 00:35:27.730
between these two
span here

486
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.310
it is difficult to imagine is a this as a theologian and much less as a

487
00:35:33.311 --> 00:35:36.430
scholastic theologian.
What is reflecting here?

488
00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:39.640
I think it just simply the mores of the time,
uh,

489
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.480
which were of course are Catholic.

490
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.440
Um,
now modern Raju is much more persuasive,
persuasive.

491
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:54.441
It seems to me when he compares a hemo to Othello after the ladder first

492
00:35:55.050 --> 00:36:00.050
threatens Soraida and later a later pleads with her in that very dramatic scene

493
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:04.210
when they leave him behind.
He says,

494
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.890
the scene in which all these develops is one of the great achievements of world

495
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:10.980
literature and the input of both to curse,

496
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.050
insult and also to cry and plead sort of antithesis has portrayed a man,

497
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.130
a real man.
I'm quoting,
uh,
meaning,
uh,

498
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.550
he's referring to a very scene,
the very dramatic scene as well,

499
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:25.500
the most dramatic scene in the whole of part one.

500
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

501
00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.150
<v 0>Uh,
[inaudible] is also good when he says a court.</v>

502
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:34.160
I agree with Spitzer's definition of servant Ian Perspectivism.

503
00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:38.540
If you haven't gotten there,
you will.
You've got to,
you're the Spitzer piece,

504
00:36:38.541 --> 00:36:43.060
which is I think the best and most important in my case book.
Um,

505
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.870
<v 1>okay.</v>

506
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:49.220
<v 0>In terms of moral,
how morals,
however Cervantes is in no way a perspective is,</v>

507
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.761
he says,

508
00:36:49.761 --> 00:36:54.761
and in a node he adds [inaudible] perhaps we ought to point out here that

509
00:36:55.581 --> 00:36:56.420
perspective is him,

510
00:36:56.421 --> 00:37:01.340
is inherent in Christian thought prospective is him in the sense of a form of

511
00:37:01.341 --> 00:37:05.750
modesty that recognizes the limits of old judgment and human knowledge is indeed

512
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.400
Christian humility and intelligence in its strictest sense,

513
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.490
the capacity to perceive the limit of our own creations.
Iuo Neha,

514
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:18.620
then he puts in the,
the word in the Greek,
the original word for Iraq or Iran.

515
00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.030
But yeah.
Moraga ro,
you said his best when he points out,

516
00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.360
referring to one critic goal.
Salus Lopez,

517
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.920
I find magnificent.
His observation that the marriage between the captive store,

518
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.330
either the new Christian is accepted by the audience of the [inaudible],

519
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.400
by the [inaudible] of the judge with no allusion to the impurity of blood that

520
00:37:39.531 --> 00:37:42.950
could resolve from it.
And this is true,
once you convert to Christianity,

521
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:48.250
there is no impediment for them to marry and there is no stigma attached to

522
00:37:48.261 --> 00:37:48.980
their issue.

523
00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.980
Although of course there were in the span of the time a stigmas attached to

524
00:37:55.671 --> 00:37:58.910
having more reach or Jewish,
uh,
a blog.
But here,

525
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:01.610
there is no inkling of it at all.

526
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.820
And he also,
he's also very good.

527
00:38:05.821 --> 00:38:09.480
I think when he points out the Lingua Franca of Burberry is the most beautiful

528
00:38:09.481 --> 00:38:13.380
expression of the efforts to communicate in that confused world.

529
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:18.450
The story of the captive demonstrates without any doubt that that primeval state

530
00:38:18.451 --> 00:38:22.830
of communication in which human beings created language if there is none.

531
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.210
Algiers is an experiment with secular communication.
The renegade,

532
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:32.580
uh,
love and language are fundamental forms of expression,

533
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:37.600
meaning the renegade,
uh,
on all of these characters speak these mangrove,

534
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.830
quote unquote language made up of all of the languages.
And that,
uh,

535
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.980
he says it's an a form over the expression of this human,
uh,
overcoming,
of,

536
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.400
of,
uh,
uh,
of,
of linguistic barriers by,
uh,

537
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.370
by,
uh,
me,

538
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:57.700
but because of their love and their desire to communicate with each other.

539
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.960
I,
in terms of the cavities,
I would emphasize,

540
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.030
I would emphasize that.

541
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:09.050
So [inaudible] is a woman of action that she is indeed very much like Dota.

542
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.550
I mean,
she's the one who work,
orchestrates their whole thing,

543
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.450
who gets the money for the escape and so forth.

544
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.490
She's not doterra who chooses her destiny in,

545
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.410
in her are a combined the figures of the renegade and the saint and the

546
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:28.570
seductress and a hemo.

547
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:33.571
Datto is perhaps the most dramatic and well rounded secondary character of part

548
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:39.100
one.
Uh,
he's this pair and losing his daughter,

549
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:44.101
his plea to her vowing to accept her and his bowing to et Cetera back in her own

550
00:39:44.411 --> 00:39:48.340
terms is full of pastors and of tragic death.
In this,

551
00:39:48.341 --> 00:39:53.341
I agree with [inaudible] and underline the fact that this is a very important

552
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.980
character in park one.
Perhaps,
as I said,

553
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.380
the most important second character,

554
00:39:59.381 --> 00:40:04.120
the most dramatic perhaps of the whole book parts one and two included.

555
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:09.760
Now we moved to a
very strange episode.

556
00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:13.900
I want to move to a very strange episode,
dokey.
How the hanging from the window,

557
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.060
uh,

558
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.400
that it is a very strange episode for which I have,
uh,
uh,

559
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.520
an explanation of sorts.
I have never been able to explain to myself,
uh,

560
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.970
this episode,
which is of course,
I mean Marty [inaudible] and the innkeepers,
uh,

561
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.890
daughter having fun at the expense of a,
of donkey holder.

562
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.050
Remember that don't get how they have been aroused by the innkeepers daughter

563
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.140
and that he had actually grab Marie tonyism,

564
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.040
pulled her into bed baths,
Marilyn Hall and all of that.

565
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:47.690
So they are in a sense,
uh,

566
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:51.610
are getting back at him here in this,
uh,
uh,

567
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:56.730
rather cruel with this rather cruel joke of having him hanging from,

568
00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.170
uh,
from the window.

569
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.670
This seems to be a distorted version,

570
00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:05.980
a perversion of the part of Mary Therese and incubators,

571
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:11.130
daughter's daughter of scenes in the cavities tail as if every important episode

572
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:14.650
had to be projected in a different register.

573
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.140
Follow me in this if you will.

574
00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:22.170
I don't have to persuade you at the bank knew or remember most of the call the

575
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:27.410
area where the captives are kept.
The captain,

576
00:41:27.411 --> 00:41:31.840
he sees a hand through a window.
Remember he sees the hand sort.

577
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.810
I that turns out.
Um,
um,

578
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:39.830
there is an exchange of messages with that hand through that high window,

579
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.530
the window in the Henry up here in this episode,

580
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.110
the relationship was no connection to the a in the action in the plot.

581
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.560
It is to simply a remembered image to me is like a symphonic Motif motif

582
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.630
repeated and expanded upon in a different key.

583
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:08.240
I don't know if I can convince you of this,
but it's the only way that I can,
uh,

584
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.110
uh,

585
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:14.110
explain this episode that there are echoes and remembrances of this window on

586
00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:18.020
this hand and all that they appear here.
And again,

587
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:22.370
it's like a musical motif in us in a,
in a,
in a symphony that is repeated.

588
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.890
Otherwise,
it's simply another act of cruelty against don't,

589
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:30.200
Quixote of which are quite a few,
uh,
throughout,
uh,
the book.

590
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.790
And,
uh,

591
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.970
you can make all kinds of symbolic and allegorical readings of it that he's

592
00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:38.060
hanging from the window and use feed.
I just barely touching the ground.

593
00:42:38.061 --> 00:42:40.010
It can't quite touch it.
And I,

594
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:44.140
and in a way you could say that that is Don Quixote's,
uh,
uh,

595
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.650
state in the world that he's in me.
They're just barely touching,
uh,

596
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.410
uh,
uh,
the,
the ground with his feet and all of that as possible.

597
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.520
Uh,
but I proposed this reading of it,
uh,

598
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.050
as bizarre as it may be an interpretation.

599
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:08.160
Now,
I said at the end of my last lecture,
uh,

600
00:43:08.161 --> 00:43:11.870
and I repeat it today,
that we are coming to the end of part one.

601
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:17.290
Don't forget that Cervantes had no idea at this point that he would write a part

602
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.633
two.

603
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:24.770
So this would be the conclusion of the novel that he began to write.

604
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.890
Probably as we saw,
he began to write the novel,
uh,

605
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.080
after donkey hotels,

606
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:37.940
second Sally after the scrutiny of the books and he's having engaged Santiago at

607
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:42.890
his squire
because the two parts are bound together.

608
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:46.370
You may not have the sense that you're coming to an end because you have another

609
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:47.990
big chunk of book to read,

610
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.190
but this is the end of part one that we are coming to.

611
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:57.310
And it was the end of the novels around run this set out to write or be wound up

612
00:43:57.561 --> 00:43:58.394
writing.

613
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:03.500
Now the sense of endings in fiction is crucial.

614
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.620
As Frank Kermode established in his wonderful book,

615
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:11.510
the sense of an ending that I recommend to everyone,
Frank Kermode,

616
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.720
k,
e,
r,
m,
O,
d,

617
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.420
e serve Frank Kermode by now

618
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.150
the ending inviters to read retrospectively into the story that precedes it and

619
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:28.151
suggest an author's conception of history and of the loop of life as it were,

620
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:34.210
as his characters meet benign or violent deaths as conflicts are resolved and as

621
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:39.831
a feeling of completion is felt by the reader in Aristotle's poetics about which

622
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:45.440
we'll be talking soon.
When we meet the Canon of Toledo,
it's,

623
00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:50.280
Eh,
the poetics established how parks should be ordered,

624
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.140
linking beginnings with ends and bolts with Middles Cervantes had that in mind,

625
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:59.550
but also the endings of chivalric romances and picaresque novels in which

626
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:03.670
deployed essentially followed the development of the hero's life,
uh,

627
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.450
from birth to death to death or,
uh,

628
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.960
to the point at which the bigger we'll began to write,

629
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:13.410
which involve the death and resurrection,
you know,
a conversion.

630
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.870
But the Quixote is neither,
uh,
in fact,
it will,

631
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.400
it is not actually very dramatic.
It's not a picaresque,
it was totally new.

632
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.820
At best it could be said,
and I repeat this,

633
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.460
that it is the parody of which evaluate romance,

634
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.840
hence deliberately as we deliberately distorted version of it.

635
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:34.951
As such,

636
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:38.980
it is a kind of Metta to evaluate romance that you've all read romance about
you.

637
00:45:38.981 --> 00:45:43.981
I'll can romances so ending it will be no easy matter for Savantas as we shall

638
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:50.010
see at least two strands of the plot.
Uh,

639
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.070
two stories within,
within the,
uh,
uh,
uh,
two strands of the plot,

640
00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.610
uh,
are closed in episodes,
uh,

641
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.550
at one Palo Meccas in,
uh,

642
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:07.790
this is done by appealing to the judicial or legal casts of the novel.

643
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.230
We just,
as we have seen involves the perpetration of crimes,

644
00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:18.231
has ms and misdemeanors by the protagonist band and by the implied or actual

645
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:22.530
presence of representatives of the state,
in this case,
the crown.

646
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:28.130
So the first sort of conclusion or conclusions that we have here have to do with

647
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:31.440
rest solutions,
restorations,

648
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.430
and the capture and arrest of Don Quixote.

649
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:40.620
I pause here to explain why this turn to the legal,

650
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:46.020
which I have explained in further detail in my book called law and the law

651
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.640
instead of antis published by Yale press on which is in your bibliography and of

652
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:55.641
which I'll give you a very brief synopsis here so that you can understand why I

653
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:59.910
read these endings and the endings of these episodes in this fashion.

654
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:03.900
I have maintained in that book,
uh,

655
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:09.530
that the picaresque and hence Samantha's is Nawbo reflects the importance of the

656
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:15.381
elaboration of a dense and complicated legal system in 16th century Spain.

657
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:19.260
You may have observed some of this while reading Eliot,

658
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:24.830
this increase was part in due to the development of the printing press,

659
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:32.150
which made the issuance and dissemination of laws much easier and also the

660
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:38.101
development of a modern state organized as a bureaucracy to administer the

661
00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:44.011
precariously United peninsula and his vast overseas and pyre.

662
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

663
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:47.630
<v 0>If you have read Eliot,</v>

664
00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.620
you understand that Spain's was a modern state in the make.

665
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:56.930
Normally Americans have a sense of Spain or some as backward,
but no,

666
00:47:56.931 --> 00:47:59.360
Spain here was at the forefront of history.

667
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.670
This situation brought about the creation and maintenance of state archives in

668
00:48:05.671 --> 00:48:10.470
which myriads of cases both criminal and civil work kept on classified.

669
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:16.140
The distinction,
criminal and civil was not quite established a search,

670
00:48:16.141 --> 00:48:21.141
although in practice it was a criminal case is a criminal act is,

671
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:25.650
is against the state.
In this case against the crown.

672
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.940
A civil crime is committed against somebody else.
Another person.

673
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.970
<v 1>So,
uh,</v>

674
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.330
<v 0>the archive was a form of state control containing many stories from which the</v>

675
00:48:39.331 --> 00:48:44.331
picaresque novel derived or drew it's cases like the one involved in la,

676
00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.680
sorry,
Joe and Guzman.
[inaudible].

677
00:48:46.681 --> 00:48:50.970
Your story is like a deposition given to a judge to justify his present

678
00:48:50.971 --> 00:48:54.960
predicament.
He is the husband of an arch priests,

679
00:48:55.050 --> 00:49:00.050
ministers legal discourse made possible the minute description of the real as

680
00:49:02.461 --> 00:49:04.020
opposed to renaissance.

681
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:09.170
John was like the pastoral which gave an ideal,
uh,

682
00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:14.190
description of the world.
Legal discourse is in my theory,

683
00:49:14.191 --> 00:49:18.570
the foundation of the novel and narrative that deals in the beginning,

684
00:49:18.571 --> 00:49:23.571
mostly with criminals like [inaudible] and continues to deal with criminals.

685
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.760
And that describes a,

686
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.210
as only legal documents can describe,
uh,

687
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.260
the business of everyday life.

688
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.280
The intertwined stories of part one involving legal issues,

689
00:49:38.281 --> 00:49:40.680
mostly focusing on testamentary law,

690
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:44.070
read like cases taken out of those archives,

691
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.610
not so then oval of the curious in pattern isn't pertinent.

692
00:49:47.611 --> 00:49:52.611
That is obviously drawn from renaissance literature in his protagonist who is a

693
00:49:53.731 --> 00:49:55.200
fugitive from justice,

694
00:49:55.201 --> 00:50:00.160
an outlaw set of antisense created the first important novelistic protagonists

695
00:50:00.161 --> 00:50:02.640
drawn from the archive as it were.

696
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.760
His is the case of the insane.

697
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.800
He go who set out to act out chivalric fantasies and in the process committed a

698
00:50:11.851 --> 00:50:15.180
series of crimes.
He is the first,

699
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:17.140
<v 1>okay</v>

700
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.200
<v 0>hero fugitive from justice in the western tradition</v>

701
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.781
in the process,

702
00:50:22.781 --> 00:50:27.590
Atlanta's uses settings like the desk poblano that I have explained here.

703
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:33.550
A drone from Spanish law and in the Holy Brotherhood has drawn into the fiction,

704
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:38.370
the police of the times,
the depiction of a real world for say,

705
00:50:38.371 --> 00:50:43.371
Advantis involved at world health together precariously by the law and whose

706
00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:49.301
representation could not be accomplished without recourse to legal language and

707
00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:51.194
concepts.

708
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:56.810
All of the situations and the Quixote are framed within legal discourse.

709
00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.890
This is the reason why endings begin with resolutions,

710
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.280
restorations on the capture of don't haughty to get back to uh,

711
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:11.650
these endings that I'm going to now describe and analyze his partial endings.

712
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.130
The episodes at the end,
towards the end of part one are the climax of the,

713
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.610
of the first Quixote.
Don't get hold.

714
00:51:18.611 --> 00:51:22.100
This defeat of Panda Filando is the culmination of his adventures.

715
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.170
He's most resounding feet,

716
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:28.790
these adventurous where all the humor and in spite of donkey halters ridiculous

717
00:51:28.791 --> 00:51:32.270
behavior I successful in bringing about peace.

718
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.640
Dorothea admits as much donkey Holtec is not an angelic Beatrice whom the

719
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:43.100
pilgrim meets in the divine comedy towards the end of Purgatorio as he read it,

720
00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:48.110
read is to enter Paradiso neuron epic hero like an els who winds up founding

721
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:49.424
Rome.

722
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.080
But he does bring about peace and justice in the world that it has been his lot

723
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.280
to be thrown into.
This is,
as I have said earlier,

724
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:03.200
part of the overall irony of the book does such a preposterous figure is the

725
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:06.740
agent of providence through his intervention.
Don't,

726
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:11.060
Fernando agrees to marry Doterra and make good on the promise that he made her

727
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:15.020
the night he stolen to her room and the flowered her swearing to become her

728
00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:16.630
husband.
Uh,

729
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:21.670
Lucinda is returned to Cardinia who had been wrong both by her and by Don

730
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:23.720
Fernando crossed the marriage vows,

731
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:27.290
bringing this conflicts to a hoppy comedy like ending,

732
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.800
but such elevated kind of justice is not the only kind of finale that takes

733
00:52:32.991 --> 00:52:34.100
place at the end.

734
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.650
Resolution also takes place at a legal level in the most concrete and my newt

735
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:44.510
fashion as restitution is made to those who have suffered injuries or damages

736
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.520
and are owed money as a result,

737
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:52.040
don't Fernando on the priest compensate the second barber and the innkeeper who

738
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:55.820
had been complaining about all the destruction and whose business not to mention

739
00:52:55.821 --> 00:52:59.000
the consumption by the night and his choir and their mouths.

740
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:04.850
The second barber had had his base in stolen and dented and his donkey and he

741
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:06.680
drank.
His harness had been stolen.

742
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:12.040
Financial institutions such as these are a form of closure drawn from the law.

743
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:18.200
It is what making whole make means.

744
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:20.540
In current legal terminology.

745
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:23.780
An individual is brought back to the state,

746
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:26.790
he or she was in the damage occurred.

747
00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:32.210
Restitution is the ending to a story that began with harm and the decrease of

748
00:53:33.031 --> 00:53:34.860
one's property or wealth.

749
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

750
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.390
<v 0>Gnocchi Quixote for his parties.
Finally apprehended by the Holy Brotherhood.</v>

751
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.770
This part,

752
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:46.630
this is part of the all encompassing closure of the novels plot don't get

753
00:53:46.631 --> 00:53:47.380
healthy on sun.

754
00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:52.130
Joe had been pursued by the holy brotherhood with an order of arrest for the

755
00:53:52.131 --> 00:53:55.130
night because of his having freed the galley slaves.

756
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:57.620
A sanctuary had feared all alone.

757
00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:02.540
They had committed other crimes such as killing sheep,
breaking a man's leg,

758
00:54:02.541 --> 00:54:05.150
and stealing property from him and his companions.

759
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:10.340
The trooper reads the arrest order,
the description,

760
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:14.820
uh,
comparing the description in it,
in the address,

761
00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:16.040
in the arrest order.

762
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:21.190
We donkey holders features in one of the most hilarious reading scenes in the

763
00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:22.724
book.

764
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.393
<v 1>Okay,</v>

765
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:30.290
<v 0>I'm reading from pages four Oh eight four oh nine of your translation and I hope</v>

766
00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:34.340
you have read these before and laughed as much as I do every time I read it.

767
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.770
But one of them,
the true person,

768
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:40.700
namely he who had been kicked and mold by Don Fernando be thought himself that

769
00:54:40.701 --> 00:54:44.420
among some warrants and see how to about him for apprehending certain

770
00:54:44.421 --> 00:54:45.254
delinquents.

771
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:49.340
He had one against Don Quixote whom the holy brotherhood had ordered to be taken

772
00:54:49.341 --> 00:54:51.410
into custody for setting up liberty.

773
00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:56.150
The Galley slaves or sanction had very justly feared.
Having this in his head,

774
00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:00.650
he had in mind to be satisfied with or the person of donkey Hopi answered to the

775
00:55:00.651 --> 00:55:03.590
description and pulling a parchment out of his bosom.

776
00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:08.690
He presently found that he looked what he looked for and setting himself to read

777
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:13.670
leisurely four who was not a great reader at every word he read.

778
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:17.750
He fixed his eyes on Gnocchi haughty and then went on comparing the marks in his

779
00:55:17.751 --> 00:55:21.890
warned with the lines on Nokia of them of Don Quixote's physionomy and found

780
00:55:21.891 --> 00:55:25.130
that without any doubt,
you must be the person there in described.

781
00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:28.700
And as soon as you have satisfied himself rolling off the parchment and holding

782
00:55:28.701 --> 00:55:31.190
the war on his left hand,
we just right.

783
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:35.540
He laid so fast the whole of funky hotel by the color that he did not suffer him

784
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:37.430
to draw breath,
crying out loud,

785
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:42.610
helped a holy brotherhood and that everybody may see I required in earnest a

786
00:55:42.661 --> 00:55:43.040
earnest,

787
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.040
read this word wherein it is expressly commanded to apprehend this highway

788
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:52.010
rubber unquote highway rubber.

789
00:55:52.011 --> 00:55:55.760
That's what Hudson guild that is described and in fact literally he is.

790
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:57.770
Why is it hilarious?

791
00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:02.040
Because the law should be the ultimate and most reliable institution in the rep,

792
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.460
in the representation of social reality,

793
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:08.570
particularly of individuals in trusted with upholding it.

794
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:13.930
Yet it's agent is a kind of dolt who can barely read because that beyond that,

795
00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:20.810
because the interpretation of the real is always problematic and difficult as

796
00:56:20.811 --> 00:56:22.580
he's reading itself and hear,

797
00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:26.050
those are my noodly reenacted by the trooper.

798
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.020
This is express brilliantly,

799
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:33.220
but the trooper looking at each feature of donkey hotels after reading it in

800
00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:36.580
this world,
and I'm comparing it with the night

801
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:43.440
like Velazquez checking to see that what he's painting corresponds to his models

802
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:49.780
in Las Meninas is a very same uh huh.
The very say moment.

803
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:55.170
Here we have a fori ds agent experiencing difficulty establishing who a person

804
00:56:56.531 --> 00:57:00.610
is on with writing experiences,

805
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:04.810
with writing the very vehicle through which the new legislation establishes his

806
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:06.610
power over individuals.

807
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:12.060
One can only imagine how Don Quixote's description was obtained from the guards

808
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:18.100
from whom he freed the galleys leaves,
taking down notes as they spoke.

809
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:23.520
That is a whole take on the trials of representation dramatize in this very,

810
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.050
very comical scene.

811
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:32.670
So as you can see,
uh,
uh,
all of these,
uh,
restitutions,

812
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.690
uh,
uh,

813
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
horror po are part of the closure of the book that belonged to the legal costs

814
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:42.850
of,
uh,
of,
of the novel.

815
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:47.870
But the most important in that league within the legal cast is the apprehension

816
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:52.510
of donkey Quixote himself by the holy a brotherhood.

817
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:55.780
This is sort of loops the plot.
It was the brewer.

818
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:58.930
But now we will have to,
uh,

819
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:04.080
to see how a UN speak about the terrain organized to cage Don Quixote and bring

820
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:09.940
him back home.
But we will do that in the next class.
