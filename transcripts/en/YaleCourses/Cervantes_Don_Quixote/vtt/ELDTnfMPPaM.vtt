WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.980
Um,

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.980
Miguel [inaudible] died in Madrid on April 23rd,

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.400
16,
16.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.270
Remember that famously Shakespeare died on the same date,

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.760
not the same day because England and Spain were following different calendars,

6
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.420
a difference of two or three days in the last five years of his life.

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.490
So Avantis so published the exemplary novels in 16,

8
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.380
13.
The voyeurs to Parnassus,

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.440
which is a long poem of essentially literary criticism where he reviews,

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.110
uh,
the writers of the,
of the period,
uh,

11
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:55.530
that appeared in 16,
14,
uh,

12
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.400
part two of the Quixote appeared in 1615.

13
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.190
And also in that year,

14
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.220
his volume of theater called eight place and eight new interludes never before

15
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.880
performed in 16,
17.

16
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:19.410
The trials of policies and see he's moon that was published posthumously,

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.000
those place he was able to,
uh,
to publish because of his,
uh,

18
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
newly acquired fame.
And,
uh,
also,
uh,

19
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.560
because they had not been a very successful on the stage except for the

20
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.100
interludes.
Uh,
let me,
uh,

21
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.300
repeat a quotation from the casebook

22
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.530
pacifically from the,
uh,

23
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.640
biographical essay by Manuel [inaudible] that opens the case book that I,

24
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.850
this is a quote that I have read before,
but I want to repeat it.

25
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.510
It is a quote that also has embedded a statement by Ann Hill del Rio,

26
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.860
which I'm a,
I think you may,
uh,
uh,

27
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.360
remember his name then he case.
And there's a real,

28
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.540
uh,
that I think,
uh,
our,
uh,

29
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.250
appropriate,
uh,
as we wind up our course.

30
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.310
But before I read you that quote,
let me read you the following also by,

31
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.670
uh,
by Doolan
quote,

32
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.060
Cervantes died in Madrid on April 23rd,
16,

33
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:41.061
16 at peace with himself and with the world at peace with himself and with the

34
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:47.901
world having received the last sacraments and was buried in the convent of the

35
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:49.530
Trinitarian nuns.

36
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.570
He died without bitterness or regrets since he had been fully conscious of his

37
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:56.940
merit,
indeed,
of his genius,

38
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.210
and was aware that his creations would endure.

39
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.930
The writer cannot hope for a greater source of consolation,

40
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.050
uh,
later constructions and reconstructions of the building.
Uh,
by the way,

41
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.900
led to the disappearance of savant thisis bones.

42
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.440
So we don't have Cervantes relics.
His bones up lost.

43
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.280
I have been insisting on advantages,
uh,

44
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.700
knowledge of Don Quixote's,
uh,

45
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.550
belonging awareness of Don Quixote belonging to the gallery of great literary

46
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.380
figures from the classical past.

47
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.220
And most recently when in the last lecture I spoke about that,
uh,

48
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.370
uh,
uh,
seen in the last,
in where they lodge.

49
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.990
And there are some wall hangings with,
uh,
with the figures of Helen,

50
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:51.760
of Troy and Dido.
Uh,
and,
and sanctuary makes the,
uh,

51
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.440
the quip that,
uh,
they will be images of,

52
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.940
of themselves,
I think Quixote on sanctuary or everywhere in the future.

53
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.810
And I underline that that is a bet that central has certainly worn.

54
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.570
Now let me go to that longer quote by,
uh,
uh,

55
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.940
Duran and del Rio,

56
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.140
who was del Rio was the author of an excellent history of Spanish literature.

57
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.910
And as I said,
he taught for many years at Columbia University.

58
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:25.960
He was a Spaniard,

59
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.190
objectively says Duran Cervantes.

60
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:34.330
His life was not a success story.

61
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.270
He was seldom in full control.

62
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.250
He was too poor for many years.
He lacked public recognition.

63
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.510
Yet as Ang Hill del Rio points out,

64
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.640
there is no reason to lament.
I'm quoting now.

65
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.750
Uh,
the young had Valerie or quote,
uh,
we think do rounds quote,

66
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.770
there is no reason to lament servant.

67
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.080
This is misfortunes nor the mediocrity of his daily life.

68
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.000
He could lost,

69
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.030
though he could those through an experience which is seldom sell an obtain,

70
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.350
uh,
when the writer is successful and wealthy,
he could know,
observe,

71
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:19.351
and feel the beat of Spanish life in its greatness and in its poverty in it

72
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:21.520
heroic fantasy.

73
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.270
And in the sad reality of an imminent decadence,

74
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.050
he was to leave in his books the most faithful image of this life reflected in

75
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:36.721
multiple perspectives with bitter sweet irony and penetrating humor.

76
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.800
Uh,
the,
uh,

77
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.930
Ellucian to decadence here is that for many years in the 20th century,

78
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.000
scholars studied the decadence of the Spanish and Pire.
Remember that quote,
uh,

79
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.240
that I brought on?

80
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:56.650
You must have read as you read earlier from Elliott about Cervantes straddling

81
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:01.130
those two moments of Spanish history.
One of,
of,
uh,
of,
of great,

82
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.610
uh,
triumph,
uh,
uh,

83
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.120
and then the beginnings of the decline.
Um,

84
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.660
now Cervantes never attained in his time the recognition of Lopi the vigor that

85
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:21.980
rider have mentioned,
uh,
uh,
so many times,
uh,

86
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.100
Lobelia Invega whom said,

87
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:27.860
Randy's criticized and admired at the same time,

88
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.133
uh,

89
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.910
but Cervantes was a greater writer than Lopi.

90
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.260
And history has confirmed this fact

91
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.440
though Lopez deserves a place in the western cannon.

92
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.540
He should not be at the same level as a set around this.

93
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.740
I say that because Lopez generally,
uh,

94
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.670
not very well known in the English speaking world,
and he sort of,

95
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.260
I don't think he's even appears in my good friend [inaudible] blooms,
uh,

96
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.040
the western cannon.
Uh,

97
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.880
but that is not Lopez fault.
That is Harold fought

98
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.760
Lopei Lopei never created it.

99
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.030
Figure of universal appeal like Don Quixote,

100
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.090
even if he wrote hundreds of place,
perhaps your thousand place.

101
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.440
Many among those plays are masterpieces,

102
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:35.330
frontier by Huna and [inaudible] and so forth.
Uh,
they,

103
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.980
they're masterpieces in their own right.

104
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.250
And Lopa created thousands of characters.

105
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.200
This is all true,

106
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.330
but he was not on the level of Cervantes.
Ironically,

107
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.261
of course,

108
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:53.030
in the period Lopa was tremendously successful historically is really a success

109
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:57.350
story.
He was,
he was rich.
He had,
uh,

110
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.100
a great following.
Uh,
and,
uh,

111
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.820
even his name was synonymous with being good.

112
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.670
If you said they Lopez,
it means it's something is good.

113
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.660
So that's how successful he was.
Uh,

114
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.520
he was just Lord it over the Spanish literary landscape.
But in,

115
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.290
in the early 17th century,
uh,
he fought in the Spanish armada.

116
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.420
He had many women,
mistresses,
wives,
10,
15 children,

117
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.070
some of them legitimate.
And,
uh,
uh,
at the end of his life,

118
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.270
he became a priest,
impregnated one of his ministers is really,
uh,

119
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.420
a life really worth a movie.
In the meantime,
said,

120
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.150
Lantus was chugging along,
uh,
uh,
in,
in Madrid,

121
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:47.890
within blocks of each other in Madrid.
Uh,
and,

122
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.550
but he was creating a work that was superior,
uh,
to,
uh,

123
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.000
to Lopez.
No,
the question to ask us,

124
00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:59.490
we draw a balance at the end of the course.

125
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.870
Easy set of volunteers who would have deserved such recognition.

126
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.900
Eh,
if he had not written dicky hope there,
but everything else that he wrote,

127
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.213
uh,

128
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.320
w w would we have a such high regard for Cervantes if he had,

129
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.820
uh,
only published the rest of his work,

130
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:24.030
some of which I mentioned when I was listing the books that he published towards

131
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:28.140
the end of its life.
The answer has to be no.

132
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.880
The answer has to be no.
Uh,

133
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.320
not by far though he would have been acknowledged as an important writer of

134
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:41.400
short novels on the basis of the exemplary novels.

135
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.120
Nobody last Ame Pladis I'll talk about that later.

136
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.870
He was also the author of a Mediocre Pastoral Romance Gal out there.

137
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.670
Remember that?
He mentions it in the,

138
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:58.440
he has the characters mentioned it in the scrutiny of the books and he himself

139
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.920
has some critical things to say about that pastor pastoral romance.

140
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.820
And it's still towards the end of his life.
Uh,
in the very last year,

141
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:09.600
he was still thinking of writing a second part of a gal out there,

142
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:14.601
but it was a mediocre work with flashes of brilliance that announced the

143
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.540
Quixote.
But that are important because of that,
not in themselves.

144
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.500
Uh,

145
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.500
he was also the author of that very uneven and very ambitious Byzantine romance

146
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:32.100
called the trials of Perseus.
And see he's wound,

147
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:36.120
I put this on the boards are all times,
so I don't have to do it.
Uh,
uh,
again,

148
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.780
this is a very odd work as Byzantine romance tend to be and said,

149
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.990
uh,

150
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.990
thought he was deluded into thinking that this was going to be the culmination

151
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.500
of his work,
his best work when he was wrong.

152
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.150
Authors are often wrong about the worth of what they have,
what they write.

153
00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:00.730
And he certainly was wrong about this.
Uh,

154
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.930
the book is,

155
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.550
is missing most of the qualities that we admire in the Quixote.

156
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.740
It's a very long book.
Uh,

157
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.630
it lacks a central figure as compelling as the mat at night,

158
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.650
except for some episodes in Spain that have sort of a realistic cast.

159
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.490
The geography is strange and abstract.
It begins in the,

160
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.800
in the,
uh,
in the snow and ice bound,
uh,
uh,
regions of a,

161
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.480
of the North Pole and finishes in Rome.
Of course,

162
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.710
uh,
the,
the dialogues are stilted.

163
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.680
They're not like the dialogues and Nikki halt.
They were a Santo speaks in his,

164
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.620
a very folksy way.
Uh,

165
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:54.220
and it is a very digressive novel.
It has,
uh,

166
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.440
again,
because of this was the author of the copter,
some,
uh,

167
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.120
moments that,
that we see as being brilliant and some hard,
uh,

168
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.560
uh,
things that,
for instance,

169
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:10.561
the characters carry around a banner like painting depicting their adventures so

170
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:13.770
that whenever somebody asks them where they have been to use,

171
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.610
unfurl this a banner and there is the,
there's their adventures.

172
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.810
It's very funny that way.
It has moments like that,

173
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.740
um,
again,
but as we've got up there,

174
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:31.741
they better see lists is important because it was written by the author of the

175
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.380
Quixote as a playwright said,

176
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.110
was a master in the comic one act interludes,

177
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.930
the [inaudible] that I have spoken about,
which show many,
uh,

178
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.660
features in common with the Quixote,
particularly,
uh,
the funny parts of it,

179
00:12:47.661 --> 00:12:51.940
the whole day,
the slapstick parts of the Quixote.
Uh,

180
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.300
but his place,

181
00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:00.330
we're stiff neoclassical because Cervantes followed the rules.

182
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.610
Uh,
the,
uh,
that the,
the precip testers,

183
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.280
those who had read Aristotle's poetics where,
uh,
uh,

184
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:11.800
uh,

185
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.750
promoting at the time you remember the discussions among the characters.

186
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.970
I think it's chapter 48 of part one.
Uh,
especially,
uh,

187
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.660
involving the Canon of Tolayo about the plays being written at the time where,

188
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.500
where Cervantes through his characters is curious as him,

189
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.360
if before not following those rules he did and then he's,
he's placed,

190
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:36.940
where does that were just,
uh,
some are okay,

191
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.010
but they're not that good.
Uh,

192
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.300
it is one of those ironies of literary history that Cervantes who was so wildly

193
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:52.051
imaginative and daring in prose fiction was so timid and conservative when it

194
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:56.410
came to the theater and mystery.

195
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.030
This is why you cannot just a list authors is you have works.

196
00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:05.950
You have to elicit works.
Uh,
when you are making a hit parade like the one,

197
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.690
uh,
Harold bloom makes him the western cannon.
Uh,
so,
uh,

198
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.710
the high point of Servantez production other than Nikki hoed,

199
00:14:17.881 --> 00:14:22.881
there was exemplary novels or stories as they're called in the translation that

200
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.750
you are using.
This is a terminological problem that I have explained before.

201
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:34.060
Uh,
the word novella that we have in Spanish were normal today did not exist.

202
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:37.420
Then.
A Novella,
uh,
was a new,

203
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:42.421
well that is a short novel or a long short story like the ones we have read and

204
00:14:43.921 --> 00:14:46.220
think on NT Cortadito the glass,
uh,

205
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.450
graduate and the ones that are included in part one of the cohort.

206
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.050
And he said he novellas a Pladis.
Uh,

207
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.560
some of these short novels are true masterpieces of the John and can stand next

208
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.260
to the greatest,
uh,
uh,

209
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.790
stories by Cervantes Italian,
uh,
predecessors,
of course,

210
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:09.560
Giovanni Boccaccio,

211
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:14.561
whom I have mentioned many times and Mattel bundle whom I have also mentioned

212
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.950
before.
Uh,
now,
uh,

213
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.670
I have mentioned them when we discussed some of these novels.
Uh,
Ma,

214
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.740
namely the glass graduate under [inaudible].

215
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.280
Today I'm going to speak about the deceitful marriage and the dog's colloquy.

216
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:35.870
Uh,

217
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.870
two connected normals that wind up the volume of the exemplary novelists or

218
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:43.610
exemplary stories.

219
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:46.710
I have trouble saying an exemplary stories because it's just not stories,

220
00:15:46.711 --> 00:15:51.590
his novels or short novels.
So I may waver,
but you know what I mean?

221
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:54.170
It's no way less him Paris in Spanish,

222
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.730
not exemplary stories.
Now,
uh,

223
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.970
as we approached these two novel,

224
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:05.480
if we have to return to the picaresque now,

225
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.040
let me summarize the reasons why the picker escrow is so important in the

226
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:13.730
development of prose fiction and repeat myself a,

227
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:18.650
unless you think that I am arbitrarily obsessed with this kind of literature,

228
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.080
it's just that it is truly very important for the development of the novel.

229
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.840
Um,
now in the picker rest there is for the first time,

230
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.440
except for Sally Stina,
but sell it.
Tina was a dialogue,

231
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.960
a dramatic dialogue.
It was not a story with a narrator and so forth.

232
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.560
So,
uh,
in the picker ask this for the first time,

233
00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:47.561
the representation of everyday life and common people with an emphasis on poor

234
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:54.770
people engaged in the struggle for existence in eh,

235
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.210
Eh,
in a setting that is contemporaneous with the author and the reader.

236
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.650
Uh,

237
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:05.650
both the author and the reader recognize the setting as being their own is

238
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:07.574
depressant.

239
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.110
That is no fancy faraway geography.

240
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:15.470
As in the romances of chivalry or the Byzantine Romances,

241
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.100
there is no remote time,

242
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.870
like the magical time of fantastic stories.
Uh,

243
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:27.290
the picaresque novels take place in the here and now.

244
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.560
The protagonist is no hero by conventional standards,

245
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.760
literary standards.
Uh,
on the contrary,
he or she,

246
00:17:37.761 --> 00:17:41.450
because there are feminine picker risks and we are going to be talking about one

247
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:45.140
today is a minor criminal in trouble with the law.

248
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:47.510
Uh,
and in fact,

249
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:52.511
the central conceit of novels like glossary [inaudible] is that the text is a

250
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:58.551
confession or deposition addressed by the accused delinquent to a figure,

251
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.260
uh,
in authority.

252
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.320
So the picker esque is an indictment of society written in the form of the legal

253
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:11.220
documents used by the authorities do a Mesh,

254
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.500
the Picato in the net of the law.

255
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:19.430
We saw how don Quixote on Sangio themselves are fugitives from justice and are

256
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:25.380
finally apprehended.
But by the trooper of the Holy Brotherhood,

257
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:28.920
that funny trooper of the holy brother who cannot read very well,

258
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.410
if you remember that hilarious scene from part one,

259
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.980
the picker risk makes possible for the novel to Depict Contemporary Society and

260
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:41.910
common social types.
So just the ones,
uh,

261
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.970
appearing and acquiring relevance in the 16th and 17th century as there is the

262
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:52.161
beginnings of what is a leveling of society that is moving towards the 18th

263
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:53.304
century,

264
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.960
the 19th century on revolutions and so forth that we are very familiar with.

265
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.520
So these characters begin to appear in novels as well as in paintings.

266
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.960
If you remember the paintings by we'll ask is that we have looked at during the

267
00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:11.520
semester,
Rafael [inaudible] who might have mentioned before,

268
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:14.370
but I want to mention again,
uh,

269
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.430
fired Sally.
Yes,
a brilliant,

270
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.800
a Spanish criminologist of the late 19th and early 20th century,

271
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:35.130
claimed that the picaresque was the origin of the social sciences,

272
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.820
specifically sociology and criminology.

273
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:45.400
That is sociology and criminology find their source in these kinds of novels.

274
00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:50.401
It's kinds of picker as novels that depict the lower strata of society in,

275
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.050
in,
in great detail.
He includes Cervantes,
his work among,
uh,

276
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.090
those,
uh,
works that he,
uh,

277
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.590
places at the origin of the social sciences.

278
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.590
So
it is to me,

279
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:13.591
very suggestive then that's Advantis chose to wind up his volume of exemplary

280
00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:19.450
novels with these two stories in the picaresque style.

281
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.850
Not picaresque per se,

282
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.170
because Atlanta's never wrote a picaresque novel in the strict sense,

283
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:31.630
but number who,
the picaresque ambiance and cast of characters.

284
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:37.210
Remember this is a book you only have a selection in your,
uh,

285
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:42.420
in your book,
uh,
of translated stories in the book.
Uh,
the volume,
uh,

286
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:47.250
consists of a prologue,
parts of which are included in my essay,
the,

287
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:52.390
in the case book about self portraits and then 12 stories.

288
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.280
Remember I talked about that number because if the pretended and was by

289
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:02.290
Serantes,
maybe he didn't include it because he didn't want the number 13.
Uh,

290
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.551
but any case,

291
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:07.230
there are 12 stories and these two that you see for marriage and the dog's

292
00:21:07.231 --> 00:21:09.910
collar,
we are the end,
the c four,
Marriage Dot Columbia.

293
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:11.080
And that's the end of the volume.

294
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.570
The order of stories in such a volume is always a significant.

295
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.770
So to me it is significant that the volume should end with these two stories,

296
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.320
this interlocking stories too.
Now,

297
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:33.190
as we saw with her,
oh,
cakey not the Catalan bandage,

298
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.550
he ness,
they pass among their,
the,

299
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:42.090
the galleys later and then later a master puppeteer and Moni polio in,

300
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.583
uh,

301
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.660
[inaudible] Cervantes often paints a sympathetic portrait of criminal types.

302
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.540
At least he never paints one.
There is one side of the negative and he,

303
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.720
he seems to have a liking for these characters.

304
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.180
One reason may be that like Don Quixote,
who is also a delinquent as we now,

305
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.320
uh,

306
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.850
they represent or original ways of life different from mainstream society.

307
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.320
Uh,
hence more interesting and appealing from a literary point of view.

308
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.150
If you're good,
you're not interesting to literature for the most part.

309
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.380
So the criminal types are interesting because they are criminals and they are

310
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:26.470
different and they have different lives that are quite original.

311
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.640
We saw the same tendency in Velazquez,
Velazquez Paints,

312
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.870
dwarves and near criminals and all of that because they are interesting,
uh,

313
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.730
different,
uh,

314
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.070
also criminal life.
And this,
and this would go back to Sally.
Yes.

315
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:43.670
Could represent the,
the,

316
00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:48.790
the origins of societal norms or how societal norms develop,

317
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.730
uh,
norms that,
that emerge out of the clash of instincts,

318
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:59.560
desires,
laws and so forth.
And this,
this is why the,
the,

319
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.450
uh,
the criminals are,
uh,
are interesting.
If you follow the law and all of that,

320
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:08.530
you're not very interesting.
The pension for criminal,
uh,
uh,

321
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.390
types found in the picaresque.
And he said,
Ron,

322
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:16.150
this is something that will become a staple of the novel,
especially,
uh,

323
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.610
the 19th century novel,
uh,
is,
is,
is,
uh,

324
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.400
people by criminals have all kinds of
interesting,

325
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.050
sometimes appealing criminals of all kinds like John Paul Jones and so forth.

326
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.240
So we moved to this,
uh,
uh,
stories,

327
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.410
the deceitful marriage [inaudible] and the dogs,

328
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:41.050
colloquial colloquium de Los Peros.

329
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.040
Now notice that these two stories,
one implanted into the other,

330
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.020
uh,
as it were,
follow the narrative device called the framed tail.

331
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.580
That is the Paler we,
the tail
a,

332
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.700
it's a device that goes back to the origins of storytelling and the thousand and

333
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:01.490
one nights,
for instance.

334
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.430
Now it allows this to finish his volume of stories with one of his cherished

335
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.310
infinitely receiving sequences.

336
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.240
Remember we've spoken about this infinity receding sequences,

337
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.150
one within the older,
within the other,
within the older,

338
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.270
I will often use the example of the uh,
of,
of,
of,

339
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.990
of the bill boy as I remember myself sitting in a barber chair surrounded by

340
00:24:29.241 --> 00:24:33.230
mirrors and then see myself disappear in the distance or images of myself and

341
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:36.150
also the,
the kind of evaporated milk with a label with a,

342
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.500
with that has a depicted,
a kind of revolt and so forth and so on.

343
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:42.560
So this is what the device is a story within the story.

344
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.850
Okay.
They are like Chinese boxes,

345
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.690
wine inside the older it is a,
it is a form of closure.

346
00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.610
If we're thinking of they close are,

347
00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:58.150
they finished the book that denies closure as it were.

348
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.980
The volume is open ended but it's open ended sort of open unto itself.

349
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.930
There could be more and more and more and more stories down.

350
00:25:04.931 --> 00:25:08.080
If you dug deeper into the stories,
uh,

351
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.360
there could be yet another story,

352
00:25:10.361 --> 00:25:15.361
which indeed there is a one story that is virtual or postponed in the,

353
00:25:16.811 --> 00:25:20.400
in the,
in the,
in,
in the second story,
the doctors called me because the,

354
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.090
the story of one of the dogs' lives,
it's not taught for,
this is what I mean.

355
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.370
MMM.
When I wrote an essay on this many years ago,

356
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.430
uh,
I called it,
uh,
the life of CPO,
uh,

357
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:40.930
saying that my essay was sort of like the telling of this life that was not told

358
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.800
in the story.
Now,

359
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.460
in the deceitful marriage,
marriage is deconstructed,

360
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.720
uh,
acid.

361
00:25:51.721 --> 00:25:56.700
We're both us as a social institution and as a narrative tool,

362
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:58.800
uh,

363
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.120
we should read the story against the backdrop of all of the stories about

364
00:26:03.121 --> 00:26:06.330
marriage that we have read in the quarter.

365
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.380
And also in the context of the pretended

366
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.840
in fact did the seed for a marriage is,

367
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.860
it's a story of surroundings that comes closest salaciousness to that contested

368
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.490
story that the pretend that that is,

369
00:26:23.491 --> 00:26:28.430
this is the dirtiest of Savannah stories.
Uh,
uh,

370
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.500
if we pretend that Andy's not [inaudible] I'm sure you will agree with me and

371
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.140
you will agree more with me once you hear my,
my reading.
Oh,

372
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.083
um,

373
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.860
it's the funnier the protagonist is a proactive female Botero a female

374
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:53.460
protagonist like others in Cervantes.
Doto pay,
uh,
uh,

375
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.360
not say last or Aida who charts her own course and follows it with cunning.

376
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.680
And with the courage of course she is a prostitute,

377
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.150
but she is a proactive female protagonists of Serantes.

378
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.340
She dupes inside campus Campuzano uh,

379
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.950
luring him with her beauty and uh,

380
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.460
pretend that worth we could call it to with her house.

381
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.240
Notice the detail is,
I told you to look for details and said,
Lantis,

382
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.170
how does she newer the inside?

383
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.420
She has beautiful hands and that is the first thing that the inside notices when

384
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:39.070
he sees her,
uh,
uh,

385
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.390
this is sort of a fetish for hands and feet to eve.
Remember,

386
00:27:42.391 --> 00:27:46.680
Dorothea were mostly,
uh,
uh,
as Stefania has a beautiful hands.

387
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.190
Uh,
she traps him into marrying her,

388
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.310
but then it turns out she was not the owner of the house.

389
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.500
Though the true proprietors come back and she's campers with the jewels with

390
00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:01.470
which she thought he had a,
he had full her,

391
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:06.330
he thought that he had full her because he,
he if,
uh,

392
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.530
boasts that they're counterfeit anyway,
the jewels that she steals,

393
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.040
it turns out however,

394
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.520
that she had the last laugh because she had infected him with syphilis.

395
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.190
It kind of delayed action.

396
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:28.430
They need actual counter blow by which she wins the game.

397
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:35.570
It is clear that what is Stefania did was her emo,

398
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:41.390
her models operandi and that the inside was neither the first nor her last

399
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.103
victim.

400
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:48.830
The cousin so called cousin who's present at his wedding was obviously you're

401
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:53.340
her pimp.
Uh,
what not.
Obviously it's,

402
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:58.180
it's us and make things that obvious,
but it is there.
Uh,

403
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.150
who was this guy?
Well,
this guys are obviously her pimp.
Uh,

404
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.260
and this is a,
this is a routine that they use to,
uh,

405
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.230
to Ensnare,
uh,
guys like the inside a pile.

406
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:18.410
He of course thinks that he's also going to have a good time and that is going

407
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:23.700
to fool her because he's making plans to scamper and go back to war.

408
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.310
Uh,
once he has had enough of a good time.

409
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.590
What is of interest to mean?
The story,
uh,

410
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.770
house around this has manipulated literary conventions.

411
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.090
The story begins with a marriage virtually.
That is,

412
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:44.270
it begins where stories normally end and works backwards to undo a union that

413
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:52.120
never took place.
Legitimately it is a marriage into which they entered,

414
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:56.350
presumably without pretense or illusions.
She,
uh,

415
00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.150
she tells him that she's no virgin and a t and she has had her life on this and

416
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.810
dad,
he doesn't care.
Uh,
and he of course,
uh,
is,
uh,

417
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.070
is not a wealthy aristocrat by any means.
And they know,

418
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.580
so they enter presumably without illusions into this marriage.

419
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.480
Uh,
but,
uh,
the marriage of course,

420
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.610
it's based on worst forms of deceit.

421
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.000
It also ends with an inversion at the end.
That should have been at,

422
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:24.910
it'd be beginning.

423
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:29.650
The man is fooled and the worn fleas in traditional stories,

424
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:34.600
it is the opposite.
The woman is full and the man,
the Guy Fleas,

425
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:41.080
marriages as we have seen throughout the semester are normally how stories end.

426
00:30:41.081 --> 00:30:41.914
I repeat,

427
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.660
they bring closure to the action representing the restoration of order and the

428
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:50.440
continuation of the species here.
However,

429
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.260
instead of MTSS inverted the for the formula,

430
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:57.550
that's the story begins with a marriage as we have seen.

431
00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.750
And I have said many times,
perhaps too many times throughout the semester,

432
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.690
and it's not a warning to you everything that happens before marriage is the

433
00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:09.970
stuff of comedy instead of antisemitism that happens after marriage,

434
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.170
stuff of tragedy.

435
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.280
But here surely because their marriage is phony,

436
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.240
what follows is common call

437
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:25.360
on worse.
The marriage by the way,
would have been an old,

438
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.980
uh,
under Spanish law and even church,
uh,
kind of law,

439
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.960
uh,
had the insight suit as the Funnier,
uh,

440
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.660
uh,
for misrepresenting herself.

441
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.930
She was not the owner of the house and so forth,

442
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:46.030
but he could not sue her because he too had misrepresented his wealth,

443
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:50.250
the jewels or who come to fit.
Uh,

444
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:55.250
and he also had plans to quit the premises as soon as he could.

445
00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:01.270
Now the end blend of all of these,
uh,
the seats is the house,

446
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.860
uh,

447
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:07.750
which should have on the country or normally provided the foundation of our

448
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:08.584
marriage.

449
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:13.910
It is in the house or they spent a brief period of matrimonial bliss.

450
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.740
This is the end ganja part that precedes the dissing Ganja legally.

451
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:26.110
And traditionally the house is the concrete sight of,
of marriage.
And,
uh,

452
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.910
and in,
in,
in Spanish,

453
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:32.911
the word for marriage where the word that is in the title of the story is

454
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.330
Casamento.

455
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.600
Casa means house in Spanish.

456
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.350
I liked the word gossip me and told his house,

457
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.150
I lie Anto from interior to lie in Spanish.
It's a,

458
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:56.030
it's a phony at the mall and you that I make up a,

459
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.730
it's also one of those soft things that language,
uh,

460
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.710
gifts the language makes,
uh,
do humor.
Uh,

461
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.240
and the word for wife in Spanish,
as you probably know,

462
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.740
this is pasta,
which is also the word for handcuffs.

463
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.500
I didn't invent the language and it is also a false in any case,

464
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:26.450
uh,
so,
uh,

465
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.820
the house is the emblem of this,
uh,
of this,
uh,

466
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:35.620
of his house gas sameon lie.
Uh,

467
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:41.480
the,
the plot of the deceitful or marriage is indeed very,

468
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.870
very disturbing because it leads to total disorder to a dissolution of the

469
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:53.210
social pact,
a social contract altogether.
It seems,

470
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.670
uh,
this is why I find it such,
such a disturbing story.

471
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:03.770
Husband and wife disappear.
They are not really husband and wife.

472
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.320
One never to be heard from again.
Stefania vanishes.

473
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:13.760
She has to vanish like the galley slaves because probably the authorities or

474
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:18.440
after her and he winds up in the,
uh,

475
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:23.500
in the hospital with a social disease for which most people never recovered.

476
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.263
Uh,

477
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:31.810
it is as if the story with his formal play of inversions is hinting not tragedy,

478
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.260
but at something perhaps worse if that is possible.

479
00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:38.540
The disappearance of all bonds,

480
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.620
the unraveling of the discourse that hold human society together and organized.

481
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:51.170
This is what is hinted at by this very disturbing story.
Indeed.

482
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:56.171
What follows is the story of the inside Campuzano in the hospital and the

483
00:34:56.601 --> 00:35:01.550
hallucination that leads him to write the next story,
the dog's Colloquy.

484
00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.740
It is ironic in a way that I find more bitter than is normal instead of Lantis

485
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.740
that what leads to literary creation here is not just a social disease,

486
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.180
but the disease of love

487
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:23.900
called at the time syphilis was called at the time in Spanish,
El Mal Francis,

488
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.650
the French disease.
Uh,

489
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:32.720
I dunno why the Spanish always blame the French for everything having to do with

490
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:35.150
sex.
Um,

491
00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.890
the law of madness,
uh,

492
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.940
of courtly love parts is literalized here.

493
00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:47.050
They love madness is a love disease,
eh?

494
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.060
Literalize the venereal illness.

495
00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.660
The dogs Colloquy is like a Stephanie,
us and the insights child.

496
00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.320
It is the product of their deceit for marriage.

497
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.900
This is very,
this I find very disturbing suggestion.

498
00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.940
So we move to the dog's Colloquy.

499
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:14.303
<v 1>Okay,</v>

500
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.630
<v 0>let me begin by considering the names of the dogs,</v>

501
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:24.050
the heroic Scipio CPM in Spanish and the picaresque better [inaudible].

502
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.310
So the two dogs,
historically,

503
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:30.750
there were two scenarios.

504
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.220
The one who took and destroyed Carthage and his son who destroyed the Spanish

505
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:43.011
down of Newman Sia and event on which Servantez based perhaps his most

506
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:48.250
successful play.
So he knew well about CPR,

507
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.370
but again,
sir is derived from Brigantine

508
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.060
right or fashion word,
no

509
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.230
better gun,
but the gun is a,

510
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.410
is a rogue rascal.
Um,

511
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.090
whereas of course a Scipio is a heroic name.

512
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:23.320
The name of a military commander.
Uh,
the two,

513
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.960
the two dogs,
uh,
make up a parent like Don Quixote on central.
If you think of it,

514
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:33.890
the sort of big arrest type Bergen Braganza and the military,

515
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.260
uh,
CPR,
a

516
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.550
CPL life,
the one not told,

517
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.060
it's suggested that could have been another key haughty,

518
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:48.210
but in a different key at Quixote in a canine key.

519
00:37:48.211 --> 00:37:52.440
I said where it would be the,
uh,
a mock heroic dog's life.

520
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.030
We could,
uh,
we could call him.
It's just suggested,

521
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.023
uh,

522
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.300
now and science come from Sonos predicament.

523
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.780
Lincoln illness and creativity is a spoof,
as I have said,

524
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.550
of the Sig Lover Port able to compose poetry because of his,

525
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.380
of his condition is a,
this will become a romantic,

526
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.840
a trope only that here it is,

527
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:23.841
these illnesses dramatically and literally a newness of love of the lowest,

528
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.270
uh,
kind.
Uh,

529
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:33.180
remember that he,
he the only cure other than some potions and stuff,

530
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:37.870
he still let him sweat it out and just hospital,
uh,
uh,
on,
on some,

531
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.920
uh,
some survive,
but not,
not too many notice.
Also,

532
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.190
we the,
the ironic name of the hospital,

533
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.220
I don't know if you noticed that it's [inaudible] to Rex Hospital of the

534
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:54.250
resurrection.
Uh,
and this is out of,

535
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.680
through a kind of wrestle [inaudible] comes out after he has sweated out,

536
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.570
uh,
he's,
uh,
his syphilis or at least part of his,
uh,
uh,

537
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.700
uh,
syphilis
now,
uh,

538
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.950
Cervantes skirts here,
the supernatural in the story.

539
00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:16.900
The idea that dogs can talk the supernatural never appears instead of antithesis

540
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:19.730
works.
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,

541
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.260
he leaves open the here at the possibility that the dog,

542
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:27.100
the story of the dog stalking is merely a halogenation on the part of,

543
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.480
of Campuzano who's ill and in his illness and,
and fever,

544
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.920
he imagines this,

545
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.490
you've got to also be a literary roofs on the part of the insight.
I mean,

546
00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:42.120
it is the character within the story,
uh,

547
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:46.060
who is making this up said run at this would say,
uh,

548
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:50.530
he wants to live in an ambiguous state.
The origin of his literary creation.

549
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.220
To me it is very suggestive.

550
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:59.221
I didn't know if you found it so that he falls asleep while his lawyer friend

551
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.530
called graduate in your translation.
Listen,
Seattle,

552
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.500
a lawyer,
he is a graduate in law.
Uh,

553
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.800
I find it very suggestive that the author falls asleep while Peralta is reading

554
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:18.460
his story.
I as well,
I mean,

555
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:22.000
it's also very significant that the reader is someone,

556
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:26.530
a lawyer trained to read text and ascertain their truthfulness.

557
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.350
This is sort of,
uh,
uh,
uh,
an ironic,
uh,

558
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.740
reading scene.
You know,
the lawyer reading this to,
to,
to,

559
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:40.720
to tell whether it is true or not.
Uh,

560
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.110
now on one level it is,

561
00:40:43.111 --> 00:40:46.930
this is a text belongs to the realm of dreams.

562
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.960
The fact that he's sleeping and it is as if the reader is tapping directly into

563
00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:57.070
his dreams as he's sleeping it,
it occurs to me,
uh,

564
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.910
because it's author,
it's asleep when it's being read and another,

565
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:05.911
it is as if there is a gap between creator and the texts needed for the reader

566
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:08.740
to judge to judge it independently.

567
00:41:08.741 --> 00:41:11.680
There is eastern sleep is no longer in control of the text.

568
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:14.200
The text is now in the hands of the reader and it is the,

569
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.230
for the reader to determine whether it is true or not.

570
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.490
This is why he is asleep.
Of course.

571
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:25.720
It's also a way of having him do something.
Well,

572
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:29.800
the other one reads the way would have been to have him go to the market or

573
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:30.071
something,

574
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:34.130
but I think this is but more interesting or suggested the fact he falls asleep.

575
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.720
I like to think of it as,
as I said,

576
00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:40.580
the reader is tapping directly into subconscious because he's asleep

577
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.270
now.
Been asked that in a way is,
is stand in for us,
the readers.

578
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.620
He offers a literary judgment at the end,

579
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.580
we're announcing this story growed a,

580
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:58.130
they'll hardly believable and encouraging his friend,
uh,
uh,

581
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.340
to go ahead and write the next life notice in the context of my discussion of

582
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:08.420
the ending of like he hopped in the last lecture that life is here is the shape

583
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:10.070
of the story in life,

584
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:15.100
the life of Braganza and the next life is going to be the life of Cpr of CPO.

585
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:21.670
It is also of course forward in that the shape of the pickers that we saw when

586
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:24.710
we discuss the,
uh,

587
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.180
the figure of [inaudible] who has written his life in prison and so forth and so

588
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:31.760
on.
Now,

589
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:34.880
there is more than a hint to that.

590
00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:39.881
The story that the insight tells or rights through the dog is an encoded

591
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:41.930
autobiography.

592
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:49.270
This is a picaresque autobiography in which the picker or pretends to be a dog.

593
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:54.880
It's very ingenious and inventive turn.

594
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.660
Uh,
also Rhonda says,
uh,
part,
uh,

595
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.570
why is it autobiographical?

596
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:06.260
Particularly because when he takes the manuscript from his,

597
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.430
uh,
pocket,
he takes her out of his,
said no send means is,

598
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.770
is Busan.
It's taking it out of his heart in a way.

599
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.830
So this is it.
This is a,

600
00:43:17.831 --> 00:43:22.831
a suggests to me that this is inside Campuzano story,

601
00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:28.130
but told deflected into the life of this,

602
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.060
uh,
of this dog.
It is,

603
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:37.630
it is very interesting that literature issues out of these tawdry living

604
00:43:38.421 --> 00:43:43.421
conditions and figures literary Krish as he did in the case of Vanessa Samantha,

605
00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:49.310
who wrote his his life while he was in prison.

606
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.690
And also in the case of Cervantes himself,
who's life,

607
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.400
if not quite as tawdry sometimes was like that when he was,

608
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.890
when he was a prisoner,
a captive in Algiers.

609
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:08.880
And the couple of times that when he was really in jail,
uh,
at,

610
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.800
uh,

611
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.800
in Spain for irregularities in his accounts when he was collecting,

612
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.880
uh,
for the,
for the,
uh,
Spanish armada and so forth.
So,

613
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.800
uh,
I think that this is a Sorento says,
uh,

614
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:28.280
take on the,
on the origins of modern literature.

615
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.350
Uh,
it,
it,

616
00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:37.410
it originates in these conditions and out of figures like lease.

617
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.820
Now the point is that,
uh,
uh,

618
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.790
that he's showing the virtual workings of the literary imagination,

619
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.850
which deflects the real and,
and the tawdry or the,

620
00:44:51.851 --> 00:44:56.851
the CD life of the enzyme and deflect that into the life of the dog,

621
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:02.930
which has a slightly classical form because of the fables or dog speak and so

622
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:06.840
forth.
I mentioned in the text,
um,

623
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:12.350
now the uncertain origin of the dogs who could also be the transformed songs of

624
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:14.401
that,

625
00:45:14.401 --> 00:45:19.401
which in that marvelous scene with sandwiches that I am sure you remember,

626
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:25.500
and that allude or hearkened back to [inaudible],

627
00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.950
uh,
uh,

628
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.310
or they could have been simply dogs born,

629
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:34.860
where in the slaughterhouse of Seville,

630
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.050
Remember Seville is the,
the,

631
00:45:38.051 --> 00:45:42.280
the capital of bigger sk life.
And this ladder,

632
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:46.460
there's a lot of house seems to be the capital within the capital of Bucharest

633
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.160
life.
But it also Sarandos is also leaving,
uh,

634
00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:55.680
the origin of the story in,
in an air of indeterminacy,

635
00:45:56.290 --> 00:46:00.120
uh,
sort of like Don Quixote's origins.
Uh,

636
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:04.800
I think that the significance of the ending of the story,
Eh,
again,

637
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:09.830
back to the infinitely receding sequences is that it brings about no closure at

638
00:46:10.021 --> 00:46:10.854
all to the volume.

639
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:18.890
So we make a little digression digression here before we get towards the end of,

640
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:25.170
uh,
uh,
of,
of the lecture,
uh,

641
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.180
to discuss cafcass parable that I hope you read for today.

642
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:35.250
CAFCA 1883,
1924,
as we all know,

643
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:40.251
was a Czech author who wrote in German such masterpieces of the Metamorphosis

644
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.290
1915 that trial 1925,

645
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:47.880
the castle 1926 and when she presented a world ruled by arbitrary and mysterious

646
00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:52.881
bureaucratic laws by which the characters seem to abide,

647
00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:55.650
impelled by,
by obscure forces,

648
00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.150
he never published this work which he ordered that he be destroyed upon his

649
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:04.440
death and wish that fortunately was not followed.
Uh,

650
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.660
I think that this brief text,

651
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.820
it's just a paragraph shows to what extent Cafca I think connected with the core

652
00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:14.070
of sort of antithesis literary imagination,

653
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:19.730
which Advantis his notion and feel for a literary creativity.

654
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:25.550
The text is entitled the Truth About Sancho Panza and it says,

655
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:31.240
without making any boast of it sent Japan's I succeeded in the course of years

656
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:36.690
by feeding him a great number of romances of chivalry and adventure in the

657
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.790
evening and night hours you saw diverting from himself,

658
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:42.730
his demon whom he later called Don Quixote,

659
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:48.220
that this demon there upon set out on inhibited on the mattress exploits,

660
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.130
which however,
for the lack of a preordained object,

661
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.230
we should have been sent your bouncer himself,

662
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.590
how nobody the Fremont sent Japan's a reassignment.

663
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.220
Lee followed don Quixote in his crusades,

664
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:05.290
perhaps out of a sense of responsibility and out of them are great and edifying

665
00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:07.120
entertainment to the end of his days.

666
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.920
That's the parable on the truth of central Buzzer.

667
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.260
So I think that calf guys turning Cervantes fiction upside down,

668
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.860
but within the spirit of Serantes,
uh,

669
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:22.060
by making central the inventor of the Quixote and following him around

670
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:25.450
afterwards,
the whole fiction comes out of sanctuary demon.

671
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.870
That is the demon of a common man.
Like those both got cancer.

672
00:48:30.871 --> 00:48:35.860
Vantis like to invent the glass graduate for example,
is another common man was,

673
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.480
and also like other authors in Cervantes,

674
00:48:39.481 --> 00:48:44.050
Sanchez creation gets out of hand and in and acquires,
uh,

675
00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:48.880
alive,
uh,
overtone.
I think this is cafcass reading of surroundings.

676
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:53.140
I think it's a very profound reading even if it is oh,
perhaps to go cities.

677
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.530
So brief,
I also wish to mention

678
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.110
the board has story pmnr author of the Quixote,

679
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.520
which is one of the most famous stories by border hissing,
which as you remember,

680
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:11.770
uh,
these French,
uh,
poet minor poet,
decides to rewrite the Quixote,

681
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.590
not just rewrite the jihad.
They bought word by word as Cervantes had written it.

682
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:23.080
The idea being that it is much more difficult to write the hotel and 17th

683
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:27.310
centuries,
uh,
a Spanish,
especially by a French one by a Frenchman.

684
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.850
Donny was for Cervantes to write it in his own time and so forth.

685
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:34.480
This is a big literary joke on the part of,
of borders,

686
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.960
but at the same time bar has,

687
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.240
is unsettling the romantic notion of the link between creator and,
and work.

688
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.760
Uh,
and uh,

689
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.380
when she shows he cannot completely unsettled it because pmnr dies

690
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:55.840
because of the effort it took to do this,
which of course you could never finish.

691
00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.190
It's an impossible task that he sets for himself.

692
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.610
Uh,
bought his,

693
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:08.611
was also reacting in 1939 when he wrote the story to what he considered to be

694
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:12.850
sort of Prato fascist readings of the Quixote by Spanish colors.

695
00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.180
Remember the Spanish civil war,
it's just over and the promotion of,

696
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:21.220
of East bunny.
Dot.
The Spanish snus and so forth.

697
00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:23.310
And he's trying to show that,
uh,

698
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:26.850
Cervantes a great creation,
uh,

699
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:31.730
it belong to any single language when any single,
uh,
a national,
uh,
tradition,

700
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:36.680
but that it can be potentially can be written or rewritten by anyone.

701
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:42.380
Also he is underlining something that he himself set with,
with Cervantes Ian,

702
00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.310
uh,
uh,

703
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.900
self deprecation that once you write something that is good,

704
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.330
it doesn't belong to you anymore.
It belongs to the tradition.

705
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.220
And so this is what he's saying.

706
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:56.210
They around this creation has escaped him because he's now belongs to the

707
00:50:56.211 --> 00:51:00.860
tradition,
not to sit around this.
This is something that border has set.

708
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.620
Now let us finish by talking a bit of our caravan.
This is death.

709
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:10.730
Going back to the beginning of today's class,
uh,
I think that said,

710
00:51:10.731 --> 00:51:15.470
rant is identified with a desk.
Don't be haughty and alone.
So,
uh,

711
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:19.880
uh,
know I think that there is an identification with,
uh,

712
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:24.890
with them,
uh,
because he feels that life us fiction has to come to an end,

713
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:29.570
uh,
and a form of truth.
Once we reached on the brink of death,

714
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.270
it is a form of truth for which ironically,

715
00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:37.271
literature has prepared him through the understanding of destined Ganja.

716
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:43.970
Cervantes seems to be saying that he liked Don Quixote's renouncing a life of

717
00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:48.680
make belief.
So what,
so what is the sense of the novel's ending?

718
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:53.660
Perhaps it is the feeling of sadness,
of regret,
that the book,

719
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.530
that madness,
the entertainment and the fund have to come to an end.

720
00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:01.310
Like everything else,
it is not so much a sense.

721
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:06.170
You're just not so much sense as meaning as a sense,
as feeling,

722
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.520
uh,
not saying Ddo,
uh,

723
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.150
as a significant [inaudible] was us in the sense when our morning or uses the

724
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:17.000
word sent Demian the tragic sense of life.

725
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:22.030
So this is the sense of the ending of the Quixote.
It is a sense of,

726
00:52:22.031 --> 00:52:24.220
of,
of sadness,
uh,

727
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:28.950
redolent with potential meaning for additional meanings that we cannot decipher

728
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.080
altogether.
Now,
the,
in the,

729
00:52:33.081 --> 00:52:34.910
in the prologue lipid see lists,

730
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:39.320
which is sort of antithesis farewell.
He,

731
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.390
he presents himself as a man.

732
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:45.950
We signed to his impending death and content with his accomplishments.

733
00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:49.010
Going back to what Darren has said in the quote at the very beginning of my

734
00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:53.120
lecture.
Uh,
the taxi Serrano,
his farewell,

735
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:57.200
the dedication to the policies,
uh,
the dedication,

736
00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:01.010
not the prologue or they must have been contemporaneous contemporary to each

737
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:04.010
other was April 19th,
16th,
16th,

738
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.590
the dedication that is four days before his death,

739
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:11.870
he says that he has,
uh,
was given the extreme unction,
which is,
you know,

740
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:15.740
the last rites in the Catholic,
uh,
uh,
a church.
And,

741
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:20.760
and then,
uh,

then over in the dark.

792
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:41.630
You sat him down to London.
Hello dear.
Look at him in front of the thoughts.

793
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.971

796
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.650
which goes in English.

797
00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:59.000
<v 0>I hope we thought an interruption like the one we had before.
Uh,</v>

798
00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:03.230
you catch the setting there going in.
He's going into,
uh,
into Madrid.

799
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:09.200
Where the court,
because this is what he,
it so happened dearest reader,

800
00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.800
us to friends and I were coming from the famous down over skeevy us,

801
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.420
which is where his wife was from,
famous for a thousand reasons,

802
00:58:17.421 --> 00:58:21.380
one of them being its illustrious families and another is even more illustrious

803
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:26.390
wines that I perceive someone behind me sparing his mount on in a great hurry.

804
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.790
He apparently wanted to overtake us and soon made that clear by calling out for

805
00:58:31.791 --> 00:58:35.970
us not to start on.
So urgently we waited for him and on a,

806
00:58:35.971 --> 00:58:37.250
she has came up,

807
00:58:37.251 --> 00:58:42.140
came a drab student drive because he came dressed all in rustic brown with

808
00:58:42.141 --> 00:58:43.790
leggings,
round toed shoes,

809
00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:47.390
a sword in a cheque scabbard and a starch lace color.

810
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:48.830
With this matching ties.

811
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:52.280
The fact of the matter is that he only had two of these ties to hold it on,

812
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:57.170
so every other minute the color kept falling over to one side and he was a great

813
00:58:57.171 --> 00:58:59.780
pace to keep it straight catching up to us.

814
00:58:59.781 --> 00:59:04.760
He said she was Sarah's must be on your way to court to obtain some office or

815
00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:08.480
benefits from his most illustrious grace of Toradol and his majesty themselves

816
00:59:08.481 --> 00:59:13.040
are downloads there judging by the hairy with which are tr with which you are

817
00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:17.240
traveling since even my ass,
judging by the hurdles which are traveling,

818
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:21.980
uh,
my ass,
uh,
which has been praised than once from her

819
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.720
<v 2>speed.
Couldn't catch two.
You do this.
One of my companions replied,</v>

820
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:31.190
it's the fault of Senora Miguel disadvantages.
Nag,
which is somewhat long,

821
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:35.270
stepping scarcely had the student heard the names to the month is when needs is

822
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:39.440
mounted from his back animal sending his Saddleback's flying in one direction

823
00:59:39.441 --> 00:59:40.700
and Israelis in another,

824
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:45.350
he traveled so completely outfitted and rushed up to me seizing my left hand and

825
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:48.770
say,
yes,
yes,
this is the complete cripple,

826
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.390
the completely famous and comic writer.
And lastly,
the delight of the muses.

827
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:56.480
I who is our shortest space of time.

828
00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:01.250
So search great companies in my praise felt it would have been this courteous

829
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.450
not to respond to them.

830
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:07.320
And so embracing him around the neck whereby I destroyed his color altogether.

831
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.173
I said to him,

832
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:13.200
that is an error into which many of my unit uninformed admirers or fallen.
I,

833
01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:14.043
sir,

834
01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:18.380
I'm set around this but not the delight of the muses or any other foolish things

835
01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:21.260
that you mentioned.
Round up your ass bumped up our,

836
01:00:21.261 --> 01:00:25.000
let's pass the brief remainder of our journey in pleasant conversation the

837
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.410
obliging students did.
The student did just that.

838
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:30.500
We reign in slightly and then resumed our trip,

839
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:35.060
but a more leisurely pace as we traveled we talked about are about my illness

840
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:40.090
and the good student immediately diagnosed me a helpless case saying this Dicks,

841
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:42.260
the stick,
this is drop seen,
curable.

842
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:45.530
Even if you were to drink all the waters of the ocean made sweet,

843
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:47.450
so you noticed that Advantis sir,

844
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:51.380
you should limit your drinking and don't forget to eat for thereby you will

845
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:55.670
recover without any other medicine.
That's what many have told me.
I replied,

846
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.780
but I just can't give up the pleasure of drinking all I want for it almost seems

847
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:00.800
I was born to it.

848
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.600
My life's race is slowing at the rate of my pulse and by this Sunday at the

849
01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:07.010
latest it will be complete.

850
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:12.180
It will complete its course and within my life user have made my acquaintance at

851
01:01:12.441 --> 01:01:16.460
a difficult moment who are there isn't enough time left to express my gratitude

852
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:19.160
for the goodwill you've shown me at this point.

853
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:22.880
We arrived at the Toledo bridge where I crossed into the city and he wrote off

854
01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:26.960
to enter by the Segovia road.
I said,
what may be said of this incident,

855
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.000
fame would take care to report it.

856
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:33.710
My friends will take pleasure in telling it and I even more pleasure in hearing

857
01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:36.320
it.
Once again,
we embraced each other.

858
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:41.350
He's spirit mount and left me just as ill at ease as he was in trying to be a

859
01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:46.040
gentleman on that ass.
He had afforded my pen a greater opportunity to be witty,

860
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:50.600
but you can always make one moment but you can have another at time it come.

861
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:55.601
Perhaps when I shall tie up this broken thread and say what I fail to hear and

862
01:01:55.731 --> 01:02:00.230
what would have been fitting good by humor.
Goodbye wit goodbye.

863
01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:04.910
Merry friends for a com dying for I am dying and hope to see you soon.

864
01:02:04.911 --> 01:02:08.960
Happy in the life to come
here.

865
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:13.920
We find the same set of antiques of the key hope their products.
Uh,

866
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:19.380
these are the five points that I want to make.
That one,

867
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:20.310
the prologue

868
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:24.540
<v 0>as dialogue as in part one and throughout savant,
this is work.</v>

869
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.320
Instead of an expository priest,
a piece in the first person,

870
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.860
he needs to create an alert to tell the story of his own self.

871
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:37.430
Why do these dialogues reflect those going on in his own mind

872
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:44.330
that do reflect he's ironic stance before his own sense of self and beef before

873
01:02:45.241 --> 01:02:46.620
his own sense of the truth.

874
01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:51.621
Because it is a sort of this perspective is that we have seen true

875
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.800
here are so many times in the cohort that we have another student with hilarious

876
01:02:58.801 --> 01:03:01.300
details about his clothing.
Uh,

877
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.220
students are seekers of knowledge readers,

878
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.000
which are of great interest to serve Lantus.

879
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:11.750
As we all know the details I sold details.
Uh,

880
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.290
instead of Andis are revealing of character of personality.
This is a way,

881
01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:20.860
a very economical way of talking about this guy's personality by showing,
uh,

882
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:24.330
he's vanity with all of his clothes that he's wearing city.

883
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.060
The scene takes place on the road,

884
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:33.290
symbol of time and of life as in the Quixote for.

885
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.590
And I think this is the subtlest and this is why I wanted you to hear it in my

886
01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.610
uninterrupted reading in Spanish,
the rhythm of,

887
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:42.870
of pros,

888
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.960
I don't know if the story itself seems to echo that of the trotting horses,

889
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.970
this dropping of the horses and the various spaces that the horses follow,

890
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:59.450
our marketing time and time.
It's fleeting.

891
01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:03.840
Miss is the theme of these piece lives,

892
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.980
race and life's journey,

893
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:09.120
coalesce as death approaches and is mark by the,

894
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.660
by the trotting of the horses and by the rhythm of the prose,

895
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.010
five Cervantes deals.
Ironically with his late fame,

896
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:24.150
which comes when he's near death,
uh,

897
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:27.600
it's something out of rhythm because now it is of little constellation or profit

898
01:04:27.601 --> 01:04:30.080
for him.
Uh,

899
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:35.120
so we have here the same self deprecating Cervantes said we have learned to

900
01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:36.084
love.

901
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:41.810
Now it is in that same spirit that I ask him or wherever he happens to be.

902
01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:44.880
And I asked you,
uh,

903
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:48.660
forgiveness for my own shortcomings in commenting his work.

904
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:50.580
Thank you very much.
