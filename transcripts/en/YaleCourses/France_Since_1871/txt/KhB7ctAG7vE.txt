Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Um, by the way, there were big trouble over the weekend, uh, in a, in a suburb next week. The last day I'm going to talk about the problem. So called problem of, of the suburbs. There's a big problem the other night and when the policeman ran down, um, two kids on a scooter, a screw town, and they were both killed apparently. And so there's a lot of riots again going on. So you can again, you can follow us if you know French on a f on false, do TFL and um, or in the restroom. But this is a, but this will probably, this will probably be in the newspapers anyway. So what I want to talk about today, uh, it's hard to do both of them in one day, but let's go, is to compliment your reading on, on a decolonization, uh, and talk about Vietnam and Algeria. Uh, and the subtext, obviously it's not, it texted intended in the, you know, in this course, but is that the Americans never learned the mistakes, uh, uh, from which the French finally learned.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I next week I, or next Wednesday, I'll talk about about Charles de Gaulle, but mostly about after he comes to power in 1958. But he's obviously important, uh, in this, um, you know, from the beginning that it's after World War Two that most of the colonies, uh, in the world became independent in a process that took a decades. Uh, and of course, the 1960s pick, the beginning of the 1960s, it's a very, very crucial for, uh, in the case of, of um, uh, of Africa. Um, and this, despite, uh, uh, despite the insistence of a, of a Winston Churchill for one, that the British empire would not be a dismembered, uh, in Britain. This transition, uh, from colony to independent state, uh, state often replete full of, of problems came without violence came generally, uh, without, uh, without insurrection. Uh, this was not the case with France, nor as you know, some of you, not the case.

Speaker 1:          02:20          I was in Portuguese from Portuguese colonies. Uh, uh, as well. Uh, the Netherlands and Britain both resisted, um, independence movements before, uh, before a caving in. And by 1980 a year that I can even remember, uh, not with pleasure because I was married that year. Um, more than half of the hundred and 54 members of the United Nations, uh, had been admitted to membership since 19, uh, 56. Now, one obvious point is that part of the dismantling of empires, uh, the, one of the important theme in this is that Britain and France, uh, in the postwar period, uh, became a less important powers than they had, uh, before, uh, is that, uh, as you know, uh, uh, France and, and this was the essential and the goals view of themself and view of the world, uh, uh, uh, seeks to retain its role as a great power. But the world had basically been divided up in the cold war between the Soviet Union, uh, and, uh, the United States.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Uh, and that both of those powers are, we're competing aggressively for these newly independent states, uh, in Africa, in Asia, and indeed in, uh, north Africa as well. Um, and so World War Two accentuated, uh, the independence movements that developed, uh, after World War One. The case of Vietnam is of course, just classic, uh, in that, uh, uh, and you had a well organized, uh, uh, nationalist communist movement ready to assume the mantle of, of yet the Movement for a Vietnamese, um, independence. Um, and, uh, as you will know that, you know, will Woodrow Wilson, the spouse nationalism as ways that we determine to determining the existence or the creation of states. And so Wilson and his American successors were kind of caught in a, uh, you know, caught in a trap because on one hand they're saying, oh, yeah, we need to, uh, uh, we need to recognize independence movements and people to see themselves as a single nation ought to have the right to have their own state.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Uh, but then because of the domain of, of him, because of the Cold War, the Americans often found themselves, uh, uh, acting in ways that, that they, um, uh, did not match a match. Their rhetoric. Um, the, the French left Syria and Lebanon by agreement made with United States and Britain, uh, after the war. Uh, but the problem of Vietnam and the problem of North Africa, uh, as you know, where the French had been since, uh, 18, uh, 30 would be a much thornier now ho ci men. I mean, I can, you know, I can remember, I can remember this, uh, sort of a time warp for someone like me cause I can remember all the marches and was in all the marches against, uh, against the war. You know, back when I, when I was your age and you know, the chance of [inaudible] men NLF is, is going to win.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Um, he had become president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the war. A hoochie men's, uh, father was an official under, uh, under the French under French rule. And he had resigned from his position because he had become a, a Vietnamese, uh, a nationalist and Holcim men. And there were other nationals of, by the way, I mean was one has a tendency to say, well, you know, they get the communist party representative nationalism, but there are other nationalists to who, who, who weren't communists but the war because the war end, the war where the work comes out. [inaudible] one ends up talking a lot about, uh, uh, about, um, communists nationalism. But he had been working on a kitchen helper on a French passenger aligner, a crossing the oceans before becoming a communist activist. And he founded in 1929 the Ho the Indo Chinese Communist Party, which he founded in Hong Kong in 1929 in 1930 unified three groups of Vietnamese communists around his leadership.

Speaker 1:          06:30          He was condemned to death in absentia, uh, by the French government. And he was saved by the refusal of the British government in Hong Kong to turn them over to the French because he would have been, he would have been executed, but that without any question. Uh, but he was arrested by the British in 1931 and he remained in prison in Hong Kong until 1933. Uh, and during World War Two, he led the Viet men have yet. And then m I, N H A in organization of Vietnamese nationalists, some of whom, but as I said before, not all of whom were communists. Now I'm the French attack, the port of high flying and he's got, these are names, you know, out of my past. I wasn't, you know, did not know about Haiphong. I was a couple of years old then, uh, not even that, I guess, uh, killing 6,000 Vietnamese. And they captured a annoyed the Vietnamese capital a and a, this is after the war.

Speaker 1:          07:26          And so France restored, uh, the nominal authority of a playboy emperor. Uh, and, but the whole Holcim is Vietnamese army. I held most of the countryside rather like Mousay tongs army, uh, in China. I've had begun, uh, during the war against climate and Dong A to carve out huge sections of, of, of, of Chinese territory as well. And Ho was supported by the Chinese communists. Um, and he prophesies you will kill 10 of our men. Uh, but we will kill one of yours. And in the end, we will end up by wearing you out. Now, this was, this was the origins of, of at least in the modern era of a guerrilla warfare, uh, uh, French intellectual who still live in called [inaudible]. Hey wrote a very important book that I remember I had to read in the seminar on revolutionary elites with Arthur Mendel at the University of Michigan called high evolutional dorms.

Speaker 1:          08:23          I to shown a revolution in the revolution, uh, about a gorilla fighting. Now, if you go back those that go back to before 1871 and 70, 71, uh, uh, you remember what, what the, the Spanish, um, uh, patriots were able to do in a, in Spain against Napoleon's occupying forces, which was to pick them off one by one. And the French retaliated by shooting down civilians as they did in Calabria in the south of Italy and other places. Uh, but you know, we will, you will kill 10 of ours and we will kill, uh, one of yours and Annette. And eventually what happens in, in the Vietnam case, I is that, uh, as in the Algerian case is that the pressure to pull out of the war becomes so enormous, uh, that that strategy wins and that the costs of continuing, uh, to, to, to fight, to battle, to repress, depending on your view of the matter, uh, will affect the home front and the Home Front, uh, will, uh, demand, uh, the end of, uh, of the, of, uh, of the fighting and indeed of, of the empire.

Speaker 1:          09:31          Uh, early in 1954, the French army suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Vietnamese at a place called den Bn Ph. You at the end, uh, which, uh, is now a tourist site for lots of French go there. I've never been there. Uh, uh, you know, there, there is just as Vietnam has become, you know, the major, Major, sort of, uh, of tourist center and for, you know, oddly, not oddly enough, but I suppose it's good and bringing these things to an end for lots of Americans who fought over there. Uh, and some of them lost your loss limit over there to go back. And, and to put at least closure on all of that. Pr Mendez Foss, who was the new socialist premier, uh, succeeded in, in taking France out of the war in Vietnam. And as you know, he would be successful with a very less successful and try to convince the French to direct milk as opposed to wine, a hopeless task.

Speaker 1:          10:25          And, and, uh, he, uh, without question became the most, uh, you know, the, the most eminent French politician, uh, not to, uh, hold, uh, not to hold, um, uh, power as, as, as president, uh, in France. Did you a convention that year, a frantic green to divide Vietnam into two states on North Vietnam, uh, became a communist regime led by hace men. Uh, the capital of Hanoi and South Vietnam became a republic run by a success succession. I think it's fair to say a pretty corrupt leaders, uh, who carried out a u s, uh, policy, uh, in exchange for, um, for a free hand, uh, in, uh, in, in all of that. Now, one thing that was going on behind all of that, uh, is the dissatisfaction of the army, uh, with what happened in Vietnam now because the army, which had been, uh, emerged from World War One, victorious, but ultimately France was less powerful than Germany in defeat.

Speaker 1:          11:37          Germany had been in defeat France and victory was less, less powerful. Uh, had been defeated and many officers, uh, uh, argued that it was the collapse of the homefront that, uh, federal brought this about. And if they had been, uh, actively by a over the long run, if enough resources had been thrown in, then, uh, victory could be achieved. Now, if that doesn't sound like Vietnam in the late 1960s and early 1970s a time that, that, uh, nobody in this room except two of us, uh, I remember, uh, cause that's exactly the same scenario and it's exactly the same scenario now, but that, that's another, uh, uh, that's another matter. Um, and so, um, therefore a France gets out of Vietnam. And, uh, one of the things that happened, by the way, my friend Mark Lawrence, it's an excellent book on this, is that already that the French and the, and, and the British and the late 1940s, we're getting the IC.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Uh, we're getting the, uh, getting the Americans to kind of do what they wanted. But what happens then is, is that when, you know, when the French are gone, uh, then, uh, the communist insurgency in the north and, and, and the Viet Cong in the south, uh, lead to, uh, this bloody a series of, of, uh, of just horrible years in which so many Americans and so many Vietnamese died. And they are a commemorated by my, I Mulind some islands, uh, uh, a wall in, in, um, uh, in, in Washington, uh, with their names on it. And, um, that, I mean that you can remember those scenes of the frantic, frantic, and when the, you know, the healer copters or are, are pulling off the, the well, uh, uh, the well healed and the well connected from, uh, uh, from Saigon and the, in the, in the very end.

Speaker 1:          13:32          And it was a lesson that was, uh, that was not, there was not, that was not learned. And, uh, sometimes that's the way that things go, but that was nothing compared to, uh, to, uh, uh, Algeria. Um, that was nothing at all. And one of the big differences why, what happened in North Africa to above all in Algeria occurred is that Vietnam for all of the residuals of French architecture, uh, you know, building a, a cathedrals and opera houses along French architectural lines. There's a wonderful book by a woman called Winland, right about imperial architecture. I, and there were a good number of French living in, in Vietnam, uh, but that, uh, Vietnam was not a settlement colony. Uh, the way that, for example, Australia and New Zealand had been in the, in the British empire. Um, but Algeria was, and so was, uh, uh, Morocco and North Africa, uh, and, uh, Tunisia where settlement colonies, all sorts of people live there from France.

Speaker 1:          14:44          And they were called cool. We're settlers basically. And their nicknames were the PM. Why Pa? Wow. The Blackfeet. And there are several interpretations. Uh, maybe Brian can a illuminated us, but sometimes they're called black feet. Uh, because of the boots, uh, that the army soldiers a war or because it was thought that if they walked over the burning sands of, of, of the Sahara, uh, you know, that their feet would be burned and therefore become a newer, uh, but they were settlers. They were people who had been there in many cases for generations and generations. Now, Algeria, as Charles told you, and you already know, uh, was first conquered in 1830, uh, uh, uh, Jay Algiers falls, uh, in, uh, in June, end of June or early July, I can't remember which, 18, 30. Uh, and it's pacified. That is, you know, lots of people are slaughtered, uh, over the next, uh, uh, decades, uh, in 1851 after the insurgency, uh, to defend, uh, the democratic and social republic against this and before this course.

Speaker 1:          15:54          But it's still important, uh, against the coup d'etat of, of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who became Napoleon third. Many of the people who were arrested and put on trial court martialled essentially before what they call mixed commissions were sent to Algeria either, uh, as prisoners in Algeria, uh, uh, or just simply kicked out. And then in a whole variety of ways where a essentially allowed to take lands to be gay that belonged to, uh, uh, the Arab and Berber populations. Uh, and, uh, therefore they are there. Um, and one of the things about imperialism is that this sort of social imperialism that, that Algeria was sort of a safety valve that, you know, people who couldn't find work or couldn't survive often, you know, when to Algeria because there, it was sort of like the far west, the image of the far west and the u acids. There is a place you can get land, you know, you can get, uh, you know, uh, you can, uh, uh, plant vineyards.

Speaker 1:          16:57          Uh, you can plant fruit and, and you will have a life, you could buy a cafe and you will have a life. And so it was much easier to get out of Vietnam because you didn't have a lot of French people living in Vietnam. And many of the people, uh, uh, in, uh, in Algeria, I did not want the French to pull out a, they associated the empire with their lives. They were French in Algeria, as you know, from reading chips, uh, books. How or why this book, who's retiring, he's just retiring as a party for him, I think today at the University of Melbourne, um, uh, that, that, you know, they, they were, I lost my sentence there, but they were, uh, they were there and their empire was their lives. The French empire was, uh, was their lives. Um, and so, uh, you got a 1 million French, uh, originally French, uh, people, uh, living in Algeria.

Speaker 1:          17:49          You have 200,000 in Tunisia and you have 300,000 in Morocco. Um, and so they poured money into their cafes, uh, in an LG I in Algiers, um, uh, into, uh, their farms into their economic activities. And they were there, some of them were very wealthy, big land owners. They were called the goalpost tall, you know, the big guys, sort of, uh, and they, uh, were determined that, that France would stay in Algeria. Algeria was France French, or they were opposed by the fl and the frog deliberate [inaudible] Nasional, uh, which was, uh, very similar to the Viet Cong, the Viet men, uh, in, um, uh, in Vietnam. Um, and the resistance was also very, uh, as one would reasonably expect, uh, with Islam, with, uh, the Muslim, uh, world. Um, three events in 1956 harden the lines between the [inaudible] that is the settlers, uh, and, uh, [inaudible] fighting for independence.

Speaker 1:          19:02          On the February 6th, the mob in Algiers and greeted the French premiere who's called Muhly, uh, m, O, l, l, e t a, and his choice, uh, for, uh, uh, Governor General, uh, who was considered by the Colo to be to pro Arab, and they greet him with rotten eggs, uh, and with, uh, uh, tomatoes. Uh, and it's a very nasty scene and moldy capitulates and appoints a socialist, uh, uh, more, uh, strident on, on the issue of holding onto Algeria, uh, as governor general. Um, in October, uh, in 1956, there's a conference between the Saltin of Morocco and the leader of the Flna leader of the FLN. In Tunisia. There's, there's, uh, outrage in, uh, the French right wing, a press. And so a French authorities had, uh, the most important delegate at this meeting. A guy called Ben Bella, who is still alive. B E N, B, e, l.

Speaker 1:          20:04          L, a. I just looked the other day to see a, and I think he's still alive. He was born in something like 19, 19, if I remember correctly. They have him kidnapped, uh, and put in a jail near Paris. Uh, it, the, uh, they began to repress critics of this rather bold and totally illegal act, uh, and launch a and C's books that are, uh, against, um, against this movement. And then in November, as some of you know, uh, the French government participates in the whole, um, uh, Suez Canal mess, uh, in part because, uh, Egypt, and we'll see this in a minute, at least briefly, uh, was an important part of, of, of, uh, of, uh, generating a sympathy for, uh, the Algerian, uh, national, uh, resistance, uh, movements. Um, and, uh, the British and the French and bay. There's a cease fire that's, that's for, that's a forced by, um, uh, Russia when the Soviet Union with the aid of, of, uh, of the United States.

Speaker 1:          21:10          Uh, and this seems to be another, a humiliation and what this does as it begins to harden the lines. Now the problem with, you know, with all of this is, is as again, as the army, um, is that now it looks again from the point of view of the, of the, the, the, the high command in the army that that again, uh, the civilians are going to capitulate and there'll be some humiliating withdrawal from Algeria as there had been from Vietnam. But it's a very different cost, isn't it? Because you've got a million Frenchmen in quotes as they see themselves. They know. They didn't accept the, you know, the Frenchness of, of, of the other. As they saw the, unfortunately I saw the, the, the Arab population is the army going to be disgraced again now, um, the, again, World War Two and the defeat in 1940 and people could remember that, has to be seen as a background and the defeat in Vietnam in eight, in 1958, the average military officer had spent at least one 30 months tour of duty in Indochina.

Speaker 1:          22:15          And the average military officer had spent two to four years now Juriah along with a small tour of the occupying, you know, garrisons in West Germany. But, but support was wavering for the war. Citations for wounded soldiers stopped appearing in the official journal is you're now with CCL. 20,000 French soldiers had died in Vietnam. Uh, that's a lot. Um, 9,000, I had died, uh, by 1958 in Algeria. And so there are charges of abandonment and hatred of the officers of the French Communist Party, which seemed to be orchestrating among other people, orchestrating and along with the intellectuals, opposition to the war. And then there was the issue of torture, how topical again, uh, in our, uh, contemporary, the world in which we lived, um, the army had raised, revived an old concept of what they consider to be the real country, the true country, the true France, if you will, representing the real interests of France.

Speaker 1:          23:31          That is the army. Uh, and, uh, the, the legal country, which was, you know, included some of those people who, uh, who, who opposed them. Um, and so, um, within the army and there begin to be not only a discord, but attempts to organize, uh, a right wing groups that became known as the OAS, the secret army that eventually tries to kill Charles de Gaulle himself and launches a campaign of terror in France. Uh, and things that, that you can read about. They try a pooch, uh, in, uh, in, in, in 1961. Sometimes I used to show this film in here, but it's the torture scene is too hard to see and people used to leave. Uh, it's horrible, but it's one of the great movies made in, uh, you know, in our lifetimes. It's the battle of Algiers, the battle of Algiers. Absolutely fantastic. The scene where the woman with a bomb goes into a cafe and places the bomb and looks at families who personally she has nothing against and she knows that they're going to blow up and be killed.

Speaker 1:          24:45          It's one of the great scenes in, uh, in, in film, uh, and it, you think it's a documentary, but it's not. And this is about the French war against the Cosby, against the, the Algerian quarters. Uh, and these two worlds, the French Cologne worlds and the cafes of the Cologne, their extension would be the port of mouth, say the old port of Maasais and, uh, and the world of people, uh, in the casbah. And so what the military wants to do is they want to break, uh, the pair of the Political Military Organization of, of the insurgence. And they want to do this through state terror. So you have the terror of those who are accused of being terrorists, who are blowing up cafes as the independence movement did in, in Vietnam. And the state, uh, uh, terror involving a systematic torture, the murder, the slaughter of, of, uh, a very, uh, ordinary people, many of whom had nothing to do with anything.

Speaker 1:          25:50          And their response is repression first, second. This is from a book by Chillner, I think. I can't remember. He lists these things, uh, on the army. Uh, a totalitarian, a technique of organization, a promising, some reform, but basically just organizing, uh, uh, a basically a military state, uh, the political activism of the army, thus, uh, the Oh Aas, uh, and working on the French population as a whole to argue that those who are against these measures being taken by the French army in the name of France are disloyal and do not represent, uh, the, the true France, the real France as they, uh, they see it. Um, and so the cycle of violence, uh, is, uh, totally, uh, I is totally untenable. And, um, oh, you know, what? The intellectuals, uh, get, uh, involved, um, uh, come to add about outcome. You and, and lots of others, uh, organized opposition to the torture. Ah, AH, the two, this repression to these mass murderers, I, and, uh, uh, the stakes, uh, increase, uh, dramatically. I N it is, um, yeah, it, it is, uh, a total, uh, total, uh, chaos. Can you, who was born in Algeria, um, described the difficult choices for French families who lived in Algeria. Uh, you know, the vast majority were not in favor of mass murder and torture. Uh, he said if he was given the choice between justice and his mother, he would take his mother.

Speaker 1:          27:43          But lots of people, there were again, these cafe owners where people of modest means who are simply caught, uh, in, uh, you know, in the middle of all of this now,

Speaker 2:          27:57          ah,

Speaker 1:          27:59          in on March 13th, 1958, a protest demonstration by French settlers, the Cola in Algiers turned into a military red led insurrection against the French government, a committee of public safety, but not a left wing one, but a right wing one, uh, of rightest, uh, seized power. Ah, Eh, this is in Algeria. And there was a distinct possibility of a military coup d'etat in France. I have a friend called Murray scalp down who's been in the ministry. He's now retired, but as an academic. And when he was in the army back in those days, he was in Dijon and they had, or he was in the air force and he had that, they were told to park planes on the runways in digital. Uh, and this happened in very many places in France because it was, it seemed quite likely that the Aha that is the French paratroopers were going to be landing and that there would be civil war in France, uh, between the army.

Speaker 1:          28:56          Uh, and those army elements that didn't go along with all of this. And those, uh, you know, intellectuals and the, and the communists and the Socialists and all these other people, though a lot of the socialists were quite ambivalent about all of this. No. Charles de Gaulle who had gone off to his small house in a place called Colon Bay, and they do a Zig Lee's, uh, after he didn't get his way, as you know, uh, uh, right after a world war two, I announced that he was ready to serve France again. Uh, many politicians who had real reasons to fear a seizure of power by the military. Uh, they believe that only the towering figure of Charles de Gaulle could save France. And on May 29th, 1958 present [inaudible] c o t y perfume appointed to Gaul premier, uh, moved, uh, point, uh, approved by the National Assembly in early June. He accepted, uh, but on condition that he could rule for by emergency to cre for six months and then ask the nation to approve a new constitution.

Speaker 1:          30:07          Now, de Gaulle had always insisted that France needed a stronger executive authority that the third republic I had fallen basically because no, there weren't any strong leaders to make what he considered the right decisions in the 1930s. But because of the fear of Caesar Ism of Napoleon's, of boodle and Jay, and have these kinds of strong types or a Vichy for that matter of Peyto, uh, the president of France had very little power. Power remained, remained in the chamber, uh, uh, in the Chamber of Deputies. Now the right, including the army was delighted to have de Gaulle, the big guy, uh, serving in what they assumed would be a more or less permanent or lengthy capacity until a new constitution with a strong executive authority could be written. He was one of theirs. He was wounded on a bridge and [inaudible] not the two French denom, but dino in a, with a t in, in Belgium, uh, at the very beginning of war war two, uh, he was born, had been born in the fortress town of Lean, not too far away from, uh, uh, the big garrisons and the big fort there and surely to Gaul would want Algeria to remain, uh, uh, to remain French would need now the new constitution increase the authority of the president.

Speaker 1:          31:33          It was written by Michelle deploy. Hey, by the way, whose son is a very important, uh, uh, gall is oil, no stone called Gaullist anymore, but, um, uh, on paid leader in, in France. Now what it did is it set it, set the term of the presidency at seven years, it's gone back to five now and ended the revolving door ministries, uh, and presence under the Fifth Republic could, uh, now, you know, conduct foreign policy. They appoint prime ministers and they can dissolve parliament. Uh, in September, 1958, 80% of the population approve the constitution of the fifth republic. But what about Algeria? Now the Algerian situation was different than any other war of independence that had been fought before. And there was an internationalization of that war is a brilliant book on this by a guy called Matthew Connolly, who was a, who teaches at Columbia, who was a graduate student here.

Speaker 1:          32:30          And what the, the, the, the National Liberation Front in Algeria was able to do, was to mobilize newspapers, uh, of the left end of the center. Uh, and to use the sort of publicity machine to excite worldwide attention, uh, against, uh, against torture, against the abuses of civilian. There was an internet nationalization of that war and this goes a long way to try to, uh, help the situation of the, of the rebels of the surgeons in, uh, in Algeria. Now. Um, so what's he going to do? And so on the 4th of June, 1958, he goes to LGS and he's welcomed by, by the throngs, not the Algerians, but the cone. Oh, by the way, the Harkema the, the hockey two names. I need to explain the hierarchy where the Algerians who fought for the French and if they stayed in Algeria after the war, they are toast. And so they, and then the French, what they did is they brought them back and put them in a not really internment camps, but sort of they put them into uh, into areas, can reserved areas for them.

Speaker 1:          33:42          And of course their relations with other Algerians are not very good. Uh, and it's a very awkward situation. The other name here is my sue, who is one of the chief torturers, uh, in the who just died a couple years ago, uh, in the army. So he goes to Algeria and he says he gives his classic speech of noncommittal. He told the settlers on the 4th of June, 1958 I have understood you, I know what you have tried to do here, but he had already decided that the cost of France continuing the war was to grow, were too great, that the war was to decisive. And he removed many of the generals responsible for the coup d'etat in Algeria from their post for somebody for whom nationalism, as we'll see on Wednesday, underlie underlay his basic philosophy of life. This seemed to be an astonishing turnaround, a stab in the back by a military man.

Speaker 1:          34:35          And as the Dreyfus affair had revealed, had revealed in the 1890s and the Vichy years had confirmed a right wing anti democratic tradition survived in the officer Corps Corps. And so they felt absolutely betrayed. And so the OAS, which had already, but we're already existed in reality, they try to kill the gall. The closest they get a is at a place called [inaudible] clay come out outside of Paris where they machine gun, uh, his big limousine and they're, you know, 20 or 30 bullet holes in there. And it's hard to miss a guy who was her power forward size. Uh, you know, six, seven, huge, huge man, but he emerges unscathed. There was absolutely incredible. And the plant bombs in Paris, this is terrorism to blow up and to terrorize the population. The goal assumes, uh, uh, assumes, uh, uh, emergency powers again this time for a year, but not in the interest of the army.

Speaker 1:          35:30          His interest is to pull France. This is the ultimate in reality. Politique, uh, is to pull France out of Algeria and there's a volt for Algerian independence held in 1961 in July and 15 million vote week and 5 million vote no, and there's a new attempt in Algeria by army officers to organize an insurrection and as soon put put down, uh, and um, uh, Algeria becomes free. Now in the last minute. That remains me to me that I have left. One of the things that is interesting now in the last 20 years is that when the national front, the right wing party of John, now he looked Penn who had demisse dismissed by the way, the death camps and the Holocaust is a minor detail. I'm quoting him exactly. And who applauded the drowning of immigrants in the San River by his thugs. Uh, when he, when he first came to the attention of the world with a see a series of astonishing electoral victories or at least a good showings in various places in France.

Speaker 1:          36:43          One of the things that people first who followed at first noted is that he didn't do that well and the tradition anymore than anywhere else in the more traditionally Catholic parts of France. That is Brittany or one of the departments where we had his first big success, a near shot two in a place called [inaudible], but the places that he did astoundingly well, we're on the Mediterranean and in the volt clues. That is where avenue is and our launch. Why it's not the, the large immigrant populations from North Africa who are voting for somebody that wants to drown them or send them back to where they came from. They're not voting for him. The people that voted for him massively are the Cologne, the PN. Wow. Not all of them, but it was they who had to leave in 1960 and 61 and 62 in many cases, getting out, quick packing up photos, whatever they could take with them in some cases, extreme cases and going to France where they bought cafes, orange groves, et cetera. And they remembered and they hate it. And that's what changes did change the inner dramatic way in area that had always been left wing, at least since the middle of the 19th century. And turns it into the bastion of for awhile of the National Front. And then things got more complicated. But it went back to these events in, uh, in Algeria. And what happened there that shaped not only France, but movements in other countries. See you on Wednesday.
