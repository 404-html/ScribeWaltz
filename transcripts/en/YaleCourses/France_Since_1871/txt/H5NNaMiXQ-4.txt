Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. I want to just finish off cause la trying to do the collaboration and one week is not easy. I want to talk a little bit more about, uh, Vichy and the juice. And then I mentioned something about [inaudible] haul the late president of France and the whole question of, of forgetting and then remembering and then I'll, I'll, uh, leap into a I to resistance. Um, just at the beginning, I mean, just to put the perspective of, of how the French Vichy forces or government's treatment of the Jews compares to other, to other countries. Um, that, yeah, in, uh, November of 1942 that's a crucial period because is that point that the Germans occupied the, the so called free zone or, or Vichy zone. And at that point Vichy authorities hand over the Jews, uh, who had been imprisoned, I in the Vichy zone, a to the Nazis and they had mark their ration cards.

Speaker 1:          01:05          You know, you had to ration cards, you had to have cards to get a little bit of butter and all this kind of stuff. They mark them Zarif. Uh, or as we've settled on the cock, uh, which meant Jew, which made it easier, uh, for, uh, the German or the French police, um, uh, tourist them. And, and, uh, so they, they, they, not only did they, uh, well, I had, well, they had to sort of turn over of what was left of their authority. Uh, but they, they did, did, um, uh, they did, uh, uh, more than the, uh, than they needed to do. And things were so bad for the Jews at the hand of the Vichy police that, that, uh, uh, when thousands of foreign Jews I had gone into niece had somehow gotten in, in, in, uh, gotten into Nice, uh, which, um, that which Mussolini's fascist troops, uh, had occupied, um, that the, you know, they, they essentially, uh, uh, uh, you know, arrested them or made it easier for the, uh, for the people there to be identified and to be in, to be taken by.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Um, uh, by the fascist a and an October, 1942, when the u s government proposed to take a thousand Jewish kids whose parents had been deported without them a PR Laval, um, who would get his after the war. And her neighbor who's gay, who is the, uh, police had a, who was when it was, uh, uh, uh, murdered, uh, before his trial by a guy seeking publicity for his book. They replied that only certified orphans could be given exit visas. And that's because you couldn't prove that the parents had already died in the death camps. They would not allow the Jewish children to be deported or to deport it, to be exiled, to be refugees, uh, in the United States. So, and, and Lavalin buscape, both of whom were frenetic antisemites knew this very well. So essentially they just condemn them to, to, um, uh, to eye eye to their fate and, and the children couldn't lose.

Speaker 1:          03:03          I mean, you couldn't leave. And I'm more than five weeks following the allied invasion of Normandy, which is, you know, what's on the 6th of June of 1944. The Vichy police were, we're still arresting Jews. And right up until the last, until the last days, uh, and so many of the cases to the media, people in the police, uh, who were gunned down at the end, at the end of the war, during, during liberation had been, you know, these were people who had gone out of their way simply to keep on arresting Jews and, and, and killing Jews. Uh, when it was clear that the allies were going to come in and, and, and, and chase the, uh, the Germans out, uh, in the eight months of 1944 before the liberation, almost 15,000 Jews, uh, were, uh, deported and deported means, uh, to the death camps. Um, so, um, anyway, three quarters of all the Jews who were arrested in France during the entire period were arrested, uh, by, uh, the French, uh, the French police, a German director, I mean French director, our director, I were, or where the heads of the academy, that is, you know, Francis divided into academy.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Uh, that is the whole structure of education from the universities down to two, the Matranel to, to, uh, uh, kindergarten's, uh, the rector's a domestic Jews from their post. And you met one of them, uh, Mark Block of my am I said lost a job twice. He lost it in straws and then in [inaudible]. Yay. Um, and in my say that the order of doctors purge juice from the right to practice and complained that there was still Jews in medical school. Now and again, they didn't have to do this. The, the, you know, the Germans weren't saying, yeah, you know, they had other things, uh, you know, security and things that they were worried about security in quotes. Uh, but it was just done, uh, because they wanted to do it. Uh, and this the same thing in the legal profession, uh, where, uh, lots of magistrates, a as in the case of, of, uh, of, of, of Hitler's Germany.

Speaker 1:          05:02          And, and, uh, in Weimar before Hitler came to power, the magistrates who admitted them, and most of them had been trained under, uh, the second right. That is before World War One. And maybe they flocked to, uh, uh, the extreme right. Uh, very, uh, uh, quickly public opinion in general did not criticize measures taken against the Jews, uh, at least until 1942 and as I said the other day, they were, there were, um, uh, so many, I did not see nations of people that, that were, uh, notes that said, uh, just to, to have kind of come home with Ai, these reef, you know, I'm sure that my neighbor, he's a Jew and the cost of this were, we're rather serious. So what do we know about the reactions of non Jewish French men and women to what was going on? Well, late in 1940 900,000 people visited a, an exposition that v she had put up in the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:54          Uh, in Paris, uh, about the alleged links of Freemasons that is free thinkers to Jews and to the British. Uh, so I mean, if you went into it, I mean, this was just the equivalent a, well, it wasn't art, the artistic equivalent, but it was rather like the, the, uh, if you went to that, you were going in this with the same sort of spirit is if you went to, uh, one of the art shows to Hitler point put on about a decade and art deco and inner Jewish art and, and this sort of stuff. Um, another 114,000 people saw the exposition when it on tour of the provinces. Um, another expedition called the Jew in France attracted in 1942, 250,000 visitors in Paris and 100,000 in the provinces. Um, the German film, uh, that, that the to which the Nazis, uh, uh, in other writers and Germany's had flocked called the juice Seuss, which ends with, with a Jew being hung, uh, to the, to the frenzied applaud of audiences, uh, was shown in France.

Speaker 1:          06:56          And people did go to see it. Not huge numbers of people. Uh, and there were even demonstrations in, in two cities, but in tour, uh, you know, on the wire, uh, people aligned up around the block in order to come in and see this, this essentially, um, a Hitler, um, uh, uh, uh, not, not see, uh, publicity, uh, uh, a movie. Uh, and the collaboration is a newspaper as you see Paul too, or I am everywhere. Uh, sold a hundred, so 250,000 copies in 1942 a and 300,000 by 1944. Yes, 1944 a, which ends as you know, in August in 1944. Doesn't end in August, but, but, uh, you know, the Germans are, are, are Paris falls and at the end of August, 1944 and then gradually the war moves, uh, to the east, um, in, uh, uh, a novel, a by a guy called a Lucia hobbit.

Speaker 1:          07:55          J, uh, called the lay a, they call him would have sold 65 very right wing thing, sold 65,000 copies, which is a huge sale in France. I, it's first month out. And is published your claim that only the shortage of paper, a war, a war rationing of kept him from selling another 200,000 copies. And here's a glimpse of what is in the novel. I wished the victory of Germany cause her war is my war. All my machine. Oh my machine gun. So often caressed in my dreams facing the despised gangs of the Popular Front to gilded ghettos of Sodom a hundred. Well ane machinegun burse he exuded about the site of Jews wearing yellow stars, the Jewish backless, the Jewish micro and all this now and all in the French record is not very good. Uh, even, uh, compared with other countries, uh, they expect is spectacular.

Speaker 1:          08:50          The exception being Slovakia, uh, which was, uh, uh, certainly one of the worst places could possibly have been, uh, as a Jew and, and not too far from, from, uh, uh, Os fits across the frontier in, uh, in Poland. I was turned over both natives and foreign zoos to Nazis, uh, right away. Uh, Vichy France was the only country in which local authorities deported Jews without the presence of occupying forces. And in Hungary, which had had antisemitic legislation since 1920, even the vicious admiral called whore, the, he was not in this course, but he was vicious. Anyway, HR, t, h y m I handed over, no Jews, uh, who are Hungarian Jews, uh, until, uh, German occupation in 1944 a and then mark, only 7% of the Jews disappeared. I helped by Danes and the proximity of Sweden. The motto was just across the straights.

Speaker 1:          09:47          It's still just across the straits, except there's a bridge now. Um, uh, yet France was the country in which a great, the greatest percentage of Jews are, a great percentage of Jews, uh, survived. Uh, the war in all, only 24% of the Jews were deported as opposed to 78% in the Netherlands and 45% from Belgium and ultimately 50% from, from, uh, Hungary. Now there's another thing going on too. I mean, just look at the map. Uh, there's nowhere to hide in the Netherlands or in Belgium of basically in Belgium is flat. There's no, uh, and I'll give you some examples of, of where Jews say were saved because of, uh, of, of, of geographic, uh, uh, of geographic, kind of doing a, I mean, the, uh, uh, of the lay of the land, but such figures that were marshaled by those apologizing for the Vichy regime regime and to repeat something that they're borrowing from Robert Paxton.

Speaker 1:          10:43          And I said the other day, a Vichy might have a save the French state. I in quotes, uh, but it lost, uh, the French. Uh, there were French, the French nation. Now what about resistance? Uh, first of all, what about me to all Francois? Me Too long. Um, was the president of France between 1981, may of 1981. And, um, uh, she would have been out, uh, when w 1981 and 91 was it, it was [inaudible] 91. The end of his term, I can't remember. No, it was 14 years. It should be 81 to [inaudible] 95 and now the term is five years. Uh, Francois Mitterrand was, uh, uh, what was a socialist, uh, who, um, started out his term in 1981 with lots of, of, of socialist, um, economic policies and sort of backed up off from them, but became somebody who was extremely popular in France. Um, and as he was dying at the, toward the very end of his life, uh, maybe a year before he died, he had very serious illness.

Speaker 1:          11:48          The journalist knew it. And unlike the journalist in the United States, you know, where it's something like that would be leaked immediately. Uh, a journalist did not leak this fact, but it was quite obvious that that falls on me too. Mom was, was it was ill. Um, and it, toward the end of his life to facts about his life came up. It came out. Um, the first is that he had a very old daughter, uh, from, uh, Aaliyah is all, if it had nothing to do with his wife, I'm necessarily common in a, in the political France. But the second and for our purposes is much more important, uh, was that he had himself been a collaborator. This was the dark secret. And He poured out his heart. Uh, he said he had something he had to tell. Uh, he wasn't telling himself that he had to tell the French people and that he had collaborated early in the war.

Speaker 1:          12:32          In fact, somebody came up with a picture of him in a right wing demonstration with the quad differ or one of these groups against immigrants, uh, before World War Two. Now he had second thoughts, uh, fairly early into the war. And he ends up, you know, he heads an important branch of, of the resistance organization. Uh, but he came to grips with his own past, uh, as France was attempting to come to grips at the very same time. Now, now to the resistance who resist maybe. And why did they resist? And again, just as the question of collaboration, uh, was a party and the discovery of massive collaboration. And it wasn't just a few people, a few elites. And this was the, you know, the dark secret of the dark years as Julian Jackson called, uh, this period. Um, so, uh, is the case with the resistance.

Speaker 1:          13:29          And as I began the lecture last time I'm in Charleston, golf, uh, was determined that the, the France of the fourth republic was to be built around his large body. Uh, and a part of that was to try to convince people, uh, in France and abroad, uh, that the godless, we're the only resistors and that they had heard the crackle of his, uh, voice imposing voice across the airwaves. And June 18th, uh, 19, uh, 40, uh, now, what can we say now? First of all, that the communists were arguably the most important or most effective resistors, uh, during, uh, during the period. Uh, and it's certainly that after the Jews or the Communists suffered, uh, most, uh, Vichy not only handed the Nazis lists of those, they arrested as communists, but also executed a many of them themselves beginning in 1941 for no other reason. Then there, um, uh, uh, political affiliation.

Speaker 1:          14:35          V She's minister of the Interior chose Communist rather than those he called good freshmen to be gunned down by German firing squads, uh, in the fortress of Bovela Vella. Yeah. Outside of Paris. Now, uh, the, the socialists presence. And Socialist presence in the resistance is an organized, forced, was not as great. But there's some, several obvious reasons for that. The communists have benefited from the fact that they had sales and virtually every commune in France, and that's what they call them, sell. Uh, there are still in our village of 300 people, uh, a communist party cell, which involves basically just five or six of our friends, uh, who, or anything. Then the about the communist of, of Moscow in all of this. Um, but who are defenders of, of, uh, of, uh, uh, uh, those who have no one else, uh, to defend them. And that sort of thing, including are different.

Speaker 1:          15:28          The former, uh, a school teacher and some of our best friends in the world. And occasionally in my mailbox I'll find an invitation from the sell of Bala Zuke, uh, to a communist party, a gathering, uh, where, uh, they, they, they've asked me to talk on the, on the collapse of a, of capitalism. You don't have to explain to them that capitalism isn't probably going to collapse in the near future. And then we all, after some political discussion, we all drink, uh, uh, illegal wine. Essentially. There's this wine called clamp clamp, tall as in Clinton, but it's nothing to do with Clinton. Um, that, that is was called those sort of the vat food a little bit. Uh, and it grows, it grows all over the place, the grapes do, and, and, and because it grows. So, uh, so wildly, uh, uh, it became sort of illegal to produce a particular grape.

Speaker 1:          16:13          And so one of the parts of being a party of resistance is you don't pay any attention to that. Uh, and to that extent, I agree with that. And so we would drink these bouts of Trento and I, I've done, I've drunk a bottles of Clariton tone with, with, um, uh, a guy who joined the party who is still alive. He and his wife joined the Communist Party in 1934 a and he is still, uh, he, he's a painter and he painted lots of people, a lots of the painting. He was done. I was in prison, uh, in Paris and when he was very lucky to be, uh, to escape a execution, but in part because of the complicity of, of a guard and we think that they joined the communist party two years before the, uh, before the, uh, the Spanish civil war, uh, is just incredible.

Speaker 1:          16:56          So the, the, the point of this is that, uh, the, the advantage of the company's Party had, is that they already have organized, they have people in most area, every large village who represent the communist party. So it's easy to organize your comrades, uh, cause you know who they are and you can trust them after all these years. So they have some advantages there. Another advantage of the communist party had a, and as I alluded to this before, is there, they were basically the party of the Shemi know, uh, of the railroad, the railroad workers and the engineers in any station. You go to go to a wall sometime where I teach and I go to often who we have friends there, um, and look in the, in the railroad station. It's just, it's just unbelievable. There's this huge plaque with about 200 names of Shemi, no, a railroad workers, uh, in the largest sense who, uh, uh, were killed, executed by the Nazis, uh, or by, uh, uh, by the, the French fascist, uh, during the war and even in every railroad station.

Speaker 1:          17:55          So the advantage there is that as you know, this from seeing all these movies I'm sure about the resistance, is pretty easy to blow up railroad tracks. Uh, and so what they were able to do is blow up, you know, how can you watch the whole whole train line between a digital and Leon and my say, for example, uh, there wasn't no Tj, obviously that just started on the 28th of September, 1981. Uh, so, uh, it's easy for a couple of Liga of the guys to go out and, and to blow up, um, uh, uh, block the track and it takes a long time to fix the track and they blow up that one and then, and they fixed that one, then boom, further on down the line. Uh, so, uh, they were very active in the north and you know, and Lilo [inaudible] Bay to acquire, uh, [inaudible] to, uh, so, and, and, and they were very much a part of the stage.

Speaker 1:          18:41          Jt that is the General Confederation of Labor. And they were more apt to be communists, uh, uh, than other, any other, uh, party. Uh, and this is true in the suburbs of Paris, um, Eh, eh, as well. So, um, they also had great strength. My metal, metallurgical, uh, workers, uh, and thus metallurgical metallurgical workers have access to, to flammable explosive materials and, and this sort of stuff. Uh, and so, um, they also, Dan organized very damaging industrial strikes, particularly in 1944. And these strikes help give people a sense of hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel. And of course, the, you know, the beat people listening to BBC and that sort of thing. A story about BBC, uh, two stories, uh, again, I hate to keep referring to this village, but I wrote a book on this village called histones and Bazooka. And, and at the end of it, uh, one of the two last chapters about the schools, but a, a school, but I had to cover it, you know, do Vichy and I headed to Vichy very, very delicately, very delicately.

Speaker 1:          19:45          Uh, it was obviously that in our village that the priest, that we don't have a pretty steady more there, but the priest was at Peyton east and lots of people hated it. I'm not just because of his politics, but a lot of people liked his politics. Uh, but he used to sort of shout at people in the confessional and there's all sorts of funny stories. He insisted that women sit on one side of the church still and that men, uh, on the other, but, um, I, this was a village. This is a village that wasn't an area of great resistance even though arms were parachuted down to, um, uh, on a plateau near where we live. This is done here in, in, uh, in the [inaudible], but there were two people in a, in the resistance and one of, uh, is still alive and very old ma'am.

Speaker 1:          20:26          Uh, and they would hide things. This is the pay calcare. I mean, it's a limestone country in big, big goat, uh, uh, you know, caves along the river and you can hide things easily there. And I wanted to talk to this man about the, about the resistance and I, uh, he's the uncle of a friend and I invited finite, invited he and his wife over and I made clear, I wanted to ask him some questions, not let as a journalist, but, but I'd been there in this place for 20 years and I knew the guy a little bit. And, uh, above all I knew was his, his family. And he said yes, he would come and he would talk to me about it because I'd been there so long. Um, but then he never showed up. He didn't want to talk about it. Uh, he couldn't talk about it.

Speaker 1:          21:06          Uh, because of, of, uh, you know, it's really like people coming back from world war one a, the people that talked and boasted were the ones who would dress up in military uniforms. When's towns had been liberated. It's if they had been there in the beginning, out in the bushes, the Mckee, the resistors. But he was a real one. We didn't want to talk about it, but I also knew speaking in BBC, and this is the transition that I had heard, the story that a man in Bala Zuke had, um, had a, in this particular village had alerted the authorities, the Vichy authorities, the fact that that some people were listening to BBC, now you could be executed for listening to BBC. That was a capital crime. Uh, and I mean, often they wouldn't, if you were somebody they knew, they wouldn't do that or whatever.

Speaker 1:          21:50          But you know, you denounce, uh, you denounce somebody for listening to the BBC. And that's not, it's not as bad as denouncing somebody's saying he's a Jew, but, but it ain't good. Uh, so I ask his friend of mine, um, an older man who could remember the war and I said, what about that? Uh, and I wait until the appropriate circumstances to ask him. He said, no, no, it's just, uh, I don't, I don't pay any attention to it. It's just rumor. It's just rumors, a vicious rumor that he's on the, you know, rumor, they believe rumors and all that. But so in franchise JBS up on Tay, I kinda snuck around a little bit, serpent head around and I asked some, uh, you know, trusted people who are very discreet. What about it? And it turned out it was his father. It was his father who did it and who was associated with the priest in the village.

Speaker 1:          22:42          And I knew this man, he died long time ago, 10 or 15 years ago. But I knew the man and such secrets are they best buried? Uh, I buried it in the French edition of my book. It's not an ad, it's not an in the Dutch addition either. Uh, it's in the English edition, but hidden, hidden away. Uh, cause he'll never know it. Never see and couldn't read the English edition. So all this stuff, you know, it's kind of delicate, uh, that whole business about, um, anyway, so, uh, uh, people, the, the comedies party became the party of the 75,000 martyrs. A because probably that many communists, uh, uh, died. Whereas this, the socialist had a lack of, uh, you know, a lack of, of, of, um, uh, Oregon structural organization and many of their leaders like Leon Blum. Uh, we're in, uh, uh, in a jail, uh, and as a, and as I said last time just passing there, it also was it I left when Catholic resistance, Social Catholics and no resistance publication condemned racism and antisemitism with the vigor vigor of the newspaper.

Speaker 1:          23:47          Tim went, our team went asha, Katya or Christian witness basically. Um, so, and what about Jews? It's hard to resist if you're being tracked down and being arrested. Uh, it's, um, and by the way, remember Pierre Leval, uh, who was the prime minister through much of the period. He was the, on another occasion when, um, uh, the Germans insisted that that French parents, uh, that, that French adults who are Jews be transported from a certain sector, uh, but they didn't ask for the children. Pure level said, send the children to for me to vi Pi three. I mean that in a very ironic sense, you know, family work, uh, country family values, put the children together. And so the children bounced off in the, in the, in the railroad car. But in fact, I know this Australian guy who was a, a young, very young man.

Speaker 1:          24:45          I in Paris, who's Jewish guy called Jack Adler. Uh, and I met him in Melbourne a few years ago, and he, um, uh, survived the war, but he was 16. He was in an underground Jewish resistance group in Paris, and he wrote a book about it. Then he went off and made a lot of money, uh, in, in Melbourne. And he got out, he survived. I became a, you know, a bear, a cake producer. And then he went back in and got his phd in French history at the University of Melbourne with my friend Peter McPhee. And He, um, uh, then he wrote this book, very good book on the Jewish resistance. But, you know, Jewish resistance was organized in, in, in, in Paris where there were, there were lots of Jews and had every conceivable reason to resist, uh, but only in cities like Volvo where they were all getting locked up, uh, uh, very quickly and in Leone and other places.

Speaker 1:          25:30          Uh, so, uh, but, but this, the reason I that I insist on this fact that there wasn't an organized Jewish resistance is because among the sort of antisemitic residuals and the postwar period is, is that the accusation that Jews didn't resist, they just kind of went off to be slaughtered and all of that and didn't put up a fight, which of course this is obviously not true. Now, the role of Protestants has been often privileged in the discussion of the resistance. Um, again, to repeat what I said, uh, lots of the most part, most the greatest percentage of Protestants are down here again in the owl dash and in the gap down here and this event mountains basically also up in the Jerome on the other side of the, uh, in the valleys that go down to the Rhone River into the drum, t, r. O, m, e.

Speaker 1:          26:17          Um, and the most famous case of, of Jewish children being saved is that of a Protestant village, which I'm going to write it on the board because it deserves it, uh, called the Lewis Chambong sooner Lino, right on the edge of the owl dash in, uh, near, near the [inaudible]. But, but, but in the mountains and what they did in this little teeny village as they organize this kind of a false id identification network, and they took Jewish kids from Santa tn and Leonel in other places in that region. I mean, that, that region is an area that always sent, you know, lots of immigrants to, uh, it's very Catholic region. But in this case, in that village, Very Protestant, uh, had sent lots of immigrants to Leon and to a Sante Tien. And so, um, they have, they adopted all sorts of Jewish kids. And then when the, when the Germans would come through, uh, you know, you could hear them coming, they would hide the kids or they'd go off into the woods and, and, but there seem to be an awful lot of kids in the Germans would go through, my God, these people must be very Catholic.

Speaker 1:          27:22          They're having babies all over the place. Look at all these kids. And they never figured it out. And in fact that they were, they were, um, they were, uh, uh, they were Protestant and, uh, lots of, uh, of people were saved. And there's a document you're on this, um, guy called Rod QED, word HR. Edward, um, D has on two really interesting books on probably the best books on the resistance that are in English. And he made, he noted something very interesting about, uh, a commune, a village in, in the, a couple of villages in the Savanna mountains, uh, in which Protestants resisted. And he noticed that, you know, in, in that part of France, the religious wars had been the 16th, 17th, and 18th century had been very bloody and they'd pitted basically the armies of the king of the, of the most Catholic king against a, um, even though that's the title that they call it a Spanish name.

Speaker 1:          28:08          But anyway, uh, of, of Louis the 14th and all these people against a Protestants and he noticed that one, particularly a resistant village, that's a huge mission cross overlooking the village that had been planted there, uh, in the 16th century as a, as a sign of, of, or in the 17th century, I don't know which war it was as a sign of victory of conquest by the state and the Catholic Church over these Protestants does. Looking at something like that all the time, make you more, want to resist a regime is closely tied to right wing Catholicism. Well, who knows? But Protestants were overrepresented in the resistance. But as I said, Catholics resistance, resistant to, and then the, you know, the, uh, from the point of view of the resistance, or I suppose anybody looking at this, uh, it's easy to, uh, uh, denounced, uh, many, uh, uh, Catholic archbishops and bishops who didn't give one damn about the Jews and who embraced Vichy with, with a great passion.

Speaker 1:          29:07          But yet in many places of Catholic, uh, villages that had Catholics, uh, resisting, and most people in France are nominally Catholics. The role of priests Wa wa was considerable, uh, that Po and the role of teachers were of an ste to have a primary school teachers, uh, was, uh, important as well. Now, priests, I don't know what you priests and, and, and, uh, um, and the school teachers that are kind of opinion makers or whatever the phrase is, I mean, they are, you know, they are people that, along with the mayor that, that, that, that sort out problems in a village. And so if you have a priest who FISM enough of this stuff, you know, he can throw his weight. Uh, and to do good things. Uh, and, uh, well, again, look at the payoff was wrong. Uh, father, uh, a Xiong tonight. Um, so, um, uh, again, the, the, the situation of, of, um, of, uh, of the Catholic churches is extremely, um, uh, is extremely, uh, complicated.

Speaker 1:          30:06          Um, and the real explosion of, of, of work on the resistance has been dominated by the stories of ordinary people taking very unordinary choices, big time choices. A friend of mine called John Suites who taught at University of Kansas. It K u, um, he did a book on Claremore fit hall, um, because that's where the sorrow and the pity he had the town that it had been focused on. And his book is called choices in Vichy, France. Uh, and he was not critical of the packs and the, which is the Canon after all. Uh, but he argued that you have to give him a wider, a description of a ride or definition of resistance in trying to determine how many people resisted packs and thinks that about 2% of the French population resisted. John thinks sweets things, and it's a very good book. Choices in Vichy France thinks that, uh, uh, uh, oh, maybe about, you know, I can't remember what he says.

Speaker 1:          31:00          18 or 20% of the population resistance. Well, what does resistance, uh, it's, I mean, lots of people took big time chances. Smuggling weapons, you're going to get killed if they catch you, you're gone, toast, finished. Uh, but you know, if you know, you're in a movie theater and they're doing the showing the documentary, I mean, before the, the film, uh, there's always this two minute news Saturday session, which I can remember as a tiny little boy, you know, with always the same kind of voices, uh, uh, giving the news. And this would be the German, the German news translated into French. And if you whistle and you boo whistling is mooing, uh, uh, in France, or if you refuse to step off the sidewalk to let a German officer pass, I mean that it's self as a, uh, a passive resistance. And so, uh, certainly more people resisted according to this definition.

Speaker 1:          31:49          Uh, then, uh, uh, and this was a type of, of choice, uh, in, uh, in, in Vichy, France. Um, one of the ways that people resisted with, for example, passing, uh, these, uh, printed these newspapers that sort of mimeographed. Uh, and there was a whole clandestine press and it was very important because it would tell people in Normandy that there had been strikes and Sante Tien, uh, or strikes and Maasais or would give news on where people thought that the, you know, the battles were going in, that kind of thing. How do you get newspapers around? Well, you just take a bunch of them on a bus, a bus and Leo for example, and the bus is going along plastic rom plus Bella Coola, and you just hold your hand out the window and drop all the leaflets, or they'd be leaflets against when the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra played in the Lille, uh, somebody did that.

Speaker 1:          32:36          They took all these, uh, these little handwritten and mimeographed, uh, uh, uh, pieces of paper that said, no, you know, don't ask, don't go assist. Don't go listen to the Berlin Philharmonic. Let us resist. And that's a form of resistance, to not going to hear the Berlin Philharmonic and drop them just like that. And, and, and, uh, the old ones, a very effective center of the resistance I told you about mark block and there because in the owner, these things called en Francais Tabula, which are basically not tunnels, but there are passages that that began in the 16th century to protect silk from being a raw silk from being rained on in a pretty rainy climate. And so the Tub Moodle also grew up the quote who's, which is this, this, uh, uh, old working class neighborhood that was outside of only a next to Leon, uh, in 1852 and these trouble, you can duck into these trouble.

Speaker 1:          33:26          And that's why the resistance was so important in, in Leon Paul. And that's, that's where mark block went when Mark Block was, had, had gone down to here. He was up in, uh, near gay here and he just kind of anxious and he says, I should go do something. So he goes to Leon and he participates in, you know, in the resistance. And of course, he pays for it with his life. Um, what about women? Now? For decades, nobody paid attention to the role of women in the resistance. Now, women were, were very rare in the heels. By the way, the term McKee means, uh, basically organized resistors. A mucky in French or Leymah key are, is kind of a, a brush, a that's very sick brush behind, which you could hide in Corsica. That's where it comes from originally. And then in the south of France on what you call in French, the [inaudible], the, you know, really dry rocky, uh, uh, countryside.

Speaker 1:          34:20          And so by 1943, by the end of 1943, in many parts of France, the Mckee rule by night that they have increased in their forces are swollen by people moving into the resistance. Now, some people, you know, had to feed these folks. Some people had the darn their socks or give, you know, nip them things just to stay, uh, stay warm some way. People had to pass messages and they're all sorts of stories about women on bicycles. Uh, it's, it's one of these sort of things that you see in movies, but if women on bicycle sort of charming, a young woman, charming the guards, uh, you know, if they, if they have the bad luck to fall upon the militia or a German guards and having a written message, which is a terrible idea, but at least to have a verbal communication of passing messages into the hills.

Speaker 1:          35:13          Now the largest resistance movement in most effective in Europe by far the Noah, uh, is in you, in ex Yugoslavia. And, and that's because of the terrain in Bosnia, Herzegovina and cross he Croatia and in Serbia and they have entire divisions with hospitals and mobile hospitals and all of that with the British, a parachuting things in. But if you look at this map, it's not surprising to see why there's very little resistance here. Can, where are you going to hide there? There's nowhere to hide. So the Mckee and the resistance, I mean there are Maki all over the place, but, but it was easier in the south and it's by the end of 43 that I said last time about the find a k on your door in the morning with someone was there to put k on the door in the morning. And uh, uh, and, and there you go.

Speaker 1:          35:57          Uh, and so the role of women has been much more important that then than people had thought. And there are all sorts of, uh, uh, why a big literature are growing literature on this now. And also in some places and [inaudible] for example, the numbers of Mucky [inaudible] of people in the Ma, the resistance of my key, uh, were swollen. It was swollen by refugees from Spain or even from Poland. Uh, so you have a, you know, you have these people living out there. Uh, and, uh, the, the only three times in France during the period do they try to take on German military units in a pitched battle? Bad idea, terrible idea. One is right near Claremont fell, uh, here. Uh, one is in the vacuum, uh, near Gunna Oberth down here. And the third, I don't remember where it is. Um, so that, that's, that's w w w that doesn't work very well because they don't have the kind of big time tanks and, and that, that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          36:59          But they were able to regroup. I mean, are places near us. There's a village way up in the hill. It's God, it's so beautiful. Uh, church fabolous church, a place called teen with his, uh, with his Roman, uh, poor of Forte, a Parte, a entryway. That's just fabulous. And there, there was a whole bunch of these people up there and they had some fairly considerable arms. This is the pitch battle, but then they get denounced. There are always people that are going to sell other people's lives away. There's no question about it. They were true believers, uh, in the regime that's going to sell people away. And the next thing they know and another case near us to next thing they know, Bam, here come the parachute to serve coming in there and the tanks are rolling up or the, you know, the smaller vehicles with machine gun room at big machine guns in this kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          37:41          And they are gone. They are just massacred. And there all sorts of places around where we live. We're where people were, were shot. And if you help, if you are a woman or you or anyone, you're a priest, you're a, uh, you're anyone, you're a school teacher and you help people and the, and they, you know, and they catch you. And particularly if you've killed the German, you know, you're gone. That's it. I told her the story of that bud, the woman the other day, it was a collaborator up on, uh, you know, along the Rhone River and they blew her brains out. And, and, and uh, the resisters did, and in pennants as it were in punishment, they, uh, just, you know, the execute people just take hostages and execute them. Begin with people you think are communists and they just shoot, shoot, shoot the other people. Look what happened in, in next check in Czech Republic and next Czechoslovakia in Prague.

Speaker 1:          38:28          I've gone to the place where Richard Heidrick was one of the very worst of the worst. I was assassinated by these, uh, by, um, uh, by check McKee. And he's gone down as he's coming in and he fights them, you know, when he finally, mortally wounded and all that. And, and they go, they go and they hide in this church that I went to visit and Prague a couple of years ago. And, you know, they of course parish horribly, but they took an entire village called ladies and kill everybody. It's rather like Sarah farmers book orders are gone, which really needs no needs. No, uh, um, Eh, you know, it needs to know, uh, a discussion now. Now, what, what led people? Well, first of all, one, one quick point is that again, I, I've said that, that if you took a map of, of, of, I've said this I guess maybe more recently, but it's of, of decriminalization, uh, allegiance to the French revolution in 1,790, the elections of 1949 in 19, uh, 81, uh, you would have virtually the same [inaudible] are left and the virtually the same day pop them all are right.

Speaker 1:          39:30          That doesn't work for the resistance. Brittany, which has always been extremely conservative, uh, was a big resistance area. The same goes with rural Normandy. And of course that's the most well known because of the invasion. You know, the, the, the Americans and the British and the Australians and New Zealanders and Canadians, uh, invade here. Uh, the Germans thought they were going to invade here, but they invade here. Um, and they'd already, uh, the resistance that already taken out lots of rail lines and things like that. In general, Eisenhower said that they were worth two divisions or something like that. A rural normity is always been conservative, so that that interpretation doesn't really work. Uh, there was lots of resistance in ovarian, which is conservative. Uh, and there was tons of resistance in the limo. Zheng Tao, uh, thus explaining that one reason that explaining the massacre and the 10th of June, 1944, or I'll do a sort of done.

Speaker 1:          40:24          So, uh, uh, the g you can't, there's no kind of geographic determinism, a regional determinism. There is some geographic determinism that is the lay of the land, but there's no regional, there's not a predisposed disposition or Brett told not to resist because they do resist the resistant. Not everybody, but the resistance is, is important in Brittany and the sort of kinds of places. Now without question, the big defining moment swelling, the ranks of the resistance is this visa do 12, I only got 12 in February. The s t o w at that is the service of obligatory work where the Germans say, we want men from each region to go to Germany and work in the factories. The reason is they have so many people, dad, so many killed, uh, and they need work. And this swells, um, uh, the ranks of resistors. This forces families and individuals to make choices in Vichy, France.

Speaker 1:          41:26          Again, to borrow from John's a title, um, and this builds on an, uh, a policy and a June 42 announced by pure Laval that, uh, called the [inaudible] or the relief team that would send specialized French workers to, uh, Germany in exchange for the release of, of French prisoners of war from 1940. Haha. Uh, but now they say, well, you got you, you got to go. And they'll show up, uh, into your village Inn and you better be ready to go. 650,000, uh, workers were sent to Germany as consecrate script labor. This also contributes to discredit further the Vichy regime, visa vi. Uh, it's, um, uh, you know, its population, uh, and the grumbling about Petain the grumbling about shortages and the grumbling about the German soldiers. A give way now to more, uh, open, uh, a resentment. Uh, the bishop of, of lead, a guy called the colony.

Speaker 1:          42:32          Now Leah na, who had kept quiet about the increasingly obvious faith of Jews announced it was no longer a duty for a Christian to go to work in Germany and Jase Jase ms here. Um, and so this swells, uh, this nomadic tribe of resistors, uh, living from day to day in the mountains and the hills. And, you know, it's, is it a scary existence? I mean, you're listening through the night, uh, or in the day for the sudden the roar of the machines, the roar of the rival of airplanes or a fast speeding German cars, uh, uh, and you're freezing in snow, a bored, tired, anxious, uh, far, far away, a demoralized and understandably a terrifying. Now, most of the, my key, we're city folks, they were, uh, that the majority and most of France is not, you know, are not urban people. Uh, in 1943, uh, in 19, uh, uh, 44, uh, you know, that was because it was easier to round up people to be sent in the s s t o that is the obligatory labor service.

Speaker 1:          43:52          Uh, if you were from a city where you had all sorts of soldiers who come out and, and, uh, uh, pick you up. Um, and so, I mean, the lien was, that probably is the classic example that is in the area in which a orders for Glenn, uh, takes, uh, of where it became a, uh, uh, it was not a, you know, not a mass mass movement, but were you still have, uh, uh, all sorts of people that are part of underground Oregon underground organizations or you know, are part of the Gaullist resistance. And Joel Moolah reason, I have his name up here, he was a former prefect of the [inaudible], which is the department of shots with, you know, in the boats, uh, south Paris, beautiful cathedral town. And then he ends up himself getting denounced in tortured, uh, and, and all of that. But the resistance, whether they were gall us or whether they were communists or whether they had no affiliation at all, a party affiliation, um, the resistance depended on, on neighborhoods, small town and above wall village networks.

Speaker 1:          44:52          Thus, uh, the role of the school teacher, uh, or some kind of local, a leader, a communist, was wounded by French, French gendarme in a village. And the vibe that is the department of tunnel and central pay and all of that on, on the Mediterranean, he was hidden by a peasant, uh, in this one of these networks. But his untreated wound developed gangrene to doctors, took care of him, alerted by the wife of an agent of a resistance organization in all 10 people combined at the risk of their life, uh, of saving the life of one, um, a resistor. And of course, ironically in areas like the Limu Museum, that if I, I insisted and I'm right in doing so, uh, that, uh, you know, as Paxton and others have argued that that Vichy saw itself as the regime of Lactam of the land. That the real values were Joan of arc and peasants and all that business, the cult of the peasant resistor in areas like the Limu Zahn that is around, uh, the motion and, and the, to the, you know, the massacre at two.

Speaker 1:          45:55          Then all these places, uh, was an important one. Uh, as, as well. Um, now after the June six landings in Normandy, uh, and, uh, you know, the troops are also moving up, uh, after the, the landings in the south or moving up, uh, their own valley, you know, killing lots of people on their way. Uh, then, um, you know, it became easier to resist. And so therefore the temptation after the war was to say, Oh, you know what a seizure it, they lie. You know, I was resisting and it wasn't, I wasn't idea, Oh yes, your gun was always ready, et Cetera, et cetera. And everybody kind of jumped forward and provide the, in the prefecture, uh, uh, of the l dash there's, you know, they have this big, sort of a joyous celebration when the town is, is liberated, and then they noticed some of the resisters notice they're all sorts of people dressed up in fancy military clothes and all of that, and had nothing to do the resistance at all.

Speaker 1:          46:51          Some of them were trying to save their, their skins, uh, because, uh, you know, they had rather different sympathies a few weeks ago before that, where a few months before that, as I said, near our village or as a priest who was laying up in the wall and shot down because he had killed because he had had day, ah, ah, to lunch and was a fascist at sometime. Earlier in, in the period, uh, there was about 24,000, um, uh, McKee who were killed in the liberation of France and in, in, in, in Paris above all. But in other cities as well, you can walk along and you see signs that say, you know, uh, ECA, Tone Bay here fell on the 24th of August, 1944. So, and so, uh, from one of the resistance groups. And occasionally you'll see a flower, a new flowers put there by somebody who remembers or somebody aware of the collective memory or especially around the prefecture of police in Paris.

Speaker 1:          47:46          I've always thought it was cruel. This is a cynical, but they should have put in some of the fancier quarters of Paris. And posse and places like that. Uh, you know, you see a Collabo, hey, uh, you know, Miss [inaudible], uh, a madame, uh, you know, look, goes into Kelechi shows, uh, uh, 1940, 1944, but that's not nice and not very generous. Uh, and, and I make no apologies for it. Um, there were, I mean, again, just to end with these little, I'll just end with this, that at, at the time of the pup home trial when pop home was, was arguing, he says, well, I was a good bureaucrat. My superiors liked what I did, and I was protecting these other Jews by sending away the hundreds, whom, you know, I made possible their departure from the Gao. Standish Hall. There was another little story came along and I didn't remember where I read it, but there was a young woman who worked in the SEC as a secretary, I in the prefecture or, or in the police or somewhere like that.

Speaker 1:          48:53          And she, um, because of people like popcorn, you had lists of all the people who are Jews are all the people who were communists in these, you'd homed are in bold Dole, uh, and, um, that these things are kept in files. But this is before the computer, the quiet violence of the computer. Uh, and these were lists that were done by hand, and she simply went in to the drawers and rip them up, ripped up the list, and put the, the scrap paper, not in the wastepaper basket, but in her pocket, and went out and deposited in the first poo bell or garbage can that she found heroic act choices and Vichy France. It made you think, it made you decide what to do.
