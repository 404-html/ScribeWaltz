Speaker 1:          00:01          Wrap it up. I want to talk about a couple of things at the beginning and then one time it, the suburbs at the end with, cause that's going to be a big problem, you know, uh, in the future. And I guess a couple of things in the beginning, uh, in somewhat of a particular order I suppose is this, that, you know, you Kinda, I kinda torn between, uh, between, uh, you know, and taking about Paris, one of the old alliances that you had and the rebuilding of, of uh, you know, I've tried to protect Paris from, from the Pompey dues and the planners and the horror of the tour Montparnasse that you had this sort of classic alliance between people on kind of the far left like me and then kind of traditional conservatives, like a great French historian called Louis Shu lea the story and in Paris.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And then, um, so I guess I kind of feel like that in, in, in trying to think about ways that, you know, how important is that France, France remain France and, and uh, I mentioned this once in passing was talking about education, but we got involved in our fields and trying to save our one room school house, uh, because if we lose our school, then we just start another beautiful place full of a mob by German and Belgian and northern French tourists, uh, in the summer Dutch also. And um, you know, if things change and, and uh, regional, uh, a one room school houses disappear because I mean, people say that that's progress and, and, and uh, lots about rural France, a lot of villages that do survive survive because they're, they're, what you call it, biological 12th or there they're sort of a bedroom, a villages for people who work in towns nearby.

Speaker 1:          01:37          But lots of France, lots of rural France really only exists now because of tourism. And that doesn't make, make it a in itself. I mean, it's important that people survive in some way, but that doesn't provide these places for the kinds of a kind of vitality and, and, uh, uh, you know, high ironic would be is if it's, if the guid me lab, the, uh, the green guides for every region [inaudible] if those are one of the sole ways in the long run along with cuisine, traditions of cuisine that did help regions maintain their identity, that would be very sad. Indeed they're going to do. Um, I have great ambivalence about the European Union and about the European constitution and of course most of my friends to vote against it. Uh, and some of my friends in Leone and in Paris voted for it. Uh, but most of the people I know, almost all of them, whether they were provincial academics or whether they're very ordinary people producing cheese or getting buy in every way, they can, uh, voted against it.

Speaker 1:          02:32          And one of the things that they're going to do now, which is a, it doesn't mean anything to most people, but it still reflects the kinds of changes that Europe is apt to bring that Europe in quotes, it's apt to bring to French regions is that they're going to get rid of the license plates. Um, which seems like a silly thing, but one of the things that I always do when I'm driving, which I drive constantly, uh, in France as you see, you know, I see cars go by and see a 23, you think, oh, the clothes, that's the, that's a really rare bird is the least populated department after the air and France. And you kind of imagine this person with a 23 is going up to see his or her age at grandmother and the Moselle 57. And you do the sort of games of where people come from and what and what.

Speaker 1:          03:13          And I mean that's interesting and it's important, but they're going to get rid of the license plates and then all the license plates will be just very much the same. And they'll look like English license plates or, or they'll look like, um, my German license plates. I don't know if they're going to get rid of those two or the K for corn or the beef for Berlin and all of this business. And it's just one of the sort of threats to the way things are that, that, that, that the European Union has brought. And there a lot of people at Yale and including some of my friends were a big of union European Union people. But you know, we have friends who scraped by, they produce goat's cheese and they, uh, uh, they, um, uh, our toll now that they must conform to European Union rules, which are, which are barked out in Brussels with full of these empty apartment.

Speaker 1:          03:54          I mean an empty office buildings that were overbuilt or barked out from [inaudible], which is another important capital, the European Union. And it tells them that they, uh, that they, uh, have to produce, uh, uh, produce a cheese in a very different way. And, um, you know, I'm part of old France will disappear. But in a way, I mean it, you know, it's sad. I don't want every part of France to be like every other part of France. And we had to really struggle to, to, to, to arrive in a world and where you have actually TV announcer speaking with an accent that's not a Parisian or, or a valley of the lar accent, you know, and, and that's very good. I'll tell you a funny little story, um, that, that has to do with this. In some ways. We have these friends who've been together for about, uh, uh, Oh, maybe 25 years.

Speaker 1:          04:39          And like a lot of our friends and France, they don't have any money and they didn't ever get married. And we have a lot of a union league. What, I mean, they're just together. I mean, there are a couple or as much as a couple. It is, my wife and I are, we've been married for 27 years. Um, and uh, they're a one, they have two signs and their oldest son is my, my son's best friend. Uh, and, um, they make goat's cheese. That's what they do. And one day, one summer we got this invitation to their wedding. You know, they'd been together for 20 years and they, you know, when you were together for 20 years, you're saying our best years are behind us and all this stuff, which isn't necessarily true, but they were getting married, there was sending out invitations and the people that don't like them said, oh, they're sending out invitations, they're getting married because they want to have a presence.

Speaker 1:          05:16          They want people to give them a presence, you know, which just went away and it's simply not true. And then people who, you know, like them and, and who felt, well, you know, this is, uh, uh, you know, they're, they're getting married because their parents are both religious sets of parents were fairly religious. One Dutch, the other, uh, Dutch Belgian and the other French from the north of France. And so they're, they're making it right in terms of the church. And people said, wait a minute, you know, is that really the case? And so, uh, yeah, the wedding and the wedding was when early September. And we couldn't go because I was back here doing this and, and happy to be here doing this. Uh, but we missed the wedding and then we finally found out why they got married. Probably it had something to do with Brussels and straws war because the, somebody went over to the cantorial, uh, capitol.

Speaker 1:          06:02          I mean this is cap place called battle. Uh, and there was a big sign that said that there, those people who want to continue in the new Europe to produce schools, produce goat's cheese. We'll have to conform to European norms about how to do that. And, and there'll be a course that's offered, uh, by the, uh, by the European Union and that we'll see. This is about two thousands before the shift of the whole, maybe more about that in a minute. And the course will cost 2000 francs, which is a huge amount of money for these people, but will be free for the wives, uh, of, uh, for the wives of a, of farmers. So they got married, they were kind of forced to get married because it would be cheaper for them to do that. Now, that's kind of a silly example, but it's still the risk of Europe is that, that people who want to live their own lives or somehow or produce goat cheese their own way and it produced very good goat's cheese.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Um, so I always bring back and huge bundles, double, triple wrapped here, won't be allowed to do that anymore. And, and France voted against the election, I mean, against the constitution. And it happened in the, in the Netherlands too. And everybody in France, and this plugs into what I'm gonna say it and talk about in a minute. You know, there's this fear of the Polish plumber, you know, that, that's the example. They use that because all of these immigrants from eastern Europe will come and, and that the European Union's gonna have to pay all the money to make Polish Sha agricultural. I'll be in Poland in two days, actually, a back yet again, uh, make, uh, you know, Polish agriculture, competitive and will cost everybody a lot of money. And that the Polish plumber will put French plumbers out of work. And so this, this fits into, you know, both fears that people have, all sorts of people, not just right wing anti-immigrant people whom I'll talk about in a minute, I can assure you.

Speaker 1:          07:38          Uh, but also just people that are afraid that, that, that, you know, they're met ta, that there possibilities of their children finding work in a country in which work is very hard to find in which there's no light at the end of the tunnel for a very, very many young people, uh, that all of this is, is going to happen. And many people, many ordinary people, not in Paris, if you're working with the George Bush dollar and try to afford a single, uh, a cafe in Paris. Uh, but if for very many ordinary people, the, the, the year whole, that is the currency that became, uh, January 1st year, 2002, I actually wrote something about the transition of to that currency, um, that, that this was the, this, this currency, uh, to most people. Seems like what you say in French is, and I'll knock, it's a sting. Uh, it, it is, all it's done is pushed up prices and the government can try it out.

Speaker 1:          08:25          All the information they want to try to show there hasn't been massive inflation inflation due to the euro. And that's simply false because things that people buy in the, in their lives, I don't mean rich people, but I mean ordinary people, uh, by have been become extraordinarily high and expensive because of, because of the whole, uh, and um, on the other hand, my own personal thing is that, look, I view the European Union as, and this is, you don't have to believe this. Uh, uh, you can probably guess that I would have this view. Uh, I believe that a social Europe might be kind of out, could counterbalance the kind of, of just runaway, you know, bandit capitalism of the worst excesses of capitalism. Uh, and that, that, you know, in America we live in, I live in a country and we're civil rights civic and civil rights are saluted.

Speaker 1:          09:14          But which human rights are, there is no human rights are no human rights in coded, uh, uh, in the United States. Thus Guantanamo Bay egg, thus a, you know, exceptional rendering to torture camps here and there. Uh, because there isn't an assumption that human rights counters that, that civil rights is what counts and the way you get civil rights, it's becoming an American citizen or permanent residents dust. The big debate on which I'm not going again too about immigration in this country, which is a very, very, a big debate. But I always sort of viewed that Europe would, well, you know, if maybe he's a British would, would, um, they didn't want to come along and they don't want to get rid of the pound and ended up all of this business. But there's somehow the social Europe with the basis of Germany and France, whether it was parties, have the right or part or senator or parties of the left, would, you know, be this kind of block that that would, would, would, uh, would do what, what your, what the gall, ironically here my singing the praises of the goal of all people, uh, me, uh, uh, you know, had, had, had that Europe could, could have the role of Sir Francis sort of this, there's honest broker in, in a world now without that, not to po big powers, but, uh, but only one sort of throwing its weight around.

Speaker 1:          10:22          And I don't even know what I think anymore about that because, um, you know, there are some advantages to Europe. It's if you live in straws, boom. If you live in Leone, you live in Paris, well, you know, it helps the economy. But if you live in the [inaudible] hall or you living in a dash Dasho it doesn't do a damn thing. It hasn't brought anything at all to anyone. Uh, as far as anyone can, anyone can tell. Um, but, and one of the things that may go in the next years, especially if Sarcozi gets his way and one of the things that's dear to me anyway, but I realized that there are excesses is the providential state, the idea of the welfare state, which we read about and saw our wines book and you all know exists. And I've said this before and I'll say it again.

Speaker 1:          10:56          If you don't have any money and you're sick, uh, you're a hell of a lot better off if you know, going to any doctor and you can pay 20 year old or 22 year old now, which is, you know, every day more and more in dollars, but a say now about $35. If you get stuck and you don't understand ratios, they will keep you going and they will help you if you're very rapport. But it, there's a big sign that saying ratios that said that the minimum charges $300 or $400, I can't remember what the big sign is. Um, now, um, the health plan is terribly expensive and there are all sorts of abuses. I mean, there are people who, for example, have to go from where we live to Leon to get treatment for this and that sometimes very serious illnesses and ambulance takes them and the ambulance will cost maybe a thousand dollars cost.

Speaker 1:          11:34          The health system was not thousand dollars. Well, there are people around the can drive them, uh, and that kind of kind of situation. And there are the unemployment benefits are lavish to say the least. There are people that, that we know that our professional shomer professionally unemployed that don't do a damn thing and they don't want to work and they never work. And, and you know, it's probably is, uh, you know, unfair but, but you know, it's human beings, human rights. That's something that they pay attention to. They ought to have the right to a minimum. And in France, you called them or Amy's, they get a really minimal little amount of money and, uh, now they're strikes, you know, they're, the railroad workers go on strike because they, they, they want Dwight Dwight Dwight [inaudible] that they acquired rights. They ought to be able to, I said this other day, if you're driving a high speed Tj, fast train, big pressure, you know, they, they almost never crash hardly ever.

Speaker 1:          12:21          Uh, but big pressure and that they think they should have the right to retire at 55 or 50. Now this seems like it's a bit of exaggeration to us in this country. We don't even have a retirement age. Um, and we don't have one at all. It doesn't exist. Uh, so there were abuses in all of this, but, but the, the kind of total Americanization of, of French social services would be, in my view, a disaster. You don't have to share that, but that means there are abuses, but you don't just have to dismantle the whole thing. Uh, and, and sort of turn it into an Americanized version of this and that people are always trying to measure happiness. I have a student who wrote former student, a great guy, a ta this class now he's at Florida state and wrote a book called happiness, a history that did rather well.

Speaker 1:          13:00          It was on NPR and all this stuff. And people are always trying to measure how happy you are. And when they, when they ask people in France what makes them happy, it's the right to have a vacation, you know, and you've got a lot of rich people in this country who are very unhappy even though they're, they're loaded because they don't take the time to have vacation and all this and we can, you know, we can debate the, we could go on and on about, I could lapse into, in the nostalgia for the next 10 hours about the favorite meals I've had through the, through the long hours into the early morning with, with friends of ours and, and, and how, you know, family things together count and your friends and all that. But, but in France, you know, France remains a, in many ways a happy place. And in that, because some of the anxiety is idea of life has taken away by the state.

Speaker 1:          13:39          And I don't necessarily, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. What's going to happen though too, to young people. Of course, you know, I'm going to talk about suburbs in a minute, but that's part of it. It's not just, it's not just, uh, an ethnic question. It's not just a spatial question. It's not just the unwanted people by the center relegated to the margins of urban life. Uh, it is also question of what happens to young people, not only young, a young, uh, uh, west Africans are young, north Africans, uh, or young people from the Caribbean, but, but also young whites too because, uh, uh, the unemployment rate, uh, is, is always been, it's considered a great success to have the unemployment rate anywhere near 10%, where sometimes as a 12, 13, and 14%. And for all the faults of this American system, uh, we have where people don't declare their unemployment often because they get discouraged, but we have a much less, uh, employment rate, uh, and, uh, the chances of, of young people, and not everybody goes to Yale, uh, not everybody goes to Harvard or Princeton or Wisconsin or Michigan or Oberlin or, or Grinnell.

Speaker 1:          14:38          You know, for a lot of people that, you know, I mean, they don't have those kinds of options that you have. Um, in France it's a much more serious condition and there's situation and people we know that are very well educated, they have no future and people we know that they have no education, uh, you know, are just scraping by to, and it's, uh, uh, you know, the French economy remains, it means a problem and maybe Europe is in the long run, it's going to help catapult a ordinary people and not just a big capitalists, big business people toward, toward a better life. You know, I don't know. Uh, but again, as I said, I encourage my friends to vote against it. We're not yet citizens, so we, we, we couldn't vote. Uh, we can't even vote in municipal elections even though we've been legally resident in France for, for 20 years.

Speaker 1:          15:17          Meacham Hall and put forward that we should be able to vote, not just us, but everybody who illegal residents because we have an interest in what happens in municipal life. Uh, but the high court overthrew, overturned it, but that's neither here nor there. Now what about them? What about but the riots and they started up again the other day. It would just very briefly when these two kids were killed, a young people that were our kids, but yeah, they were young. They were 15 and 16 when they were, uh, killed, um, through their own fault. Alas, uh, uh, when they ran into a police car. Uh, uh, but that, that was, these, there were troubled in Toulouse, but not very much trouble. Uh, and that the trouble in this place called Vva Lubell, uh, and in fairly soon, um, in October and November, I'm even two years ago and use user were seniors are yours.

Speaker 1:          15:57          You were juniors ever will maybe remember this and you could remember it if you were in high school too. Uh, there were riots to began in the northern suburbs of Paris and those who've been to front Sloan into France and flowing into Wasi. Uh, when you landed at the airport, Charles de Gaulle, which they still insist on calling Wasi, uh, you, um, you know, your, your next thought is that w you know what you'll do the first day in Paris, whether it's seeing old friends again, or where are you going to eat or what you're going to visit. Well around Wasi are not only he's drawn see the transit camp where so many people were in World War II were, uh, had to stay before they were set off to the death camps to die. But they're, they're the grim suburbs. And I, and I, as I told you before, I explain why, why French suburbs and other European suburbs are very different.

Speaker 1:          16:44          They're just the opposite of American suburbs. They're largely the domain of people unwanted by the center, by the center. And this has been a, been a tradition in France and other places. There's a sense, uh, since the ceased to become agricultural, uh, truck farming communities and became, uh, uh, places where there were factories and where there was a transient population and it's been like that. It was the worst trouble. It's worst rioting in France since 1968. Uh, we're a, um, a year that we've already talked about. Uh, again, the, the precipitating event was a death of two adult to adolescents who are 15 and 17. On October 27th, 2005. This is only two years ago. They had fled along with another person who was very seriously wounded and was taken care of by ironically, by the, uh, coincidentally by the mother, the mother of our, of our French Godson at the Ob.

Speaker 1:          17:35          Tell her while she knew a, they were a bleed, they're being chased by the cops in clichy suit. What? P and C, l I. C h, a Su like underneath. And then the block the woods. They're know Wa left there underneath housing projects because that's, these were built in the sixties and seventies. Ain't no woods in Clichy Su walk. Um, and it populated population 28,300 people. The sixth poorest commune in France, 70% of the population I live in these housing projects in French, the word is CT, c, I, t. E with an accent. Now the first he tay were [inaudible]. They were created by a established by Napoleon, the third in Paris. Just a couple of you liked the clip ribbons and that was the end of it. Um, uh, 70% live who live in these projects, which are just awful. Um, are Muslims, like the two boys who died, they'd tried to hide in an electric transformer and were grilled, basically electrocuted.

Speaker 1:          18:36          And the other of the boy who survived had, um, had burns over, you know, almost entirety of his body. He's still alive. He lived. Um, and so the incident and the events that followed have to be seen in the resentment that I've talked about before and resistance of young people, but in particularly minority young people to the police, to the crs and also to the municipal police, uh, in, um, the grub grim suburbs of Paris, but also venture outside of a Lior among others and outside of, of, uh, of a Mousay, you know, where's he don and the great, the great soccer player. And as I said the other day, the most, still the most a respected person admired person in France and Z. Don grew up in such a project, uh, and unlike Recia via, he didn't have his picture taken, the backed with his back in a fancy suit to the project.

Speaker 1:          19:27          He, uh, he was proud of where he grew up and it was part of his life. And he's, he's, he's very good. Or if you follow French soccer, there's no reason why he should. But [inaudible] who's a great defense player, who's an older guy now, and he took it on Sarcozi after this and start closing. You say, what do you millionaire know about the projects? And a, and he took him on and he said, you calling these people scum because of who they are and because they live there, and he says, I know the projects. You don't know the projects and Sarcozi doesn't go to the projects. Uh, cause he, you know, anyway, that won't get off on that. But we might, who knows. Um, so in two months, more than 9,000 cars were set ablaze and 3000 people were arrested. Most of those writing, uh, writing where young, uh, young minority males of North African particularly, but also west African, uh, uh, my, uh, extraction along with, uh, people from, you know, Guadeloupe and Martinique and all sorts of other places too.

Speaker 1:          20:23          Uh, and as I, as I argue the other day, I mean, these are people who, because they don't know Algeria, they don't know Tunisia, they don't know Molly, uh, they don't know synagogue. Uh, they feel like they belong nowhere, uh, because they don't share the culture of their parents. I, and they share with their friends a culture of exclusion that can also serve as a way of, you know, of solidarity a that the can also, uh, in their language as I described the other day. And, and, and in these unfortunate advance a show that they can stick together, they can hang together to, um, and the trouble spread to the suburbs of Leon to lead to sanity and the straws booth and other places where you can anticipate such reactions, but also amazing enough to places like, Aha, you know, and the lot, or in believe, which isn't too far away.

Speaker 1:          21:13          And just all sorts of places or the hall, uh, where you wouldn't think there'd be anything in trouble, maybe described as, you know, lighting a poo, bell of garbage can of blaze and throwing it through a storefront or something like that. That's not a good thing to do. Uh, but they spread to all sorts of places. There was also an incident in Belgium, uh, and which has a huge population from x, Zaire, from, from, from Congo, uh, and, uh, in Germany as well. And most, most immigrants in, in Germany, the majority, not most, but the majority of people who are there are either from Turkey or now from, from ex Yugoslavia, uh, and, and Albania and the forms of resistance. We're not themselves new hurling Molotov cocktails and burning cars. I mean, they say happened in, in straws were for years. And it happens in Detroit.

Speaker 1:          21:59          Uh, you know, I said this the other day, there had been riots and a much more smaller scale in 1983, uh, uh, and in 2000 and the town to mobile. Yeah. Which is fairly near business. So in the east, the name doesn't matter. Um, but there was violence, more violence than before, and it was directed, uh, particularly against the police. And the difference between those incidents and the incidents now that have occurred, uh, last week is that people were using guns. There isn't pistols and they're shooting at the police and that takes it to a different level. That didn't happen. Uh, uh, two years ago, and that's not a good sign. Surprisingly, there was only a one desk, a man who was beaten to death. We'll trying to put out a fire, uh, in a, in a place called staff, which is a suburb of Paris.

Speaker 1:          22:47          And there were a few injuries. That's all. Not very many for such big trouble, lots of burned out cars, lots of anger. The army was never called in. Um, damage was, was surprisingly limited. Uh, it was limited basically to cars, uh, and a few shops and things like that. There wasn't a to lose somebody set the library and fire. And this is what happened in key. She, uh, in, um, [inaudible] bell last week as well. Uh, but, um, there were occasional attacks on, on churches. I'd synagogues because there has been a rise of antisemitism, uh, uh, particularly in Muslim communities. Uh, in France, it, I, in contemporary France, there was an attack on the Leon subway that may tool, uh, and even against a stupidly a, also against sporting facilities. And France are not a lot of places for young people to do sports. And they've done been better about that.

Speaker 1:          23:41          Uh, you know, I mean, sports are not exactly part of the program and lycees and they run around the, the, you know, the run around in the gym twice and they're all the hacking and coughing and grasping for their gold was, uh, but you know, they've been doing better now. And one of the reasons that said that France does so well in soccer is because, you know, they're, they, they take particularly young minority, uh, uh, youth who are very good, good soccer players and they get good training. And, and, and that's why, you know, when fruit, when we won the World Cup in 1998 and Joan Marie Le Pen said, ah, the new leader of the National Front, he said, he said it wasn't a French team. That one. Why? Because when you count it up, there was Dominique because there's no reason you should know this, but there was picky.

Speaker 1:          24:21          Uh, there was a blog dorm, blah, who's from last. Uh, there was, uh, uh, quite, uh, quite slip in many ways, uh, uh, about Tez, uh, the goalie. And did I forget somebody, there was a guy who never kept missing all the time. Um, it was the name of what tall. I can't remember who, but the great players were two homme is he don this psyche? Uh, you know, the, the, these were the really great ones. And so the Penn said, well, that's not really France because they may have French nationality, but he doesn't count them as French. Uh, because his, his racist view of the world, which doesn't differ that much from that event out off Hitler, when push comes to shove, they don't count. But happily, most people in France celebrated, uh, joyously, uh, because they certainly are French. Um, and, and the damage was far less than, for example, in La, during the Rodney King, uh, uh, riots in, in, in 1992 after the, the police who beat up this guy on camera, uh, beat up this, this minority guy from downtown La. You know, it's, the La suburbs are not where the d underprivileged people live.

Speaker 1:          25:29          They do not live in, in, uh, you know, uh, the valley in the valley and all that and all that kind of stuff. Um, and when there were attacks on buildings, they were attacks at night, so nobody would be in, in the buildings and the destruction of empty cars. Well, so we'll stupid, you know, does not, did not kill people. Now again, I don't mean to sound like I'm defending violence, but, uh, um, not a single, despite the generalized hatred of the, of the police, not a single policeman was killed or even seriously wounded. Uh, though there were a few live round fire, there were more policemen hurt the other night, you know, were shot, uh, hit by bullets. Then by then happened, uh, uh, two years ago. Um, so, um, the government strategy of criminalizing petty misdeeds, I mean that seems to have worked in New York.

Speaker 1:          26:17          I guess that's what, you know, Giuliani is going to stay over and over again. Uh, the zero tolerance, I mean the resting of people who are hopping the metro, getting on the Metro for free and all of this, uh, they tried that in France and that may have increased the resistance, the hatred of the police because sometimes you, you know, you, you see people get picked up when they're trying to get through the metro and you'll, you'll see police from there and get on for free cause they don't, they don't have any money. And, uh, you know, when I let you know, I let people through behind me if they don't have any money and if they, they look like they have money, then I knock home about 20 feet back. Uh, when I'm going through by stopping or knock on backwards. We very nice.

Speaker 1:          26:50          But I believe in public transportation. Uh, anyway, but the SRAP government had eliminated funds not only for voluntary associations, uh, but for the kind of beat policing that has worked in many areas in it, you know, and sometimes in this country that in tough neighborhoods where they've been a lot of problems by having the policeman become part of the community and therefore not just seem like a foreign presence, but that's not the case in [inaudible]. And that's not the case in Boban knee. That's not the place in Qube of y and places like that. Or in Venice who outside, uh, of lean all there. When the police are there, they're not the same guys. And when they're there, they're the ones saying, you know, your papers, your papers, your papers, or they don't go at all and they don't protect the other people. I mean, most of the crime that occurs there is that, you know, are minorities against minorities because of the sheer numbers and the police.

Speaker 1:          27:38          One of the complaints there is the police aren't there to help anybody. And when they do, they come in huge numbers. It's up against the wall baby and that kind of stuff. So the rise took on a political dimension. And here I get again, I'm, I'm, I'm saying I, I'm not trying to give a political interpretation into this. This is a fact. I mean, this is what happened. Um, and Nick and equalizer, I z the minister of Interior, um, he manipulated the situation. He referred to the writers, this riff Raff or even scum Rokaya a word that I've used before, how Chi scum, which can, you know, I can also be tough guy, but, but it means scum more. And he said, well, we knew need to do is get these big hoses that they use this as brand that you clean out gutters specifically for cleaning out gutters.

Speaker 1:          28:20          We have to get these hoses and get rid of them, get them out of the gutters. So who's down? You know, these are people who are non whites, who are poor, who live in the suburbs, who are condemned, where marginalized. Uh, uh, the words suburb even lost is neutral sense in the French language. Long ago at the end of the 19th century. I did a book on this a long time ago and I just don't that word but on, on some of this stuff. Um, and so, uh, that he said that suburb should be disinfected to get rid of this gum. And I'm not being too over the top to say that, uh, you know that you, you it, his few years scum, this is son of immigrants. By the way, when you're an immigrant, you're scum because you exist because you're there because you're not rich.

Speaker 1:          29:00          And when he got elected that he gets his big vacation. And in Multa spending as much money as humanly possible to say, well, if you work hard like me, fall, say they won't say, phone says you, you will become rich to, well, it ain't that easy. It seemed like a blatant attempt to win the supporters who, who exported the violent extreme right of a John Marie Le Pen and after election law, Penn said all these things, what we've said, he said it to be sure in a more tactful way. Uh, he does not believe that the camps were a minor. The death camps were a minor, minor detail in the history of World War II, which is what Lopez said. He doesn't believe that. Uh, and he didn't, he would not give some nodding approval when some of his thugs drown Moroccans in the, in the, uh, in the, in the sen, you know, after Joan of Arc Day March, Joan of arc, they march, uh, and sort of say, well, you know, boys will be boys and this kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          29:57          Um, but he took the, the rhetoric of racism and made it respectable. And then you don't have to agree with this, but this is my view. This is what happened. That's what happened. That's it. It was a strategy that Charlotte Pasqua who had been in Ministry of Interior long ago and tried to use and hidden, not worked, but it worked this time around. Now again, I don't exaggerate the problem of, of, uh, you know, there has been increased criminality. There've been attempts to prove that the, that the greater increases of criminality, uh, uh, Eh, you know, uh, uh, Shay lately, you know, with, with immigrant populations and non immigrant populations, uh, you know, it, that's hard to say whether that's true or not. We're not talking about crime waves like you, like, like lots of murders and things like that. France still operates on a very civilized, uh, uh, a scale in part because they have very harsh gun laws.

Speaker 1:          30:45          Uh, and it's, you can't just sort of a, it'd be 15 and not old enough to, uh, to vote are old enough to drink in this country. Uh, but you're old enough to buy a machine gun practically, uh, and that sort of thing. Uh, to hum a t, t, h, u r m, whom I mentioned a while ago, the, the, the, uh, footballer or denounced the remarks is contemptuous and humiliating serving to awaken latent racism in France. And he got that right. And shock shock is usual, tried to, uh, more concerned with his bank accounts in Japan or whatever, tried to remain above. And the indictment, which subsequently has followed up in his indictment yet, but all the scandals when he was mayor of Paris, he tried to remain above the fray. Uh, he, uh, had the declaration of the state of emergency on November 8th red to journalists on his behalf instead of actually reading it himself.

Speaker 1:          31:37          But he seemed to be as he was in the end, more and more ineffective, isolated and virtually ignored, rather like his predecessor Charles de Gaulle in 1968 in 1969, um, one of the one minister on the center, right, uh, said that one of the reasons this is all happening isn't the suburbs is polygamy. That was his, his definition for what happened. Uh, Sarcozi the other day said, this is not a social crisis in the suburbs. What, not a social crisis. It's a crisis. It's an enormous social crisis. He said that he referred to a voyeur to, uh, a thug ocracy a thug autocracy, and there's no social crisis. The social crisis is that, that huge percent of the population living in France, particularly 5 million Muslims, but not just 5 million Muslims, more than that, you're not feel part of France and are not integrated in France. Uh, in part because of, of special considerations where they live, lack of opportunity also because of discrimination and lack of, of, of low opportunity.

Speaker 1:          32:40          The same that other people have had. Um, it's hard to get people to teach in the stem stem knee. That is the department of number 93. When you say catch around class, which means, uh, the sentence underneath, which is, has many of these places you can't get teachers to teach there because there is violence, you know, not big time violence, but there's, there's, there's violence and the whites out there. Of course. Uh, uh, not all of them. And many of them vote, uh, uh, uh, national front and they voted for Sarcozi massively. Uh, this was discovered actually about 10 years ago also that in some of the neighborhoods in Paris said Monaca and then the 18th and 20th thrown these small bubbles bubble on the 20th that the white population voted overwhelmingly, uh, in some areas for, uh, for the, the, the National Front, uh, in, in part because they, you know, they were afraid of the fact that they would be minorities in there are in their own cal ta and all of this.

Speaker 1:          33:30          And you also had this crossover vote between the old communist party white workers voting for the national front as well. And you found that in, in places in the north of France. And you found that in other places. Um, it, it's given all this, it's surprising that the trouble is, didn't come, uh, uh, before, uh, because, uh, the, the, the, the immigrants as you know, really were attracted to France in larger numbers by the booming economy, uh, in the 1960s. And all of this slowed down at a time that I can remember with the, uh, the, uh, the oil crisis of 73 and 74, which is just, we don't, when I was, and I got to Yale when that much older than you guys, uh, that, uh, that was, that, that stopped it. And suddenly all the people that, you know, all the announcements have come to France, we'll find you a job posted in Tunis and, and, uh, uh, Jay and Matt cash and Fez and all these places, uh, uh, those, those were taken down.

Speaker 1:          34:26          And, and, uh, and uh, they're there and the economic slowdown came, but there were fewer jobs awaiting goes people and their descendants and the Muslim population of Francis now about 5 million people. One of the interesting things also is that there was no really way of counting the number of people of any ethnic origin in France. There is none because it's illegal to ask on a census what is, what are your ethnic origins? You can't do that. So there's no official way of counting up now that, that then France can say, we have no, we have no ethnic crisis. But also you can't, they, they can say that, which isn't true. Uh, I mean, hello. That's just isn't true. But also the problem is if you don't know where all the, where you have strong ethnic minorities or even majority's, then you can't really go out and try to solve the problem because you're not really sure.

Speaker 1:          35:20          Municipals statistics are much more accurate, but there's no, I don't know, any global kind of statistics, but they think they're above about five, uh, a million people and many of them live in the suburbs, live in these Asha LMS. They're called, uh, uh, [inaudible] or, or, or, uh, well see tay, you know, their, their housing projects. Uh, uh, basically, uh, and in which, um, uh, so many of the people are poor, many depend on, on state assistance and crowd more and more relatives than tiny spaces. We knows how a good number of people from Zaire, uh, who were brought to to France thanks to a, a French friend of ours, a lawyer and some of them came as basketball players, a couple of them did and you know, they're living in rooms out in the suburbs and they, they're, you know, 15 people living in a, in a, in a small apartment.

Speaker 1:          36:11          Um, and what are, and so the rate of unemployment in France in 19 2005 was about 10, about 10%, 3 million unemployed. That's a lot. But a young, young people among young people is 23% and in the suburbs, uh, uh, then employment weight rate rose from 28% to 40% for young people between 1990 and 2000. And the unemployment rate for foreigners and French with origins in non European countries stood at about 36% of the population in Clichy. This community that I said was the fifth or whatever I said sixth poorest community in France. I think fifth at the time 80% of the population lived in what were classified are classified still as a zone. Then small Siebler, difficult urban zones and 35% in public housing in Clichy Suwon the unemployment rate for young people between 18 and 25 your age stood at 60%, and for 33% of the population as a whole.

Speaker 1:          37:18          And there were constant complaints when all their journalists would go in, the reporters go, Eh, you know, [inaudible] was sent out reporters and, and, and they counted all these stories of their lives. They're trying to find jobs and with the same qualifications being turned down systematically and they've done all these, they've done, they've done these secret things. I've seen this on TV where they'll take people, uh, you know, and, and set up companies in a way to see how they react when they're confronted by candidates for a job, uh, in which, you know, the white person will be less well qualified than the north African or a west African. And time and time again, just write down the line, wouldn't get the job, wouldn't. And there's no use. There's no use ignoring this fact, even as Sarcozi, uh, uh, says it, uh, that this, this isn't true.

Speaker 1:          38:06          And many of them are particularly those people from north and west Africa, depending on this informal economy, a economy of barter in economy of, of, you know, black marketing to, uh, to an extent or, or petty drug deals and things like that. Uh, because there's nothing else, uh, to do a man of Arab origin. Put it this way, he says, I raised my children, hiding from them. The fact that I no longer have any hope for them, but the real drama is that they understand all of that. They grew up in this bloody chaos and they suffer. There is no future for the children of immigrants here. That's a tough thing to say. And that's not, that was a thoughtful, it's not just somebody who is reacting to, to, uh, into a city in flames and to violence between the police and young people. Uh, it's somebody who's who for whom that experience was a part of, uh, of, uh, of their lives.

Speaker 1:          39:03          And he's reflecting the fact that, I mean, in this interview, when I wrote to all of this, I wrote this for a piece, uh, you know, I was doing it, you know, reading magazines. That's how you know that are you doing kind of instant history. I wrote this just a couple weeks after this happened for an encyclopedia, a while, maybe six months after that, you know, you, you end up reading things like this, but, but, but if this is a form of history also, uh, and he's reflecting the gap between himself and his own children, they don't believe that they belong anywhere. If you don't believe you belong anywhere, you know, then then, you know, then society's got a big a problem. And they say that they don't feel French and they've been controlled so many times. It's not just their control. Once in a while or some, you know, a zealous policemen sees a west African and north African and says, Hey, hey, let me see your papers, man.

Speaker 1:          39:51          Uh, it's just time and time again. And I told you the other day that, you know, I never am crow. I'm never, never controlled anywhere. Never, never, never. And I've been leaving metro stations with all sorts of people were, you know, Barbara's Roy Schwartz and places like that with all sorts of people who are minorities and, and more French than I am, more French than I am. And I have a residence card. I don't have a passport, and they have passports and there are ones are controlled. It's not me that's controlled. And I don't dress in differently than they do as you might've been able to tell. Uh, and it, it, uh, the recent law against Foula, you know, against the headscarves. So, which has been much to do. And My friend Joan Scott just has, who lectured up here a couple of weeks ago. Hey, you know, this also, I mean, my argument, not everybody agrees with me, not even people on the left, some of them don't agree with me, but, but, uh, um, you know, you can twist and say, well, this and not twisted, but you can take the take on it that this is really an antifeminist thing.

Speaker 1:          40:43          It's anti women's thing. People wearing full hour. And I generally feminist, uh, but not necessarily. Why not? Uh, that I think it's anti Muslim. Uh, they say, well, you know, you can't wear big crucifixes in the class to a, you can't worry Yamakas in the class. Well, I don't know. Uh, my kids have been in the say a [inaudible] near to lose and then, um, uh, Marcel Gimo and Oba and a, they knew or saw me wearing huge crucifixes. Uh, no crude, big crucifix is allowed. Uh, I'm not sure if they've seen Yamikas that is a problem because they had the right there, the growth of antisemitism and not just among Muslim populations, but it's directed against Muslims. There's no question about it. Uh, in my view. And furthermore, that, I mean, you can understand the position of some Muslim women. I'm not saying anything about, uh, why people were fooled.

Speaker 1:          41:29          I mean, I don't know, but there's some are under pressure from their fathers or their older brothers to wear headscarves. And that's very, you know, one can understand these family situations. I'm not saying anything about this, but I think that, that, that, that this is a law that is aimed at Muslims. I think, uh, you can invoke the secular republic, you can look, invoke the separation of church and state. You know, we talked about that this country went to the inauguration and north haven, Connecticut of, uh, our dear friend who was just elected select when the other day, and it was supposed to be separation of church and state. And they were, you know, there were prayers and they were in vocations and all of this business. Uh, but I, I see this as directed at Muslim women because they are Muslims and other people don't agree with me, but I think, but this has been a lightning rod for, for the way that people treat each other.

Speaker 1:          42:13          And who has the right to be who they are in, you know, in France. Um, and as I said, the French Republic has even refuse to acknowledge the existence of ethnic groups. They're not counted, they're not countable. And part of that, as I said, is that you don't want to make people feel different by saying you are so many people from muddy. You are so many people from Senegal. You are so many people from, with Algerian background, uh, or whatever. Uh, but, uh, what the government did is talk about the necessity of order of imposing order. And that's what he talks about, his order and the police in order La Fosse daughter. And there's no talk much anymore about equality. Uh, and it gets lost in this is that old French commitment to human rights, which is something that one can only value. And given that the total degradation of, of views of human rights in, in, in, uh, in, uh, you know, well, we'll get into this, but in, in this country, uh, recently, uh, I, um, you know, when could only a wonder, it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          43:13          Um, and ironically the state of emergency that was declared in 2005 in the fall was based on the state of siege law that had been imposed in 1955 during the Algerian war of independence to try to impose order on Algerians who want it to be free and they use the same law without any kind of, oh, excuse a new, and we were very sorry this law, we understand this is a different situation or is it, who knows? Uh, and uh, it was this fact was not lost on Arab minorities. Uh, the Portuguese immigrants may be the largest single national ethnic or other from other places group in the Paris region, but it, but Algerians are not far away and what this riots did, and this is a good place to end since we can do we have to end, uh, is it a, made clear that in the civil that there's been a breakdown in civil society, in the fringe suburbs and that obviously something has to be done.

Speaker 1:          44:11          And there's been a lot of talk about how we're going to pump more money into voluntary associations, but nothing has been zen zen Ho. That's what people said the other day. Uh, the red belt, uh, remains, uh, uh, uh, you know, a dream of the past. Nope. They're communist party is hardly, no, no one's out there defending these people. There are no political parties. There's the SLS Ross season, uh, uh, Harlem, uh, uh, Daisia is an old group. Uh, but I've yet to see a political party, uh, embraced the cause of these people. The way, for example, even the communist party embraced the cause of, of, of, uh, the small percentage of French peasants that is 8% or 5%. Even now, uh, in, uh, uh, left in France. Um, and the credits that had been locked off by the previous government, US still have never have never been returned.

Speaker 1:          45:01          Um, there aren't enough funds at the moment to create jobs. He tried to create these employ young jobs. Do they call them the people to help old ladies on with her, on the trains where their suitcases, but these are temporary work. You know, there, I mean, the problem is, uh, is an enormous problem and it's not something you can kind of be drempt away, like saying, well, they are out there and you know, Paris, we'll still have all of this American and English and German and Belgian visitors because they don't go with the Clichy Suwon they go to look at north for dom and the Eiffel Tower. And when they fly over places like Sar Salar or Gosh, Mulago Ness, you know, they don't pay much attention to it. And so one, one thing that people have to do, and I suppose this is what I'm doing now, uh, is that one can only, Eh, uh, you know, encourage public awareness of the kind of marginalization of, of lots of people.

Speaker 1:          45:46          You can't turn Europe into sort of fortress Europe. You know, you can't imagine the kind of thing that the Americans want to do or some Americans want to do. Build this huge wall, a new Berlin Wall between Mexico and the United States. You know what they going to do in Paris, but a huge, huge wall, run the peripheral leak, uh, have the highway running around Paris and then leaving it open to Versailles of course, and the fancy suburbs on the, uh, on the west. Um, so, uh, for a moment, I mean a lot of people in 2005 at the end, or if you ask him in 2006, you ask young people even to participate in who said garbage can on fire. What do you think has come out of this? The, the ones who were most charitable about all of this said that look, uh, with commodities is that we've tried to make France and w and the world and Europe people, they had to comfortable places to don't think about these issues, uh, uh, aware of these problems.

Speaker 1:          46:38          But this isn't a problem that's going to, it's going to go away. And once you can see it as a problem, it's a challenge. Uh, and uh, because they, you know, France believes deeply in the tradition in this course, uh, the, of course, you know what I mean? The, the history of France and Liberty Fraternity, equality. And there's the times when push comes to shove and you have to actually show that you mean it. So, uh, hopefully France will remain France. Uh, but hopefully this situation will improve, but it's going to take a lot of action and not just kind of polarizing talk and appealing to two electorates who just want the whole problem to go away. Um, your final moment yet go away. And I want to thank you for taking this course and I'm going to put these things outside and you can sign up and once you sign up, you're signed up. So be sure to know where you're supposed to go for your final. Okay. And have a wonderful break and have a wonderful end of the semester and see you, see you around email next semester. Take it easy.
