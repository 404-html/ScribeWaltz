Speaker 1:          00:01          I have taken my favorite mid term story, maybe one or two. Have you heard this before? The point of this is that you don't screw around with midterms because people put their game faces on. You're going to have your game face this on a Monday. But maybe 10 years ago, somebody in the first half of this class raised their hand as um, you know, the day before the lecture, before the midterm said, oddly enough, what, uh, what language will the midterm Ben, and this is before we had French speaking sections. So I mean, I don't know, you ask a question that it was fairly silly question to give a fairly silly answers. So I said Croatian I, and um, so then I started thinking, well, I'll play a little joke on him. Ha ha ha. You know, don't screw around with midterms. And so I have a colleague who is Croatian and so I made up the following question, which he translated in the Croatian.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And so the test, you come into the tasks and you get your basic piece of paper with the, it says the answer, one of two of the following two questions. And there's a third question in Croatia with a translation by evil bonnets. And the question was mine, I take full credit or discredit for this. The question was the population of Paris in 1831 was 630,000, uh, 721 people, um, name these people and in, in, in, in a second, in a second column, a list those who own more than one apartment. Um, so if you've got a question said the population of Paris was 630,000, 731 name these people, would you answer that question? Three people did. So you have to think, what have they been drinking? What have they been smoking? And so what do we do? I'm screwing around with a midterm and we have three blue books answering question number three in Croatian not responding in Croatia.

Speaker 1:          02:00          And that would be extra credit. Uh, and the first person says, well, I've been logically enough people. You must, what people must panic. I must've done this too when I showed up late for midterms or whatever, if I remember to go, uh, you know, you just, you panic and you start writing. And the first person that said, well, you know, Miriam and he's real interested in social geography. So roller, a pretty coherent essay about how the rich people live in the west and the poor people live in the east and the wealthier people in the center and the poor people in the periphery. So I mean, so we graded that as a, as a, as a, as a real answer person. Number two takes pen. I remember male or female person number two takes pen and starts writing a column. I'll buy za zoo include, I'll buy sa John [inaudible], outbound Isa, CSEC gay rights, names, rights, French names sitting there for, for 45 minutes writing names.

Speaker 1:          03:03          What do you do with that? Uh, I mean, I called psychiatric surface as I, I don't know, I get to say, I got to do with this stuff. You know, I this crap. And so the third person a says question number three, and then just sort of just drooled all over the, all over the blue book for about the next half hour, you know. And so we get these things, get to soggy blue book and you get one with a kind of a half ass but still okay. You know, essay on social geography and you get the third is a bunch of names. So what do you, how do you grade that? Uh, we had a council of, you know, a, a meeting to discuss this and I remember what we did. I know we gave the first person some sort of B plus for the, for the essay and, and uh, uh, you know, number two, I think I, I, uh, can vote the person and then maybe call the college dean to say, you know, some of us have Pi San Matias and much pie on a tee probe.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Namco Ma'am knew. Anyway, I didn't mean to screw around with it, which in return, I'm sorry. Oh, I said Bob, maybe I, I tore it up at the end. There was probably about 17 or 18 names and they were in alphabetical order. So it wasn't that the, the, the midterm was a total loss, but that's the last time I screw around with, with, uh, with midterms. So, uh, do we, uh, Brian, uh, mobile, however, we, uh, uh, do we do our, we are your people and getting this in French, the midterm or in English, but the exam, and we do the examine in a few minutes. Are we going to do that in French horn? Okay. What, uh, so let, let's, uh, let's start, where was I got, I got, I got taken out and taken out there a little bit here thinking about those old times.

Speaker 1:          04:48          Um, I want to, I want to do they talk about 1917 and 1918 and talk a little bit, uh, a little bit, uh, about the, uh, about the mutinies, um, of the mutinies have to be seen in the context of course, in all these assaults. But above all the battle of the Somme and the battle of the Somme, which began on July 1st 19 a 16, was, uh, was the darkest moment, uh, certainly in, um, uh, in four years of, of, of dark days on the first day of the battle of the Somme. I always give these statistics, but there's some interesting, uh, the first day, 1st of July in 19 a 16, almost 40 sols and British soldiers were killed in one day. I, and, uh, I mean 40,000, sorry, were wounded and 20,000 were killed on the fray. First Day there was a casualty for every half meter of the entire front line.

Speaker 1:          05:48          So one casual d for every half meter of the front line. And I gave this, um, this is this the first day what I was going to give you an overview of the course, but there were more I British soldiers killed or seriously wounded. Um, and the first three days of the battle of the Somme, then there were Americans killed in World War One, a Korea and Vietnam combined. And then you could include the 4,000 that had been killed in this, uh, uh, current, uh, uh, absurd war. Uh, and so, I mean, that's it. Those are phenomenal losses. And so the question again, when you look at the poisoning of the political atmosphere and the absence of, of, uh, of, uh, able leadership in Europe in the 1920s in 1930s, uh, where were they? Uh, in the case of Britain, they were at that poem went, hung up on that old barbed wire because they were dead.

Speaker 1:          06:43          And, uh, you know, sometimes it's, it's easy in, in British society, such a class society, and it's easy to kind of poke fun at Oxbridge Sha folks going in their common room and then going off to a, you know, machine gun, a Indian and surgeons, uh, and this sort of thing, but to the flower of British, um, uh, youth perished in the flower of, of other, uh, countries, youth, uh, during, uh, during this time. And so the immune needs have to be seen in that context. And I'll come back to them. Uh, uh, it's back to them, uh, in a, uh, in a while. Now I'm 1917 is, is the crucial a year, uh, really in a determining, uh, uh, the outcome of a war that seemed like it was going to go on forever, a forever not, not defined by truly forever. Uh, but, uh, that in 19, end of 1917 and beginning of 1918, um, into March 19, it will, after they slow down the Luton Dorf offensive in 1918, uh, the military planners begin to think that the, when the war in 1920, 19, 21, maybe if all went spectacularly well in 1919 and of course there were, you know, as so many people died due to win a few, um, uh, a hundred meters or a kilometer or two kilometers, three kilometers at best, there were wags who said, well, if this rate, we'll reach the Rhine, somebody figured out by the year 2007, uh, which is, uh, where we are now more or less, if I remember that statistic, but a two things happen in 1917 that, that are, um, that are essential.

Speaker 1:          08:22          One is at the Bolshevik revolution, comes along, uh, with first the revolution in February where the people of Saint Petersburg w wake up and find that the emperor has no clothes, that there's police but not troops. And the bread lines are long. And, uh, the, uh, the, the czarist autocracy falls, uh, leading to that sort of power vacuum and Corinne's keys, provisional government. And of course, at an October, uh, the Bolsheviks after one attempt that failed the Bolsheviks seized power. And at that point, the war changes dimensions dramatically in the east. Russia is still in the war until the treaty of Brest [inaudible], uh, in March of 1918. Um, but the, the, the propaganda, which was more than that of, of, of war bread and piece, I mean, that's a motto to live by, uh, means that, that, uh, you've got, um, uh, a de acceleration in the Russian war effort and you've got massive, I'm a massive desertions from the Russian army.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Um, now, one of the amazing things is that the desertion rate was so low compared to what you will, you know, what you think would happen and is rather amazing that the, that the Russians were, were able to hold on. Uh, uh, again, I mean, just as the Germans were close to, uh, uh, close to, uh, Paris, uh, particularly in March, 1918, uh, uh, the German forces are also quite a close to Petrel God, which, which, uh, Lennon God had been. Um, I mean, not letting him go on debt at Saint Petersburg had been renamed because Petrograd does sounded a, sounded more Russian. But the other thing that, that, that changes the outcome of the war is that the Americans come in. Uh, and, um, in the United States, um, you know, the United States were supposedly neutral until 1917. But outside of, of places with strong German populations, for example, uh, Philadelphia, uh, Milwaukee, uh, Chicago, uh, the majority of Americans supported the allies as defined by the British, the French and the Russians, and particularly through them, uh, uh, the British component.

Speaker 1:          10:34          Uh, but it wasn't really that that brings the Americans into the war, the German high command to make, again, one of these interesting long stories, very, very short had decided that that the only way they can win is to knock the British out of the war. Uh, and the way that they could knock the British out of the war is to stop the supply of, of a munitions of food, of grain, of almost anything else you can imagine to, um, to Great Britain. Now, how you're going to do that? Well, the way you're going to do that is with, um, a campaign of, of unrestricted submarine warfare, the famous u boats, uh, that, uh, the sink, an incredible, uh, a number of ships. Um, and, um, the German, uh, the German government goes down, sends representatives downs to the, down to the docks in New York and other ports, Boston and other places.

Speaker 1:          11:25          And they put up warning saying that, that, uh, you know, the civilian passengers or any other Americans who go on ships ought to know that they're entering a war zone and could be sunk. Um, and the, the German u boat sink, some ships with American, it's on them. Uh, the most dramatic event was at the sinking of the Lusitania, uh, which I'm sure you all know about in which lots of Americans, I can't remember how many, but it might was hundreds and hundreds. It might've even been a thousand. Uh, I apologize for not having a statistic in my eye and my head, uh, were killed off a, I think it's fairly near, um, Ireland. And of course the Americans go wild and say that, uh, uh, this, this, um, you know, ship was carrying, passengers are going over to Britain and, and uh, civilians. And, uh, this was, uh, an act of piracy and active war, an act of murder, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          12:15          It turns out that, and I think it was a 1960s, they're 1970s. I vaguely remember this. They sent divers down to down into the Lusitania and they found that as the Germans had claimed, was absolutely correct, that the Americans were, uh, the ship was carrying munitions. And therefore, I mean, I'm not defending the sinking of the ship. I'm not defending, you know, of the thinking of any ship. Uh, but, uh, but clearly it was, it was carrying weapons. And that's one of the reasons that the ship went down was such a dramatic impact is because all the munitions blow up when the, when the German torpedo hit it. But, but the law and the over the long run, what happens is, is that that the man who was going to keep America out of war, I would, Roy Wilson pro, former president of Princeton University, uh, ends up taking the US into war.

Speaker 1:          12:59          And those of you who had American history from Glenda or, or, uh, other people want to go more, other folks, um, here will know that, that, you know, in the end, I mean, most Americans really didn't want to go to war. And, uh, Wilson, who was the first American president, by the way, ever to leave the United States during a term of a term of office, a ghost of Versailles, uh, to the treaty of Versailles after the war. And then he can't get the treaty ever, uh, uh, ratified by, uh, by the u s congress. After that. I mean, his, his repudiation is, is, um, a really complete, uh, unfortunately for him at the end of the war. Now, what difference did the Americans come into? The warm of coming into the warm mean in 1917. It was not the, the troops. I mean, lots of troops.

Speaker 1:          13:42          I begin to arrive, um, and led by pure perishing, John Perishing, who had done, who had honed his skills by, uh, you know, shooting down Mexicans, uh, in, uh, in Mexico. Uh, it, uh, and they have the reputation for being sort of cowboys and earnest. And they are the, uh, the typical American image is really a, though it's been desmin devastated in the last four or five years, but, uh, uh, really is created by the Americans arriving to fight. And you're well trained pistol, uh, uh, wielding a sharp shooters and all that. And they first go to the first fight at Chateau Gfe, which is not very far from Paris. It's northeast of Paris in 1917. But that's not what makes the difference. Uh, American troops in the long run will help tilt the scale to, uh, to the allies, uh, and it compensates for, um, for, for what we've discussed in terms of the French not having a, you know, they're gonna run out of soldiers.

Speaker 1:          14:34          But the big difference is that the curves cross, uh, that the curves of the ability of the Germans to supply, uh, their own forces, uh, that the German war machine, uh, is not going to be able to compete with the combined power of American industrial might. And Detroit can be easily converted. The factories in Detroit and Ypsilanti and Flint, Michigan in lots of other places can be easily transformed into production of, uh, uh, if slanty yeah. Into a production of arms and, and places like, like that. And so the curves cross, and it's at that point when many people in, uh, you know, the French and the British high command along with the Americans, they know they're going to win the war, uh, in a, in a, in the long run. Uh, but the question at what, at what cost? And, and, and, you know, the lively discussion as there had been in Germany, over German war aims, uh, you know, the Germans, if they win the war and the West, they're going to want demand part of Belgium, they're going to want to probably more of Lohan, uh, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          15:35          Uh, uh, the French also, uh, have their war aims that are going to want to have a permanent French, you know, presence. They're talking about that and in the Rhineland and, and as well as taking Alsace and Lauryn bet. And so that helps set up, which I'll come back to talk about in a while, uh, 19, 18 march, because that's when the German say, baby, it's now or never. And so that's, that's the, the big Luton Dorf offensive, which I'll come back to in, in March of 1918. That's important, uh, uh, uh, to say, to discuss at least, uh, a little bit. Now what about the mutinies and what about other aspects of, uh, you know, of, of the war? Um, uh, they have to do with, with, with, with the home front and in the mutinies are not on the, on the, on the home front, but they're, they're quite a close to it.

Speaker 1:          16:28          As I said at the beginning, um, as I said at the beginning, your, um, most people in France did not want war in 1914 but because it was easy to portray Germany as the aggressors, which they were, the vast majority of the population, uh, obviously was prepared to hold on because of the proximity, uh, certainly of, of Paris, uh, to, uh, to the front. And this is right through the war. It's right through into the failure of the Luton Dorf offensive. Now to be sure there are tensions within French society about the war. There was tremendous, uh, resentment and you can see photos of this resentment, uh, as, as, uh, in, in Paris. Opera was one place where they distributed coal. That was ray rationed in order to have to have heat. And as you know from the discussion previously of the Golden Buddha, you know, that's where many of the famous restaurants and cafes, the cafe now, he can't, uh, uh, the, the, the cafe lawpay and ironically, the cafe de la pay, the cafe of peace, uh, and all those things are, are, are, um, uh, located.

Speaker 1:          17:40          And so as, um, as people waited in line to hope to get a few chunks of coal in order to stay warm and in these cold a Parisian a winters, uh, they saw the fancy people in their big cars. I've driven by chauffeurs, uh, going off to the great restaurants and people who had profit tiered from the war and named me a war in which people, uh, uh, do not profit enormously in, in which some aspects of big business are not just gleeful with every extended tour of duty. And, and, uh, you'll have that, you'll have discovered something that I didn't know existed. And so there's a lot of tension toward, toward up, uh, a to a profiteers, to legal, the big guys, the fact guys, they global ne the big hats. Um, and you've got those tensions, but you have more than that. You have tensions between those people who, uh, PA peasants, they Payza who are, um, you know, conscripted without any real possibility, unless they've already had two brothers killed.

Speaker 1:          18:39          Uh, and that saves them. And for example, skilled workers in the armament industry, uh, for example, around Santa Tn, Santa Tn, uh, is an armament manufacturing town or was they used to make bikes there too? Neither. They don't make it either there anymore or in tune in, in, in the Co has a places that make arms people, skilled workers got out of the draft because of that. And thus they worked very hard. Uh, uh, but there was, you know, there are some tension, uh, towards, towards that from, uh, from, uh, for example, people in, in the Macias on tile, uh, where you have the, the, the most endless lists of names killed that one could ever see in Avania and places like that. So you have those sorts of tensions as well. Now, the role of women in all of this is of course crucial. A because it's in the factories.

Speaker 1:          19:29          Uh, particularly and not ski and not highly skilled work because they didn't have the from us. You are the training in that, that women step up and uh, and replace men. And also, again, the role of nurses is so important. And so that's what I was inconceivable for many French women after all of this, not to get the vote after World War One, whereas in Britain, uh, women, uh, uh, get the vote after World War Two and the United States, Rosie the riveter, you know, working in a factory in Detroit or in, in, uh, uh, Pittsburgh, uh, you know, became sort of an icon for a, you know, sort of in the Crypto, uh, uh, feminist movement, uh, in later decades. Uh, so you have some tensions there. I mean, you also had workers who would come back and of course, after the war, if they were lucky enough to survive Brunello top Bruno Gabon, we'll probably talk about this next week after midterm, you know, they, they get thrown out there the last hired, so they're the first fired.

Speaker 1:          20:20          And there's some tensions between males and females over that too, because, well, the males had been out in the trenches and then they want those jobs back and, and all of that. But another thing is rather interesting is of course the role of women in, in, in them, the nurses and the big, you know, the, the, the northern French nuns and the Belgium nuns with those huge hats. Uh, you know, the, the, the, and, and it was easy to become anticlerical and we've talked about that before. But, but one of the things that calm that situation is the role of, of the clergy in particular of the female clergy in attending to these horrible, horrible wounds and, and some cases going, you know, going to the front is, you know, working with ambulance as in this sort of thing. It's a other women did, who didn't happen to be nuns.

Speaker 1:          21:02          And if, for example, the, the, the, the, the case of Leon has been documented and Leon was the capital of the Radical Party with the big are socially conservative and v but very, and, but, but, uh, moderate politically, but based upon built upon anti clericalism, uh, and in Leon where there was a vibrant kind of anti clericalism before World War one that calms down because, you know, these nuns who people, uh, you know, attacked, representing in some ways institutionalized role of the, of, of, of, uh, the Catholic Church and French society. We're extraordinarily heroic and so are these priests and, uh, you know, in ministers and, and, and, and indeed, rabbis who of course, who get killed by shells, uh, as they're giving the last rights to all of these, uh, people who, who have been killed. And there's another attention to that's not talked about so much. Uh, but I, I can, I've heard it in the end.

Speaker 1:          21:51          There's a collective memory of a, you know what, where we live too. Is that one of the things that happens with the warrant, obviously when you look at a map of France, uh, that they popped him all like the aisle then and the n and the mountain and, and the product Kallai and the na are basically German or the front line is running right through that. Did they pop them all? So you've got these millions of people who become refugees and they are going, Eh, you know, they're in a more organized fashion than in 1940 when everybody's seen the pictures of them walking along the roads, caring what they can, and then diving into the ditches as the, as the, uh, loose, uh, as the Luftwaffe, the German, a fighter plane, the German air force is strafing them in a more organized fashion, but you still have to somewhere to go.

Speaker 1:          22:36          You have to have someplace to end up where you're going to be fed. And so where they end up, well, they ended up in the places in France where there are not, where there's not fighting. And uh, and it became, is that people get tired of the war by 1917. Well, at the time, I mean, everybody's tired of the war, but, but as, as as one gets even tired or of the war, you hear the sort of grumbling about these people from the north and they speak at different accent. Uh, in some cases if they, if they speak German, they speak a different language. If they speak slimish. And there are lots of Flemish speakers who come down from, from, uh, the Knauf and places like cause Buka and all of that. Um, and so they are strains on local resources, which are already extremely limited.

Speaker 1:          23:19          And so you even have this talk, a grumbling, it's not more than that, but grumbling in cafes and bars about, uh, Paris is war, but also about the Bush do know that is the Germans of the north. And in one of the things is that a lot of people in the north of France or blonde and a lot of people in the majority of people in the south of France have dark hair. And so all of a sudden there's is a ride. It was a silly way of viewing it, but this is how people viewed it is that, you know, you had your bom blind people in the south and you have dark people in north. I mean that life is like that. But you have the, the rival of these people, many of whom will collect their Dutch, you know, who are arriving and who caused some sort of strain, a strain on, uh, the building of communities to, uh, to take care of those who perceived as, as of their own.

Speaker 1:          24:12          And so 1917 is a big year for that as well. You have, you have other kinds of, uh, uh, you have, you have other kinds of problems you have in 1917 is the year lots of men and women go on strike. Now, they are not, these are not defeatist in quotes strikes, but the strikes and Santa tn and many of them are, are involving women, uh, are demands for better working conditions for better wages. They're part of the Sacred Union Union Hay, but they want better conditions. And so the strikes in 1917, again, they're not the fetus strikes, they want to win the war, but it's the same thing as the, the movement, uh, before the war for better conditions, uh, that why should you work for worse conditions than men, for example? Or why should it work for conditions when the prophet hears are getting rich and the global born the big bonus, the big hats are getting wealthy.

Speaker 1:          25:02          Why, why should you have terrible conditions? And so these strikes, you know, are very widespread. Clem soul. Uh, it'll come, it has more power. In 1917, he becomes prime minister. He says, I wage war. I wage war. I wait. Wage war. That's all. Uh, there were attempts to break the strikes, but it's a year where the, the, the morale of the Home Front, uh, is, is extremely, um, it's fragile. It's more fragile, 1917 than any other time. And there seems to be this enormous disparity between this or a howling propaganda of, of, of big, big newspapers in which everything is a great victory and defeats are just tiny setbacks a step back. And if, if things are so damn good, why, you know, why are the Germans still close to Paris? And so it becomes pretty hard to explain now. They don't have the problems that the Germans will have because, and that's a different situation.

Speaker 1:          25:51          A very good book edited by my friend, um, uh, j winter, uh, and, uh, coming from the zone, do we do a rollback, uh, called Capitol cities and at war, because conditions are worse in Berlin than they are in, in Paris. Uh, but conditions are much better in London than they are in Paris. And that's the only for fairly obvious reasons. So the losses are still a equally bad, uh, so that that year in 1917 is, uh, uh, is a bad year. Uh, but overall, uh, things come are calmed down. And, um, uh, for these reasons I've already said it is a, a, a turning point. Now, what about these, the, the strikes, I mean, what about the mutinies? Uh, how serious were the mutinies? They were probably only two, uh, divisions that were totally reliable standing between the Germans and Paris at that point. Not reliable. Uh, again, to the extent that, that the, that they want the Germans to win because they don't, but they want, for example, the rights of the French were trying to keep, uh, representatives from the Socialist Party, from going to Switzerland or going to to Sweden to meet an international peace conferences, uh, and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          27:01          Um, but one of the, I spoke earlier earlier, whenever it was Monday, about this sort of discontinuity or the contrast between, uh, the soldiers view of the war and that other civilians and one of the, uh, and how the soldiers back on leave didn't want to talk about it. And, and, uh, you know, couldn't really give that precise kinds of information anyway, uh, because off it's all swirling around them and they don't really know what's going on in other places except where they are. Uh, but one of the best evidences of that is the fact that nobody, as far as as we can tell at the home front, really knew at the time of the, uh, of the mutinies about how serious and widespread the mutinies were, uh, that they didn't really know. Now remember also that, that in fact, this is one of the key sources for Bruno coupons.

Speaker 1:          27:49          Magnificent book, uh, on, um, uh, Vic called rated the French translation to English would be, we'd be sort of something like a victory plunged into morning. Ah, that is the return of the soldiers. One of the principle sources are letters written by soldiers from the front that were collected and censored by, uh, by military sensors who don't want the, uh, these letters revealing to civilians much of what's going on at all. And so that also explains why people at the home front really didn't know a about how widespread these new knees were, nor did the Germans, nor did the British, uh, uh, outside of the high command have any sense of what was going on. Now, um, these mutinies, it's not, uh, uh, to, uh, hard to say, uh, why, you know, these movies take place in, in, in, in, uh, when they do, uh, or, or why they take place at all.

Speaker 1:          28:47          Uh, it is not, again, to feed us and they don't want the Germans to win. Uh, they have some respect, lots of respect for the German soldiers that were fighting against the law at the end of the war. They still just with seeps out of these letters is maybe on, we'll talk about this next time, uh, is, uh, uh, you know, hatred for, you know, the horrible hunt, et Cetera, et cetera. But is that, you know, anybody could tell that these tactics were just killing hundreds of thousands of people for nothing, for nothing. That there wasn't going to be a French British breakthrough that the battle of the Somme grounds to, uh, a halt all along the front, uh, for obvious reasons after, uh, you know, a, you know, after a matter of, of, of, of really days but weeks, uh, and that there isn't any, uh, any, any hope, um, that it began when one company, oh, by the way, how do we know this?

Speaker 1:          29:43          Uh, you know, we don't know it from Kirk Douglas. Um, most archives in France are, um, can be opened up 50 years after the fact. So, uh, what is your, is this 2000 something where the 2007 so we could see the archives 50 years ago, but not, uh, uh, 49 years ago, but with the military archives, because this was so sensitive, the mutinies, all of these documents were in the war archives and vast sen, and I saw them before they were open because I bribed my way in. Uh, I was not to see them, I was working on something else, but they're the person that ran this, that we're arc. I was just totally clueless. Totally clueless. And she lived for about, you know, three hour Tris or lunch breaks I guess more appropriately. And then, uh, um, and I knew these documents were there and so I knew also somebody tipped me off that the Gao, the end likes a stamps.

Speaker 1:          30:35          And so I would put all these wild sort of stamps on my, you know, mail letters when people still use stamps and, and, and, and, and I had one from Latin America and one from Africa. And, and this guy comes up, he's okay. Very beautiful. The stamps. I said, Oh, do you like stamps? And you're, yeah. So, yeah. So, well would you like these? Oh, thank you so much. And they're pretty soon I'm in the, in the archives, uh, in the back, you know, and, and he's, he's an officer too. He's some sort of a lieutenant, a guy, either ogre guy. Anyway, so I bribed my way in and you could see these, all of these, these cartons, and they were changed. They were literally all chained in this big kind of capsule look like a space capsule, except it was just looks like the basement of Branford college or something.

Speaker 1:          31:18          But, but you, you couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't get into those pigs that was taught to be the national disgrace, uh, that there had been these, uh, uh, these mutinies, uh, and the mutinies were, uh, were indeed why widespread? And so what happens is that a refusals to go, uh, to go over the top a simply spread. They spread like wildfire. Soldiers say they don't want to get killed anymore for 5 cents a day. In some places there are red flags go up. In some places they're black flags, which are the, the, the flags of anarchism. But, uh, remember that, that uh, you know, the Socialists had also joined the, the uh, uh, joined, uh, the sacred union. And as you'll get ends up being minister of Transport, minister of a communication or something like that in 19, um, uh, uh, in, but in 1915, if I remember correctly, and two regiments that are posted and Swat Soul Swipe Sloan is not very far away from Paris.

Speaker 1:          32:19          That's swa song was about a 45 minute drive away from Paris by car. Now two regiments decide they're going to march on Paris to try to set things right. They're going to force the Chamber of deputies to find a way to end the war. Not to, to say we want the Germans to win, uh, but to find a way, get some sort of negotiated so that this carnage, uh, stopped. Um, most of the generals who were fairly clueless, uh, see organized Bolshevik propaganda behind this or pacifist, those people coming out of Sweden or Switzerland and trying to stop a, a the, the useless way this war is being fought. Um, uh, it may and June about about 40,000 soldiers were, um, involved in collective, um, uh, acts of, of uh, of refusal. Uh, and, um, the, although the generals insisted in their correspondence that those 40,000 people were cowards.

Speaker 1:          33:19          I know this, obviously it was not the case, and many of them had already been shot up and already been wounded. And already we're, we're, we're, we're, we're going back. Um, and, um, the first signs of this, by the way, are the soldiers were, were supposed to move up in order to prepare to go over the top, began buying like sheep, going Baa, Baa, the way that sheet by and the way to the slaughter, the, the slaughter house. Uh, because that's, that's where they were going. Um, now there, there was socialist and passive as pacifists literature that had, uh, uh, happily enough, uh, you know, in my view had to, had gotten into the trenches. But, but, but th th this is not the motivation, uh, and pay town, uh, you know, who ends up being one of the evil forces in France, but this was the early town, uh, when pay town, uh, he realizes that, that this is not the case.

Speaker 1:          34:06          Uh, that, uh, um, and in fact the repression is much less severe than many of the generals wanted a more about that, uh, uh, in, in a minute. Um, and so he ends the policy. Petain does have these mad attacks over the top, the whistles blow, and then they simply get slaughtered. Uh, they, uh, in some areas, and we don't have exact statistics because there were certainly some people are just put up against the wall and shot in and we don't know. It's just like after 1945, uh, we don't know. We have a guest of 10,000 people were killed in the reprisals in 1845. But that's, that's a pretty rough account. Uh, but, um, there were 3,400, 27 condemnations, um, about 10% of the people who were, who faced some kind of, of, of court martial for something they did or something they didn't do.

Speaker 1:          35:05          Um, and 49 were condemned to death, which is not, I'm not from, for condemning anybody, uh, uh, to death. Um, but, um, it, it, um, and, and these were carried out as in the movie, uh, as in the film, uh, immediately, you know, it's just up against the wall, Bang, Bang. And Peta, uh, tries to, he tries to bring in, um, uh, he tries to bring in better conditions, I mean ups the booze ration as well. And of course that was a pretty happy, uh, so I'm in all, in fact, I said 40,000, but there's another statistic, uh, that, that, that, that goes as high as 70,000 people. Uh, and uh, let me throw in a statistic. As long as we're doing that, uh, for strikes and set, 1917, there were 689 strikes, a affecting 300,000 workers. That's a lot, twice all meal, 300,000 workers.

Speaker 1:          36:04          And that's compared to 98 strikes in 19 a 16. But again, uh, we know fascinating, um, uh, aspect. I'm repeating, uh, I is that this was not known and this was not known. Uh, you know, then you couldn't drive it in 45 minutes, but this was not known, uh, in, in Paris by the general population. Uh, what had, what had happened. And then the end, uh, France, uh, France, France holds on now in the spring of 19. Um, and the spring of 1918, the Germans launched their victory drive, uh, in quotes, uh, the first major German offensive since 1914 before spend. The British and the French attempting to break through. Now, if the same time, the Austrian Hungarian Empire, uh, the army is all the cracks that were quite predicted and predictable. Uh, there are all sorts of problems there and funds. Yosef has died in 1916 and so the Germans are quite unsure whether the fostering going to empire is going to be able to hold on, uh, uh, in, uh, uh, you know, fighting against the Italians for example, and member of the breast, the Tosca is not, uh, is not signed until March of, of 1918.

Speaker 1:          37:23          And the Americans have by spring of 1918, 325,000 soldiers. That's not a huge number of soldiers, but, but there's still three times, Michigan football stadium full. So that's, you know, that's, that's a lot of people. So Luda nerf decides on a massive German assault along the poor, old some river, therefore avoiding the mud of Flanders and avoiding, uh, the forts of eastern France around Vietnam. He was encouraged by the fact that there are younger soldiers that are just barely 18 that had been put into, uh, uh, into, uh, uh, the ranks. Uh, and he also has brought up old, much older men too. So they have some serious troops in order to try to pull off this breakthrough. And so on 21st of March, 1918 after a relatively brief bombardment of five hours as opposed to five days, 1.6 million men who could have imagined these numbers, who could have imagined these numbers.

Speaker 1:          38:22          In 1913, a 1.6 million men attacked the ally defenses, uh, in five separate, uh, our defenses in five separate offenses over a front of a 40 miles. And they do break through in five days. Some German units have pushed forward more than 40 miles. Uh, the, uh, uh, uh, complimentary attack in Flanders, uh, does very well indeed. Uh, and the, the British troops and the French has as a, you know, a General Haig. Uh, uh, in Britain famously once said, we're fighting with their backs to the wall. And on Easter Sunday of that year, again, the shells from big Bertha loved all those miles from the north fall on Paris through to Rivoli. You can still see a sign where it took out an apartment building, Church of Santa Fe, uh, uh, you know, right near the sand, the same thing. We'll have our [inaudible], uh, up by Moh Parnassus, same thing.

Speaker 1:          39:24          So these shells a fall, and they begin, uh, taking, uh, alive. But what happens, uh, was predictable and predicted is that as on the small scale in the big scale, the Germans begin to outrun their cover and supplies, and they begin at each one of these five points of German offensive to encounter a stiff a resistance. On July 15th, Ludendorff tries a last desperate attack, uh, and it's, um, it's, it's repulsed. And for Luna Andorf. He knew this was the last chance to win the war. And at that point he knows it's a lafond, the article, the end of the green beans, uh, that they're simply not going to win. And that the French, their resources swollen by the mirror can entrance into the war, uh, are not going to sue for an armistice, armistice until they've pushed the Germans back across, uh, the Rhine. And we're at that point, morale plunges dangerously in Germany.

Speaker 1:          40:29          In January of 1918 250,000 German workers defy the government by going on strike and strikes were illegal during the war. There's all sorts of hoarding and so there's a big problem and the French, uh, forces counter or the allies, the British, the French and the Americans CounterTack in July. And at this point when they're in the open for the first time tanks that you've all seen, pictures of them stuck in the mud, uh, now, but when they're in the open tanks began to work rather well, and they'd been getting to adopt a strategy of having soldiers, infantry following tanks, and therefore not getting picked off, uh, a, you know, in such huge numbers, and they begin to make a big a difference. Uh, on the 8th of August, 1918 of the German army's darkest day, the, uh, there are all sorts of attacks against the German lines and a British force moves force moves eight miles.

Speaker 1:          41:25          Uh, and that though that's a territory that was unimaginable, uh, in the beginning, at this point, Luton to RF us the hapless of Wilhelm, the second that is all over, but the shouting and you better figure out some way of bringing, uh, this whole thing to, uh, to an end. And as, as, as you know, in the end, uh, uh, go home, the second will slither across the Dutch border. Uh, and the armistice will be signed in a railroad car and comb PN, uh, uh, north of Paris. Um, there's still a railroad car there or it's not the same one. And that's where Hitler insisted on the declaration of the armistice in 1940 being signed. So the war ends on the 11th of, of, of November, 1918. And as you know, there were many people, not many, but there are lots of people killed after were because they didn't know that the pharmacist had come along and that the, that the biggest pan-am DEMEC ever in human history, at least since the black death, uh, in the 14th century, uh, the Spanish flu, uh, is, it was called a, it probably started in India, uh, but had already began to slip a sweep through, uh, a sweep through the world.

Speaker 1:          42:32          So, uh, things were not getting better and better, but they were getting worse and worse. Uh, just a few, I mean, obvious, uh, statistics. I mean, you can see these all over, but, um, uh, it, it is, uh, it, it, it, it is staggering. Beforehand was something that Jay Winter, uh, has, um, has, uh, begun one of his books, uh, with, um, and just in terms of dead and wounded, uh, just a couple, don't reckon, write these down and you write it down or don't write them down. But anyway, uh, Russia dead, 1 million, 800,000 wounded 5 million. Now that ain't nothing like World War II, 25 million dead in the Soviet Union in World War Two. But 1.8 million is a rather lot, uh, to, uh, to be killed in France. Uh, the French, um, at least two, probably more than this, but, uh, you, you hear figures from one point, uh, 1.4 million to 1.5 million.

Speaker 1:          43:33          Dead and wounded, 4 million, 266,000, Great Britain, including the empire, the dominion, the Australians, uh, the Kenyans a dead 908,000 and wounded 2 million. The Italians, 58,000, 578,000, excuse me, with about a million wounded, uh, in Serbia, which is a very small country. Dead, 278,000 wounded, 133,000, tiny Belgium killed 38,000 wounded 44, uh, uh, and among the central powers, Germany, 2 million dead, 2 million dead. After all that, you know, with your armies, how do you explain to the folks back home, all those people dead, why you've surrendered will, must be someone's fault. And that's what the right would argue. It's the Jews. It was a socialist. So it was the communist there hadn't a stab in the back. How do we explain this to the folks back home? A wounded 4 million more than that. Austria, Hungary. The amazing thing is they held on so long giving you all the national, given all the national differences, 1.1 million with wounded, uh, 3.6 million.

Speaker 1:          44:47          I mean, these are just statistics that are so incredible. In France, there are 36,000 communes and there were only 12 that didn't have somebody killed. And that's where when you go to any French commun except those 12, you will see, uh, uh, you know, a list of those people killed or even inside churches. Sometimes they'll have the parish ones and if the war monuments or near the churches, that tends to happen more in areas that were still Christianized, where people still went to church. And I mentioned this once before, but if you go to the booboo nay or the Rda, you still, you find these war memorials that are sort of like Voltaire of God exists. How could he or she let this happen with broken crosses, shattered crosses that were lamenting that this could happen in a, in a so called civilized world. And of course, one thing that happens after the war, it as, as Charles pointed out, you know the other day is that if you've been told, if you ate, if you, you're an African in their urination and you've been told that this is the great civilization, that the Europeans, they've got it all, you know, you've been told by them that they're better than you.

Speaker 1:          45:51          How do you, how do you reconcile that to what they're screaming at you and they're little schools trying to teach you their language? If they're, if they're so damn better, how could they bring, uh, all of this upon, uh, upon Europe? There is by the way, but one soldier left in Great Britain who still alive for more. We're one, he's a fellow called Harry Payne. He was born in 1898 and somebody just published a book about him. And periodically on Armistice Day, he is interviewed. You can hear him on BBC, but with the passing of time, of course, uh, you don't have that anymore. And I can remember even my Magennis, I can remember, you know, seeing these very aged people coming out in November 11th, uh, so proud of, you know, of what they did, uh, fighting and you know, in the Americans too that did. But in those days, those were different wars and those were different countries.

Speaker 1:          46:49          And I would argue also that was a very different America. Anyway, just to simply end with something that Jay winter leaves us, uh, with. He has a wonderful book, uh, uh, about morning in memory and he begins with a film. He begins with a film by about Goss. I bet a Goss ga. And Ce did a very long overrated film on Napoleon Napoleon with a famous snowball fight. But he did a book. He did, uh, uh, he takes a Zoloft, his title, but he did a movie called Jack Hughes. He makes it a 19, 18 and 19, 19. He made it before, uh, the war. Uh, his is over. Uh, the hero is a guy called John Diaz. He's a wounded soldier, poet. And he goes crazy. He begins to lose his mind. So many people that did after all that in World War One, he escapes from a mental hospital and he goes back to his village and he brings all the villagers together and he tells him about a dream that he's had a in the asylum.

Speaker 1:          47:53          And um, in the dream in the movie, you see a battlefield graveyard with all the crosses. They're all there and they're all a skewed. And a big black cloud comes up behind the village graveyard in the ground, in the, in the, in the movie. And magically, these ghostlike figures emerged from the grays with tattered bandages, missing arms, their bandages to began. I began to unravel around their head. And some are blind who they've lost their sight and some are coughing out their lungs from the poison gas and they leave the battlefield and they go back to their own villages to see if the sacrifices have been worth it. And what they find is what Jay calls the pettiness, a civilian life. That the black marketing, uh, the profiteering, their wives had been sleeping around. Uh, things aren't the way they should be. Whereas they have suffered, but they come back, they're alive again, but they're really dead.

Speaker 1:          48:55          And their appearance so terrifies the villagers that they decide the men their ways and to, and to, to be big, become better people, better people. And so the, these, these ghostlike figures in their advantages, they marched back to the cemetery and they go back into their graves and it's all over. But what's it's, it's, but what's really interesting about it is it some of the soldiers who were on leave at that time on premise, y'all were used as extras in the movie and you can identify them. Someone who has lost his arm. Really, it's not a fake missing arm. It's a real one. And some of them who were there in the movie go back to the war and are killed. They die real deaths in their graves with their tattered vantages. And as if art and reality has emerged. And that's an important theme in all of this because there's no war, no more powerful moment in history that has brought us such great literature and all of this, and there's no war like this ever. That end leaves so many demons into the world, and as is some of those demons that we will now next turn, but not today. Good luck than the midterm. Have a great weekend. Rock and roll.
