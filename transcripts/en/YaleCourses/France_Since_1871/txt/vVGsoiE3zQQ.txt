Speaker 1:          00:01          I'm going to talk about anarchism today. And especially, I'm gonna talk about the life and death of a one guy. Somebody I don't admire I on me, but in a way he represents some aspects of the origin of modern terrorism in, in late 19th century Paris. And I guess if you're gonna write a book about somebody, it's not a bad idea to pick someone who only lived to be age 21, uh, can make for a shorter book, uh, cause he was getting, uh, as you'll see, uh, in 1894. Um, so, uh, there we go. Um, first of all, no anarchists. I'm like, socialists did not want to capture the state seize control of the state. They wanted to destroy the state. They wanted to abolish the state. Uh, they viewed a political participation. And in this way, there are other like to syndicates as are propping up a capitalism and its army defending the interests of wealthy people.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Um, the first anarchist was a man called a poodle. A who's influenced really a is in the 1850s and 1860s, uh, and put on, was from, from the east of France. He was from Bezos Song, uh, in the east, and he once wrote a pamphlet called property is theft. Uh, in 1841, uh, he met too much property or unearned property, was theft. Uh, but it was a provocative kind of title and he wants, wrote the following to be governed is to watch, inspected to be watched, inspected, spied upon directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censored, commanded by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be governed is to be at every operation that every transaction noted. Registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed the license, authorize, admonish, prevented, forbidden, a reformed, a corrected, punished, and on the pretext of public utility and the name of the general interest to replaced under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from squeezed, hoaxed robbed.

Speaker 1:          02:25          And then at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint to be repressed, fired upon vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused club, disarmed bound. Um, check in prison, imprisoned, uh, judged, condemn, shot, deported sacrifice, sold, betrayed, and to Crown, all mocked, ridiculed, a derided, outraged, dishonored that is government debt. It's, it's justice that is hits it's morality now predominant followed by two important Russian, uh, anarchists, both of whom I won't talk about, but who extremely interesting. And both of whom were Noble's a one as a guy called Peter Kropotkin and the other, the terrifying, quite terrifying. Uh, Mikhail Bakunin. Um, and they become a quite important, um, Kropotkin, uh, who was a gentleman, a geographer, and once toasted by the, by the king of, of England, uh, and in the end, uh, was horrified by the Bolshevik, uh, uh, a revolution. He was among those who came up with the term propaganda by the deed.

Speaker 1:          03:33          That is the belief that, that the masters were potentially revolutionary. And it took a single spark, a single assassination, a single bomb to start revolution rolling. And our kiss a assassinated, depending on how you count it, five or six or seven heads of state, uh, in the late decades of the 19th century, including a President Mckinley of the United States who was a shot or stabbed, I can't remember which in, um, in Buffalo, New York in 1901, uh, that number included as we'll see in a while, a Saudi council, c, O, s t a r n o t, uh, who was the president of, of France. So I want to begin with, with a bomb. And I've had, because of this bomb years and years afterward, I've had the rather odd, a feeling of twice having eaten, uh, in the cafe restaurant that my book's subject blew up. Uh, the cafe a terminus, and it is a turning point in, uh, the origins of modern terrorism.

Speaker 1:          04:41          On February 12th, the 1894 a pale seeing young man called [inaudible], prepared a bomb in his room in Paris. He hid it in his closing along with a loaded pistol in a knife and he headed toward the elegant boulevards near the Paris opera, which had been completed 20 years earlier. He wanted to throw the bomb and kill as many people as possible on restock before the opera itself, which as you can see, resembles a giant golden wedding cake. There was a fancy ball going on and he knew he could not get past the guards to get close enough to claim any victims. He then checked out the restaurant, be no followed by the cafe America and then the most chic of the mall, the Cafe Dilla pay in the Garland hotel, which is still there. He was in some way a flaneur and intellectual who had briefly in his life and something of a dandy, but if so, he was an impoverished Flender who lived on the margins of urban life and who now came to the grand boulevard, not just to observe what detached distance as the flood or did, but to hate and now to kill.

Speaker 1:          05:53          He moved on finding each place was not crowded. A crowded enough. At 8:00 PM, he reached the cafe Termi nous right next to the golf Santa, the czar around the corner from the guard Salazar, and it's, the cafe was slowly filling up. He ordered a beer and soon, uh, another and then a cigar. And in a rather an anarchist like gesture, he paid for them is the small orchestra played on. About an hour later, he walked to the doorway, turned, lit the fuse with a cigar. He sued the bomb back into the cafe, which was now very crowded, already famous for its great expositions. Paris more than ever identified with ledger and with consumerism had become a permanent exposition in itself. It's boulevards, the staging ground, as you'll see later in the course for the belly. PUK department stores welcome clients with Dazzling Electric Lights and arrange shop windows, inspiring Zola to call them that cathedrals of modernity.

Speaker 1:          06:56          The isles of the department stores were, as has been argued, a continuation of the great boulevards themselves. In contrast, the poor workers lived along the narrow grey streets of the calc ta. Popu there. Uh, this is not a county pope you there, this is, uh, the, the terminus that will be in neighborhoods of eastern Paris. We're cholera had killed a as late as 1884. The rebuilding of Paris by mine in the fifties and sixties had chased thousands of ordinary people, uh, by higher rents to the exterior, a neighborhoods of northern Paris, northeastern Paris, and to their working class suburbs. But the capital of the world that is Paris was no longer the capital of revolution. Soldiers and Paris seem to be police and soldiers seem to be everywhere. And there were indeed many more of them for that matter. Ost Mons boulevards were too wide for barricades to August.

Speaker 1:          07:54          And Wow. The impression is painting the new boulevards that line, the, the, that the buildings that lined the boulevards were cold in, lined up like soldiers at review. A nice description of the consolidation of state power in 19th century France on May Day 1891 troops fired on demonstrators killing women and children in the small industrial town in the north of me. Uh, woolens town France may not then have had strong executive authority because of the fear of Caesar Ism after two Napoleon's, but no other state was so centralized. And so in the early 1890s did anarchist, uh, begin to create small organizations along the move, which is the room move tab behind the Ponti Y'all where a guy calls you on Gob published one of the anarchist newspapers at number one 40 here and there in the Latin quarter, but above all in Mamacita, uh, and in these northern industrial regions and beyond in, uh, uh, suburbs.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Now the 1880s and nineties, will as you, you may already know, uh, we're, will be remembered as a time of scandal. The sleazy Panama Canal scandal and lots of other ones. The president's son in law is selling the ledge own donor, uh, et cetera. And the memory of the Paris commune loomed large for anarchists. More than 25,000 people had been gunned down. And now from the heights of Moma and from Bellville, uh, another, uh, peripheral neighborhood anarchist looked down on the flashing lights of the Capitol, and they hated many, admired the Russian anarchists, Michael Bakunin, uh, the, uh, who for whom destruction was quote unquote, a creative passion that would bring about the end of the state. Capitalism, uh, and private property, uh, the modern state, but, and wrote with all its terrible means of action given to them by modern centralization was becoming an immense crushing, threatening reality as those slaughtered Komi now saw ops close in May of 1871.

Speaker 1:          10:05          And so a wave of anarchist bombings swept the capital between 1892 in 1894 they ended with the assassination of a Saudi council, uh, in June of that year in Lino, um, after two attempts on his life, King Umberto, the first of Italy noted that assassination was quote, a professional risk, and indeed he was later assassinated himself. Yet many of the anarchists were, were people of peace. Uh, indeed, uh, and, and women of peace. In the case of Louisa Michelle, about whom you, you can, uh, uh, can read, uh, for, uh, for core Plotkin and before Him who'd all, uh, the goal was the primitive, the goal was sort of communities that would exist without the state. Uh, Kropotkin they had lived in the French is Johan Mountains in the east and also in Switzerland. Uh, and they're watchmakers seem to get along fine without the intrusion, uh, of, uh, of the state.

Speaker 1:          11:04          But yet, as I said before, it was a Kropotkin who accept it and may have created the phrase propaganda by the deed. Uh, sometimes, uh, attributed to, uh, the Italian anarchists, Mala Testa, who had lots of influence in, um, in Spain, in Italy and in Argentina who doesn't look like such a terrifying guy himself, uh, when you see him there. But again, the belief that a single act of violence would be the spark that would bring social revolution. Now, Kropotkin later had doubts about this and he said, personally, I hate these explosions, but I cannot stand as a judge to condemn those who are driven to despair. It can. He had after all an 1880 describe the importance of permanent revolt by oral and written propaganda by the knife, the rifle and dynamite. Everything that is not legal is good for us. Now, dynamite was invented by that man of the peace prize, Alfred Nobel in 1868.

Speaker 1:          12:08          And what it seemed to do was level the playing field. Uh, it seemed to represent a modern revolutionary alchemy, uh, and as a compensation of for many evils, for humiliation and weakness for discrimination and frustration and anger at social exploitation and injustice. The German anarchist Johan most who came to the United States, um, he, we had written in his newspaper freedom that it was within the power of dynamite to destroy capitalism. Justin had been within the power of, of gunpowder and the rifle to white feudalism from the face of the earth. And American anarchist crowed before being hung in Chicago, Haymarket 1886, uh, in given, given given dynamite to the downtrodden, millions of the globe, science has truly done its best work. The famous Robert Shoal, Francois [inaudible] took this to heart. He had been born in, in non poverty near Santa tn in 59, his father, a Dutch mill hand who abandoned his wife and four children in primary school and it mass.

Speaker 1:          13:17          He was embarrassed by having closed shows so shabby that they resembled those worn by beggars. He worked here and there, but periods of unemployment became longer. He turned toward anarchism also to grave robbing, counterfeiting and finally murder strangling a strange old hermit who had a lot of money stashed away in his house in the hills near Santa Tn. He was arrested, managed to escape the police wagon and went to Paris living under an assumed name in 1891 police fired on demonstrators on the boulevard, p sheep in Paris on the edge of Paris. Three were hauled to a police station and they were beaten up, put on trial and co two condemned to long prison sentences. Ravish shoals, two deeds followed. He bombed the houses have two of the magistrates on the boulevard, Sandra math, very elegant neighborhood. And on the route of clichy. Uh, what, uh, on the way home he stopped in a restaurant called Le v, v e r y with an accent on the boulevard Magenta.

Speaker 1:          14:22          A way to remember to scar he had on his left hand. Three days later, he went back to the same place to eat because he'd eaten well. It took 10 policemen to subdue them. See this hand, he told judge and jurors it is killed as many bourgeois as it has fingers. He was teen on the 11th of July, 1892, uh, in the Luau. And when Brazil several days later, a destroyed the restaurant. He killing the pots hall, the owner leading to the ghoulish punned that served as an anarchist signature. Viv Costume, Ravish Shul. So terrified contemporaries that for a time his name became a French verb to revel show eight [inaudible] somebody was to dynamite them. And after his death, the anarchists of Paris and they're, they're exiled friends in London from all over the continent, uh, debated long into the night. The wisdom of such attacks would print. Here, you can see it by the artists.

Speaker 1:          15:27          Charlotte. Mohan reproduced in a widely read anarchist newspaper portrayed. Ravi shoal is a martyr, his defiant heroic face set within the frame of a guillotine. Some sympathizers began to compare their martyr Robert Shoal to sort of a violent Jesus Christ, both Christ and Robert Shoal. We're 33 when they were executed and out. An anarchist song sang a song called La Rava showed that is the song of Rev, a show to uh, uh, the tune of ha a song from the French Revolution in the great city of Paris live, the well fed bourgeois and the destitute who have empty stomachs but they, they have long teeth, long live rava shoal. Let's dance the robber shoal a long live the sound of explosions. So it will be so, it will be [inaudible] in his eulogy for a robber Shawl and anarchist critic art critic Paul, a. Dot. And literary critic Paul, a dom warned that the real murderer robber shul will open an era and it did, uh, an anarchist writer outrage.

Speaker 1:          16:35          Public opinion by provocatively stating what do the victims matter if the gesture is beautiful. Bull. Just a vertical psychosis took hold of Paris with people of means afraid to go to red, good restaurants or the theater and in Nice neighborhoods, people fearing to rent two magistrates for fear of lay. Dina Meteye, the dynamites hours near nearly 20 Parisian dailies carried each installment of anarchist attack. This is a bomb. This is a cold meat. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a pan. It's a casserole. Uh, but it's a bomb. Hundreds of scrawled we, and here's the first, you know, they, they, they advantage of this time that the wagons that did come to, to, to detonate, uh, and to make safe as best they can, these objects. And they kept filing, finding joke bombs and sardine cans and stuff like that. And so here's the municipal chemist, the Guy Calls Ya, who's checking this out.

Speaker 1:          17:36          Uh, hundreds of scrawled threats and which I read, I might, you know, they're in the archives there, uh, arrived to a property owners and the concierge, uh, uh, to people of means, uh, uh, by the Avengers of Robert Shoal a or an anarchist from the neighborhood, uh, address to an exploiter of the proletarian. Finally, the day when a social justice will arrive next Sunday, the 1st of May, you will be blown up, signed Ladina meat and in Monaca a benefit dance for anarchist played the dynamite Polka, uh, as one of the dances, the well known next act on the 9th of December, 1893 August of [inaudible], an unemployed worker distraught and being unable to feed his family, tossed a small bomb filled with tax thumbtacks into the Chamber of Deputies. His goal was not to kill. There were several scratches on the deputies, but to call attention to the plight of the poor who situations seem to be getting worse and worse.

Speaker 1:          18:38          He was captured on the spot. The get your immediately, instantaneously after a, a brief trial severed his head as he defiantly shouted, the obligatory long live anarchy a meal. On Ray's father, a militant Republican who wrote poetry. He had been elected to the commune from the 10th, or only small, and was a member of the central committee of the Federated National Guard. And the Paris commune. He fled under the, uh, a sentence of death to Spain. Um, and in Catalonia, he worked in the mines, uh, turning from socialism to anarchism cause the anarchists were terribly influential, uh, in Spain, right through the Spanish civil war. I, particularly in Barcelona, uh, and also in under the Sia in the south. And Meta was born in 1872, uh, in a suburb of, of Barcelona, uh, dominated by the textile factories. He had two brothers fought Shanae, uh, who, uh, was older, who had the same name as his father and Judah, who was 15 in 1894 following his father's death, uh, in 1882 from what appear to be mercury poisoning a madam, he, uh, returned to Paris with her children, and it's the region, uh, in mule became a pupil of the city of Paris, uh, receiving the equivalent of a scholarship, uh, to, uh, school, uh, outside of Paris.

Speaker 1:          20:05          Uh, his mother bought or had a little bit of land that had been in the family, uh, and found, uh, started up in Obash, uh, right down the street from this. I was actually an end. I was actually able to find it to go out to this place called Braven, which now, you know, strangely enough is not all that far from you. Oh, Disney, but then was truly, uh, in, uh, in, in the countryside. So, uh, I mean it only becomes a scholarship student. Uh, he, uh, he's very smart. He gets a certificates of merits in all the schools he goes to and he gets his box, his baccalaureate exam, you passed us as the age 16, uh, which was a pretty tough to do. Um, he was examined in physics, math and chemistry, and he would put some of the later, uh, to use as we shall see the last report on his scholarship red.

Speaker 1:          20:56          He will begin studies next year at the Ecole polytechnique, which is one of the grounds they call the big, you know, military engineering school. Extraordinarily hard to get in. He was classified as Adam deceived that as he could be admitted. But after passing one part of the exam, he failed the oral exam, but he could have taken it again. He claimed that one of his friends threw a stink bomb into the room when he was taking the exam. Uh, and, uh, you know, said later that he vowed vengeance on bourgeois society, blah, blah, blah. Uh, that wasn't the case. Um, he took a position with an uncle, an engineer working on a water project in Venice, but he precipitously returned to France. He dabbled in spiritism trying to contact, uh, the sole of his dead father. And that's where we try to move tables around and, and, and, and all of that is anarchist friend, a shot Amato total claim that he lost his footing and fell into the abyss of spiritual spiritism even becoming a medium of incarnation and wasted his health in such exhausting experience experiments because he longed for knowledge, but he left it all behind.

Speaker 1:          22:00          Uh, and, uh, in Paris, he worked here and there while living on the margins of urban life. His brother a false to ne, uh, became an anarchist and was a prominent orchard at the meetings and debates held in smokey, smokey halls and cafes on the edge of Paris, principally more math, uh, and the full bull, uh, do tops and in the Latin quarter. And he went to jail in 1894 for things that he'd written immediately. Now, 20 years of old, 20 years of age of what La [inaudible] Mu, uh, he was called microbe by his classmates because it was relatively small a size. He was Pale, deep set black eyes as you saw and sport at the beginnings of a blonde beard on his chin to go with chestnut hair. He was devoted to his mother and would walk or take the train out to a, not a really nearby station, uh, to go and, and, uh, and visit her, uh, and there with a bar, several tables with workers drinking wine, the inevitable, uh, checkered tablecloth, green shutters, and a red brick roof, uh, and chickens a poking around.

Speaker 1:          23:14          And, um, laundry hanging out to dry. Uh, as I said, it was a village and the other 120 francs that a immunotherapy you earned a month, he gave about a third of his mother to his, uh, to his mother. Um, here she is, uh, down below and there she is up above on the left, prematurely aged. Uh, and that is one of the places that he, uh, that he lived that we'll see later where I've, I've been to everywhere that he lived, I've got managed to get into the buildings I've everywhere. He lived a sort of, you kind of walk around and follow them. I don't admire him, but it's interesting to try to, to try to see what he saw and that's what I really love about history. Uh, anyway, so he, he began meeting with some of the anarchist groups. He read Kropotkin his great book, the Conquest of bread as well as works by Mala Testa and various French counterparts.

Speaker 1:          24:07          His two targets were private property and authority to vicious germs, as he called them. That formed the base of contemporary societies that he wrote have to be destroyed, eradicated from social life. He remained an intellectual, somewhat detached, arguably from those people who crowded into these anarchist meetings or who came to get for once a bite to eat in the various lectures where soup was served to the poor afterward. Um, in contrast to y'all who loved the people by almost the guy executed for throwing the TAC bomb, a Mulatto remembered immediate, only loved the idea. He felt a mark estrangement from the ignorant and survival plebs Plebeians, uh, a feeling distinctive, uh, also have a number of literary and artistic anarchist by whom he met. Uh, no, no, uh, uh, less, uh, a painter then can be, uh, uh, [inaudible] Ho who was a Pizarro who, who was, uh, an anarchist.

Speaker 1:          25:09          Uh, and, and mark also was the center of this sort of literary and cultural anarchism, uh, the, the anarchism of the sort of intellectual elite, uh, who lived in [inaudible] because it was cheaper and they're, they're the next generation removed down to, uh, uh, Montparnasse. And then when math would already become the sort of tourist trap it is now though, it's still has, uh, it's, uh, it's charms. Um, I mean all, he was a loner. He never spoke in public as far as we know though. He didn't shout out some things at one it meeting once. Uh, he was described later after his death is the sounds used of anarchy. Uh, sounds use was one of them was a cold, steely guy who had ripped off his mother's silver during the, before the French revolution, who became a member of the committee of public safety. And uh, he and Robespierre where sort of main men of, of the committee of public safety.

Speaker 1:          26:04          Uh, so he didn't speak like false Janae, who was a really gifted orator. Um, and in March, uh, 1893 fortunate gave a speech, uh, at this one place where they met over and over again denouncing the government class, uh, and the bourgeoisie. And he appeared to pull a dynamite cartridge from, he said, this is our arms. These are our arms and appear, deploy, pull a dynamite cartridge, uh, from his pocket. Uh, it actually was nothing but a pen or a pen case. But he was arrested and so was a mean. Uh, and m immediately lost his job. Uh, at that point he worked in, in the garment industry. I love this cause here's the, the root of a song ta in the center of Paris. And that's still, you know, the finest, so beautiful from the 1890s that they left it there. That company hasn't been there since World War One.

Speaker 1:          26:57          Uh, but that's where immediately, uh, uh, worked. But he lost his job after he was arrested and then, and then released. He bounced between, um, uh, between bad jobs once working as an apprentice and unpaid watchmaker in order to perhaps work on timing mechanisms, uh, for, uh, for bombs in 1892. And he always got very good employers, loved him because he was very smart. He was, he served as a, as an accountant. He penned letters and that kind of stuff. Um, but in 1882, he briefly served as the manager for the anarchist literary, uh, a newspaper. Uh, in the meantime, he was gathering materials to make bombs. And learning how to prepare them that July, he and he and his brother may have gone to Santa tn and mom result with the intention of blowing up the house of the magistrate in Robichaud is trial down there.

Speaker 1:          27:51          But, and I, I went to Santa and to try to, uh, you know, find that if he actually went there and the police think he did, but I have no positive proof of that. Um, anyway, he, um, he, uh, the police informants and the police were everywhere. If you want to see this, it'll, Joseph Conrad has a wonderful novel called the secret agent. Uh, and GK Chesterton has another one called a man who would be Thursday in which all seven anarchist in this antithesis anarchist group turned out to be policed spies. And Lennon was just riddled with police spies, uh, you know, watching the Dutch and Spanish and French and Russian and Czech anarchists and all the others. But anyway, uh, he was overheard telling somebody, I didn't put enough nitroglycerin into this one, uh, and it didn't work, but I'm gonna put a little more acid next time and we'll see what happens.

Speaker 1:          28:36          And the police report, which I've seen assigned him to the number 318,532, uh, and so he had a police existence, which was good for, uh, uh, for me. Um, the police, as I said, it infiltrated these groups. Uh, one of the, the, uh, the, the police spies who is known as x number for a reported that the old ways of the anarchist no longer seem to be in play that were anarchists, hadn't used to go to these big halls where the police were scribbling notes and identifying everybody was there. That the ones who had to worry about, we're not the ones who were in the hall giving speeches, but as the one who are looking in the shadows looking for other people with, uh, you know, with evil deeds, uh, as it were, uh, in mine, they were the ones who would show up and then leave quickly.

Speaker 1:          29:30          These were the most violent and one is the ones who are capable of carrying out propaganda by, uh, the deeds. Uh, they were not the ob, the posers, um, or, uh, the boasters, uh, they were off by themselves and they reflected a debate with an anarchist circles between the association analysts who had ended up being cynical lists and those who believed in the individual autonomy in individual autonomy that the single anarchist making his decision to go out and, and kill individual autonomy. And thus, you know, I use the, the uh, the description of, of, of, of this lecture for better for worse as dynamite club, but dynamite club was the perception of our, not the police, cause they knew better, but of the public that imagined that, that, that behind every incident, every sardine can was in there for various plot to destroy organized a society.

Speaker 1:          30:36          There was no club, but there were some violent individuals capable of minorities within anarchist movement of doing deeds on the 11th, backing up one year for reasons we'll see. The 11th of November, 1892, an employee of this, uh, of the mine company of cow Mo, those mining strikes that John had catapulted jr has to fame, um, found a suspicious looking package on the floor outside the company door at 11 avenue. Uh, Dillup. Aha, they're 11 up on the left. This is 1900. This picture I've gotten into that building to my son and I did, I would showed him where that he put the bomb. It's still a very elegant, uh, uh, uh, elegant building. Um, and they carried it downstairs, rather stupidly, place it on the sidewalk. It's a back entrance. And a policeman came along and said, well, you better take it to the police station. I'm not noticing that there were a little powder that seem to be coming out of this, uh, uh, this, uh, machine is, they used to call them in those days.

Speaker 1:          31:39          Um, it was a reversible bomb. It was a bomb not made by a fuse, but by chemicals. And when they came together with blow up. And so these, these poor policemen are carrying it to the nearest police station, which is there, no, that's the f the building now. Uh, you can get into, it's on the first floor. I love stuff like that. I just love it. That's the police station, which is still there also. And so they carry it into the, through the course first courtyard. One guy says, hurry up, it's heavy. I was a heavy thing. They put it in, put it down on the table. Boom. Arms, legs everywhere. Gone. Five people killed in the most horrible way. The bomb had been wrapped in a newspaper. Uh, the issue of Luton from June 1st, 1892 which related the story of the arrest of a meet Ari and his brother and me.

Speaker 1:          32:33          Then when we left Paris the next day for London, sending along his apologies, he was a list on a list of 130 suspects. He hangs around Fitzroy Square, which now is so expensive. So Charlotte Street just full of one fancy, uh, an affordable restaurant after another. He hangs around with the anarchists there. Um, a friend of Oscar Wilde's remembered meeting him there. He spoke some English but not terribly well once he told people, today is the anniversary of the dancing lesson by which he meant bodies jumping up and down in their last final agony, uh, in, in the police station. He was proud he had exterminated six enemies. Mulatto said he grew in his own eyes. He said to himself that his role as a destroying angel had just begun. But why didn't they think he was a serious suspect? Well, because the policemen that particular day, that day in November eight, 1892, he'd gone to work near the Gal, do know the station of the north.

Speaker 1:          33:37          He had two errands to do. One was near the Church of the Madeline, the second with way up by near the Arc de Triomphe, his boss gave him some money to do these errands and policemen tried to do the same thing and said that he could not have gone back to his house in Moscow to the fifth floor roof at home. It doesn't matter. I love this stuff. And got the bomb gone all the way back down to the avenue local Aha. And then finished his errands and got back in two hours and 15 minutes pop. Oh. So I did it. I replaced a tram way and only booths with, you know, buses and Metros. And I replaced a carriage. I never take cabs with a cab and my cab couldn't turn left on the avenue loop high. So I subtracted 11 minutes. I paused, I couldn't get that day into the one of his houses where we put the bomb.

Speaker 1:          34:30          Um, and I came back in about two hours and 15 or 16 minutes. Somebody did the same thing in 1894 and said he certainly could have done it anywhere anyway. Old immediately is off in London now. Um, let, I'm just trying to now to imagine what he imagined, what converts them to anarchism was the appalling a gap between the wealthy and the poor in Paris and other places. Uh, the heritage of his father, uh, of course with some, had something to do with it. Never had people lived it up and such flamboyant, uh, want to get even say egregious ways, uh, as in Paris, in the belly book, the so called gay nineties. Now that the nostalgia for that is, is a creation really of how horrible things would be later with world war one. But, but still the, the belly pope was not bell for very many people, but what leads him to anarchism is, uh, is that everywhere he lived.

Speaker 1:          35:27          And that was the only place, the exception in a minute ago, which was near the busty everywhere he lived was on the edge of Paris. And everywhere he lived, the facades of the buildings are still the same is one that's near a Momar. Ah, and they're building sock recur. This is from that same time the hadn't been completed yet, but it's, it, it's big bell drowning out. The whole city hadn't been put in there, but this soccer career was built where, uh, where the commune had been, had started and it was a, it was seen as a monument of penance for the government of the moral order. And so that they hated this and they refer constantly to this. Uh, they have fantasies a as all, I wrote a novel called Paris, but he in 1898 a, which is modeled after a meal, Henri and some of these other people.

Speaker 1:          36:16          And, and the brother of this priest who liked it, you know, rem record is losing his religion. He has these fantasies about blowing up, sock recur and Emilio and relived near there, he lived in the Ruby at home, which is now fairly sheikh. He live in the top floor up there. That's where he went to get the bomb. And then he moves into this place. It says, Vila full share hasn't flow for sure. And that's not fancy at all. Uh, but, and this is the same facade. He lived on the inside there, uh, in 1894 and I went up there cause I, you know, I gotta see, I gotta, I gotta See, and this is a pretty, uh, a sketchy neighborhood and there are a lot of d there, a drug deals going on here. And I didn't want to look like, uh, uh, seek on CV.

Speaker 1:          36:57          You know, I'm a plainclothes cop and I don't want it to last. I don't wanna look like a wealthy tourist either. And so, you know, I kind of hid behind the truck and took pictures and I walked in and said something like, so seller Liga and uh, you know, every day I had to see, but when you walk out of this, that's how you got in. That's 1894. When you walk out of this, you turn right and there is the park of, of, of bevy and down below the plus lateral cat, when he would lose his head and he looked out, he was lucky he couldn't see the tour Montparnasse uh, which didn't even exist, but he could see symbols that he hated. There was a tool he fell that had only been there for the Eiffel Tower, been there for five years. There was the Ponti on where that the State is commemorated its heroes and there was no true dom, which he hated as well.

Speaker 1:          37:46          And so he once wrote that love can lead you to hate. He wrote that before. He's gay teens and he hated, he loved humanity in the abstract. He loved his mom too. But he, he loved humanity and he hated the state. And so he sent out, he set out to kill. So these are, uh, these are sort of visual signifiers, I guess in the new cultural history. They would call them these buildings upon which are these monuments that he looked down, uh, and uh, and hated. If you've read, uh, Balzac's old Gfi, oh, ever in your reading career that at the very end of the story, Rosti neck is up at perilous as cemetery. And in the poor parallel, she has not poor but, but the area around it is, and he gestures down to western Paris, the fancy Paris, and he says the equivalent of its war between you and me.

Speaker 1:          38:39          Now Baby. But he wanted to make the big time. He wanted to sleep with the right people. He wanted to, to just do better and better for himself. Immediate already says that, points down in those neighborhoods. And he says, this war between you and me now baby. And he meant it and he built bombs. And he went out to, uh, to kill a, at a time when anarchist deeds were being celebrated by some, uh, anarchists. The explosive device that he threw into the cafe. Termi News. February, uh, 1894, hit a chandelier, then a marble table and fell to the ground, exploding. 20 people were wounded of whom won. The, uh, later died, broken glass paces of pieces of, of tables and chairs, blood and injured people. Fear was everywhere. Uh, and our architect had five wounds, a draftsman, 17 Ari had seen, I had been seen.

Speaker 1:          39:39          He did after all sip just his second beer first also. Uh, and at one point, not, not, so he wouldn't be caught. Let's, so we can rule out indirect suicide, uh, which I'll talk about just briefly in a minute. He said, Oh, where's the scoundrel that did this, uh, and runs away. And he's chased by policemen, by an apprentice barber, by, uh, a controller from the, from, uh, the trauma way. And they finally catch him, uh, around the corner from, uh, from the Garth's, none of those are, and the, and he fires point blank with his pistol. He also had his knife, had that poison on it as well. Uh, uh, one policeman called [inaudible], uh, is, was very lucky to have escaped, uh, uh, with his life because his big wallet with was hit by, uh, by one of, of these shots. And so he's put in prison here in the Cosia Gov, and that cell no longer exists that he was in now don tall and Robespierre and Marie Antoinette and, and, uh, Louis the 16th, we're also in this prison.

Speaker 1:          40:42          And one of the great sources about this guy's life was, uh, the prison guards because they're trying to get information out of him and he tries to convert them to anarchism. And, and you know, they have very interesting, uh, kind of, uh, of relationship. Um, the first night he was in prison, a friends of his broke into his room and took out enough, uh, dynamite to make 14 or 15 other bombs. And so Paris is to say the least on a high alert. Um, and so, um, on the, uh, is, was put on a trial, uh, and in, uh, flourish. Uh, he, uh, I saluted anarchism and gave a declaration, a four anarchism, uh, that, uh, was red. Uh, and it's still red, uh, today. Um, where he says, you have Gary to deaths in Spain. You have a hung us, and in Germany you have shot us, uh, here and there you have, uh, uh, you let you have a, a guillotine destined France.

Speaker 1:          41:43          But what you can never do as extinguished and are key because it's, uh, it's, um, it's roots are too deep. Uh, not surprisingly, he was condemned to, uh, to be executed. Um, and that he was on the 21st of May, 1894, uh, and an early morning at 4:00 AM four in the morning. And the, the, the executioners all come from the same family in this guy called [inaudible] was, it was the execution. I got to go back to that woman in a minute. Um, this is DBA who was called Mr [inaudible], who was the chief executioner. And for him, one where execution was just, you know, just one more execution. The last public execution and France was 1936. The last execution in France, uh, using a gay teen of course come WTF was 1972 or 1973, I can't remember what date. And you know, in the chill of that morning where people paid for paid for, uh, uh, seats on the roof.

Speaker 1:          42:44          And there were, there were little children whose parents bought them seats as if they were on the roof as if you're outside Wrigley field in watching the cubs from a, from a roof far away, uh, uh, executions were festive events for those people. Also finishing there other nights. And there was always sort of, uh, uh, uh, some speculation about when this is going to happen, when is he finally going to be executed? And the scene which I've tried to recreate in this book of, of deep layer of the wagons with the wood of justice showing up and, and with the apprentices doing their work and putting up this guillotine, uh, as if you're putting together this, this basically perfect toy that didn't need any nails because everything fit together so well. Uh, you know, they're really, this guillotine scenes were so important for anarchist also because it's part of the idea of martyrdom, a revolutionary immortality.

Speaker 1:          43:36          And now this comes from a Christian religion also, doesn't it? The execution scenes. Uh, you know, I, again, I mean, I, you, I, you see what I'm saying in that, but, but, but the, the scenes of the martyrdom and the use that anarchist put to this are still, uh, uh, are still rather, um, rather important. Now, uh, was this a form of indirect suicide? He'd fall in love with the wife of an anarchist and her building is still there too, ironically, not far away from the place where he was executed. And he hit on her and they would go out with the husband to his obash and he per word reclaim as love and, and she kind of blew them off. Um, it was an indirect suicide. No, obviously not because he tries to escape at the end and then she tell you no. And real anticipation of the modern life, she is out giving interviews to the journalists after his execution.

Speaker 1:          44:30          Uh, she's saying, oh, he loved me so much and, and, and one can well understand why. You know, I, the whole thing was just, just, uh, incredible though, but it was not any kind of indirect, a suicide at all. But what do I mean about the origins of modern terrorism? What was new about it? Well, a couple things. Rava Shul vial, we're very poor. Robert Shaw was a pullover tip, a sad sack. Viola was not, he was very honorable person. Most of the people in Western Europe, there are some exceptions in, in, in the Russian case, but these were an anarchist. It's a group called Neuro Novo People's will. Um, we're, uh, we're ordinary workers and me, don't worry with an intellectual, he was an intellectual. That's new. But that's not as important as what else was new. Instead of targeting a head of state or a uniform person, as other anarchists had done, he just picked people who were having a beer, petty, bourgeois, the hated because they propped up capitalism and through the bomb at them knowing he was gonna kill a lot of them, he sat there and looked at them.

Speaker 1:          45:38          There's a very amazing scene in battle of Algiers and the movie metal jurists where this woman's going to place a bomb and she's looking at people that are going to die because of what she is doing there. And he looked at these people and he said, uh, I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you because I love, I hate. And that's really new about it. Is it worth at all musing about what this has to do with, uh, with, uh, modern terrorism? I don't know, just a, a few, uh, uh, reflections. Uh, there is no doubt about that, that there are some connections. If you take, you know, a psalm of enlightened, for example, he announced for it as everybody knows and the late nineties that he'll attack civilians, American civil billions, just like American military people. That's perfectly obvious. Um, that, uh, another, uh, another connection is within modern terrorism.

Speaker 1:          46:34          I mean, you have this, the of alliance between intellectuals, students and, and, and, uh, uh, people who are simply a down and out. I mean, there are big differences also. I mean the suicide bombers is something, you know, it's very different but, but still there are things that are, we're thinking about third. And you know, there's the whole idea of revolutionary in mortality that you kill people. You die and you have revolutionary immortality. Uh, for many a fundamentalist terrorist you pass into, into this immediately into this nirvana fourth, uh, both set of terrorist target, a powerful enemy, a structure they set out to destroy a tariff and tried to kill one warrant, a thousand goes in old Chinese, uh, uh, a proper and they want to tack the state and capitalism. I in the case of the anarchists and the targets are perfectly obvious in the case of uh, uh, of contemporary terrorists as well.

Speaker 1:          47:27          Sif dynamite like bombs are seen as leveling the playing field. You attack, you can prove that you are strong. When in reality you are our weak. They demonstrate the powerful states are vulnerable even to small groups of determine, uh, determined, uh, uh, anarchists. Next also these groups, as I said, their tendency is always to try to find one person running the whole show. It's absolutely not the case in the case of the anarchist, as I already said, nor is it the case now, uh, as well. So the French government then and officials now have a tendency to look for centrally organized, massive conspiracy and salvage, acknowledging this role of small groups or even isolated individuals undertaking locally organized or freelance, uh, uh, operations and our kids to repeat always emphasize the full autonomy of the individual. Indeed the potential and murderous individual as the case, as I've said, and you know, I obviously, uh, uh, to test everything that the medial Henri, uh, stood for, but I've tried to understand his, his, um, uh, hatred yet.

Speaker 1:          48:34          There's one more other, there's one more thing that could be added to, is that when you think of the word terrorism, the word terrorism was originally applied to actions taken by the state to terrorize. The terror was terrorizing opponents in the French revolution. And it's often forgotten that the vast majority of victims of terror are victims of state terrorism. And the anarchist hated the state because they'd seen up close what state terrorism did in the wake of the Commun. And the beating up of the police, uh, clichy, uh, the massacre of the innocence of these women, young women gunned down, uh, during the strike in the north or man demonstration in the north in 1891, uh, must be remembered, uh, during the 1890s, anarchists attacks, which were terrible, killed a maximum of 60 people. Tragic wounding more than, than 200. But if you look at non, if you look at state terrorism, uh, the ratio of somebody has figured out stands at approximately 262, one, 260 victims of state terrorism as opposed to one victim of this horrible thing.

Speaker 1:          49:46          Terrorism has become part of the political process, what has been called a adults macabre or sort of macabre dance, uh, uh, between states and their fiercest opponents. The two interact dynamically and need each other. The hatred of dissidents is only foot further stoke by the overreaction of authorities. Uh, it's simply, uh, uh, encourages attacks. And certainly this is not, of course I'm political science, but there are over. But the reaction of the United States government and other governments, uh, to, uh, the, the horrible, horrible tax and September 11th are a pretty good example of that. When, uh, when states take tactics, swell the hatred of their opponents by, uh, by abusing prisoners, by torturing prisoners and by that sort of thing. Uh, that line between that goes all the way back to two Spain of the 1890, the first decade of the 20th century, back to the Paris commune before that. And, uh, unfortunately to are very day. That is a story of [inaudible] see you on Wednesday.
