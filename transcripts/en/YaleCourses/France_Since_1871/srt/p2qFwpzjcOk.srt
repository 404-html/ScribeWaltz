1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,411
Wrap it up.

2
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:03,410
I want to talk about a couple of things
at the beginning and then one time it,

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,560
the suburbs at the end with, cause that's
going to be a big problem, you know, uh,

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,940
in the future. And I guess a
couple of things in the beginning,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,010
uh, in somewhat of a particular
order I suppose is this,
that, you know, you Kinda,

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,890
I kinda torn between, uh, between, uh,

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,100
you know,
and taking about Paris,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,990
one of the old alliances that you had
and the rebuilding of, of uh, you know,

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,010
I've tried to protect Paris from,

10
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:37,380
from the Pompey dues and the planners
and the horror of the tour Montparnasse

11
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,250
that you had this sort of classic
alliance between people on kind of the far

12
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,430
left like me and then kind
of traditional conservatives,

13
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,580
like a great French historian called
Louis Shu lea the story and in Paris.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And then, um, so I guess I
kind of feel like that in, in,

15
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,480
in trying to think about ways that,
you know, how important is that France,

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,620
France remain France and,
and uh,

17
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,750
I mentioned this once in passing
was talking about education,

18
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:04,270
but we got involved in our fields and
trying to save our one room school house,

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,180
uh,
because if we lose our school,

20
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:10,170
then we just start another beautiful
place full of a mob by German and Belgian

21
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,260
and northern French tourists,
uh,

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,400
in the summer Dutch
also. And um, you know,

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,490
if things change and,
and uh, regional, uh,

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,540
a one room school houses
disappear because I mean,

25
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:28,800
people say that that's progress and,
and, and uh, lots about rural France,

26
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:32,040
a lot of villages that do survive
survive because they're, they're,

27
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:35,040
what you call it, biological 12th
or there they're sort of a bedroom,

28
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,970
a villages for people who work in
towns nearby. But lots of France,

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,420
lots of rural France really only
exists now because of tourism.

30
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:46,320
And that doesn't make, make
it a in itself. I mean,

31
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,660
it's important that people
survive in some way,

32
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:53,280
but that doesn't provide these places
for the kinds of a kind of vitality and,

33
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:58,150
and, uh, uh, you know, high ironic would
be is if it's, if the guid me lab, the,

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:58,890
uh,

35
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,890
the green guides for every
region [inaudible] if those
are one of the sole ways

36
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,060
in the long run along with cuisine,

37
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,140
traditions of cuisine that did help
regions maintain their identity,

38
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,600
that would be very sad. Indeed
they're going to do. Um,

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,930
I have great ambivalence about the
European Union and about the European

40
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:20,400
constitution and of course most of
my friends to vote against it. Uh,

41
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,690
and some of my friends in Leone
and in Paris voted for it. Uh,

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,290
but most of the people I know,
almost all of them,

43
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,710
whether they were provincial academics
or whether they're very ordinary people

44
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,580
producing cheese or getting buy in every
way, they can, uh, voted against it.

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,620
And one of the things that they're
going to do now, which is a,

46
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,330
it doesn't mean anything to most people,

47
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:40,590
but it still reflects the kinds of
changes that Europe is apt to bring that

48
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,550
Europe in quotes,

49
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,580
it's apt to bring to French regions is
that they're going to get rid of the

50
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,610
license plates. Um, which
seems like a silly thing,

51
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,320
but one of the things that I
always do when I'm driving,

52
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,180
which I drive constantly, uh,
in France as you see, you know,

53
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,560
I see cars go by and see a 23, you
think, oh, the clothes, that's the,

54
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,640
that's a really rare bird is the least
populated department after the air and

55
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,121
France.

56
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:05,600
And you kind of imagine this person with
a 23 is going up to see his or her age

57
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,470
at grandmother and the Moselle 57.

58
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:13,000
And you do the sort of games of where
people come from and what and what.

59
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,280
And I mean that's interesting
and it's important,

60
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,560
but they're going to get rid of the
license plates and then all the license

61
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,060
plates will be just very much the same.

62
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,120
And they'll look like English license
plates or, or they'll look like, um,

63
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,770
my German license plates.

64
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,680
I don't know if they're going to get rid
of those two or the K for corn or the

65
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,960
beef for Berlin and all of this business.

66
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,380
And it's just one of the sort of threats
to the way things are that, that, that,

67
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,840
that the European Union has brought.

68
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,560
And there a lot of people at Yale and
including some of my friends were a big of

69
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:41,440
union European Union people. But you
know, we have friends who scraped by,

70
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:46,290
they produce goat's cheese and
they, uh, uh, they, um, uh,

71
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,830
our toll now that they must conform
to European Union rules, which are,

72
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,610
which are barked out in Brussels
with full of these empty apartment.

73
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,010
I mean an empty office buildings that
were overbuilt or barked out from

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,900
[inaudible], which is another
important capital, the European Union.

75
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,460
And it tells them that they, uh, that
they, uh, have to produce, uh, uh,

76
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,660
produce a cheese in a very
different way. And, um, you know,

77
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:15,250
I'm part of old France will disappear. But
in a way, I mean it, you know, it's sad.

78
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,500
I don't want every part of France to
be like every other part of France.

79
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,470
And we had to really struggle to, to, to,

80
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,610
to arrive in a world and where you have
actually TV announcer speaking with an

81
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,640
accent that's not a Parisian or, or a
valley of the lar accent, you know, and,

82
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,520
and that's very good. I'll tell
you a funny little story, um, that,

83
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,290
that has to do with this.
In some ways.

84
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:39,760
We have these friends who've been together
for about, uh, uh, Oh, maybe 25 years.

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,050
And like a lot of our friends and France,

86
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,270
they don't have any money and
they didn't ever get married.

87
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,090
And we have a lot of a union league. What,
I mean, they're just together. I mean,

88
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,580
there are a couple or as much as a
couple. It is, my wife and I are,

89
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,690
we've been married for 27 years.
Um, and uh, they're a one,

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,680
they have two signs and their oldest son
is my, my son's best friend. Uh, and, um,

91
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,780
they make goat's cheese. That's
what they do. And one day,

92
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,050
one summer we got this invitation
to their wedding. You know,

93
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,300
they'd been together for 20
years and they, you know,

94
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,290
when you were together for 20 years,

95
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,150
you're saying our best years are
behind us and all this stuff,

96
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,940
which isn't necessarily true,
but they were getting married,

97
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:13,450
there was sending out invitations and
the people that don't like them said, oh,

98
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,410
they're sending out invitations,

99
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,840
they're getting married because
they want to have a presence.

100
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,800
They want people to give them a presence,
you know,

101
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,830
which just went away and it's simply
not true. And then people who, you know,

102
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,450
like them and, and who felt, well, you
know, this is, uh, uh, you know, they're,

103
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:31,510
they're getting married because their
parents are both religious sets of parents

104
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,770
were fairly religious.
One Dutch, the other, uh,

105
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,990
Dutch Belgian and the other French from
the north of France. And so they're,

106
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,660
they're making it right in terms of the
church. And people said, wait a minute,

107
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:43,640
you know, is that really
the case? And so, uh, yeah,

108
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,960
the wedding and the wedding
was when early September.

109
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:48,790
And we couldn't go because I
was back here doing this and,

110
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,050
and happy to be here doing this.
Uh,

111
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,940
but we missed the wedding and then we
finally found out why they got married.

112
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:58,440
Probably it had something to do with
Brussels and straws war because the,

113
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,180
somebody went over to the
cantorial, uh, capitol.

114
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,320
I mean this is cap place called battle.
Uh,

115
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,000
and there was a big sign
that said that there,

116
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,170
those people who want to continue in
the new Europe to produce schools,

117
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,000
produce goat's cheese.

118
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,970
We'll have to conform to European
norms about how to do that. And,

119
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,110
and there'll be a course
that's offered, uh, by the, uh,

120
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,220
by the European Union and that we'll see.

121
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,830
This is about two thousands
before the shift of the whole,

122
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,170
maybe more about that in a minute.
And the course will cost 2000 francs,

123
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,420
which is a huge amount of
money for these people,

124
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,610
but will be free for
the wives, uh, of, uh,

125
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,660
for the wives of a, of
farmers. So they got married,

126
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:42,020
they were kind of forced to get married
because it would be cheaper for them to

127
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:44,360
do that. Now, that's
kind of a silly example,

128
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:46,940
but it's still the risk of Europe is that,

129
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,480
that people who want to live their own
lives or somehow or produce goat cheese

130
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:54,200
their own way and it produced
very good goat's cheese. Um,

131
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,950
so I always bring back and huge
bundles, double, triple wrapped here,

132
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,670
won't be allowed to do that anymore. And,
and France voted against the election,

133
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,580
I mean, against the constitution. And it
happened in the, in the Netherlands too.

134
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,780
And everybody in France,

135
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:08,510
and this plugs into what I'm gonna say
it and talk about in a minute. You know,

136
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,390
there's this fear of the Polish plumber,
you know, that, that's the example.

137
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:14,780
They use that because all
of these immigrants from
eastern Europe will come and,

138
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,020
and that the European Union's gonna have
to pay all the money to make Polish Sha

139
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,730
agricultural. I'll be in
Poland in two days, actually,
a back yet again, uh, make, uh,

140
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:25,850
you know, Polish agriculture, competitive
and will cost everybody a lot of money.

141
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:30,230
And that the Polish plumber will put
French plumbers out of work. And so this,

142
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:34,760
this fits into, you know, both fears
that people have, all sorts of people,

143
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,580
not just right wing anti-immigrant
people whom I'll talk about in a minute,

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,270
I can assure you. Uh, but also just
people that are afraid that, that, that,

145
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,410
you know,
they're met ta,

146
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,620
that there possibilities of their children
finding work in a country in which

147
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,370
work is very hard to find in which there's
no light at the end of the tunnel for

148
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:53,720
a very, very many young people, uh,
that all of this is, is going to happen.

149
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,270
And many people, many
ordinary people, not in Paris,

150
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:59,480
if you're working with the George Bush
dollar and try to afford a single, uh,

151
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,030
a cafe in Paris. Uh, but if for
very many ordinary people, the, the,

152
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:08,810
the year whole, that is the currency
that became, uh, January 1st year,

153
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:13,490
2002, I actually wrote something about
the transition of to that currency, um,

154
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,390
that, that this was the, this,
this currency, uh, to most people.

155
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:22,040
Seems like what you say in French is, and
I'll knock, it's a sting. Uh, it, it is,

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,400
all it's done is pushed up prices
and the government can try it out.

157
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,150
All the information they want to try to
show there hasn't been massive inflation

158
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,530
inflation due to the euro.

159
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,190
And that's simply false because things
that people buy in the, in their lives,

160
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,950
I don't mean rich people, but
I mean ordinary people, uh,

161
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,000
by have been become extraordinarily
high and expensive because of,

162
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,920
because of the whole, uh, and um, on the
other hand, my own personal thing is that,

163
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:50,360
look, I view the European
Union as, and this is, you
don't have to believe this. Uh,

164
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,620
uh, you can probably guess that
I would have this view. Uh,

165
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,460
I believe that a social
Europe might be kind of out,

166
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,830
could counterbalance the kind
of, of just runaway, you know,

167
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:06,620
bandit capitalism of the worst
excesses of capitalism. Uh,

168
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,870
and that, that, you know,
in America we live in,

169
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,820
I live in a country and we're civil
rights civic and civil rights are saluted.

170
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,810
But which human rights are,

171
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,070
there is no human rights are no
human rights in coded, uh, uh,

172
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,580
in the United States. Thus
Guantanamo Bay egg, thus a, you know,

173
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,860
exceptional rendering to torture
camps here and there. Uh,

174
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,530
because there isn't an assumption
that human rights counters that,

175
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,570
that civil rights is what counts
and the way you get civil rights,

176
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,450
it's becoming an American citizen
or permanent residents dust.

177
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,360
The big debate on which I'm not going
again too about immigration in this

178
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,940
country, which is a
very, very, a big debate.

179
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,270
But I always sort of viewed that
Europe would, well, you know,

180
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:46,550
if maybe he's a British would, would, um,

181
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,880
they didn't want to come along and they
don't want to get rid of the pound and

182
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,840
ended up all of this business.

183
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,160
But there's somehow the social Europe
with the basis of Germany and France,

184
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:59,700
whether it was parties, have the right or
part or senator or parties of the left,

185
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,340
would, you know, be this kind of block
that that would, would, would, uh,

186
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,600
would do what, what your, what the gall,

187
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:10,740
ironically here my singing the praises of
the goal of all people, uh, me, uh, uh,

188
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,740
you know, had, had, had that Europe could,

189
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,380
could have the role of Sir Francis
sort of this, there's honest broker in,

190
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:20,520
in a world now without that,
not to po big powers, but, uh,

191
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,590
but only one sort of
throwing its weight around.

192
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,220
And I don't even know what I think
anymore about that because, um, you know,

193
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:29,300
there are some advantages to Europe.
It's if you live in straws, boom.

194
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,090
If you live in Leone, you live in Paris,
well, you know, it helps the economy.

195
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,540
But if you live in the [inaudible] hall
or you living in a dash Dasho it doesn't

196
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,330
do a damn thing. It hasn't brought
anything at all to anyone. Uh,

197
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,080
as far as anyone can,
anyone can tell. Um, but,

198
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,200
and one of the things that
may go in the next years,

199
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,920
especially if Sarcozi gets his way and
one of the things that's dear to me

200
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,670
anyway, but I realized that there are
excesses is the providential state,

201
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,230
the idea of the welfare state,

202
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:55,200
which we read about and saw our
wines book and you all know exists.

203
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,880
And I've said this before
and I'll say it again.

204
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,690
If you don't have any
money and you're sick, uh,

205
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,480
you're a hell of a lot
better off if you know,

206
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:05,010
going to any doctor and you can pay 20
year old or 22 year old now, which is,

207
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:08,850
you know, every day more and more
in dollars, but a say now about $35.

208
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,410
If you get stuck and you
don't understand ratios,

209
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,840
they will keep you going and they will
help you if you're very rapport. But it,

210
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,150
there's a big sign that saying ratios
that said that the minimum charges $300 or

211
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,150
$400, I can't remember what
the big sign is. Um, now, um,

212
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,630
the health plan is terribly expensive and
there are all sorts of abuses. I mean,

213
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,620
there are people who,
for example,

214
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:28,710
have to go from where we live to Leon
to get treatment for this and that

215
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:32,220
sometimes very serious
illnesses and ambulance takes
them and the ambulance will

216
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:35,610
cost maybe a thousand dollars cost. The
health system was not thousand dollars.

217
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,870
Well, there are people around
the can drive them, uh,

218
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,600
and that kind of kind of situation.

219
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,840
And there are the unemployment
benefits are lavish to say the least.

220
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:43,640
There are people that,

221
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,130
that we know that our professional shomer
professionally unemployed that don't

222
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:50,080
do a damn thing and they don't want
to work and they never work. And,

223
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:53,480
and you know, it's probably is, uh,
you know, unfair but, but you know,

224
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:56,710
it's human beings, human rights. That's
something that they pay attention to.

225
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,350
They ought to have the right to a minimum.
And in France,

226
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,100
you called them or Amy's, they get a
really minimal little amount of money and,

227
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,800
uh, now they're strikes,
you know, they're,

228
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,650
the railroad workers go on
strike because they, they,

229
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,130
they want Dwight Dwight Dwight
[inaudible] that they acquired rights.

230
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,870
They ought to be able to,
I said this other day,

231
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,990
if you're driving a high speed Tj, fast
train, big pressure, you know, they,

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,640
they almost never crash hardly ever.
Uh,

233
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,870
but big pressure and that they think they
should have the right to retire at 55

234
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,680
or 50. Now this seems like it's a bit
of exaggeration to us in this country.

235
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:33,970
We don't even have a retirement age.
Um, and we don't have one at all.

236
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:37,380
It doesn't exist. Uh, so there were
abuses in all of this, but, but the,

237
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:41,890
the kind of total Americanization of,
of French social services would be,

238
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,170
in my view, a disaster. You
don't have to share that,

239
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,500
but that means there are abuses,

240
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,400
but you don't just have to
dismantle the whole thing. Uh, and,

241
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:52,480
and sort of turn it into an Americanized
version of this and that people are

242
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,260
always trying to measure happiness.
I have a student who wrote former student,

243
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,113
a great guy,

244
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,200
a ta this class now he's at Florida
state and wrote a book called happiness,

245
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,140
a history that did rather well.
It was on NPR and all this stuff.

246
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,660
And people are always trying to measure
how happy you are. And when they,

247
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,060
when they ask people in
France what makes them happy,

248
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,740
it's the right to have a vacation,
you know,

249
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,260
and you've got a lot of rich people in
this country who are very unhappy even

250
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:11,491
though they're,

251
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,890
they're loaded because they don't take
the time to have vacation and all this

252
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:17,980
and we can, you know, we can debate
the, we could go on and on about,

253
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,910
I could lapse into,

254
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:22,900
in the nostalgia for the next 10 hours
about the favorite meals I've had through

255
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:26,350
the, through the long hours into the early
morning with, with friends of ours and,

256
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:30,460
and, and how, you know, family
things together count and
your friends and all that.

257
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:35,410
But, but in France, you know, France
remains a, in many ways a happy place.

258
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:35,981
And in that,

259
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,160
because some of the anxiety is idea
of life has taken away by the state.

260
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,070
And I don't necessarily, I don't
think that's necessarily a bad thing.

261
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,300
What's going to happen though too,
to young people. Of course, you know,

262
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm going to talk about
suburbs in a minute, but that's
part of it. It's not just,

263
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,740
it's not just, uh, an ethnic question.
It's not just a spatial question.

264
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:57,520
It's not just the unwanted people by
the center relegated to the margins of

265
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:01,300
urban life. Uh, it is also question
of what happens to young people,

266
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:05,860
not only young, a young, uh, uh, west
Africans are young, north Africans, uh,

267
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,840
or young people from the Caribbean, but,
but also young whites too because, uh, uh,

268
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:13,540
the unemployment rate,
uh, is, is always been,

269
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,560
it's considered a great success to have
the unemployment rate anywhere near 10%,

270
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,110
where sometimes as a 12, 13, and 14%.

271
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,310
And for all the faults of
this American system, uh,

272
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,120
we have where people don't declare their
unemployment often because they get

273
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:29,470
discouraged, but we have a much less,
uh, employment rate, uh, and, uh,

274
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,520
the chances of, of young people,
and not everybody goes to Yale, uh,

275
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:36,610
not everybody goes to Harvard or Princeton
or Wisconsin or Michigan or Oberlin

276
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:40,300
or, or Grinnell. You know, for a lot
of people that, you know, I mean,

277
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,090
they don't have those kinds
of options that you have. Um,

278
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,440
in France it's a much more
serious condition and there's
situation and people we

279
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,510
know that are very well educated,

280
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:51,980
they have no future and people we know
that they have no education, uh, you know,

281
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:56,120
are just scraping by to, and it's, uh,
uh, you know, the French economy remains,

282
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,880
it means a problem and maybe
Europe is in the long run,

283
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:03,540
it's going to help catapult a ordinary
people and not just a big capitalists,

284
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,560
big business people toward, toward a
better life. You know, I don't know. Uh,

285
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,890
but again, as I said, I encourage
my friends to vote against it.

286
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,680
We're not yet citizens, so
we, we, we couldn't vote. Uh,

287
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,020
we can't even vote in municipal
elections even though we've been legally

288
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,060
resident in France for,
for 20 years.

289
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,700
Meacham Hall and put forward that we
should be able to vote, not just us,

290
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:23,000
but everybody who illegal
residents because we have
an interest in what happens

291
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,600
in municipal life. Uh, but the high
court overthrew, overturned it,

292
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,480
but that's neither here nor there.
Now what about them?

293
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,150
What about but the riots and they
started up again the other day.

294
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:35,380
It would just very briefly when
these two kids were killed,

295
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,400
a young people that were our
kids, but yeah, they were young.

296
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:42,260
They were 15 and 16 when they
were, uh, killed, um, through
their own fault. Alas, uh,

297
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,420
uh, when they ran into a police car.
Uh, uh, but that, that was, these,

298
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,820
there were troubled in Toulouse,
but not very much trouble. Uh,

299
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:54,600
and that the trouble in this place called
Vva Lubell, uh, and in fairly soon, um,

300
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,790
in October and November,

301
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,980
I'm even two years ago and use
user were seniors are yours.

302
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,640
You were juniors ever will maybe remember
this and you could remember it if you

303
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,770
were in high school too.
Uh,

304
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,770
there were riots to began in the northern
suburbs of Paris and those who've been

305
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:10,460
to front Sloan into France
and flowing into Wasi. Uh,

306
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,190
when you landed at the airport,
Charles de Gaulle,

307
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:16,890
which they still insist on calling
Wasi, uh, you, um, you know, your,

308
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:21,410
your next thought is that w you know
what you'll do the first day in Paris,

309
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,120
whether it's seeing old friends again,

310
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,830
or where are you going to eat
or what you're going to visit.

311
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Well around Wasi are not only he's
drawn see the transit camp where so many

312
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:33,980
people were in World War II were,
uh,

313
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,630
had to stay before they were set off
to the death camps to die. But they're,

314
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,270
they're the grim suburbs. And I, and
I, as I told you before, I explain why,

315
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,360
why French suburbs and other
European suburbs are very different.

316
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,020
They're just the opposite
of American suburbs.

317
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,520
They're largely the domain of people
unwanted by the center, by the center.

318
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:57,090
And this has been a, been a
tradition in France and other places.

319
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,550
There's a sense, uh, since the
ceased to become agricultural, uh,

320
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,250
truck farming communities
and became, uh, uh,

321
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,400
places where there were factories and
where there was a transient population and

322
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,670
it's been like that.
It was the worst trouble.

323
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:14,260
It's worst rioting in France
since 1968. Uh, we're a, um,

324
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,450
a year that we've already
talked about. Uh, again, the,

325
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:21,770
the precipitating event was a death of
two adult to adolescents who are 15 and

326
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,700
17. On October 27th, 2005.
This is only two years ago.

327
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,180
They had fled along with another person
who was very seriously wounded and was

328
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,530
taken care of by ironically, by the,
uh, coincidentally by the mother,

329
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,400
the mother of our, of our French Godson
at the Ob. Tell her while she knew a,

330
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,730
they were a bleed, they're being chased
by the cops in clichy suit. What?

331
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,810
P and C, l I. C h, a Su like underneath.

332
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:46,070
And then the block the woods.

333
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,670
They're know Wa left there underneath
housing projects because that's,

334
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,620
these were built in the
sixties and seventies.

335
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,060
Ain't no woods in Clichy Su walk.
Um,

336
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,690
and it populated population 28,300 people.

337
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,060
The sixth poorest commune in France,

338
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,710
70% of the population I live in
these housing projects in French,

339
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,400
the word is CT, c, I, t. E with an accent.

340
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,760
Now the first he tay were [inaudible].

341
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,700
They were created by a established
by Napoleon, the third in Paris.

342
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:21,250
Just a couple of you liked
the clip ribbons and that
was the end of it. Um, uh,

343
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:26,040
70% live who live in these projects,
which are just awful.

344
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,880
Um, are Muslims, like
the two boys who died,

345
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:34,680
they'd tried to hide in an electric
transformer and were grilled,

346
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,340
basically electrocuted. And the other
of the boy who survived had, um,

347
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,500
had burns over, you know, almost entirety
of his body. He's still alive. He lived.

348
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,660
Um, and so the incident and the events
that followed have to be seen in the

349
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:53,250
resentment that I've talked about
before and resistance of young people,

350
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:56,910
but in particularly minority
young people to the police,

351
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,480
to the crs and also to the
municipal police, uh, in, um,

352
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,010
the grub grim suburbs of Paris,

353
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:09,840
but also venture outside of a Lior
among others and outside of, of, uh,

354
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,800
of a Mousay, you know, where's he don
and the great, the great soccer player.

355
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,450
And as I said the other day,
the most,

356
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:19,710
still the most a respected person
admired person in France and Z.

357
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,810
Don grew up in such a project,
uh, and unlike Recia via,

358
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,000
he didn't have his picture taken,

359
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,580
the backed with his back in a
fancy suit to the project. He, uh,

360
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,760
he was proud of where he grew up and it
was part of his life. And he's, he's,

361
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,700
he's very good. Or if you follow French
soccer, there's no reason why he should.

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,200
But [inaudible] who's a great defense
player, who's an older guy now,

363
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,020
and he took it on Sarcozi after
this and start closing. You say,

364
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,440
what do you millionaire know
about the projects? And a,

365
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:47,730
and he took him on and he said,

366
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:51,300
you calling these people scum because
of who they are and because they live

367
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,760
there, and he says, I know the projects.

368
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,550
You don't know the projects and Sarcozi
doesn't go to the projects. Uh, cause he,

369
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:00,210
you know, anyway, that won't get off
on that. But we might, who knows. Um,

370
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,500
so in two months,

371
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:05,970
more than 9,000 cars were set ablaze
and 3000 people were arrested.

372
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,140
Most of those writing, uh,
writing where young, uh,

373
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,040
young minority males of
North African particularly,

374
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:18,930
but also west African, uh, uh,
my, uh, extraction along with,

375
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,650
uh, people from, you know,

376
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,210
Guadeloupe and Martinique and all sorts
of other places too. Uh, and as I,

377
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:26,070
as I argue the other day, I
mean, these are people who,

378
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,100
because they don't know Algeria, they
don't know Tunisia, they don't know Molly,

379
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,660
uh, they don't know synagogue. Uh,
they feel like they belong nowhere,

380
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,030
uh, because they don't share
the culture of their parents. I,

381
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:43,031
and they share with their
friends a culture of exclusion
that can also serve as

382
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:48,760
a way of, you know, of solidarity
a that the can also, uh,

383
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,040
in their language as I described
the other day. And, and,

384
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,570
and in these unfortunate advance a
show that they can stick together,

385
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,590
they can hang together to,
um,

386
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,220
and the trouble spread to the suburbs
of Leon to lead to sanity and the straws

387
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:07,221
booth and other places where you
can anticipate such reactions,

388
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:11,950
but also amazing enough to places like,
Aha, you know, and the lot, or in believe,

389
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:16,300
which isn't too far away. And just
all sorts of places or the hall, uh,

390
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,240
where you wouldn't think there'd be
anything in trouble, maybe described as,

391
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,320
you know,
lighting a poo,

392
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,830
bell of garbage can of blaze and throwing
it through a storefront or something

393
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,870
like that. That's not
a good thing to do. Uh,

394
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,070
but they spread to all sorts of places.
There was also an incident in Belgium, uh,

395
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:34,720
and which has a huge population from
x, Zaire, from, from, from Congo, uh,

396
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:39,490
and, uh, in Germany as well.
And most, most immigrants
in, in Germany, the majority,

397
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,241
not most,

398
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:44,380
but the majority of people who are there
are either from Turkey or now from,

399
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,480
from ex Yugoslavia, uh, and,

400
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,200
and Albania and the forms of resistance.

401
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:55,201
We're not themselves new hurling
Molotov cocktails and burning cars.

402
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:59,470
I mean, they say happened in, in straws
were for years. And it happens in Detroit.

403
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,480
Uh, you know, I said this the other day,

404
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,520
there had been riots and a much
more smaller scale in 1983, uh, uh,

405
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:10,210
and in 2000 and the town to mobile.
Yeah. Which is fairly near business.

406
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:12,720
So in the east, the
name doesn't matter. Um,

407
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,890
but there was violence,
more violence than before,

408
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,880
and it was directed, uh,
particularly against the police.

409
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,910
And the difference between those
incidents and the incidents now that have

410
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,300
occurred, uh, last week is
that people were using guns.

411
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,750
There isn't pistols and they're shooting
at the police and that takes it to a

412
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,720
different level. That didn't
happen. Uh, uh, two years ago,

413
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:38,590
and that's not a good sign.
Surprisingly, there was only a one desk,

414
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,330
a man who was beaten to death.
We'll trying to put out a fire, uh,

415
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:46,960
in a, in a place called staff,
which is a suburb of Paris.

416
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,980
And there were a few injuries. That's
all. Not very many for such big trouble,

417
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,880
lots of burned out cars, lots of anger.
The army was never called in. Um,

418
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,980
damage was, was surprisingly limited. Uh,

419
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:04,180
it was limited basically to cars, uh,
and a few shops and things like that.

420
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:07,330
There wasn't a to lose somebody
set the library and fire.

421
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:09,740
And this is what happened
in key. She, uh, in, um,

422
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,570
[inaudible] bell last
week as well. Uh, but, um,

423
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,390
there were occasional attacks on,
on churches.

424
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,440
I'd synagogues because there has
been a rise of antisemitism, uh, uh,

425
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,250
particularly in Muslim
communities. Uh, in France, it, I,

426
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:31,690
in contemporary France, there was an
attack on the Leon subway that may tool,

427
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,430
uh, and even against a stupidly a,
also against sporting facilities.

428
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:39,670
And France are not a lot of places
for young people to do sports.

429
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:43,150
And they've done been better
about that. Uh, you know, I mean,

430
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:46,610
sports are not exactly part of the program
and lycees and they run around the,

431
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,361
the,
you know,

432
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:50,750
the run around in the gym twice and
they're all the hacking and coughing and

433
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,830
grasping for their gold was, uh, but
you know, they've been doing better now.

434
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:57,890
And one of the reasons that said that
France does so well in soccer is because,

435
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,990
you know, they're, they, they take
particularly young minority, uh, uh,

436
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,690
youth who are very good,
good soccer players and they
get good training. And, and,

437
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:07,180
and that's why, you know, when fruit,

438
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,300
when we won the World Cup in 1998
and Joan Marie Le Pen said, ah,

439
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:14,570
the new leader of the National Front, he
said, he said it wasn't a French team.

440
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,780
That one. Why? Because
when you count it up,

441
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:19,490
there was Dominique because there's
no reason you should know this,

442
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:24,230
but there was picky. Uh, there was
a blog dorm, blah, who's from last.

443
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,740
Uh, there was, uh, uh, quite, uh,

444
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,580
quite slip in many ways,
uh, uh, about Tez, uh,

445
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,620
the goalie.
And did I forget somebody,

446
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:38,810
there was a guy who never
kept missing all the time. Um,

447
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,880
it was the name of what tall.
I can't remember who,

448
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,650
but the great players were two
homme is he don this psyche? Uh,

449
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,130
you know, the, the, these were the really
great ones. And so the Penn said, well,

450
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:52,910
that's not really France because
they may have French nationality,

451
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,410
but he doesn't count them as French. Uh,
because his, his racist view of the world,

452
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,810
which doesn't differ that much
from that event out off Hitler,

453
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,290
when push comes to shove,
they don't count. But happily,

454
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,550
most people in France
celebrated, uh, joyously, uh,

455
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,250
because they certainly
are French. Um, and,

456
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:15,020
and the damage was far less
than, for example, in La,
during the Rodney King, uh,

457
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,610
uh, riots in, in, in 1992 after the,

458
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:22,370
the police who beat up this guy
on camera, uh, beat up this,

459
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,800
this minority guy from
downtown La. You know, it's,

460
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,060
the La suburbs are not where the
d underprivileged people live.

461
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,530
They do not live in, in, uh, you know, uh,

462
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,460
the valley in the valley and all
that and all that kind of stuff. Um,

463
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,250
and when there were attacks on buildings,
they were attacks at night,

464
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:42,580
so nobody would be in, in the buildings
and the destruction of empty cars. Well,

465
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:46,940
so we'll stupid, you know, does
not, did not kill people. Now again,

466
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:50,900
I don't mean to sound like I'm defending
violence, but, uh, um, not a single,

467
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:53,090
despite the generalized hatred of the,
of the police,

468
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:56,340
not a single policeman was killed
or even seriously wounded. Uh,

469
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,670
though there were a few live round fire,

470
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,810
there were more policemen hurt the
other night, you know, were shot, uh,

471
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,860
hit by bullets. Then by then
happened, uh, uh, two years ago.

472
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,310
Um, so, um,

473
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,020
the government strategy of
criminalizing petty misdeeds,

474
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,080
I mean that seems to have worked in New
York. I guess that's what, you know,

475
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,890
Giuliani is going to stay over and
over again. Uh, the zero tolerance,

476
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,080
I mean the resting of people
who are hopping the metro,

477
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,280
getting on the Metro for
free and all of this, uh,

478
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,690
they tried that in France and that
may have increased the resistance,

479
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,580
the hatred of the police because
sometimes you, you know, you,

480
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,360
you see people get picked up when they're
trying to get through the metro and

481
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,670
you'll, you'll see police from there
and get on for free cause they don't,

482
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,470
they don't have any money. And,
uh, you know, when I let you know,

483
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,580
I let people through behind me if
they don't have any money and if they,

484
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,690
they look like they have money, then
I knock home about 20 feet back. Uh,

485
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,700
when I'm going through by stopping
or knock on backwards. We very nice.

486
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,310
But I believe in public
transportation. Uh, anyway,

487
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,900
but the SRAP government had eliminated
funds not only for voluntary associations,

488
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,470
uh,

489
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,420
but for the kind of beat policing that
has worked in many areas in it, you know,

490
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,570
and sometimes in this country that in
tough neighborhoods where they've been a

491
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:10,530
lot of problems by having the policeman
become part of the community and

492
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:12,780
therefore not just seem
like a foreign presence,

493
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,910
but that's not the case in [inaudible].
And that's not the case in Boban knee.

494
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,510
That's not the place in Qube
of y and places like that.
Or in Venice who outside,

495
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:25,320
uh, of lean all there. When the police
are there, they're not the same guys.

496
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,680
And when they're there, they're
the ones saying, you know,
your papers, your papers,

497
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:31,890
your papers, or they don't go at all
and they don't protect the other people.

498
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,620
I mean, most of the crime that
occurs there is that, you know,

499
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:38,700
are minorities against minorities because
of the sheer numbers and the police.

500
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,310
One of the complaints there is the
police aren't there to help anybody.

501
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,380
And when they do,
they come in huge numbers.

502
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:46,320
It's up against the wall
baby and that kind of stuff.

503
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,990
So the rise took on a political
dimension. And here I get again, I'm, I'm,

504
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:53,730
I'm saying I, I'm not trying to give
a political interpretation into this.

505
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:57,590
This is a fact. I mean, this is what
happened. Um, and Nick and equalizer,

506
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,330
I z the minister of Interior,
um,

507
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,440
he manipulated the situation.
He referred to the writers,

508
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:09,420
this riff Raff or even scum Rokaya a
word that I've used before, how Chi scum,

509
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,170
which can, you know, I can also be
tough guy, but, but it means scum more.

510
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:13,621
And he said,
well,

511
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:17,190
we knew need to do is get these big hoses
that they use this as brand that you

512
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:20,580
clean out gutters specifically
for cleaning out gutters.

513
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,350
We have to get these hoses and get rid
of them, get them out of the gutters.

514
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:28,440
So who's down? You know, these are
people who are non whites, who are poor,

515
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,670
who live in the suburbs, who are
condemned, where marginalized. Uh, uh,

516
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,570
the words suburb even lost is
neutral sense in the French language.

517
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,550
Long ago at the end of the 19th century.

518
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,850
I did a book on this a long time ago
and I just don't that word but on,

519
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,070
on some of this stuff. Um, and so, uh,

520
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,300
that he said that suburb should be
disinfected to get rid of this gum.

521
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,590
And I'm not being too over the top to
say that, uh, you know that you, you it,

522
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:55,740
his few years scum, this is
son of immigrants. By the way,

523
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,860
when you're an immigrant,

524
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,660
you're scum because you exist because
you're there because you're not rich.

525
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,680
And when he got elected that
he gets his big vacation.

526
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:06,510
And in Multa spending as much money
as humanly possible to say, well,

527
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:11,270
if you work hard like me, fall,
say they won't say, phone says you,

528
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:13,770
you will become rich to,
well, it ain't that easy.

529
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,900
It seemed like a blatant attempt
to win the supporters who,

530
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:21,901
who exported the violent extreme right
of a John Marie Le Pen and after election

531
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:25,500
law, Penn said all these
things, what we've said,

532
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,850
he said it to be sure in
a more tactful way. Uh,

533
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,500
he does not believe that the camps were
a minor. The death camps were a minor,

534
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,330
minor detail in the history of World
War II, which is what Lopez said.

535
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,830
He doesn't believe
that. Uh, and he didn't,

536
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,890
he would not give some nodding approval
when some of his thugs drown Moroccans

537
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:48,370
in the, in the, uh, in
the, in the sen, you know,

538
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,260
after Joan of Arc Day March,
Joan of arc, they march, uh,

539
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,340
and sort of say, well, you know, boys
will be boys and this kind of stuff. Um,

540
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,320
but he took the, the rhetoric of
racism and made it respectable.

541
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,040
And then you don't have to agree
with this, but this is my view.

542
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,360
This is what happened. That's
what happened. That's it.

543
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,410
It was a strategy that Charlotte Pasqua
who had been in Ministry of Interior

544
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:15,430
long ago and tried to use and hidden, not
worked, but it worked this time around.

545
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,870
Now again, I don't exaggerate
the problem of, of, uh, you know,

546
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:23,070
there has been increased criminality.
There've been attempts to prove that the,

547
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,880
that the greater increases of
criminality, uh, uh, Eh, you know, uh, uh,

548
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,500
Shay lately, you know, with,

549
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:34,010
with immigrant populations and non
immigrant populations, uh, you know, it,

550
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,730
that's hard to say whether
that's true or not.

551
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,470
We're not talking about
crime waves like you, like,

552
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,370
like lots of murders and things like that.

553
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,550
France still operates on
a very civilized, uh, uh,

554
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,960
a scale in part because they have
very harsh gun laws. Uh, and it's,

555
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:50,440
you can't just sort of a, it'd
be 15 and not old enough to, uh,

556
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:53,350
to vote are old enough to
drink in this country. Uh,

557
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,920
but you're old enough to buy
a machine gun practically, uh,

558
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,020
and that sort of thing. Uh,
to hum a t, t, h, u r m,

559
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,420
whom I mentioned a while
ago, the, the, the, uh,

560
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,210
footballer or denounced the remarks is
contemptuous and humiliating serving to

561
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:12,100
awaken latent racism in France.
And he got that right.

562
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,590
And shock shock is usual, tried to, uh,

563
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,560
more concerned with his bank
accounts in Japan or whatever,

564
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,870
tried to remain above.
And the indictment,

565
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,810
which subsequently has followed
up in his indictment yet,

566
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,570
but all the scandals when
he was mayor of Paris,

567
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,870
he tried to remain above
the fray. Uh, he, uh,

568
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,080
had the declaration of the
state of emergency on November
8th red to journalists

569
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,390
on his behalf instead of
actually reading it himself.

570
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,200
But he seemed to be as he was in the end,
more and more ineffective,

571
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,030
isolated and virtually ignored,

572
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:48,031
rather like his predecessor
Charles de Gaulle in 1968 in 1969,

573
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,410
um, one of the one minister
on the center, right, uh,

574
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,930
said that one of the reasons this is all
happening isn't the suburbs is polygamy.

575
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,210
That was his, his definition for what
happened. Uh, Sarcozi the other day said,

576
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:05,020
this is not a social
crisis in the suburbs.

577
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,420
What, not a social crisis. It's a
crisis. It's an enormous social crisis.

578
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,390
He said that he referred to a voyeur to,
uh,

579
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,250
a thug ocracy a thug autocracy,
and there's no social crisis.

580
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:22,000
The social crisis is that,
that huge percent of the
population living in France,

581
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,880
particularly 5 million Muslims, but not
just 5 million Muslims, more than that,

582
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,290
you're not feel part of France and
are not integrated in France. Uh,

583
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,220
in part because of,
of special considerations where they live,

584
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,140
lack of opportunity also because
of discrimination and lack of,

585
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:42,410
of, of low opportunity. The same
that other people have had. Um,

586
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,320
it's hard to get people to
teach in the stem stem knee.

587
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,860
That is the department of number 93. When
you say catch around class, which means,

588
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:50,670
uh, the sentence underneath, which is,

589
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,780
has many of these places you can't get
teachers to teach there because there is

590
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,710
violence, you know, not big time
violence, but there's, there's,

591
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,280
there's violence and the whites out
there. Of course. Uh, uh, not all of them.

592
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:04,300
And many of them vote, uh, uh, uh,

593
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,530
national front and they voted
for Sarcozi massively. Uh,

594
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:11,390
this was discovered actually about
10 years ago also that in some of the

595
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:14,810
neighborhoods in Paris said Monaca and
then the 18th and 20th thrown these small

596
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,630
bubbles bubble on the 20th that the white
population voted overwhelmingly, uh,

597
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:24,450
in some areas for, uh, for the,
the, the National Front, uh, in,

598
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,730
in part because they,
you know,

599
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:29,420
they were afraid of the fact that they
would be minorities in there are in their

600
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:30,830
own cal ta and all of this.

601
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,100
And you also had this crossover vote
between the old communist party white

602
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:38,340
workers voting for the national
front as well. And you found that in,

603
00:33:38,341 --> 00:33:42,870
in places in the north of France. And
you found that in other places. Um, it,

604
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,990
it's given all this, it's surprising
that the trouble is, didn't come, uh, uh,

605
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,030
before, uh, because, uh, the, the, the,

606
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,160
the immigrants as you know,

607
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:56,600
really were attracted to France in larger
numbers by the booming economy, uh,

608
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:01,400
in the 1960s. And all of this slowed down
at a time that I can remember with the,

609
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,670
uh, the, uh, the oil crisis
of 73 and 74, which is just,

610
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,090
we don't, when I was, and I got to Yale
when that much older than you guys, uh,

611
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,470
that, uh, that was, that, that
stopped it. And suddenly all
the people that, you know,

612
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,600
all the announcements have come to France,

613
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:21,270
we'll find you a job posted
in Tunis and, and, uh, uh,

614
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:24,890
Jay and Matt cash and Fez and
all these places, uh, uh, those,

615
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:27,710
those were taken down.
And, and, uh, and uh,

616
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,380
they're there and the
economic slowdown came,

617
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,880
but there were fewer jobs awaiting goes
people and their descendants and the

618
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:37,880
Muslim population of Francis
now about 5 million people.

619
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,570
One of the interesting things also is
that there was no really way of counting

620
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,960
the number of people of any
ethnic origin in France.

621
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,940
There is none because it's illegal
to ask on a census what is,

622
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,060
what are your ethnic origins?
You can't do that.

623
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,620
So there's no official way
of counting up now that,

624
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,320
that then France can say,
we have no,

625
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,030
we have no ethnic crisis.
But also you can't,

626
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,920
they, they can say that, which isn't true.
Uh, I mean, hello. That's just isn't true.

627
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,640
But also the problem is if
you don't know where all the,

628
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,970
where you have strong ethnic
minorities or even majority's,

629
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,730
then you can't really go out and try
to solve the problem because you're not

630
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:23,480
really sure. Municipals statistics are
much more accurate, but there's no,

631
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:25,580
I don't know,
any global kind of statistics,

632
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,920
but they think they're above about five,
uh,

633
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,130
a million people and many
of them live in the suburbs,

634
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,400
live in these Asha LMS. They're
called, uh, uh, [inaudible] or, or,

635
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,500
or, uh, well see tay, you know, their,
their housing projects. Uh, uh, basically,

636
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,510
uh, and in which, um, uh, so
many of the people are poor,

637
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,720
many depend on,

638
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:54,721
on state assistance and crowd more
and more relatives than tiny spaces.

639
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:57,450
We knows how a good number
of people from Zaire, uh,

640
00:35:57,451 --> 00:36:00,690
who were brought to to France thanks to a,
a French friend of ours,

641
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,150
a lawyer and some of them
came as basketball players,

642
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,800
a couple of them did and you know,

643
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:07,530
they're living in rooms out in the
suburbs and they, they're, you know,

644
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:12,440
15 people living in a, in a, in a
small apartment. Um, and what are,

645
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,430
and so the rate of unemployment in France
in 19 2005 was about 10, about 10%,

646
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:19,890
3 million unemployed.
That's a lot. But a young,

647
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:24,830
young people among young people
is 23% and in the suburbs, uh,

648
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,320
uh,

649
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,320
then employment weight rate rose from
28% to 40% for young people between 1990

650
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,680
and 2000.

651
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,540
And the unemployment rate for foreigners
and French with origins in non European

652
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:44,541
countries stood at about 36%
of the population in Clichy.

653
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:50,640
This community that I said was the
fifth or whatever I said sixth poorest

654
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,301
community in France.

655
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:56,280
I think fifth at the time 80% of the
population lived in what were classified

656
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,790
are classified still as a zone.
Then small Siebler,

657
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:04,791
difficult urban zones and 35% in public
housing in Clichy Suwon the unemployment

658
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:12,891
rate for young people between
18 and 25 your age stood at 60%,

659
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,240
and for 33% of the population as a whole.

660
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,060
And there were constant complaints
when all their journalists would go in,

661
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:25,260
the reporters go, Eh, you
know, [inaudible] was sent
out reporters and, and,

662
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,870
and they counted all these
stories of their lives.

663
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:31,320
They're trying to find jobs and with the
same qualifications being turned down

664
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,080
systematically and they've done all these,
they've done,

665
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,710
they've done these secret things. I've
seen this on TV where they'll take people,

666
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,660
uh, you know, and,

667
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,310
and set up companies in a way to see how
they react when they're confronted by

668
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,420
candidates for a job,
uh, in which, you know,

669
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:53,421
the white person will be less well
qualified than the north African or a west

670
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:58,140
African. And time and time again, just
write down the line, wouldn't get the job,

671
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,440
wouldn't. And there's no use. There's no
use ignoring this fact, even as Sarcozi,

672
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,900
uh, uh, says it, uh, that
this, this isn't true.

673
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,230
And many of them are particularly those
people from north and west Africa,

674
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:11,970
depending on this informal economy,

675
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,350
a economy of barter in economy of,
of, you know, black marketing to, uh,

676
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,330
to an extent or, or petty drug
deals and things like that. Uh,

677
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:26,280
because there's nothing else, uh, to do
a man of Arab origin. Put it this way,

678
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:29,220
he says, I raised my
children, hiding from them.

679
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:32,220
The fact that I no longer
have any hope for them,

680
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,860
but the real drama is that
they understand all of that.

681
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,160
They grew up in this bloody
chaos and they suffer.

682
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,000
There is no future for the
children of immigrants here.

683
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,260
That's a tough thing to say. And
that's not, that was a thoughtful,

684
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,720
it's not just somebody who
is reacting to, to, uh,

685
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,910
into a city in flames and to violence
between the police and young people.

686
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:55,810
Uh,

687
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,400
it's somebody who's who for whom
that experience was a part of,

688
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,360
uh, of, uh, of their lives. And he's
reflecting the fact that, I mean,

689
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,900
in this interview, when I wrote to all
of this, I wrote this for a piece, uh,

690
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,990
you know, I was doing it,
you know, reading magazines.

691
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:13,360
That's how you know that are you
doing kind of instant history.

692
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:16,900
I wrote this just a couple weeks after
this happened for an encyclopedia,

693
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,410
a while, maybe six months
after that, you know, you,

694
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,110
you end up reading things
like this, but, but,

695
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,550
but if this is a form of history also,
uh,

696
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,780
and he's reflecting the gap between
himself and his own children,

697
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,090
they don't believe that
they belong anywhere.

698
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,530
If you don't believe you belong
anywhere, you know, then then, you know,

699
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:38,710
then society's got a big a problem.

700
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,520
And they say that they don't feel French
and they've been controlled so many

701
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,470
times. It's not just their control.
Once in a while or some, you know,

702
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:49,990
a zealous policemen sees a west African
and north African and says, Hey, hey,

703
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:53,500
let me see your papers, man. Uh,
it's just time and time again.

704
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:56,980
And I told you the other day that,
you know, I never am crow. I'm never,

705
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:58,960
never controlled anywhere.
Never, never, never.

706
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:02,610
And I've been leaving metro stations
with all sorts of people were, you know,

707
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,370
Barbara's Roy Schwartz and places like
that with all sorts of people who are

708
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:10,600
minorities and, and more French
than I am, more French than I am.

709
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,230
And I have a residence card.
I don't have a passport,

710
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,840
and they have passports and
there are ones are controlled.

711
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,250
It's not me that's controlled.

712
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,880
And I don't dress in differently than
they do as you might've been able to tell.

713
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,720
Uh, and it, it, uh, the recent law against
Foula, you know, against the headscarves.

714
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,350
So, which has been much to do.
And My friend Joan Scott just has,

715
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,100
who lectured up here a couple of weeks
ago. Hey, you know, this also, I mean,

716
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:35,440
my argument, not everybody agrees
with me, not even people on the left,

717
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:39,280
some of them don't agree with
me, but, but, uh, um, you
know, you can twist and say,

718
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:40,270
well,
this and not twisted,

719
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,690
but you can take the take on it that
this is really an antifeminist thing.

720
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,560
It's anti women's thing. People wearing
full hour. And I generally feminist, uh,

721
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,630
but not necessarily. Why not? Uh, that
I think it's anti Muslim. Uh, they say,

722
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:56,250
well, you know, you can't wear
big crucifixes in the class to a,

723
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,570
you can't worry Yamakas in the
class. Well, I don't know. Uh,

724
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,630
my kids have been in the say a
[inaudible] near to lose and then, um,

725
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,220
uh, Marcel Gimo and Oba and a, they
knew or saw me wearing huge crucifixes.

726
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,980
Uh, no crude, big crucifix is allowed. Uh,

727
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,340
I'm not sure if they've seen Yamikas
that is a problem because they had the

728
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:18,850
right there, the growth of antisemitism
and not just among Muslim populations,

729
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,210
but it's directed against Muslims. There's
no question about it. Uh, in my view.

730
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:23,830
And furthermore, that, I mean,

731
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:26,050
you can understand the
position of some Muslim women.

732
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:30,640
I'm not saying anything about, uh, why
people were fooled. I mean, I don't know,

733
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:33,470
but there's some are under pressure from
their fathers or their older brothers

734
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,050
to wear headscarves. And
that's very, you know,

735
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,550
one can understand these
family situations. I'm not
saying anything about this,

736
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:44,120
but I think that, that, that, that this is
a law that is aimed at Muslims. I think,

737
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,300
uh, you can invoke the secular
republic, you can look,

738
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,550
invoke the separation of church and state.
You know,

739
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,430
we talked about that this country went
to the inauguration and north haven,

740
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:53,420
Connecticut of,
uh,

741
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,090
our dear friend who was just
elected select when the other day,

742
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:59,450
and it was supposed to be separation of
church and state. And they were, you know,

743
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:03,590
there were prayers and they
were in vocations and all
of this business. Uh, but I,

744
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:07,700
I see this as directed at Muslim women
because they are Muslims and other people

745
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:11,030
don't agree with me, but I think, but
this has been a lightning rod for,

746
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,970
for the way that people treat each other.

747
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,600
And who has the right to be who they
are in, you know, in France. Um,

748
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,880
and as I said,

749
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:24,650
the French Republic has even refuse
to acknowledge the existence of ethnic

750
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:27,980
groups. They're not counted, they're not
countable. And part of that, as I said,

751
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:30,590
is that you don't want to make people
feel different by saying you are so many

752
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,440
people from muddy.
You are so many people from Senegal.

753
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:38,120
You are so many people from, with
Algerian background, uh, or whatever. Uh,

754
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,170
but,
uh,

755
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,090
what the government did is talk about
the necessity of order of imposing order.

756
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,650
And that's what he talks about,

757
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:49,060
his order and the police
in order La Fosse daughter.

758
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,140
And there's no talk much
anymore about equality. Uh,

759
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,890
and it gets lost in this is that old
French commitment to human rights,

760
00:42:57,891 --> 00:43:00,140
which is something that
one can only value.

761
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:04,910
And given that the total degradation of,
of views of human rights in, in, in, uh,

762
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,190
in, uh, you know, well, we'll
get into this, but in, in this
country, uh, recently, uh,

763
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,730
I, um, you know, when could
only a wonder, it's amazing. Um,

764
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,890
and ironically the state of emergency
that was declared in 2005 in the fall was

765
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:23,891
based on the state of siege law that
had been imposed in 1955 during the

766
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,400
Algerian war of independence to try to
impose order on Algerians who want it to

767
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:35,090
be free and they use the same law
without any kind of, oh, excuse a new,

768
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,650
and we were very sorry this law,

769
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:41,090
we understand this is a different
situation or is it, who knows? Uh, and uh,

770
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:45,720
it was this fact was not
lost on Arab minorities. Uh,

771
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:50,890
the Portuguese immigrants may be the
largest single national ethnic or other

772
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,680
from other places group in
the Paris region, but it,

773
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:59,390
but Algerians are not far
away and what this riots did,

774
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:02,870
and this is a good place to end since
we can do we have to end, uh, is it a,

775
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:07,310
made clear that in the civil that there's
been a breakdown in civil society,

776
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,730
in the fringe suburbs and that
obviously something has to be done.

777
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,140
And there's been a lot of talk about
how we're going to pump more money into

778
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,240
voluntary associations,
but nothing has been zen zen Ho.

779
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,410
That's what people said the
other day. Uh, the red belt, uh,

780
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,340
remains, uh, uh, uh, you know,
a dream of the past. Nope.

781
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,970
They're communist party is hardly, no, no
one's out there defending these people.

782
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,050
There are no political parties. There's
the SLS Ross season, uh, uh, Harlem, uh,

783
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,910
uh, Daisia is an old group. Uh, but
I've yet to see a political party, uh,

784
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,880
embraced the cause of these
people. The way, for example,

785
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,210
even the communist party embraced
the cause of, of, of, uh,

786
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:50,100
the small percentage of French peasants
that is 8% or 5%. Even now, uh,

787
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:52,750
in, uh, uh, left in France. Um,

788
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,460
and the credits that had been locked
off by the previous government,

789
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,230
US still have never have
never been returned.

790
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,790
Um, there aren't enough funds
at the moment to create jobs.

791
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:07,330
He tried to create
these employ young jobs.

792
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:09,540
Do they call them the people
to help old ladies on with her,

793
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,170
on the trains where their suitcases, but
these are temporary work. You know, there,

794
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,210
I mean, the problem is, uh,

795
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:18,540
is an enormous problem and it's not
something you can kind of be drempt away,

796
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,480
like saying, well, they are
out there and you know, Paris,

797
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,150
we'll still have all of this American
and English and German and Belgian

798
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:27,820
visitors because they don't go with the
Clichy Suwon they go to look at north

799
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:29,550
for dom and the Eiffel Tower.

800
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:33,570
And when they fly over places like Sar
Salar or Gosh, Mulago Ness, you know,

801
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:36,900
they don't pay much attention to it. And
so one, one thing that people have to do,

802
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,400
and I suppose this is what I'm doing
now, uh, is that one can only, Eh, uh,

803
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,580
you know, encourage public awareness
of the kind of marginalization of,

804
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,780
of lots of people. You can't turn Europe
into sort of fortress Europe. You know,

805
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,620
you can't imagine the kind of thing
that the Americans want to do or some

806
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:54,420
Americans want to do.
Build this huge wall,

807
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:57,990
a new Berlin Wall between
Mexico and the United States.

808
00:45:57,991 --> 00:46:01,170
You know what they going to do
in Paris, but a huge, huge wall,

809
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:02,800
run the peripheral leak,
uh,

810
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,880
have the highway running around Paris
and then leaving it open to Versailles of

811
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:10,530
course, and the fancy suburbs
on the, uh, on the west. Um, so,

812
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,750
uh, for a moment, I mean a lot
of people in 2005 at the end,

813
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,310
or if you ask him in 2006,

814
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:20,670
you ask young people even to participate
in who said garbage can on fire.

815
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,560
What do you think has come out of this?
The,

816
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,310
the ones who were most charitable
about all of this said that look, uh,

817
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,430
with commodities is that we've tried
to make France and w and the world and

818
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,450
Europe people, they had to comfortable
places to don't think about these issues,

819
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,200
uh, uh, aware of these problems. But
this isn't a problem that's going to,

820
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:43,860
it's going to go away. And once you can
see it as a problem, it's a challenge. Uh,

821
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:45,000
and uh, because they, you know,

822
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:49,680
France believes deeply in the tradition
in this course, uh, the, of course,

823
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,920
you know what I mean? The, the history of
France and Liberty Fraternity, equality.

824
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:56,730
And there's the times when push comes
to shove and you have to actually show

825
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,440
that you mean it. So, uh, hopefully
France will remain France. Uh,

826
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,880
but hopefully this situation will improve,

827
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:09,410
but it's going to take a lot of action
and not just kind of polarizing talk and

828
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,340
appealing to two electorates who just
want the whole problem to go away. Um,

829
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,320
