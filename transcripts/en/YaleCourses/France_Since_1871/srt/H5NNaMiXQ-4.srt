1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,161
Okay.

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:06,180
I want to just finish off cause la trying
to do the collaboration and one week

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:10,020
is not easy. I want to talk a little
bit more about, uh, Vichy and the juice.

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,550
And then I mentioned something about
[inaudible] haul the late president of

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,650
France and the whole question of,

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,570
of forgetting and then remembering
and then I'll, I'll, uh,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,220
leap into a I to resistance.
Um,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
just at the beginning, I mean,
just to put the perspective of,

9
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:33,641
of how the French Vichy forces
or government's treatment
of the Jews compares to

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,550
other, to other countries. Um,

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,170
that, yeah, in, uh,

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,390
November of 1942 that's a crucial period
because is that point that the Germans

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,470
occupied the, the so called
free zone or, or Vichy zone.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,230
And at that point Vichy
authorities hand over the Jews, uh,

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,750
who had been imprisoned,
I in the Vichy zone,

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,340
a to the Nazis and they had mark
their ration cards. You know,

17
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,540
you had to ration cards,

18
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,620
you had to have cards to get a little
bit of butter and all this kind of stuff.

19
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:15,300
They mark them Zarif. Uh, or as
we've settled on the cock, uh,

20
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,690
which meant Jew, which made
it easier, uh, for, uh,

21
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:23,390
the German or the French police,
um, uh, tourist them. And, and, uh,

22
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:27,280
so they, they, they, not only
did they, uh, well, I had, well,

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,710
they had to sort of turn over of
what was left of their authority. Uh,

24
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:36,040
but they, they did, did,
um, uh, they did, uh, uh,

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,940
more than the, uh, than they needed to do.

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,050
And things were so bad for the Jews at
the hand of the Vichy police that, that,

27
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,130
uh,
uh,

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,960
when thousands of foreign Jews I had
gone into niece had somehow gotten in,

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,000
in, in, uh, gotten into
Nice, uh, which, um,

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,480
that which Mussolini's fascist
troops, uh, had occupied,

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,210
um, that the, you know, they,
they essentially, uh, uh,

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,260
uh, you know, arrested them
or made it easier for the, uh,

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
for the people there to be identified
and to be in, to be taken by. Um, uh,

34
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,110
by the fascist a and an October,
1942,

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,760
when the u s government proposed to take
a thousand Jewish kids whose parents

36
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:22,230
had been deported without them a PR Laval,
um,

37
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,100
who would get his after the war. And
her neighbor who's gay, who is the, uh,

38
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,890
police had a, who was when it
was, uh, uh, uh, murdered, uh,

39
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,030
before his trial by a guy
seeking publicity for his book.

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,980
They replied that only certified
orphans could be given exit visas.

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,240
And that's because you couldn't prove
that the parents had already died in the

42
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,170
death camps.

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,130
They would not allow the Jewish
children to be deported or to deport it,

44
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:51,630
to be exiled, to be refugees, uh,
in the United States. So, and,

45
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:55,470
and Lavalin buscape, both of whom were
frenetic antisemites knew this very well.

46
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,560
So essentially they just
condemn them to, to, um, uh,

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,380
to eye eye to their fate and, and
the children couldn't lose. I mean,

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,233
you couldn't leave.

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,430
And I'm more than five weeks following
the allied invasion of Normandy, which is,

50
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:13,480
you know, what's on the 6th of June
of 1944. The Vichy police were,

51
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,670
we're still arresting Jews. And right
up until the last, until the last days,

52
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,940
uh, and so many of the cases to the
media, people in the police, uh,

53
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,460
who were gunned down at the end,
at the end of the war, during,

54
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,690
during liberation had been,
you know,

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,720
these were people who had gone out of
their way simply to keep on arresting Jews

56
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,790
and, and, and killing Jews. Uh,

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,660
when it was clear that the allies
were going to come in and, and, and,

58
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,690
and chase the, uh, the Germans out, uh,

59
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:45,580
in the eight months of 1944 before
the liberation, almost 15,000 Jews,

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,650
uh, were, uh, deported and deported
means, uh, to the death camps.

61
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,860
Um, so, um, anyway,

62
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,730
three quarters of all the Jews who were
arrested in France during the entire

63
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:02,210
period were arrested, uh,
by, uh, the French, uh,

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,370
the French police, a German
director, I mean French director,

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,780
our director, I were, or where the
heads of the academy, that is, you know,

66
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,180
Francis divided into academy.
Uh,

67
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:17,050
that is the whole structure of education
from the universities down to two,

68
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:20,400
the Matranel to, to, uh,
uh, kindergarten's, uh,

69
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,600
the rector's a domestic Jews from their
post. And you met one of them, uh,

70
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,700
Mark Block of my am I
said lost a job twice.

71
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,330
He lost it in straws and
then in [inaudible]. Yay. Um,

72
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,010
and in my say that the order of doctors
purge juice from the right to practice

73
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:39,010
and complained that there was still
Jews in medical school. Now and again,

74
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:42,460
they didn't have to do this. The, the, you
know, the Germans weren't saying, yeah,

75
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,950
you know, they had other
things, uh, you know,

76
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,940
security and things that they were
worried about security in quotes. Uh,

77
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,690
but it was just done, uh,
because they wanted to do it. Uh,

78
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:57,220
and this the same thing in the
legal profession, uh, where, uh,

79
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,560
lots of magistrates, a as in
the case of, of, uh, of, of,

80
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,130
of Hitler's Germany. And, and, uh, in
Weimar before Hitler came to power,

81
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:10,130
the magistrates who admitted them, and
most of them had been trained under, uh,

82
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,510
the second right. That is before World War
One. And maybe they flocked to, uh, uh,

83
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,140
the extreme right. Uh, very, uh, uh,

84
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,240
quickly public opinion in general did
not criticize measures taken against the

85
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,720
Jews,
uh,

86
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:27,690
at least until 1942 and as I said the
other day, they were, there were, um,

87
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,100
uh, so many, I did not see nations
of people that, that were, uh,

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,770
notes that said, uh, just to, to have
kind of come home with Ai, these reef,

89
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:39,040
you know, I'm sure that my neighbor,
he's a Jew and the cost of this were,

90
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:39,970
we're rather serious.

91
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,420
So what do we know about the reactions
of non Jewish French men and women to

92
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,190
what was going on?
Well,

93
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,220
late in 1940 900,000 people visited a,

94
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:55,800
an exposition that v she had put up
in the [inaudible]. Uh, in Paris, uh,

95
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,930
about the alleged links of Freemasons
that is free thinkers to Jews and to the

96
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:05,210
British. Uh, so I mean, if
you went into it, I mean,

97
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,720
this was just the equivalent a, well,
it wasn't art, the artistic equivalent,

98
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:11,360
but it was rather like the,
the, uh, if you went to that,

99
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,180
you were going in this with the same
sort of spirit is if you went to, uh,

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,550
one of the art shows to Hitler point
put on about a decade and art deco and

101
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:22,040
inner Jewish art and, and
this sort of stuff. Um,

102
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,720
another 114,000 people saw the exposition
when it on tour of the provinces.

103
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,943
Um,

104
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,350
another expedition called the
Jew in France attracted in 1942,

105
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:38,351
250,000 visitors in Paris
and 100,000 in the provinces.

106
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,720
Um, the German film, uh, that,
that the to which the Nazis, uh,

107
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,260
uh, in other writers and Germany's
had flocked called the juice Seuss,

108
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,820
which ends with, with a
Jew being hung, uh, to the,

109
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,150
to the frenzied applaud of
audiences, uh, was shown in France.

110
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,540
And people did go to see it.
Not huge numbers of people. Uh,

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,010
and there were even demonstrations in,
in two cities, but in tour, uh, you know,

112
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,360
on the wire,
uh,

113
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,680
people aligned up around the block
in order to come in and see this,

114
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:14,060
this essentially, um,
a Hitler, um, uh, uh,

115
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,930
uh, not, not see, uh, publicity, uh, uh,

116
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,300
a movie.
Uh,

117
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:24,140
and the collaboration is a
newspaper as you see Paul too,

118
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,690
or I am everywhere. Uh, sold a hundred,

119
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,750
so 250,000 copies in 1942
a and 300,000 by 1944.

120
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,650
Yes, 1944 a, which ends as
you know, in August in 1944.

121
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,590
Doesn't end in August, but, but,
uh, you know, the Germans are, are,

122
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,520
are Paris falls and at the end of August,

123
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,410
1944 and then gradually the
war moves, uh, to the east, um,

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,960
in, uh, uh, a novel, a by a
guy called a Lucia hobbit. J,

125
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,770
uh, called the lay a, they call him
would have sold 65 very right wing thing,

126
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,290
sold 65,000 copies, which
is a huge sale in France. I,

127
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,500
it's first month out.

128
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:10,460
And is published your claim that
only the shortage of paper, a war,

129
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,750
a war rationing of kept him from
selling another 200,000 copies.

130
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,820
And here's a glimpse of
what is in the novel.

131
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,260
I wished the victory of Germany cause
her war is my war. All my machine.

132
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,610
Oh my machine gun.

133
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,910
So often caressed in my dreams facing the
despised gangs of the Popular Front to

134
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,550
gilded ghettos of Sodom a hundred.

135
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:36,551
Well ane machinegun burse he exuded about
the site of Jews wearing yellow stars,

136
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,450
the Jewish backless,

137
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,690
the Jewish micro and all this now and all
in the French record is not very good.

138
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,300
Uh, even, uh, compared with other
countries, uh, they expect is spectacular.

139
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,660
The exception being Slovakia,
uh, which was, uh, uh,

140
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:58,130
certainly one of the worst places could
possibly have been, uh, as a Jew and,

141
00:08:58,131 --> 00:09:03,060
and not too far from, from, uh,
uh, Os fits across the frontier in,

142
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,440
uh, in Poland. I was turned over both
natives and foreign zoos to Nazis, uh,

143
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:09,720
right away.
Uh,

144
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:13,860
Vichy France was the only country in
which local authorities deported Jews

145
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,190
without the presence of occupying forces.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,410
And in Hungary, which had had
antisemitic legislation since 1920,

147
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,040
even the vicious admiral called
whore, the, he was not in this course,

148
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,380
but he was vicious. Anyway, HR, t,

149
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:32,970
h y m I handed over, no Jews, uh,

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,940
who are Hungarian Jews, uh, until, uh,

151
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,810
German occupation in 1944 a and then mark,

152
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,570
only 7% of the Jews disappeared.

153
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,810
I helped by Danes and
the proximity of Sweden.

154
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:49,290
The motto was just across the straights.
It's still just across the straits,

155
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:53,550
except there's a bridge now. Um, uh, yet
France was the country in which a great,

156
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:58,140
the greatest percentage of
Jews are, a great percentage
of Jews, uh, survived. Uh,

157
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,790
the war in all,

158
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:04,791
only 24% of the Jews were deported as
opposed to 78% in the Netherlands and 45%

159
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,800
from Belgium and ultimately
50% from, from, uh, Hungary.

160
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,060
Now there's another thing going on
too. I mean, just look at the map. Uh,

161
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,460
there's nowhere to hide in the Netherlands
or in Belgium of basically in Belgium

162
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,610
is flat. There's no, uh, and
I'll give you some examples of,

163
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:26,610
of where Jews say were saved
because of, uh, of, of,

164
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,530
of geographic, uh, uh, of geographic,
kind of doing a, I mean, the,

165
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,460
uh, uh, of the lay of the land,

166
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,810
but such figures that were marshaled by
those apologizing for the Vichy regime

167
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,410
regime and to repeat something that
they're borrowing from Robert Paxton.

168
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,280
And I said the other day, a Vichy
might have a save the French state.

169
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,080
I in quotes, uh, but it
lost, uh, the French. Uh,

170
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,090
there were French, the French nation. Now
what about resistance? Uh, first of all,

171
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:00,590
what about me to all
Francois? Me Too long. Um,

172
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,670
was the president of France
between 1981, may of 1981. And,

173
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,920
um, uh, she would have been out, uh,

174
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,500
when w 1981 and 91 was it,
it was [inaudible] 91.

175
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,530
The end of his term, I can't
remember. No, it was 14 years.

176
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:21,030
It should be 81 to [inaudible] 95
and now the term is five years.

177
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,220
Uh, Francois Mitterrand was, uh,
uh, what was a socialist, uh, who,

178
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:31,030
um, started out his term in 1981
with lots of, of, of socialist,

179
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,670
um, economic policies and sort
of backed up off from them,

180
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:40,240
but became somebody who was
extremely popular in France. Um,

181
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,610
and as he was dying at the, toward
the very end of his life, uh,

182
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,910
maybe a year before he died,
he had very serious illness.

183
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,880
The journalist knew it. And unlike the
journalist in the United States, you know,

184
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,340
where it's something like that
would be leaked immediately. Uh,

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,210
a journalist did not leak this fact,

186
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:59,350
but it was quite obvious that that falls
on me too. Mom was, was it was ill. Um,

187
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,640
and it, toward the end of his life to
facts about his life came up. It came out.

188
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,130
Um, the first is that he had
a very old daughter, uh, from,

189
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,800
uh, Aaliyah is all, if it had
nothing to do with his wife,

190
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,800
I'm necessarily common in a,
in the political France.

191
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,240
But the second and for our purposes
is much more important, uh,

192
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,690
was that he had himself been a
collaborator. This was the dark secret.

193
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,420
And He poured out his heart. Uh, he said
he had something he had to tell. Uh,

194
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,970
he wasn't telling himself that he had to
tell the French people and that he had

195
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,680
collaborated early in the war.
In fact,

196
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,980
somebody came up with a picture of him
in a right wing demonstration with the

197
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:40,110
quad differ or one of these
groups against immigrants, uh,

198
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,410
before World War Two. Now
he had second thoughts, uh,

199
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,810
fairly early into the war.
And he ends up, you know,

200
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:51,520
he heads an important branch of,
of the resistance organization. Uh,

201
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,280
but he came to grips with his own past,
uh,

202
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,430
as France was attempting to come
to grips at the very same time.

203
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,960
Now,
now to the resistance who resist maybe.

204
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,810
And why did they resist?
And again,

205
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:11,000
just as the question of collaboration,
uh,

206
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
was a party and the discovery
of massive collaboration.

207
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:20,680
And it wasn't just a few people, a few
elites. And this was the, you know,

208
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:25,450
the dark secret of the dark years
as Julian Jackson called, uh,

209
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:29,590
this period. Um, so, uh, is
the case with the resistance.

210
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,010
And as I began the lecture last
time I'm in Charleston, golf, uh,

211
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,160
was determined that the,

212
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:39,010
the France of the fourth republic was
to be built around his large body. Uh,

213
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,240
and a part of that was to
try to convince people, uh,

214
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,030
in France and abroad,
uh, that the godless,

215
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,190
we're the only resistors and that
they had heard the crackle of his,

216
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,580
uh, voice imposing voice across
the airwaves. And June 18th, uh,

217
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,980
19, uh, 40, uh, now, what can we say now?

218
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,360
First of all,

219
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,390
that the communists were arguably
the most important or most effective

220
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,750
resistors, uh, during,
uh, during the period. Uh,

221
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:18,610
and it's certainly that after the Jews
or the Communists suffered, uh, most,

222
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,120
uh, Vichy not only handed
the Nazis lists of those,

223
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,160
they arrested as communists,

224
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,370
but also executed a many of them
themselves beginning in 1941 for no other

225
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,960
reason. Then there, um, uh, uh,

226
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,290
political affiliation.

227
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,650
V She's minister of the Interior chose
Communist rather than those he called

228
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:43,060
good freshmen to be gunned down
by German firing squads, uh,

229
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,830
in the fortress of Bovela Vella.
Yeah. Outside of Paris. Now,

230
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,560
uh, the, the socialists presence.

231
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:54,650
And Socialist presence in the
resistance is an organized, forced,

232
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,220
was not as great. But there's some,
several obvious reasons for that.

233
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,060
The communists have benefited from the
fact that they had sales and virtually

234
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,040
every commune in France, and that's
what they call them, sell. Uh,

235
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,380
there are still in our
village of 300 people, uh,

236
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,260
a communist party cell,

237
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,400
which involves basically just five or
six of our friends, uh, who, or anything.

238
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,720
Then the about the communist of,
of Moscow in all of this. Um,

239
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,610
but who are defenders of, of, uh, of,
uh, uh, uh, those who have no one else,

240
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,780
uh, to defend them. And that
sort of thing, including are
different. The former, uh,

241
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,810
a school teacher and some of
our best friends in the world.

242
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,310
And occasionally in my mailbox I'll
find an invitation from the sell of Bala

243
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,150
Zuke, uh, to a communist party,
a gathering, uh, where, uh,

244
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,100
they, they, they've asked me to talk on
the, on the collapse of a, of capitalism.

245
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:48,470
You don't have to explain to them that
capitalism isn't probably going to

246
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:52,640
collapse in the near future. And then
we all, after some political discussion,

247
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:54,950
we all drink, uh, uh,
illegal wine. Essentially.

248
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:58,160
There's this wine called clamp clamp,
tall as in Clinton,

249
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:00,430
but it's nothing to do
with Clinton. Um, that,

250
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,040
that is was called those sort of the
vat food a little bit. Uh, and it grows,

251
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,840
it grows all over the place,
the grapes do, and, and, and
because it grows. So, uh,

252
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,070
so wildly, uh, uh, it became sort of
illegal to produce a particular grape.

253
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,610
And so one of the parts of being a
party of resistance is you don't pay any

254
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,640
attention to that. Uh, and to
that extent, I agree with that.

255
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:22,340
And so we would drink these
bouts of Trento and I, I've done,

256
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,330
I've drunk a bottles of Clariton
tone with, with, um, uh,

257
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,910
a guy who joined the
party who is still alive.

258
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,120
He and his wife joined the Communist
Party in 1934 a and he is still,

259
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:38,590
uh, he, he's a painter and he painted
lots of people, a lots of the painting.

260
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,310
He was done. I was in prison, uh, in Paris
and when he was very lucky to be, uh,

261
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,390
to escape a execution,
but in part because of the complicity of,

262
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:51,740
of a guard and we think that they joined
the communist party two years before

263
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:56,570
the, uh, before the, uh, the Spanish civil
war, uh, is just incredible. So the, the,

264
00:16:56,571 --> 00:17:01,130
the point of this is that, uh, the, the
advantage of the company's Party had,

265
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,920
is that they already have organized,
they have people in most area,

266
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,550
every large village who
represent the communist party.

267
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:11,030
So it's easy to organize your comrades,
uh,

268
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,270
cause you know who they are and you
can trust them after all these years.

269
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,460
So they have some advantages there.

270
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:19,820
Another advantage of the communist party
had a, and as I alluded to this before,

271
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,080
is there, they were basically the party
of the Shemi know, uh, of the railroad,

272
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,070
the railroad workers and the
engineers in any station.

273
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:32,150
You go to go to a wall sometime where
I teach and I go to often who we have

274
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,570
friends there, um, and look in the,
in the railroad station. It's just,

275
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,860
it's just unbelievable.

276
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:41,010
There's this huge plaque with
about 200 names of Shemi, no,

277
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,950
a railroad workers, uh, in the largest
sense who, uh, uh, were killed,

278
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,640
executed by the Nazis,
uh, or by, uh, uh, by the,

279
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:54,900
the French fascist, uh, during the war
and even in every railroad station.

280
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,060
So the advantage there
is that as you know,

281
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:59,550
this from seeing all these movies
I'm sure about the resistance,

282
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,740
is pretty easy to blow up railroad tracks.
Uh,

283
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:04,380
and so what they were able
to do is blow up, you know,

284
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,650
how can you watch the whole whole train
line between a digital and Leon and my

285
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,270
say, for example, uh, there wasn't no Tj,

286
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:17,210
obviously that just started on the
28th of September, 1981. Uh, so, uh,

287
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,750
it's easy for a couple of Liga of the
guys to go out and, and to blow up, um,

288
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,240
uh,
uh,

289
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,520
block the track and it takes a long time
to fix the track and they blow up that

290
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:31,230
one and then, and they fixed
that one, then boom, further
on down the line. Uh, so,

291
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,480
uh, they were very active
in the north and you know,

292
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,190
and Lilo [inaudible] Bay to
acquire, uh, [inaudible] to,

293
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,650
uh, so, and, and, and they were
very much a part of the stage.

294
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,980
Jt that is the General
Confederation of Labor.

295
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,810
And they were more apt to be communists,
uh, uh, than other, any other, uh, party.

296
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,260
Uh, and this is true in the
suburbs of Paris, um, Eh, eh,

297
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,410
as well. So, um,

298
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,780
they also had great strength.
My metal, metallurgical, uh,

299
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,220
workers,
uh,

300
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:06,120
and thus metallurgical metallurgical
workers have access to,

301
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,740
to flammable explosive materials
and, and this sort of stuff. Uh,

302
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,040
and so, um, they also,

303
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:18,570
Dan organized very damaging industrial
strikes, particularly in 1944.

304
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,750
And these strikes help give people a sense
of hope that there's light at the end

305
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,530
of the tunnel. And of
course, the, you know,

306
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,430
the beat people listening to BBC and that
sort of thing. A story about BBC, uh,

307
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,090
two stories, uh, again, I hate to
keep referring to this village,

308
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:35,720
but I wrote a book on this village
called histones and Bazooka. And,

309
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,960
and at the end of it, uh, one of the two
last chapters about the schools, but a,

310
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,380
a school, but I had to cover it, you
know, do Vichy and I headed to Vichy very,

311
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:46,350
very delicately, very delicately. Uh,

312
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,410
it was obviously that in
our village that the priest,

313
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,830
that we don't have a
pretty steady more there,

314
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:53,580
but the priest was at Peyton
east and lots of people hated it.

315
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm not just because of his politics, but
a lot of people liked his politics. Uh,

316
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,970
but he used to sort of shout at people
in the confessional and there's all sorts

317
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:00,601
of funny stories.

318
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:04,660
He insisted that women sit on one side
of the church still and that men, uh,

319
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,760
on the other, but, um,
I, this was a village.

320
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,600
This is a village that wasn't an area of
great resistance even though arms were

321
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:17,010
parachuted down to, um, uh, on
a plateau near where we live.

322
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:20,190
This is done here in, in,
uh, in the [inaudible],

323
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,680
but there were two people in a,
in the resistance and one of, uh,

324
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,230
is still alive and very old ma'am.
Uh, and they would hide things.

325
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:32,490
This is the pay calcare. I
mean, it's a limestone country
in big, big goat, uh, uh,

326
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,820
you know, caves along the river and
you can hide things easily there.

327
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,890
And I wanted to talk to this man
about the, about the resistance and I,

328
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,600
uh, he's the uncle of a
friend and I invited finite,

329
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,130
invited he and his wife
over and I made clear,

330
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,980
I wanted to ask him some questions,
not let as a journalist, but,

331
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,140
but I'd been there in this place for 20
years and I knew the guy a little bit.

332
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,430
And, uh, above all I knew was
his, his family. And he said yes,

333
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,430
he would come and he would talk to me
about it because I'd been there so long.

334
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,880
Um, but then he never showed up. He
didn't want to talk about it. Uh,

335
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,740
he couldn't talk about it. Uh,
because of, of, uh, you know,

336
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,370
it's really like people coming
back from world war one a,

337
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,950
the people that talked and boasted were
the ones who would dress up in military

338
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:17,080
uniforms.
When's towns had been liberated.

339
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,920
It's if they had been there in the
beginning, out in the bushes, the Mckee,

340
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,100
the resistors. But he was a real
one. We didn't want to talk about it,

341
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,030
but I also knew speaking in BBC, and
this is the transition that I had heard,

342
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:32,760
the story that a man in
Bala Zuke had, um, had a,

343
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,880
in this particular village
had alerted the authorities,

344
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:40,420
the Vichy authorities, the fact that
that some people were listening to BBC,

345
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,890
now you could be executed for listening
to BBC. That was a capital crime.

346
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,970
Uh, and I mean, often they wouldn't,
if you were somebody they knew,

347
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:52,460
they wouldn't do that or whatever.
But you know, you denounce, uh,

348
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,220
you denounce somebody for listening
to the BBC. And that's not,

349
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,760
it's not as bad as denouncing
somebody's saying he's a Jew, but,

350
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,240
but it ain't good. Uh, so I
ask his friend of mine, um,

351
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,420
an older man who could remember the
war and I said, what about that? Uh,

352
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,210
and I wait until the appropriate
circumstances to ask him. He said, no, no,

353
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:16,630
it's just, uh, I don't, I don't pay
any attention to it. It's just rumor.

354
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,860
It's just rumors, a vicious rumor
that he's on the, you know, rumor,

355
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,040
they believe rumors and all that.
But

356
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,680
so in franchise JBS up on Tay,
I kinda snuck around a little bit,

357
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,720
serpent head around and I
asked some, uh, you know,

358
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,340
trusted people who are very discreet.
What about it?

359
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:37,540
And it turned out it was his father.

360
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,400
It was his father who did it and who
was associated with the priest in the

361
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:46,240
village. And I knew this man, he died
long time ago, 10 or 15 years ago.

362
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:51,010
But I knew the man and such
secrets are they best buried? Uh,

363
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,120
I buried it in the French edition
of my book. It's not an ad,

364
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:58,810
it's not an in the Dutch addition
either. Uh, it's in the English edition,

365
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,940
but hidden, hidden away. Uh,
cause he'll never know it.

366
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:05,650
Never see and couldn't read the English
edition. So all this stuff, you know,

367
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:10,520
it's kind of delicate, uh, that
whole business about, um, anyway, so,

368
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,740
uh, uh, people, the,

369
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:16,070
the comedies party became the
party of the 75,000 martyrs.

370
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
A because probably that many
communists, uh, uh, died. Whereas this,

371
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:23,960
the socialist had a lack of, uh,
you know, a lack of, of, of, um, uh,

372
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,630
Oregon structural organization and many
of their leaders like Leon Blum. Uh,

373
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,130
we're in, uh, uh, in a jail, uh, and as a,

374
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:36,410
and as I said last time
just passing there,

375
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:39,140
it also was it I left
when Catholic resistance,

376
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Social Catholics and no
resistance publication condemned
racism and antisemitism

377
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,280
with the vigor vigor of the newspaper.
Tim went, our team went asha,

378
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,240
Katya or Christian witness basically.
Um,

379
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,120
so,
and what about Jews?

380
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,340
It's hard to resist if you're being
tracked down and being arrested. Uh,

381
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,850
it's, um, and by the way,
remember Pierre Leval, uh,

382
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,880
who was the prime minister through
much of the period. He was the,

383
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:12,830
on another occasion when, um, uh, the
Germans insisted that that French parents,

384
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,330
uh,
that,

385
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:19,310
that French adults who are Jews be
transported from a certain sector, uh,

386
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,800
but they didn't ask for the children.
Pure level said,

387
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,190
send the children to
for me to vi Pi three.

388
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,360
I mean that in a very ironic
sense, you know, family work, uh,

389
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,500
country family values,
put the children together.

390
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:41,180
And so the children bounced off in the,
in the, in the railroad car. But in fact,

391
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,200
I know this Australian guy who
was a, a young, very young man.

392
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,960
I in Paris, who's Jewish
guy called Jack Adler. Uh,

393
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,960
and I met him in Melbourne a few years
ago, and he, um, uh, survived the war,

394
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:58,250
but he was 16. He was in an underground
Jewish resistance group in Paris,

395
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:01,340
and he wrote a book about it. Then he
went off and made a lot of money, uh, in,

396
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:05,730
in Melbourne. And he got out, he
survived. I became a, you know, a bear,

397
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,950
a cake producer.

398
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,610
And then he went back in and got his phd
in French history at the University of

399
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,610
Melbourne with my friend Peter McPhee.
And He, um, uh, then he wrote this book,

400
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,020
very good book on the Jewish
resistance. But, you know,

401
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,490
Jewish resistance was organized in,
in, in, in Paris where there were,

402
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,500
there were lots of Jews and had every
conceivable reason to resist, uh,

403
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,860
but only in cities like Volvo where
they were all getting locked up, uh, uh,

404
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:32,640
very quickly and in Leone and other
places. Uh, so, uh, but, but this,

405
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,050
the reason I that I insist on this fact
that there wasn't an organized Jewish

406
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:40,220
resistance is because among the sort of
antisemitic residuals and the postwar

407
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,220
period is, is that the accusation
that Jews didn't resist,

408
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:46,790
they just kind of went off
to be slaughtered and all
of that and didn't put up a

409
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:51,200
fight, which of course this
is obviously not true. Now,

410
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:56,201
the role of Protestants has been often
privileged in the discussion of the

411
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,430
resistance. Um, again, to
repeat what I said, uh,

412
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,970
lots of the most part,

413
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,450
most the greatest percentage
of Protestants are down
here again in the owl dash

414
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,250
and in the gap down here and this event
mountains basically also up in the

415
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,590
Jerome on the other side of the,
uh,

416
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,720
in the valleys that go down to the Rhone
River into the drum, t, r. O, m, e. Um,

417
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,970
and the most famous case of,

418
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,620
of Jewish children being saved
is that of a Protestant village,

419
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,240
which I'm going to write it on the
board because it deserves it, uh,

420
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,760
called the Lewis Chambong sooner Lino,

421
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,550
right on the edge of the owl dash in,
uh, near, near the [inaudible]. But, but,

422
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,110
but in the mountains and what they did
in this little teeny village as they

423
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,990
organize this kind of a false
id identification network,

424
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,970
and they took Jewish kids from Santa
tn and Leonel in other places in that

425
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:54,240
region. I mean, that, that region is
an area that always sent, you know,

426
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:58,320
lots of immigrants to, uh, it's very
Catholic region. But in this case,

427
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:00,970
in that village, Very Protestant, uh,

428
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,880
had sent lots of immigrants to
Leon and to a Sante Tien. And so,

429
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:10,110
um, they have, they adopted
all sorts of Jewish kids.

430
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,310
And then when the, when the Germans
would come through, uh, you know,

431
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,270
you could hear them coming,

432
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:18,470
they would hide the kids or they'd
go off into the woods and, and,

433
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
but there seem to be an awful lot of
kids in the Germans would go through,

434
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,890
my God,
these people must be very Catholic.

435
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,200
They're having babies all over the place.
Look at all these kids.

436
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,980
And they never figured it out. And in fact
that they were, they were, um, they were,

437
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,880
uh, uh, they were Protestant and, uh,
lots of, uh, of people were saved.

438
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:37,530
And there's a document you're on
this, um, guy called Rod QED, word HR.

439
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,770
Edward,
um,

440
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,240
D has on two really interesting books
on probably the best books on the

441
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:44,820
resistance that are in English.
And he made,

442
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:49,350
he noted something very interesting about,
uh, a commune, a village in, in the,

443
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,580
a couple of villages in the
Savanna mountains, uh, in
which Protestants resisted.

444
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:55,950
And he noticed that, you know,
in, in that part of France,

445
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:58,230
the religious wars had been the 16th,
17th,

446
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:02,640
and 18th century had been very bloody
and they'd pitted basically the armies of

447
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:06,740
the king of the, of the most
Catholic king against a, um,

448
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,220
even though that's the title
that they call it a Spanish
name. But anyway, uh, of,

449
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,790
of Louis the 14th and all these people
against a Protestants and he noticed that

450
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,800
one,
particularly a resistant village,

451
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,920
that's a huge mission cross overlooking
the village that had been planted there,

452
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,460
uh, in the 16th century as a, as a
sign of, of, or in the 17th century,

453
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:30,990
I don't know which war it was as a sign
of victory of conquest by the state and

454
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:33,900
the Catholic Church over
these Protestants does.

455
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:36,930
Looking at something like that
all the time, make you more,

456
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,970
want to resist a regime is closely
tied to right wing Catholicism.

457
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,810
Well, who knows? But Protestants were
overrepresented in the resistance.

458
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,610
But as I said, Catholics
resistance, resistant to, and
then the, you know, the, uh,

459
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,120
from the point of view of the resistance,
or I suppose anybody looking at this,

460
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,060
uh, it's easy to, uh, uh,
denounced, uh, many, uh, uh,

461
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,070
Catholic archbishops and
bishops who didn't give one
damn about the Jews and who

462
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,870
embraced Vichy with,
with a great passion.

463
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,760
But yet in many places of Catholic,
uh, villages that had Catholics,

464
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,600
uh, resisting, and most people in
France are nominally Catholics.

465
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,350
The role of priests Wa
wa was considerable, uh,

466
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,030
that Po and the role of teachers were
of an ste to have a primary school

467
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:27,650
teachers, uh, was, uh,
important as well. Now, priests,

468
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,720
I don't know what you priests
and, and, and, uh, um,

469
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,160
and the school teachers that are kind
of opinion makers or whatever the phrase

470
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:39,030
is, I mean, they are, you know,
they are people that, along
with the mayor that, that,

471
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,160
that,
that sort out problems in a village.

472
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,750
And so if you have a priest who
FISM enough of this stuff, you know,

473
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,230
he can throw his weight. Uh,
and to do good things. Uh,

474
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:53,640
and, uh, well, again, look at the
payoff was wrong. Uh, father, uh,

475
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,360
a Xiong tonight. Um, so,
um, uh, again, the, the,

476
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,860
the situation of, of, um, of, uh,

477
00:30:01,861 --> 00:30:06,550
of the Catholic churches is extremely,
um, uh, is extremely, uh, complicated.

478
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,300
Um, and the real explosion of, of,

479
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:14,301
of work on the resistance
has been dominated by the
stories of ordinary people

480
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:18,610
taking very unordinary choices,
big time choices.

481
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:22,570
A friend of mine called John Suites who
taught at University of Kansas. It K u,

482
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,620
um, he did a book on
Claremore fit hall, um,

483
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,650
because that's where the sorrow and the
pity he had the town that it had been

484
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:34,330
focused on. And his book is
called choices in Vichy, France.

485
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,930
Uh, and he was not critical of the packs
and the, which is the Canon after all. Uh,

486
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,950
but he argued that you
have to give him a wider,

487
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,020
a description of a ride or definition
of resistance in trying to determine how

488
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:50,770
many people resisted packs and thinks
that about 2% of the French population

489
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:54,190
resisted. John thinks sweets
things, and it's a very good book.

490
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,170
Choices in Vichy France thinks
that, uh, uh, uh, oh, maybe about,

491
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:03,910
you know, I can't remember what he says.
18 or 20% of the population resistance.

492
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:08,230
Well, what does resistance,
uh, it's, I mean, lots of
people took big time chances.

493
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:10,930
Smuggling weapons, you're going to get
killed if they catch you, you're gone,

494
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,930
toast, finished. Uh, but
you know, if you know,

495
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:17,980
you're in a movie theater and they're
doing the showing the documentary, I mean,

496
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,480
before the, the film, uh, there's always
this two minute news Saturday session,

497
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:25,210
which I can remember as a tiny little boy,
you know,

498
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:28,750
with always the same kind of
voices, uh, uh, giving the news.

499
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:32,020
And this would be the German,
the German news translated into French.

500
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:36,880
And if you whistle and you boo
whistling is mooing, uh, uh, in France,

501
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,630
or if you refuse to step off the
sidewalk to let a German officer pass,

502
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,790
I mean that it's self as a, uh,
a passive resistance. And so, uh,

503
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,590
certainly more people resisted according
to this definition. Uh, then, uh,

504
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,480
uh, and this was a type of, of choice,
uh, in, uh, in, in Vichy, France.

505
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,430
Um, one of the ways that people resisted
with, for example, passing, uh, these, uh,

506
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,100
printed these newspapers that
sort of mimeographed. Uh,

507
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,360
and there was a whole clandestine press
and it was very important because it

508
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:10,900
would tell people in Normandy that there
had been strikes and Sante Tien, uh,

509
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,280
or strikes and Maasais or would give
news on where people thought that the,

510
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,350
you know, the battles were
going in, that kind of thing.

511
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,460
How do you get newspapers around? Well,
you just take a bunch of them on a bus,

512
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,380
a bus and Leo for example,

513
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,470
and the bus is going along
plastic rom plus Bella Coola,

514
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,980
and you just hold your hand out the
window and drop all the leaflets,

515
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,140
or they'd be leaflets against when the
Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra played in

516
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:37,510
the Lille, uh, somebody did
that. They took all these, uh,

517
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,230
these little handwritten and mimeographed,
uh, uh, uh, pieces of paper that said,

518
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:44,480
no, you know, don't ask, don't go assist.

519
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:47,660
Don't go listen to the Berlin
Philharmonic. Let us resist.

520
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:51,230
And that's a form of resistance, to not
going to hear the Berlin Philharmonic

521
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,440
and drop them just like that.
And, and, and, uh, the old ones,

522
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:59,060
a very effective center of the resistance
I told you about mark block and there

523
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,850
because in the owner,
these things called en Francais Tabula,

524
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,430
which are basically not tunnels,

525
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:09,431
but there are passages that that began
in the 16th century to protect silk from

526
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:14,300
being a raw silk from being rained
on in a pretty rainy climate.

527
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,530
And so the Tub Moodle also grew up the
quote who's, which is this, this, uh, uh,

528
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:22,670
old working class neighborhood that
was outside of only a next to Leon, uh,

529
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:26,390
in 1852 and these trouble,
you can duck into these trouble.

530
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,840
And that's why the resistance was so
important in, in Leon Paul. And that's,

531
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,790
that's where mark block went when Mark
Block was, had, had gone down to here.

532
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,550
He was up in, uh, near gay here and
he just kind of anxious and he says,

533
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:42,110
I should go do something. So he goes to
Leon and he participates in, you know,

534
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,010
in the resistance. And of course,
he pays for it with his life. Um,

535
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,650
what about women? Now? For decades,

536
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,990
nobody paid attention to the role
of women in the resistance. Now,

537
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:57,500
women were, were very rare
in the heels. By the way,

538
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:02,270
the term McKee means, uh,
basically organized resistors.

539
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,980
A mucky in French or Leymah
key are, is kind of a, a brush,

540
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,270
a that's very sick brush behind,
which you could hide in Corsica.

541
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,040
That's where it comes from originally.

542
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:16,600
And then in the south of France on what
you call in French, the [inaudible], the,

543
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,480
you know, really dry
rocky, uh, uh, countryside.

544
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,920
And so by 1943,
by the end of 1943,

545
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:26,360
in many parts of France,

546
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,510
the Mckee rule by night that they have
increased in their forces are swollen by

547
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,220
people moving into the resistance.
Now, some people, you know,

548
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:39,050
had to feed these folks.

549
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,890
Some people had the darn
their socks or give, you know,

550
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,130
nip them things just to
stay, uh, stay warm some way.

551
00:34:47,131 --> 00:34:50,780
People had to pass messages and they're
all sorts of stories about women on

552
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:54,740
bicycles. Uh, it's, it's one of these
sort of things that you see in movies,

553
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:59,270
but if women on bicycle sort of charming,
a young woman, charming the guards, uh,

554
00:34:59,480 --> 00:34:59,961
you know,
if they,

555
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:04,520
if they have the bad luck to fall upon
the militia or a German guards and having

556
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,890
a written message,
which is a terrible idea,

557
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,100
but at least to have a verbal
communication of passing
messages into the hills.

558
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,890
Now the largest resistance movement in
most effective in Europe by far the Noah,

559
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,860
uh, is in you, in ex Yugoslavia. And,

560
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:22,520
and that's because of
the terrain in Bosnia,

561
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,900
Herzegovina and cross he Croatia and in
Serbia and they have entire divisions

562
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:31,610
with hospitals and mobile hospitals
and all of that with the British,

563
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,430
a parachuting things in.
But if you look at this map,

564
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:38,850
it's not surprising to see why there's
very little resistance here. Can,

565
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,800
where are you going to hide there?
There's nowhere to hide.

566
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,880
So the Mckee and the resistance, I mean
there are Maki all over the place, but,

567
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:48,881
but it was easier in the south and it's
by the end of 43 that I said last time

568
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:52,680
about the find a k on your door in the
morning with someone was there to put k

569
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:57,270
on the door in the morning. And
uh, uh, and, and there you go.

570
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:57,930
Uh,

571
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,490
and so the role of women has been much
more important that then than people had

572
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:05,150
thought. And there are
all sorts of, uh, uh,

573
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,780
why a big literature are
growing literature on this now.

574
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,720
And also in some places and
[inaudible] for example,

575
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:16,590
the numbers of Mucky [inaudible] of people
in the Ma, the resistance of my key,

576
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,040
uh,
were swollen.

577
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:22,770
It was swollen by refugees from
Spain or even from Poland. Uh,

578
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,720
so you have a, you know, you have
these people living out there. Uh, and,

579
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:28,460
uh,
the,

580
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,460
the only three times in France during
the period do they try to take on German

581
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,850
military units in a pitched battle?
Bad idea,

582
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,970
terrible idea. One is right near
Claremont fell, uh, here. Uh,

583
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,090
one is in the vacuum, uh, near Gunna
Oberth down here. And the third,

584
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:51,720
I don't remember where it
is. Um, so that, that's,

585
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:56,580
that's w w w that doesn't work very well
because they don't have the kind of big

586
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:00,720
time tanks and, and that,
that kind of thing. But they
were able to regroup. I mean,

587
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,570
are places near us. There's a
village way up in the hill. It's God,

588
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:07,770
it's so beautiful. Uh, church fabolous
church, a place called teen with his,

589
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,690
uh, with his Roman, uh,
poor of Forte, a Parte,

590
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,080
a entryway. That's just
fabulous. And there,

591
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,910
there was a whole bunch of these people
up there and they had some fairly

592
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:21,270
considerable arms. This is the pitch
battle, but then they get denounced.

593
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:24,030
There are always people that are going
to sell other people's lives away.

594
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,510
There's no question about it.
They were true believers, uh,

595
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,410
in the regime that's
going to sell people away.

596
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,670
And the next thing they know and another
case near us to next thing they know,

597
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,390
Bam,

598
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,180
here come the parachute to serve coming
in there and the tanks are rolling up or

599
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:37,711
the,
you know,

600
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:41,430
the smaller vehicles with machine gun
room at big machine guns in this kind of

601
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:44,130
stuff. And they are gone.
They are just massacred.

602
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:47,550
And there all sorts of places around
where we live. We're where people were,

603
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:51,330
were shot. And if you help, if you are a
woman or you or anyone, you're a priest,

604
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:53,640
you're a, uh, you're anyone,

605
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:57,980
you're a school teacher and you help
people and the, and they, you know,

606
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,470
and they catch you. And particularly
if you've killed the German, you know,

607
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:04,890
you're gone. That's it. I
told her the story of that
bud, the woman the other day,

608
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:07,140
it was a collaborator up on, uh, you know,

609
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:10,530
along the Rhone River and they blew
her brains out. And, and, and uh,

610
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,870
the resisters did, and in pennants
as it were in punishment, they,

611
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:19,260
uh, just, you know, the execute people
just take hostages and execute them.

612
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,410
Begin with people you think are
communists and they just shoot, shoot,

613
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,300
shoot the other people.
Look what happened in,

614
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:28,200
in next check in Czech Republic
and next Czechoslovakia in Prague.

615
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,230
I've gone to the place where Richard
Heidrick was one of the very worst of the

616
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:35,560
worst. I was assassinated
by these, uh, by, um, uh,

617
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,670
by check McKee. And he's gone down as he's
coming in and he fights them, you know,

618
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:43,270
when he finally, mortally wounded
and all that. And, and they go,

619
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:46,600
they go and they hide in this church that
I went to visit and Prague a couple of

620
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,040
years ago. And, you know, they
of course parish horribly,

621
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,920
but they took an entire village
called ladies and kill everybody.

622
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,740
It's rather like Sarah
farmers book orders are gone,

623
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,780
which really needs no
needs. No, uh, um, Eh,

624
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,880
you know, it needs to know,
uh, a discussion now. Now,
what, what led people?

625
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,500
Well, first of all, one, one quick
point is that again, I, I've said that,

626
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:14,020
that if you took a map of, of, of, I've
said this I guess maybe more recently,

627
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:17,210
but it's of, of decriminalization, uh,

628
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,800
allegiance to the French
revolution in 1,790,

629
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:25,240
the elections of 1949 in 19, uh, 81, uh,

630
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,230
you would have virtually the same
[inaudible] are left and the virtually the

631
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:32,800
same day pop them all are right. That
doesn't work for the resistance. Brittany,

632
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:36,040
which has always been
extremely conservative, uh,

633
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,240
was a big resistance area.
The same goes with rural Normandy.

634
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,160
And of course that's the most well known
because of the invasion. You know, the,

635
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,590
the, the Americans and the British and
the Australians and New Zealanders and

636
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:52,210
Canadians, uh, invade here.
Uh, the Germans thought they
were going to invade here,

637
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,920
but they invade here. Um,
and they'd already, uh,

638
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,430
the resistance that already taken out
lots of rail lines and things like that.

639
00:39:59,431 --> 00:39:59,951
In general,

640
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:03,460
Eisenhower said that they were worth
two divisions or something like that.

641
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,370
A rural normity is
always been conservative,

642
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,300
so that that interpretation
doesn't really work. Uh,

643
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:13,350
there was lots of resistance in
ovarian, which is conservative. Uh,

644
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,190
and there was tons of resistance
in the limo. Zheng Tao, uh,

645
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:22,310
thus explaining that one reason that
explaining the massacre and the 10th of

646
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:27,070
June, 1944, or I'll do a
sort of done. So, uh, uh,

647
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,000
the g you can't,
there's no kind of geographic determinism,

648
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,590
a regional determinism.

649
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:36,280
There is some geographic determinism
that is the lay of the land,

650
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:37,360
but there's no regional,

651
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,900
there's not a predisposed disposition
or Brett told not to resist because they

652
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:43,750
do resist the resistant. Not
everybody, but the resistance is,

653
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,620
is important in Brittany and
the sort of kinds of places.

654
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,750
Now without question,
the big defining moment swelling,

655
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,600
the ranks of the resistance
is this visa do 12,

656
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,450
I only got 12 in February.

657
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:03,451
The s t o w at that is the service of
obligatory work where the Germans say,

658
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,320
we want men from each region to go
to Germany and work in the factories.

659
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,060
The reason is they have so
many people, dad, so many
killed, uh, and they need work.

660
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,660
And this swells, um, uh,
the ranks of resistors.

661
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,840
This forces families and individuals
to make choices in Vichy,

662
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,250
France. Again, to borrow
from John's a title, um,

663
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,490
and this builds on an,
uh,

664
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,400
a policy and a June 42
announced by pure Laval that,

665
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,900
uh, called the [inaudible] or the relief
team that would send specialized French

666
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:46,880
workers to, uh, Germany in
exchange for the release of,

667
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,950
of French prisoners of
war from 1940. Haha. Uh,

668
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,930
but now they say, well, you got you,
you got to go. And they'll show up,

669
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:02,030
uh, into your village Inn and you
better be ready to go. 650,000,

670
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,140
uh, workers were sent to Germany
as consecrate script labor.

671
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,380
This also contributes to discredit
further the Vichy regime,

672
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:16,310
visa vi. Uh, it's, um, uh, you know,

673
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:18,080
its population,
uh,

674
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:22,640
and the grumbling about
Petain the grumbling about
shortages and the grumbling

675
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:27,260
about the German soldiers. A
give way now to more, uh, open,

676
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,420
uh, a resentment. Uh, the bishop of,
of lead, a guy called the colony.

677
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,740
Now Leah na,

678
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,720
who had kept quiet about the increasingly
obvious faith of Jews announced it was

679
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:43,721
no longer a duty for a Christian to go
to work in Germany and Jase Jase ms here.

680
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,920
Um, and so this swells, uh,

681
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:52,760
this nomadic tribe of resistors,
uh,

682
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,880
living from day to day in
the mountains and the hills.

683
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,100
And, you know, it's, is it
a scary existence? I mean,

684
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:03,620
you're listening through the night,
uh,

685
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:06,980
or in the day for the sudden
the roar of the machines,

686
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:11,981
the roar of the rival of airplanes
or a fast speeding German cars,

687
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,450
uh, uh, and you're
freezing in snow, a bored,

688
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:22,280
tired, anxious, uh, far, far away,

689
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:27,290
a demoralized and understandably
a terrifying. Now,

690
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:31,880
most of the, my key, we're
city folks, they were, uh,

691
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,860
that the majority and most of France
is not, you know, are not urban people.

692
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,940
Uh, in 1943, uh, in 19, uh, uh,

693
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,990
44, uh, you know,

694
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:49,910
that was because it was easier to round
up people to be sent in the s s t o that

695
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:52,250
is the obligatory labor service.
Uh,

696
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,700
if you were from a city where you had
all sorts of soldiers who come out and,

697
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,200
and, uh, uh, pick you up. Um, and so,

698
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,061
I mean,
the lien was,

699
00:44:02,061 --> 00:44:06,650
that probably is the classic example
that is in the area in which a orders for

700
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:11,450
Glenn, uh, takes, uh, of where it
became a, uh, uh, it was not a,

701
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:16,010
you know, not a mass mass movement,
but were you still have, uh, uh,

702
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,310
all sorts of people that are part
of underground Oregon underground

703
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:22,820
organizations or you know,
are part of the Gaullist resistance.

704
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:24,830
And Joel Moolah reason,
I have his name up here,

705
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,520
he was a former prefect
of the [inaudible],

706
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,500
which is the department of shots with,
you know, in the boats, uh, south Paris,

707
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,730
beautiful cathedral town.

708
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,790
And then he ends up himself getting
denounced in tortured, uh, and,

709
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,320
and all of that.
But the resistance,

710
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,080
whether they were gall us or whether they
were communists or whether they had no

711
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:47,580
affiliation at all, a party affiliation,
um, the resistance depended on,

712
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:51,990
on neighborhoods, small town
and above wall village networks.

713
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,370
Thus, uh, the role of
the school teacher, uh,

714
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:59,520
or some kind of local,
a leader, a communist,

715
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:03,090
was wounded by French,
French gendarme in a village.

716
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:07,380
And the vibe that is the department of
tunnel and central pay and all of that on,

717
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:10,590
on the Mediterranean, he
was hidden by a peasant, uh,

718
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,420
in this one of these networks.

719
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,890
But his untreated wound
developed gangrene to doctors,

720
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:17,670
took care of him,

721
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,260
alerted by the wife of an agent of a
resistance organization in all 10 people

722
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:27,000
combined at the risk of their life,
uh, of saving the life of one,

723
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,650
um, a resistor. And of course,
ironically in areas like the Limu Museum,

724
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,730
that if I, I insisted and I'm right
in doing so, uh, that, uh, you know,

725
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:39,990
as Paxton and others have argued that
that Vichy saw itself as the regime of

726
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:41,910
Lactam of the land.

727
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:45,600
That the real values were Joan of arc
and peasants and all that business,

728
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,520
the cult of the peasant resistor in
areas like the Limu Zahn that is around,

729
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,320
uh, the motion and, and the, to
the, you know, the massacre at two.

730
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,030
Then all these places, uh,
was an important one. Uh, as,

731
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,040
as well.
Um,

732
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:08,130
now after the June six
landings in Normandy, uh,

733
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,010
and, uh, you know, the troops are
also moving up, uh, after the,

734
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:15,270
the landings in the south or moving
up, uh, their own valley, you know,

735
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:20,200
killing lots of people on their
way. Uh, then, um, you know,

736
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,900
it became easier to resist.

737
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:25,290
And so therefore the temptation
after the war was to say, Oh,

738
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:28,470
you know what a seizure it, they lie.
You know, I was resisting and it wasn't,

739
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:31,890
I wasn't idea, Oh yes, your gun was
always ready, et Cetera, et cetera.

740
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:36,180
And everybody kind of jumped forward and
provide the, in the prefecture, uh, uh,

741
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,490
of the l dash there's, you
know, they have this big,

742
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:42,750
sort of a joyous celebration
when the town is,

743
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:43,890
is liberated,

744
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,220
and then they noticed some
of the resisters notice
they're all sorts of people

745
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,660
dressed up in fancy military
clothes and all of that,

746
00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:51,120
and had nothing to do
the resistance at all.

747
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,200
Some of them were trying to save their,
their skins, uh, because, uh, you know,

748
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:58,170
they had rather different sympathies
a few weeks ago before that,

749
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,120
where a few months before that,
as I said,

750
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:03,240
near our village or as a priest who
was laying up in the wall and shot down

751
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:06,630
because he had killed because
he had had day, ah, ah,

752
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,860
to lunch and was a fascist at sometime.
Earlier in,

753
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,830
in the period, uh, there
was about 24,000, um, uh,

754
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,750
McKee who were killed in the
liberation of France and in, in, in,

755
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,730
in Paris above all.
But in other cities as well,

756
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:28,050
you can walk along and you see
signs that say, you know, uh, ECA,

757
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:32,540
Tone Bay here fell on the
24th of August, 1944. So,

758
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:36,460
and so, uh, from one of
the resistance groups.

759
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,320
And occasionally you'll see a flower,

760
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:42,910
a new flowers put there by somebody
who remembers or somebody aware of the

761
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:46,480
collective memory or especially around
the prefecture of police in Paris.

762
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,970
I've always thought it was cruel.
This is a cynical,

763
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:51,820
but they should have put in some
of the fancier quarters of Paris.

764
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:56,800
And posse and places like that. Uh,
you know, you see a Collabo, hey,

765
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,700
uh, you know, Miss [inaudible],
uh, a madame, uh, you know, look,

766
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,840
goes into Kelechi shows, uh, uh, 1940,

767
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:10,000
1944, but that's not nice
and not very generous. Uh,

768
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:14,080
and,
and I make no apologies for it.

769
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,770
Um, there were, I mean, again,

770
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,120
just to end with these little,
I'll just end with this,

771
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,070
that at, at the time of the pup
home trial when pop home was,

772
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:31,990
was arguing, he says, well, I was a good
bureaucrat. My superiors liked what I did,

773
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:35,770
and I was protecting these other Jews
by sending away the hundreds, whom,

774
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,810
you know, I made possible their
departure from the Gao. Standish Hall.

775
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,560
There was another little story came along
and I didn't remember where I read it,

776
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:47,680
but there was a young woman who
worked in the SEC as a secretary,

777
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:52,540
I in the prefecture or,
or in the police or somewhere like that.

778
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,550
And she, um, because
of people like popcorn,

779
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,280
you had lists of all the people who
are Jews are all the people who were

780
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:05,050
communists in these, you'd
homed are in bold Dole, uh,

781
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:09,280
and, um, that these
things are kept in files.

782
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,140
But this is before the computer, the
quiet violence of the computer. Uh,

783
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:16,930
and these were lists
that were done by hand,

784
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:22,230
and she simply went in to
the drawers and rip them up,

785
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,860
ripped up the list, and
put the, the scrap paper,

786
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,740
not in the wastepaper basket,
but in her pocket,

787
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:34,660
and went out and deposited in the first
poo bell or garbage can that she found

788
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:39,430
heroic act choices and Vichy France.
It made you think,

789
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,110
it made you decide what to do.
