1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,240
Thanks.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,073
Um,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,470
as Professor [inaudible] said,

4
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm going to talk today about the French
Empire from 1871 the year that the

5
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,310
course begins to 1914,

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,020
which is the beginning of World War One.

7
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:13,810
Of course,

8
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,250
uh,

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,620
which is something that you'll
talk about if I'm not mistaken,

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,110
uh,

11
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,660
in the lecture right after this one.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,090
So I'm going to start the lecture with
a passage from a French novel called

13
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,370
Lumet flooded I math,

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:25,960
uh,

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,240
the master of the sea.

16
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,880
It was written by one vehicle,

17
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,630
Michelle,

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,640
the Boogie and published in 1900.

19
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,380
So right in the middle of the
period we're talking about,

20
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,960
the novel was about an army officer who
was so upset by the defeat at the hands

21
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:44,430
of Prussia and the loss of assessing the
hen that he leaves France to go serve

22
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,760
in a regiment in the Sudan
in the heart of west Africa.

23
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,220
At one point during the novel,

24
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,120
the young officer returns to France
and he meets an older general from his

25
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,170
father's generation.

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,390
So during their conversation,

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,560
the older general expresses some anger
that the officer's seemed to be more

28
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,530
concerned with adventuring in his words.

29
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:08,160
Then with recovering the land where
his father's generation had fallen,

30
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,430
the young officer replied to him,

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,713
this is a quote.

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,560
Are we to blame if the world around
us has changed and grown all out of

33
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,394
recognition,

34
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:18,971
diplomacy?

35
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:22,220
It used to be concerned with the
Mediterranean and the Bosphorus.

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,720
Now it has to do with China and the Congo.

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,490
The Great States of Europe are dividing
up the other continents of Africa and

38
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:33,330
Asia in the way they used to divide
up countries like Italy and Poland.

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,140
What used to be a European balance of
power is now a world balance of power and

40
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:42,150
any country which does not
wish to become less important,

41
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,410
must obtain as much new territory
as our rivals are doing.

42
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,500
It is through colonies.

43
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,901
Can Cute,

44
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,790
concluded the young officer that she,

45
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,310
we shall one day achieve
your life's ambition.

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,020
The ambition of the older general.

47
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,760
I give you my word of honor.

48
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:00,780
He said that you are mistaken in thinking
that they say ambition has died in our

49
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,614
hearts

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,860
during the period I'm talking about today.

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,040
The French empire quite literally exploded
and Empire that in 19 1871 had been

52
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,450
little more than parts of Algeria and a
military presence presence in parts of

53
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,284
North Africa,

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,370
Southeast Asia,

55
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,410
and a few small spits of land in the
Pacific and the Caribbean exploded to

56
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:25,620
include large swathes of
North Africa and West Africa.

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,810
Most of mainland Southeast Asia,

58
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,520
parts of the Middle East and territories
in the Pacific and the Caribbean as

59
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,210
well.

60
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,800
By the end of World War One.

61
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,290
And the French empire span 11 million
kilometers and a hundred million

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,573
inhabitants.

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,680
So just to put it in
the context of France,

64
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:47,130
that's twice as many people as lived
in metropolitan France at that time,

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,113
roughly.

66
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,860
So I chose the passage from the novel to
begin this lecture because it captures

67
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:57,150
what I think are the two central themes
in this period and French colonial

68
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:57,984
history.

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,380
Both the young officer in the older gen
in the novel are serving in the French

70
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,980
army because they are obsessed with
recovering the national strength and

71
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,840
prestige that France had lost,

72
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,570
the devastating defeat depression now.

73
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,930
But the older general thinks about
this in terms of recovering on SAS,

74
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,420
they'll hand in terms of
continental rivalries,

75
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,770
but the young officers sees Francis Road
to greatness in very different terms.

76
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,590
He sees it overseas outside of Europe.

77
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,490
So my first point is that in these decades
after 1871 French nationalism became

78
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:35,251
increasingly inseparable from the idea
of a large and strong colonial empire.

79
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,890
France had had colonies for a long time,

80
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,160
but the fusion of a more modern and mass
form of nationalism with colonialism

81
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,120
was new and French history to this period
and it was something that drove the

82
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:53,020
explosion of the French Empire that I
just described to its heights in the years

83
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,460
just after World War One.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,990
The second point that I want to make
about the novel is simply that it was a

85
00:03:58,991 --> 00:03:59,824
novel.

86
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,450
It was one of many novels written about
empire during this period and novels

87
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:08,500
were just one of the many forms of popular
culture that began to reflect Francis

88
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,970
growing presence overseas.

89
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,740
Indeed during the late 19th century
empire became something that more and more

90
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,900
French people experienced directly,

91
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,000
whether through popular
culture or sometimes in much
more active ways serving in

92
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,270
the army or navy or in
colonial administrations,

93
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,560
or even settling lens that had not been
part of France when those people were

94
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,394
born.

95
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,080
So what I would like you to take away
from this lecture is that during the third

96
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:39,220
republic empire became a central
part of French national identity.

97
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,260
Empire was something that all political
platforms in France discussed and took

98
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,094
positions on.

99
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,900
It was part of the idea of French
national greatness that citizens were

100
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,330
beginning to learn in the
schools of the republic.

101
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,570
It was in the national newspapers that
more and more people were reading and it

102
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,640
even for some became a
career and a way of life.

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,650
So in its many forms,

104
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,210
empire during this period became a
common experience for French people,

105
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,700
whether they were from
Brittany or from Burgundy,

106
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,380
from provost,

107
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,550
or the APP Dash.

108
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,443
In short,

109
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,440
empire was a central part
of making people French.

110
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,070
Although it was in the decades after
1871 that Francis colonial empire truly

111
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,660
became a part of national identity.

112
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,000
Empire had a long past and French history
during the 17th and 18th centuries.

113
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,780
France had territories in the Caribbean
and of course in North America,

114
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,650
although many of these were lost during
the era of the French Revolution,

115
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,910
one of the revolutions,

116
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:44,230
most powerful legacies was the idea
of a moral imperative to continue the

117
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,600
revolution beyond Francis borders.

118
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,583
In other words,

119
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,480
France had not only a right but a duty
to bring French civilization to the rest

120
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,314
of the world,

121
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,800
even if he isn't even as the revolution
raged in France at the close of the 18th

122
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,634
century,

123
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,600
the republic's armies had poured outward
into Europe to bring the rights of man

124
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,130
to the monarchies of the continent.

125
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,631
This continued,

126
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,740
of course with Napoleon who extended the
reach of the nation completely across

127
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,920
Europe before its hands froze
in the cold Russian planes.

128
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,530
Napoleon also believed,

129
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,521
and this is important,

130
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,980
that France was destined
to quote unquote civilized,

131
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,990
those who were not only not French,

132
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,610
but not European.

133
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,350
Napoleon attempted to colonize Egypt at
the turn of just at the turn of the 19th

134
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:32,351
century and his attempt to combined a
messianic belief in science and progress,

135
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,260
an absence of any real knowledge about
non western world and a predisposition

136
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:43,580
for the idea that non white
races were inferior to whites,

137
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:44,414
to Europeans.

138
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,340
And this was a potent combination of
nationalism with ideas about race and

139
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,910
civilization that would drive French
colonialism until its bitter end.

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,000
This combination came to be known in
French as the museum CVDs that feast,

141
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,450
the civilizing mission,

142
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,860
the idea that a Greco Roman
heritage Christianity,

143
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,480
the legacy of the enlightenment,

144
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,060
modern science capitalism,

145
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,290
that all these things made France
inherently superior and gave it a moral

146
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:16,880
responsibility to export these legacies
of its civilization to the less

147
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:17,714
fortunate.

148
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,040
So although France had a long history
of empire at the birth of the third

149
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:27,041
republic in 1871 the upheavals of many
revolutions and the Paris commune meant

150
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:33,200
that the overseas empire had been fairly
small for a long time and that it was

151
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,030
at that point pretty marginal in national
politics and culture in the years

152
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:39,890
before the French to defeat by Prussia,

153
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,700
the French government's control over
territorial expansion was actually pretty

154
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,534
limited.

155
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,720
The main urge to expand came
not from French politicians,

156
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,200
but often from soldiers and sailors in
far off places who were often prompted by

157
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:58,310
missionaries who urged intervention to
save souls or by businessmen who urged

158
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,960
intervention to make a quick fall.

159
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,720
Even the bulk of French expansion in
Algeria after 1830 Algeria was really

160
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:10,220
Francis major colony and the years and
for most of the 19th century even this

161
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:14,360
was largely the work of generals who
wave the flag and shot their rifles often

162
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,750
in direct opposition to the wishes
of national governments in Paris.

163
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,940
So at times it really seemed like the
French empire was little more than a giant

164
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,250
system of relief for the armed services.

165
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,370
As one a former colonial governor wrote,

166
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,540
what drove us to expand in faraway places
was a ball above all the need to find

167
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,490
something to occupy the army and the navy.

168
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,860
But this began to change in important way
as after 1871 in French politics after

169
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,610
the end of the disastrous
war with pressure.

170
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,960
You're overriding question for many was
how France could regain its place as a

171
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,890
national power,

172
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,080
as a great power among among Europe,

173
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,460
the war with Prussia had shown that
Germany was a nation on the and England's

174
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:57,690
dominance in world affairs,

175
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:58,800
especially its empire was,

176
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,670
was unquestioned.

177
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,830
As you all know by now,

178
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,870
politics in France during the 1870s and
the 1880s were tumultuous to say the

179
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:10,740
least as France hobbled
from one FAF to the next.

180
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,510
So critics attack the republic as
a cesspool of intrigue and scandal.

181
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
Aperiodic industrial downturns,

182
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,470
broad political challenges
from left and right as blown.

183
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,960
Chisholm and socialism both
threatened to overthrow the republic.

184
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,340
France also suffered from the lowest
birth way among western European nations.

185
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,470
So emasculated,

186
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,220
militarily,

187
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,731
slumping,

188
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,410
economically shrinking.

189
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,310
Demographically,

190
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,720
France appeared to many people to
be in a state of inevitable decline,

191
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,540
staring at the specter of national
stagnation and fading international

192
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,374
relevance.

193
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,070
Many luminaries of the young
third republic believed
that the key to recovering

194
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,610
Francis greatness lay in the
expansion of its colonial empire.

195
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,830
Perhaps the most famous of these
advocates of colonial expansion among the

196
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,480
political elite was June Fetty,

197
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,800
who was of course the famous advocate
of the Eco Lipid weekend in the battles

198
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:09,180
over that and the 1870s and eighties
eighties Betty's arguments for imperial

199
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:13,890
expansion in many ways encapsulate
French colonial ideology in the late 19th

200
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:14,724
century,

201
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,410
very believed in his,

202
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,240
in his words,

203
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,940
quote,

204
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,350
that colonial policy was the daughter
of industrial policy enrich states were

205
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:26,370
capitol abounds and accumulates where
the manufacturing system is undergoing

206
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,240
continual growth.

207
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,060
Export is an essential
factor in public prosperity.

208
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,673
In other words,

209
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,790
colonies were essential to
a strong national economy
and the rise of Germany and

210
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:40,500
even the rise of the United States and
Russia meant that France needed exclusive

211
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:44,550
access to new markets and sources for
raw materials that in the eyes of many

212
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:44,970
people,

213
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,970
only colonies could provide the closely
tied to these economic imperatives of

214
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:51,270
empire.

215
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,620
We're strategic ones,

216
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,380
rivalries between nations in Europe as
they often had in the past spilled out

217
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:03,300
into the rest of the world and a nation
that wished to survive had to compete.

218
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,210
This is Fetty again in today's Europe.

219
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,820
In this competition of the
many rivals who's power we are,

220
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,211
see,

221
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,350
we see growing around us.

222
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,830
A policy of abstention is very simply
the road to decadence in the times in

223
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,580
which we live nation's are only great
in accordance with the activities which

224
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,414
they develop,

225
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,430
exerting ourselves without action.

226
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,440
Regarding all expansion in Africa and
the Orient as a trap or an adventure to

227
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,131
live in this way,

228
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:29,881
believe me,

229
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:34,110
is to abdicate our position and to
tumble from the first to the third or the

230
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,790
fourth rank of nations.

231
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,150
Fetty also believed in what he called
the humanitarian and civilizing side of

232
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:42,984
the question.

233
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,543
In his words,

234
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,450
superior races have a right
visa vi inferior races he wrote,

235
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,830
but they also have a duty,

236
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,120
and this is echoing the language of,

237
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,350
of the French revolution almost directly.

238
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,690
They also have a duty
to bring civilization,

239
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,770
Western government,

240
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,783
education,

241
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,400
medicine and morals to other peoples.

242
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,710
So for men likes you to Fetty.

243
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,390
It was the greatness of the nation of
the French nation that made the expansion

244
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,770
of the French empire,

245
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,750
not only necessary but legitimate.

246
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,700
It was the colonial empire that would
save France from losing ground to its

247
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:20,170
rivals and that would help elevate the
cultures and the civilizations of the

248
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,640
peoples that France colonized.

249
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,670
So the 1880s politicians like fairly
brought Francis colonial ambitions into

250
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:30,460
national politics in
ways never seen before.

251
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,750
And you just a few years after national
political power swung decisively to the

252
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,584
Republicans.

253
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,390
In 1879 if Eddie's government launched
a campaign to try to jumpstart Francis

254
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:44,320
stagnating presence in Southeast Asia
by taking over the northern half of what

255
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:49,210
is now Vietnam was done called Tonkin
and the French had tried to take this on

256
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:49,931
several occasions,

257
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:54,910
but it failed on the pretext of defending
persecuted Vietnamese Catholics and

258
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,930
attacking pirates.

259
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,860
The French sent several companies of
soldiers north to attack the Capitol of

260
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,723
Hanoi.

261
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,571
The campaign,

262
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,430
was it just a little too ambitious?

263
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,811
The French captain,

264
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,461
a man named lead,

265
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:06,130
yeah.

266
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,190
Ended up with his head on a pike
staff in the middle of the city.

267
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,241
Yup.

268
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,890
This happens in places other than France.

269
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,380
Head's getting cut off
that he's aggressive.

270
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,350
Colonial expansion was,

271
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,380
was really very unpopular at first.

272
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,660
Josh Glam also accused him of high
treason and crowds outside shouted for

273
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:23,680
fatties head on a pike.

274
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,180
Staff next to leave.

275
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,014
Yes.

276
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,363
Nevertheless,

277
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:27,971
ferries,

278
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,600
insertion of colonial affairs onto
the national stage was a sign of the

279
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:35,140
prominence that empire would come to
play in national politics in the years to

280
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:35,974
come.

281
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,070
Just after fatties demise
in national politics,

282
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,570
French colonial activity began to expand
at a rapid rate as the third republic

283
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:46,570
race to compete with the British
and the Germans and the Dutch.

284
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,850
By the 1890s debates over colonial
policy had become a standard part of

285
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:55,930
discussions and the Chamber of deputies
and every government after Jude failures

286
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,200
presided over a steadily
expanding colonial empire.

287
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,740
This new prominence of colonial issues
in French national politics was in many

288
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:10,480
ways due to the activities of a growing
and very influential colonial lobby in

289
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,350
French society.

290
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,001
In many ways,

291
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:17,080
it was this colonial lobby that was most
responsible for imagining and spreading

292
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:21,280
the idea that national greatness was
closely tied to colonial expansion.

293
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,190
So what was this colonial lobby?

294
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,560
I want to emphasize that it was not a
single organization or formal movement.

295
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,880
It really was more a large and
very diverse group of end of,

296
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,451
uh,

297
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:39,260
of individuals and associations who put
forward the case for colonial expansion

298
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,390
and in many different ways,

299
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,780
the colonial lobby was not organized
by an executive committee and had no

300
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:51,190
organized sections or no clearly
defined program or electoral platform.

301
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,010
It was far beyond the vocal colonial
activists or advocates in the Chamber of

302
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,460
Deputies.

303
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,020
It included men like the informal group
of explorers and geographers who met

304
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:07,610
every week in Paris at the [inaudible]
to share their fascination with exotic

305
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:12,380
places and to talk about
how the government might be
able to better promote and

306
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,330
support these voyages of exploration.

307
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,850
The colonial lobby included shipbuilders
and railway magnates and factory

308
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:20,684
owners,

309
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,880
people who believe that the colonies were,

310
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,540
were the way to where the path
to to untold material wealth.

311
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,550
It included missionaries who saw in the
quote unquote heathen races of Africa

312
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,384
and Asia,

313
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,990
a potential source for converts to replace
the French who were starting to skip

314
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:40,991
church and starting to use birth
control and greater numbers and included

315
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:45,080
writers and journalists for whom
the culinary is the colonies were,

316
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:45,341
were,

317
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:46,820
were a little more than good copy.

318
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,110
So those are made up the colonial
lobby warrant United at all by the same

319
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:51,944
interests.

320
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,610
But it was precisely this diversity of
their interests that shows how compelling

321
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:59,030
empire is becoming for so many
different parts of French society.

322
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,910
So indeed during the 1880s and 1890s
the assumption increasingly became that

323
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,100
through the French
colonies served the nation.

324
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:11,180
They serve the nation as a whole in ways
that went further and further beyond

325
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,730
economic and geostrategic necessities.

326
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,340
Many parts of French society increasingly
came to see empire as a solution to

327
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:20,480
national problems.

328
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,760
In the words of the historian Glen,

329
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,594
Gwendolyn Wright,

330
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,980
the colonies were quote unquote,

331
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:27,110
a laboratory of modernity.

332
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,270
There were places to further and
protect the destiny of the nation,

333
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:36,950
literally quite literally through
experiments in nation building before the

334
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:37,784
third republic,

335
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,050
colonies had been seen really as the
social value of colonies was little more

336
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,390
than than seen as,

337
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:46,310
as getting rid of people that the
state considered to be undesirable.

338
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,570
Um,

339
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,400
the French penal colony in New Caledonia,

340
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:50,570
it was a good example of this.

341
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,810
We're over 4,000 of the community had
been sent in 1871 but toward the end of

342
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:56,631
the century,

343
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:57,650
this began to change.

344
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,780
Social reformers began to see the
colonies as a potential home for landless

345
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:03,530
peasants,

346
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,460
for the unemployed,

347
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,770
or even for orphans who
had no home in France.

348
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,390
In other words,

349
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,100
colonies were places that could serve
to solve the nation's problems and not

350
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:15,140
merely locked them up
and throw away the key.

351
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,400
French engineers and social planners
came to see the empire as a really a vast

352
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,040
worksite where new forms of
architecture and urban planning,

353
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:25,971
uh,

354
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:26,200
could,

355
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,360
could be carried out places where
experiments could be carried out to help

356
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,260
benefit France.

357
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,790
You definitely Otay was a famous
French military officer and future

358
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,650
administrator in the colony of Morocco.

359
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,630
He insisted that North Africa,

360
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:39,770
West for France quote,

361
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,320
what the Far West is for America,

362
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,730
an excellent testing ground for
creating new energy rejuvenation.

363
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,750
And for [inaudible],

364
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,040
the French military likewise saw colonies
as a training ground where the army

365
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,880
and the navy could protect and
expand Frances overseas interests.

366
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,270
And in doing so could learn to
better defend the nation at home.

367
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,080
So as empire became a more important
part of French national debates,

368
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,820
it also started to become an increasingly
central part of popular culture and

369
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:12,660
life in France,

370
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,290
schoolchildren began reading
about colonies in textbooks.

371
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,290
One directive from the
Ministry of Education.

372
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,460
Read that quote.

373
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,660
It must not be forgotten that France is
a world power which possesses colonies

374
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:25,920
in all parts of the earth.

375
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,880
Let us not have any scruples
about retaining for two years,

376
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:30,571
just two years.

377
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,330
The attention of French youth on France.

378
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,920
Let us give them as rich an image as
possible for their country of the mother

379
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,110
country and her distant daughters.

380
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,880
French citizens already out of school
began to learn about the empire in

381
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:45,714
different ways.

382
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,980
For example,

383
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,760
the urban middle classes who visited the
Museum of man or the Museum of natural

384
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,760
history in Paris began to
see collections of art,

385
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,990
of clothing and household objects and
other things collected in the French

386
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:02,160
empire by scientific societies that
were brought back to Paris to be put on

387
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:02,994
display.

388
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,470
The colonies were put on display
and even more spectacular fashion at

389
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:09,030
international expositions,

390
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,300
which were held in Paris in 1878 1889
and 1900 the exposition of 1900 which

391
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:21,510
quite literally took over the city of
Paris and that exposition colonies were

392
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:25,440
for the first time given their own
separate exhibition grounds in the gardens

393
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:26,850
behind the Takata Hook Palace.

394
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:30,200
Across the sin from the
Eiffel Tower and we're quote,

395
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,130
set apart enough by the river to permit
the creation of an atmosphere different

396
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,150
from the rest of the fair.

397
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Entire colonial buildings were transported
to Paris and rebuilt colonial work.

398
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:45,030
Men were brought to France to execute
the detail and decorative work in the

399
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,910
buildings and they remained
there throughout the exhibition,

400
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:52,390
posing as residents and merchants in
the reconstructed villages and bizarres

401
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,350
from far away mosques,

402
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:56,070
temples,

403
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,570
archeological discoveries,

404
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,291
dancers,

405
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:58,711
music,

406
00:19:58,711 --> 00:19:59,544
and food.

407
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,810
All were brought to create
a self contained world
that attempted to represent

408
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,750
Frances growing empire to
the average French person.

409
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,270
The empire was more than a periodic
occasion for spectical colony.

410
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:16,470
Slowly but surely crept into the
most mundane forms of everyday life.

411
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,150
Readers of French newspapers,

412
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:18,984
for example,

413
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,371
like the put usual,

414
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:23,250
not read more and more about
the French empire every day.

415
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,084
As it grew.

416
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,441
For the most part,

417
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:29,010
articles focused on military encounters
and on the French who fought in them.

418
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,780
African or Asian opponents merely filled
the need in these stories for an evil

419
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:34,800
or a savage enemy.

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,450
There were backdrop for main characters
in a drama that unfolded every day.

421
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,480
A story that more and more
Frenchmen love to follow.

422
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,290
Other readers read novels that
evoked the exotically different,

423
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,540
the strange customs of natives,

424
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,530
the bright colors and the pungent odor
is overseas and the lure of the desert,

425
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,580
or if the jungle Pierre,

426
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,380
hello t,

427
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,150
who was one of the most
famous of these writers,

428
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,050
wrote panoramas of colonial life
that were packed with adventure,

429
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,183
with danger,

430
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,001
with sex,

431
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,290
and with local color,

432
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,153
quote unquote,

433
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,740
in which hardy Frenchmen
lived the rough life,

434
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,090
the sensual pleasures,

435
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:12,400
and the fighting spirit of the empire.

436
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,190
Artists like Paul Gauguin and all
he Matisse began painting Levantine,

437
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,650
Harems and souks African
villages and jungles,

438
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,110
temples in Indochina and native life.

439
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,040
Throughout the empire,

440
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,360
colonies were a rich source of subjects
for the growing medium of photography.

441
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,580
Photographers liked photographing the
rice patties and the Mekong River Buddhist

442
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:35,020
monks and saffron robes,

443
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,730
mysterious Muslim women behind
veils and cannibals with spears.

444
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,970
These images were reproduced
in books and newspapers,

445
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,103
postcards,

446
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,100
and other places.

447
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,780
The French encountered an empire in
many other ways in their daily lives.

448
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,750
Colonial influences began
to be heard in music.

449
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:53,584
For example,

450
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,300
cafe and dance hall goers
heard songs like my Beltone.

451
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:00,700
[inaudible] was about a
Frenchman's Vietnamese concubine.

452
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,141
I can't resist.

453
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:02,974
I'm going to read it.

454
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,513
Not Too

455
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,663
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

456
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,583
[inaudible] [inaudible]

457
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,293
[inaudible] [inaudible]

458
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,253
[inaudible] [inaudible]

459
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,003
[inaudible] [inaudible]

460
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,550
don't you here at your window.

461
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,420
He who loves you,

462
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:28,570
your quartermaster and back
from Tonkin where I finished.

463
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,561
Happy to see you.

464
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:30,394
My darling.

465
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,190
I've left my beautiful Dunkin was for you.

466
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:33,930
My charming,

467
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,790
false wise.

468
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,930
You are the most beautiful of the aisle,

469
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,011
far from you.

470
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:40,240
I was not at peace.

471
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,300
More bourgeois music lovers
hoard orchestral works by
composers like cause I've

472
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:49,750
had in Debussy who were fascinated
by the sounds of the Orient.

473
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,040
The colonies also came
to suggest new fashions,

474
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,510
oriental silks and 17 frocks popular
in women's clothing in the early 20th

475
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,510
century owed much to this
fascination with the exotic,

476
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,300
even the goods that people
bought increasingly evoked
the colonies often through

477
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,134
advertising.

478
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,800
One of the most famous
French advertisements ever,

479
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,813
for example,

480
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,560
is the publicity for Ben and Ya.

481
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,430
A sweet powdered beverage made from
bananas that when mixed with milk makes a

482
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,264
breakfast food.

483
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,430
The yellow banana bucks featured a
derogatory caricature of a smiling African

484
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,770
uttering the pigeon
Frisch craze in French.

485
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,030
You have wound by Nina.

486
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,020
Good stuff,

487
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,853
but then yeah,

488
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,290
things like this brought the empire all
the way to the breakfast tables of many

489
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,130
French families.

490
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,510
French people even began to
encounter the empire in church.

491
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,260
The last third of the 19th century was
a time of intense Catholic missionary

492
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:46,880
activity outside of France,

493
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:50,090
usually in the French colonies
and church goers in France.

494
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,070
Listen to the appeals of their priests,

495
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,420
the donate money to help
a French missionary from
their defacto mall away and

496
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:56,871
far off.

497
00:23:56,871 --> 00:24:01,871
Indochina or Senegal replace a little
bamboo or Straw chapel with a proper brick

498
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,404
church.

499
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,123
Of course,

500
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,300
there was no better way to
experience or more intense way,

501
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:11,631
I would say,

502
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:14,600
to experience empire than
to actually go there.

503
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,120
And then late 19th century,

504
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,390
more and more French people that exactly
that until the 1880s and the 1890s

505
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,660
there were relatively few French
people in territories that the French

506
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,540
controlled is colonies with
the exception again of Algeria,

507
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,630
which had about 300,000 French settlers
in 1871 this really wasn't exception.

508
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,360
Um,

509
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,040
even by the 1880s or 1890s,

510
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:42,041
places like Indochina only had probably
between 20 and 30,000 at the most,

511
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,243
maybe even less.

512
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,410
So at first,

513
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:48,830
many of these French colonies had little
more than administrators' garrisons of

514
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:53,360
troops and some explorers and missionaries
beating the bush for riches or for

515
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,194
souls.

516
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,550
Gradually,

517
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,000
however,

518
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,360
more and more French citizens
came to overseas territories,

519
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,530
not for adventure,

520
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,670
but just to make a living.

521
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,570
The part of French society most
immediately affected of course,

522
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:10,070
was the military which
went to the colonies in
increasingly greater numbers as

523
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:15,071
the empire and resistance to it spread
soldiers and the empire risked long sea

524
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:21,050
journeys and tropical diseases
and miserable pay for the
risk and the adventure

525
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,660
that they thought that
they might find over there.

526
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,341
Missionaries to,

527
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:25,911
as I mentioned,

528
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:28,040
when overseas more and more
toward the end of the century,

529
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,810
to try to find converts that they weren't
finding in France apart from soldiers

530
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,890
and traders and missionaries were
settlers who increasingly went to the

531
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:37,700
colonies,

532
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,810
not for a tour of duty,

533
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,980
but they went there to stay.

534
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,830
Settlers were often committed to the
colonies for life that gave up the

535
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,420
resources they possessed at home.

536
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,890
They took to the colonies,

537
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:52,370
whatever capital and whatever possessions
they could get and they could carry

538
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:53,204
with them.

539
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,300
The colonies were not hospitable places,

540
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,160
and needless to say,

541
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,850
remoteness from France and relatives,

542
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,100
tropical diseases in a very understandable
hostility of indigenous populations.

543
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:08,120
We're a major deterrent for many people.

544
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,943
However,

545
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,450
a number of French men and women
did dare a new life in the Maghreb,

546
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,850
in Indochina or in West Africa.

547
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,100
Many were drawn by the inducements of
people who owned large tracts of land and

548
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,420
who needed people to work in,

549
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,820
cultivate this land to
help them turn a profit.

550
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,240
When there weren't enough Frenchmen,

551
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,910
landowners didn't hesitate to populate
their lands with non-French Europeans

552
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,200
like Italian and Spanish,

553
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,090
some of whom were also in the colonies.

554
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:38,540
As members of the famous
international military force,

555
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,880
the lesion with Tom Shia foreign legion.

556
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,580
As the French empire grew,

557
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,860
life in the empire became
more slowly more regularized.

558
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,820
The French government began to replace
soldiers and sailors with administrators

559
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,930
who exercise the will of the state.

560
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,800
These administrators' held
responsibility for collecting taxes,

561
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,450
for overseeing spending,

562
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:04,920
and for keeping law and order,

563
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,760
which often meant authorizing violence
against those who resisted the spread of

564
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,630
the French empire.

565
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,641
Increasingly,

566
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,460
these administrators came not
from the ranks of the military,

567
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,660
but from new schools founded in France
to train people for service and the

568
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:19,494
empire.

569
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,560
One of the most famous of these was the
[inaudible] founded in 1887 which taught

570
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:28,680
future administrators a little bit about
the language and the culture of the

571
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,240
place that they were being sent,

572
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,050
as well as the basics of the position
that they were going to fill when they

573
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:34,884
were over there.

574
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,870
The French government also did its best
to draw professionals to newly acquired

575
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:42,090
territory's lawyers,

576
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,110
doctors,

577
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,943
engineers,

578
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,843
surveyors.

579
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,530
All of these were much needed in,

580
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:46,731
in,

581
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,940
in the empire and Paris offered subsidies
to get qualified candidates to take a

582
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,290
post overseas.

583
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,810
As the empire continued to grow,

584
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,610
more and more women came to live in these
places that had for a long time been

585
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,890
perceived as much too dangerous for them.

586
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,863
In many ways,

587
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,280
the domesticity that the arrival of women
brought to French life in the colonies

588
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,690
was the clearest sign of the,

589
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:15,691
the idea of domesticating and even taming
French colonies and integrating them

590
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,790
into the sphere of greater France.

591
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,860
Places that had once been considered too
dangerous for women became places where

592
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,680
women eager to Mary
went to find a husband,

593
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,060
a book called [inaudible].

594
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,280
The woman in the colonies published in
1900 assured interested women that the

595
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:38,170
empire could provide a
hospitable home quote.

596
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,530
A woman who arrives in don't count,

597
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,611
for example,

598
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:42,720
is sure of success.

599
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,130
There are no women in,

600
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:44,391
in,

601
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,380
in Tonkin who failed to marry.

602
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,750
There were of course women who did not
go to the colonies simply for marriage.

603
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,730
And even those who did found themselves
pushed out of normal social expectations

604
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:58,470
by the necessities of colonial life.

605
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,390
Many women in the colonies,

606
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:01,224
for example,

607
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:05,340
we're drawn into humanitarian work
at hospitals or in dispensaries are

608
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:06,210
orphanages,

609
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,040
which is ironic in light of the positions
that many of their husbands held in

610
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,950
the colonial administration doing work
that couldn't exactly be described as

611
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:15,090
humanitarian of course.

612
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,650
So just to put the expansion of the
French population in the colonies and the

613
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,000
context of one place,

614
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,650
let me just mention the Algerian town
of antibiotic during this period before

615
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:30,651
the French conquest and about
had a population of about
4,000 Arabs and Berbers,

616
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:33,330
some Turks and a fairly
large Jewish population.

617
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,090
The French captured on about fairly
early in 1832 but for many years,

618
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:43,390
the European population of the city was
really little more than the soldiers who

619
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:45,340
kept control of the city.

620
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,800
By the mid 1840s however,

621
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,990
there were 5,000 Europeans at
times went by as time went by,

622
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,430
mines and forests in that area became
an attractive source of employment for

623
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,120
people.

624
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,800
A railway line was built and the city
and for infrastructure slowly grew.

625
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,810
In fact,

626
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,170
the city was also at that
time renamed Boone I,

627
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,650
transient population of,

628
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
of Europeans,

629
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,270
mostly French evolved into
a rooted and stable one.

630
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,230
By the 1890s Europeans born in Boone,

631
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,700
outnumbered migrants from overseas and
French citizens formed the majority of

632
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:22,750
the residents of the city.

633
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,150
Algeria was by far,

634
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:28,700
of course the French colony with
the largest friends population.

635
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,320
But the others grew and grew during this
time and by World War One and it would

636
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:36,980
be almost a half a million French
citizens scattered throughout the French

637
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:37,814
empire.

638
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,560
So what was life like for these people?

639
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:48,300
Few men and women in the empire had lives
that were as exciting or as romantic

640
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,260
as the newspapers and popular songs
made the colonial experience out to be

641
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,240
despite being drawn to the empire by
the promise of adventure and prosperity.

642
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,950
Few people who went over
there found either disease,

643
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,050
took a large toll on French
people in the colonies,

644
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,410
many of whom fell victim
to malaria or yellow fever.

645
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,460
Dang gay fever.

646
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,210
Leprosy before they had spent
much time in the colony at all.

647
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,410
Attack was often always a concern.

648
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:16,831
In fact,

649
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:19,530
as we're accidents and deserts or jungles,

650
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,950
medical care in the colonies
was often pretty inadequate.

651
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,410
Working conditions were harsh.

652
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,521
Most settlers had,

653
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:27,001
for example,

654
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,800
had to build and maintain
their own houses,

655
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,160
clear forests or brush and
set up their own shops.

656
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,350
Colonial goods,

657
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,760
we're often susceptible
to rapidly changing market
conditions and many colonists

658
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:39,594
ended up in debt.

659
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,520
Many benefits offered by the French state
to its citizens didn't extend to the

660
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:49,521
empire and subsidies that people had
received to move to Algeria or to Morocco.

661
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,150
We're quickly exhausted.

662
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,200
Social life in the colonies
was pretty limited.

663
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,010
Bigger cities had theaters and some of
the art galleries and concert halls,

664
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:00,000
but in most places,

665
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,600
French citizens might spend months
without the side of another European.

666
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,400
Most of the French who lived in colonies
never abandoned the stereotypical

667
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:10,710
attitudes that they had
about their own superiority.

668
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,140
And these attitudes,

669
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:13,501
of course,

670
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:17,310
we're often reinforced by French laws
and institutions that gave whites more

671
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,290
privileges than indigenous populations.

672
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,633
For the most part,

673
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,410
life was really quite separate,

674
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,310
uh,

675
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:23,910
between,

676
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,690
between whites and other
European neighborhoods,

677
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:27,961
again,

678
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:29,940
had a town hall theater shops,

679
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:31,680
lining shaded streets and cafes.

680
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:36,000
Very often indigenous peoples
were separated from the
French by social barriers

681
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:37,050
and by physical barriers.

682
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:39,090
Sometimes markets and shops,

683
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,830
mosques and pagodas are often
apart from French colonial life.

684
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,420
So taking us now to world war one,

685
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,980
when the guns of August began to roar in,

686
00:32:50,981 --> 00:32:52,310
in August,

687
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,520
1914,

688
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,040
the colonial empire was
very near its height.

689
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,550
Paris controlled the second
largest empire in the world,

690
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,930
second only to Britain's during the
40 years before the first world war.

691
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,950
The empire span these vast swathes of
north and west Africa and Southeast Asia,

692
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,170
enormous islands like Madagascar,

693
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,330
famous cities like Timbuktu,

694
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,400
and they'd even contain parts of India.

695
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,270
The crown jewel of the empire of
their fiercest national rival.

696
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,070
Colonial promoters lauded the benefits
of an empire that they said provided

697
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:23,270
international prestige,

698
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,520
secure place for investments,

699
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,230
a market for French products,

700
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,820
a source for raw materials,

701
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,020
and a reserve army of soldiers
and become a popular part of,

702
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,740
of,

703
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,640
of popular culture,

704
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:38,360
of daily life and even a career
for many French men and women.

705
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,303
In short,

706
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,880
empire had become a fundamental part of
the national identity and in some ways

707
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,340
the national hubris then
sweeping through France,

708
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,390
not only France,

709
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,130
but the rest of Europe as well.

710
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Just as many in France cheered at the
declaration of war on Germany in 1914

711
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,710
we've no idea of what was to come.

712
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,070
Few French people in 1914 could see
any reason to think that anything might

713
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:11,360
threaten this eternal marriage between
France and it's outposts overseas between

714
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:15,680
the brave beneficence purveyors of French
civilization and the graceful natives

715
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,520
under French rule.

716
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,441
For many people.

717
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:23,270
France had recovered completely from its
devastating defeat in 1871 and from the

718
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:28,271
loss of assessed Lohan to once again
become a powerful nation empire.

719
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,110
Again.

720
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,320
Empire had been a central
part of this national revival.

721
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,370
As one member of the colonial
lobby said in 1912 quote,

722
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,460
it may be said that it
was colonial expansion,

723
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,770
which coming as it did just after the
events of 1871 brought the renewal of

724
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:46,604
France.

725
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,940
It was on the day that France
became a colonial power again.

726
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:55,220
That became once more conscious of her
vitality and her strength and was able to

727
00:34:55,221 --> 00:35:00,221
resume her role in the concert of
Europe and on the world stage today,

728
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,970
1912 when that role is becoming so
important again in the concert of Europe,

729
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,800
when France finds herself in all parts
of the world on a footing with the

730
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,120
greatest European powers,

731
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,040
we may indeed be proud.

732
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,570
We may indeed be proud of the colonial
work which France has performed.

733
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,940
What was there to be proud of?

734
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:20,930
Again,

735
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,130
this idea of national expansion and
national greatness intimately tied to the

736
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,940
perceived positives benefits of
bringing French civilization abroad.

737
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,210
A member of the Chamber of Deputies
in fact answered this question,

738
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,350
what was there to be proud of?

739
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,590
What nobler or more inspiring work?

740
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,830
Good one find colonizing means coming in
touch with new races and civilizations

741
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,430
and it means achieving the noblest
type of fellowship for any form of

742
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:51,540
colonization which did not successfully
successfully seek to increase the

743
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,290
dignity,

744
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,160
the moral standards and the wellbeing
of the colonized people would be

745
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:59,910
uncivilized and unworthy of
a great nation and quote,

746
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,850
of course not all was well in the empire.

747
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,280
I focused in this lecture so far on the
place of the empire in domestic politics

748
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,114
and culture,

749
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,830
so I haven't spoken all that much about
the effect that French colonization had

750
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,350
on the lives of those in the colonies.

751
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,240
Needless to say,

752
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,800
the realities of empire did not often
coincide with as you'd failures,

753
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,170
promises to spread the
spread the best of friends,

754
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,004
civilization,

755
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,640
nor did it coincide with the
character of the smiling,

756
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,520
graceful African and the property at
popular press or on the front of the ban.

757
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:36,720
Yeah,

758
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,980
box on the breakfast table.

759
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,540
Empire.

760
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,220
Of course,

761
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,880
it was much more complicated than that.

762
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,750
A few people accepted the rise of
French power without a struggle,

763
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,030
but few could match the technological
advantage advantages then enjoyed by the

764
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,770
French military and the navy.

765
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,140
As the French empire spread,

766
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,530
soldiers and sailors put down one
resistance movement after another,

767
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,970
usually with uncompromising brutality
and often with very high death tolls.

768
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,610
As French colonial administrations,

769
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,930
legal systems,

770
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,640
police forces replaced the army
and the navy military repression.

771
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,820
What?

772
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,650
What had been military repression took
more of the character of an occupation

773
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,050
dressed up as integration,

774
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,780
the integration of the colonies
into the French nation.

775
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,980
French structures of authority enforced
to inequality between French and other

776
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:30,780
races and justified the exploitation of
resources and the political repression

777
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,520
that really where the realities of
everyday life for most of French colonial

778
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:36,354
subjects

779
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,483
cracks.

780
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,900
By 1914 however,

781
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,120
cracks began to appear in this edifice.

782
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,780
Not everybody had been swept
up by Francis colonial dreams,

783
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,410
and as the realities of empire
became more and more apparent,

784
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,750
a small anti-colonial lobby and France
began to grow like their counterparts in

785
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:55,620
the colonial lobby,

786
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,120
anti colonialists opposed French
expansion for a number of reasons.

787
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,763
For some people,

788
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,880
French colonial adventures seemed a
dangerous overextension of French power.

789
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,130
Some people wondered how useful these
dense jungles and barren deserts could

790
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:12,450
possibly be to France,

791
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,070
especially when it became clear that a
lot of the financial returns on colonial

792
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:20,730
expansion that had been expected
did not come to match these initial

793
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,564
projections.

794
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,730
Some people began to criticize
colonial expansion for moral reasons,

795
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,240
protesting the growing
incidences of colonial barbarity.

796
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,280
To give one example at one public protest
in 1906 the famous intellectual and

797
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:41,281
novelist and a total foss thundered
whites do not communicate with blacks or

798
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:44,980
yellow people except to
windsurf or massacre them.

799
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,530
The people whom we call barbarians.

800
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,650
No us only through our own crimes.

801
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,900
It is our responsibility as Frenchmen to
denounce the crimes being committed in

802
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:59,140
our name and quote [inaudible],

803
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,030
the leader of the Socialist Party went
even further refuting the myth of the

804
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:07,870
civilizing mission of the
[inaudible] in this case in Morocco.

805
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,831
Joe Has said,

806
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:09,664
quote,

807
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,950
there existed before the French takeover.

808
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm Moroccan civilization capable
of the necessary transformation,

809
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,460
capable of evolution and progress.

810
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,030
A civil lays a civilization
both ancient and modern,

811
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,310
and there was a seed for the future.

812
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,300
There was a hope,

813
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,430
and let me say that I cannot pardon those
who have crushed this hope for Pacific

814
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,690
and human progress.

815
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:36,930
African civilization by all sorts of
roses and by the brutality of conquest and

816
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,541
quote during the 1920s in 1930s anti
colonialism would become a more powerful

817
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,040
force in French politics.

818
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,160
Grouping together some
socialists and communists,

819
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,560
some voices within the
French Catholic Church,

820
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,060
journalists and writers and a number of
intellectuals and avant garde artists,

821
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,040
a ladder of whom would famously organized
an anti-colonial counter exposition

822
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,700
during the famous 1931
colonial exposition in Venice.

823
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:08,701
Then in 1900 and Paris there had been
no similar anti-colonial exposition.

824
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,343
However,

825
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,450
and I want to underscore this,

826
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,100
it was not the French themselves who
would eventually succeed in crumbling the

827
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:23,101
imperial edifice built over
so many generations when
the French colonial empire

828
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:27,160
eventually expired in 1962
when the French left Algeria,

829
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,570
it did so first and foremost because of
the many forms of resistance organized

830
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:34,330
and carried out by those
who lived under it's yolk.

831
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,060
That's another topic for another lecture,

832
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,260
but what I want to say here is sort of
in conclusion is that the first world war

833
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,940
was in many ways the beginning of the
end for the French colonial empire.

834
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,920
It was a tipping point after which
these myths underpinning French rural,

835
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,630
we're no longer sustainable.

836
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:53,910
These are,

837
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,310
they'd been very powerful
myths before World War One,

838
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,540
many in the colonized world had
actually asked themselves whether French

839
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,150
civilization might in fact
be superior to their own.

840
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,360
The French had arrived with technological
advantages that many in the colonized

841
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,310
world did not have,

842
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,490
and that achieved military and
political control with few numbers.

843
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,103
For some people,

844
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,310
it did seem for a time that what the
French were saying about the missile and

845
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,620
CBDS,

846
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,280
that case the civilizing mission
might actually in fact be true.

847
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,130
But for many of these people,

848
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,150
World War One was a
revelation during the war,

849
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,560
nearly half a million colonial subjects
were conscripted or even volunteered,

850
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:37,010
and many of them did to don the BW blue
uniform of the [inaudible] and to fight

851
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:37,844
for France,

852
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,070
many others came to the Metropol to
work in shipyards are in factories.

853
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,343
Those who came,

854
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,910
saw poverty.

855
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,290
They saw deep rifts in French
society over the place of religion,

856
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,610
uh,

857
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,870
over politics.

858
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,280
And most importantly,

859
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,870
they saw their omnipotent colonial masters
in a war that was literally ripping

860
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:01,340
French civilization apart.

861
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,180
Although those who came to
France to fight or to work,

862
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,490
we're very small minority
of colonial subjects.

863
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,880
The echoes of the guns of
August reverberated worldwide
and for countless people

864
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,030
throughout the empire.

865
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,010
The Great War showed that France,

866
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,300
for all its power,

867
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,080
did not and could not correspond
to its own colonial myths.

868
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:27,650
This in the minds of other races would
write the governor general of Indochina

869
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:30,020
in 1931 in the minds of other races,

870
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,030
the war delta terrible blow to the
moral standing of a civilization which

871
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:37,700
Europeans claimed with
pride to be superior,

872
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,940
yet in whose name European spent more
than four years savagely killing each

873
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:43,874
other.

874
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,120
Europe's prestige had
been greatly compromised.

875
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,280
It has long been commonplace to contrast
European greatness with Asian or

876
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,390
African decadence.

877
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,450
The contrast now seems to be reversed.

878
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,371
Indeed,

879
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:02,270
empire would have a very different
relationship to national identity in the

880
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,900
years after world war one for
growing numbers of people in France,

881
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,440
empire slowly came to seem
too difficult to maintain.

882
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,880
Too expensive,

883
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:15,860
especially during the lean years of the
Depression in the 1930s and perhaps for

884
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:17,690
many even immoral,

885
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,480
what had been a point of unification in
France slowly turned into a source for

886
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:25,130
political and cultural tension,

887
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,790
but the opposite was true or
the Francis of the places,

888
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,830
places that France had colonized.

889
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:36,220
Indeed during the 1920s and 1930s
national identities will be formed outside

890
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:36,831
France,

891
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,310
throughout the French empire in
opposition to the French colonial project.

892
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,900
As anti-colonial activists laid the
roots for liberation movements that would

893
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:48,590
ultimately tear down the French colonial
empire in the years after the Second

894
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:49,424
World War.

895
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,380
And that's a subject for another lecture.

896
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,460
Thanks very much.
