1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,920
I have taken my favorite mid term story,
maybe one or two.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,030
Have you heard this before?

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,470
The point of this is that you don't
screw around with midterms because people

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,160
put their game faces on. You're going
to have your game face this on a Monday.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,170
But maybe 10 years ago,

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,860
somebody in the first half of this
class raised their hand as um,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,920
you know, the day before the
lecture, before the midterm
said, oddly enough, what,

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,200
uh,
what language will the midterm Ben,

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,670
and this is before we had French speaking
sections. So I mean, I don't know,

10
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,210
you ask a question that it was fairly
silly question to give a fairly silly

11
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:41,010
answers. So I said Croatian I, and
um, so then I started thinking, well,

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:43,200
I'll play a little joke on
him. Ha ha ha. You know,

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,340
don't screw around with midterms.

14
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:48,510
And so I have a colleague who is
Croatian and so I made up the following

15
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:53,130
question, which he translated in
the Croatian. And so the test,

16
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:56,280
you come into the tasks and you get
your basic piece of paper with the,

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,910
it says the answer,
one of two of the following two questions.

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,270
And there's a third question in Croatia
with a translation by evil bonnets.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,880
And the question was mine,
I take full credit or discredit for this.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,420
The question was the population
of Paris in 1831 was 630,000,

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,030
uh, 721 people, um,

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,210
name these people and in, in, in,

23
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,100
in a second,
in a second column,

24
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,620
a list those who own more
than one apartment. Um,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,840
so if you've got a question said
the population of Paris was 630,000,

26
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:41,070
731 name these people,
would you answer that question?

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,580
Three people did. So you have to
think, what have they been drinking?

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,990
What have they been smoking?
And so what do we do?

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm screwing around with a midterm
and we have three blue books answering

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,260
question number three in Croatian
not responding in Croatia.

31
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,620
And that would be extra credit. Uh,
and the first person says, well,

32
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:07,260
I've been logically enough people.
You must, what people must panic.

33
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,660
I must've done this too when I showed
up late for midterms or whatever,

34
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,560
if I remember to go, uh, you know, you
just, you panic and you start writing.

35
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,580
And the first person that
said, well, you know,

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,640
Miriam and he's real interested
in social geography. So roller,

37
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:23,160
a pretty coherent essay about how the
rich people live in the west and the poor

38
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:27,690
people live in the east and the wealthier
people in the center and the poor

39
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,380
people in the periphery. So I mean,
so we graded that as a, as a, as a,

40
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:35,910
as a real answer person.
Number two takes pen.

41
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,860
I remember male or female person number
two takes pen and starts writing a

42
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,430
column.
I'll buy za zoo include,

43
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,700
I'll buy sa John [inaudible],
outbound Isa,

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,850
CSEC gay rights, names, rights,

45
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,640
French names sitting there for,

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,740
for 45 minutes writing names.

47
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,760
What do you do with that? Uh, I mean,

48
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,000
I called psychiatric surface as
I, I don't know, I get to say,

49
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,950
I got to do with this stuff.
You know, I this crap.

50
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,510
And so the third person a
says question number three,

51
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,640
and then just sort of
just drooled all over the,

52
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,480
all over the blue book for about
the next half hour, you know.

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,580
And so we get these things,

54
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:28,960
get to soggy blue book and you get one
with a kind of a half ass but still okay.

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,320
You know, essay on social geography and
you get the third is a bunch of names.

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,130
So what do you, how do you grade that?
Uh, we had a council of, you know, a,

57
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,760
a meeting to discuss this
and I remember what we did.

58
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,760
I know we gave the first person some sort
of B plus for the, for the essay and,

59
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:47,680
and uh, uh, you know, number
two, I think I, I, uh,

60
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,160
can vote the person and then maybe
call the college dean to say, you know,

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,110
some of us have Pi San Matias
and much pie on a tee probe.

62
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,680
Namco Ma'am knew. Anyway, I didn't mean
to screw around with it, which in return,

63
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:04,180
I'm sorry. Oh, I said Bob, maybe I,

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,310
I tore it up at the end.

65
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,340
There was probably about 17 or 18 names
and they were in alphabetical order.

66
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,280
So it wasn't that the, the,
the midterm was a total loss,

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,290
but that's the last time I
screw around with, with, uh,
with midterms. So, uh, do we,

68
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,770
uh, Brian, uh, mobile, however,
we, uh, uh, do we do our,

69
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,310
we are your people and getting this
in French, the midterm or in English,

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,960
but the exam,
and we do the examine in a few minutes.

71
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,770
Are we going to do that in
French horn? Okay. What, uh,

72
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,450
so let, let's, uh, let's
start, where was I got, I got,

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,440
I got taken out and taken out there a
little bit here thinking about those old

74
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:49,240
times. Um, I want to,

75
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:53,350
I want to do they talk about 1917
and 1918 and talk a little bit, uh,

76
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,230
a little bit, uh, about the,
uh, about the mutinies, um,

77
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,740
of the mutinies have to be seen in the
context of course, in all these assaults.

78
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,950
But above all the battle of the
Somme and the battle of the Somme,

79
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,030
which began on July 1st 19 a 16,
was,

80
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,250
uh, was the darkest moment,
uh, certainly in, um, uh,

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,020
in four years of,
of,

82
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:22,300
of dark days on the first day
of the battle of the Somme.

83
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,020
I always give these
statistics, but there's some
interesting, uh, the first day,

84
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,020
1st of July in 19 a 16,

85
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,880
almost 40 sols and British
soldiers were killed in one day.

86
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,480
I, and, uh, I mean 40,000, sorry,

87
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:40,990
were wounded and 20,000
were killed on the fray.

88
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,991
First Day there was a casualty for every
half meter of the entire front line.

89
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,840
So one casual d for every
half meter of the front line.

90
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,110
And I gave this,
um,

91
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,110
this is this the first day what I was
going to give you an overview of the

92
00:05:57,111 --> 00:06:02,040
course, but there were more I British
soldiers killed or seriously wounded. Um,

93
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,060
and the first three days
of the battle of the Somme,

94
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,410
then there were Americans
killed in World War One,

95
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,460
a Korea and Vietnam combined.

96
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,770
And then you could include the 4,000 that
had been killed in this, uh, uh, current,

97
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,610
uh, uh, absurd war. Uh,
and so, I mean, that's it.

98
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:25,970
Those are phenomenal losses.
And so the question again,

99
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,270
when you look at the poisoning of the
political atmosphere and the absence of,

100
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,230
of, uh, of, uh,

101
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,130
able leadership in Europe
in the 1920s in 1930s, uh,

102
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:40,070
where were they? Uh, in the case of
Britain, they were at that poem went,

103
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,390
hung up on that old barbed wire because
they were dead. And, uh, you know,

104
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:48,410
sometimes it's, it's easy in, in
British society, such a class society,

105
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,060
and it's easy to kind of poke fun at
Oxbridge Sha folks going in their common

106
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:57,650
room and then going off to a, you know,
machine gun, a Indian and surgeons, uh,

107
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,650
and this sort of thing, but to
the flower of British, um, uh,

108
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:05,390
youth perished in the flower of,
of other, uh, countries, youth, uh,

109
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,100
during, uh, during this time.

110
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,150
And so the immune needs have
to be seen in that context.

111
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,870
And I'll come back to them. Uh, uh,
it's back to them, uh, in a, uh,

112
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,650
in a while.
Now I'm 1917 is,

113
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,760
is the crucial a year,
uh,

114
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:26,300
really in a determining, uh, uh,

115
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,660
the outcome of a war that seemed
like it was going to go on forever,

116
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,890
a forever not, not defined by
truly forever. Uh, but, uh,

117
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:38,540
that in 19,
end of 1917 and beginning of 1918,

118
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,610
um, into March 19, it will,
after they slow down the
Luton Dorf offensive in 1918,

119
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,730
uh, the military planners
begin to think that the,

120
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:51,620
when the war in 1920, 19, 21,

121
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,650
maybe if all went spectacularly well
in 1919 and of course there were,

122
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,810
you know, as so many people
died due to win a few, um, uh,

123
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,300
a hundred meters or a kilometer or two
kilometers, three kilometers at best,

124
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,070
there were wags who said, well, if
this rate, we'll reach the Rhine,

125
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,770
somebody figured out by the
year 2007, uh, which is, uh,

126
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,150
where we are now more or less,
if I remember that statistic,

127
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,680
but a two things happen in 1917 that,
that are, um, that are essential.

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,850
One is at the Bolshevik
revolution, comes along, uh,

129
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:29,080
with first the revolution in February
where the people of Saint Petersburg w

130
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,250
wake up and find that the
emperor has no clothes,

131
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:35,810
that there's police but not troops.
And the bread lines are long. And, uh,

132
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,150
the, uh, the,

133
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,320
the czarist autocracy falls,
uh,

134
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,880
leading to that sort of power vacuum and
Corinne's keys, provisional government.

135
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,130
And of course, at an October, uh,

136
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,050
the Bolsheviks after one attempt that
failed the Bolsheviks seized power.

137
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,680
And at that point, the war changes
dimensions dramatically in the east.

138
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,750
Russia is still in the war until
the treaty of Brest [inaudible], uh,

139
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:08,400
in March of 1918. Um, but the,

140
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:13,350
the, the propaganda, which
was more than that of, of, of
war bread and piece, I mean,

141
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:18,230
that's a motto to live by,
uh, means that, that, uh,

142
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
you've got, um, uh,

143
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,300
a de acceleration in the Russian
war effort and you've got massive,

144
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,470
I'm a massive desertions from
the Russian army. Um, now,

145
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:32,260
one of the amazing things is that the
desertion rate was so low compared to what

146
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:35,330
you will, you know, what you think would
happen and is rather amazing that the,

147
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:38,880
that the Russians were, were able
to hold on. Uh, uh, again, I mean,

148
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:43,650
just as the Germans were close to,
uh, uh, close to, uh, Paris, uh,

149
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,590
particularly in March, 1918, uh, uh,

150
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:50,360
the German forces are also quite a
close to Petrel God, which, which, uh,

151
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,480
Lennon God had been. Um, I mean,

152
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,580
not letting him go on debt at Saint
Petersburg had been renamed because

153
00:09:56,581 --> 00:10:01,200
Petrograd does sounded a, sounded more
Russian. But the other thing that, that,

154
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,770
that changes the outcome of the
war is that the Americans come in.

155
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,530
Uh, and, um, in the United States, um,

156
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,570
you know, the United States
were supposedly neutral
until 1917. But outside of,

157
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,270
of places with strong German populations,
for example, uh, Philadelphia, uh,

158
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,460
Milwaukee, uh, Chicago, uh,

159
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,610
the majority of Americans supported
the allies as defined by the British,

160
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,910
the French and the Russians, and
particularly through them, uh, uh,

161
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,980
the British component.
Uh,

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,950
but it wasn't really that that
brings the Americans into the war,

163
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,550
the German high command to make, again,
one of these interesting long stories,

164
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:45,570
very, very short had decided that that
the only way they can win is to knock the

165
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:48,150
British out of the war.
Uh,

166
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,840
and the way that they could knock the
British out of the war is to stop the

167
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:55,800
supply of, of a munitions
of food, of grain,

168
00:10:55,801 --> 00:11:00,300
of almost anything else you can
imagine to, um, to Great Britain. Now,

169
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:04,540
how you're going to do that? Well, the
way you're going to do that is with, um,

170
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,940
a campaign of, of unrestricted
submarine warfare, the famous u boats,

171
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,130
uh, that, uh, the sink, an
incredible, uh, a number of ships.

172
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,140
Um, and, um, the German, uh,

173
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,760
the German government goes down,
sends representatives downs to the,

174
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,680
down to the docks in New York and
other ports, Boston and other places.

175
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,180
And they put up warning saying
that, that, uh, you know,

176
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,620
the civilian passengers or any other
Americans who go on ships ought to know

177
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:35,870
that they're entering a war zone
and could be sunk. Um, and the,

178
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:40,410
the German u boat sink, some
ships with American, it's on them.

179
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,640
Uh, the most dramatic event was at
the sinking of the Lusitania, uh,

180
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,970
which I'm sure you all know
about in which lots of Americans,

181
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,010
I can't remember how many,
but it might was hundreds and hundreds.

182
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:51,900
It might've even been a thousand.
Uh,

183
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:55,110
I apologize for not having a
statistic in my eye and my head, uh,

184
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,260
were killed off a, I think
it's fairly near, um, Ireland.

185
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,300
And of course the Americans
go wild and say that, uh,
uh, this, this, um, you know,

186
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:08,650
ship was carrying,
passengers are going over to Britain and,

187
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:13,450
and uh, civilians. And, uh, this was,
uh, an act of piracy and active war,

188
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,970
an act of murder, et Cetera,
et cetera. It turns out that,

189
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:20,200
and I think it was a 1960s, they're
1970s. I vaguely remember this.

190
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,160
They sent divers down to down into the
Lusitania and they found that as the

191
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,280
Germans had claimed, was absolutely
correct, that the Americans were, uh,

192
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:30,100
the ship was carrying munitions.
And therefore, I mean,

193
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,530
I'm not defending the sinking of the
ship. I'm not defending, you know,

194
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,430
of the thinking of any ship.
Uh, but, uh, but clearly it was,

195
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,520
it was carrying weapons.

196
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:43,750
And that's one of the reasons that the
ship went down was such a dramatic impact

197
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,770
is because all the munitions blow up
when the, when the German torpedo hit it.

198
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,680
But, but the law and the over
the long run, what happens is,

199
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:52,810
is that that the man who was going
to keep America out of war, I would,

200
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:55,960
Roy Wilson pro, former president
of Princeton University, uh,

201
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,870
ends up taking the US into war.

202
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,030
And those of you who had American
history from Glenda or, or, uh,

203
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,400
other people want to go more, other folks,
um, here will know that, that, you know,

204
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,780
in the end, I mean, most Americans really
didn't want to go to war. And, uh, Wilson,

205
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,610
who was the first American president,
by the way,

206
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:17,611
ever to leave the United States
during a term of a term of office,

207
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,160
a ghost of Versailles, uh, to the
treaty of Versailles after the war.

208
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:25,330
And then he can't get the treaty
ever, uh, uh, ratified by, uh,

209
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,160
by the u s congress. After that. I
mean, his, his repudiation is, is,

210
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:34,510
um, a really complete, uh, unfortunately
for him at the end of the war. Now,

211
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,980
what difference did the
Americans come into?

212
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,930
The warm of coming into the warm mean
in 1917. It was not the, the troops.

213
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:44,500
I mean, lots of troops.
I begin to arrive, um,

214
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,260
and led by pure perishing,
John Perishing, who had done,

215
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:52,000
who had honed his skills by, uh, you
know, shooting down Mexicans, uh, in, uh,

216
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,340
in Mexico. Uh, it, uh,

217
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:57,730
and they have the reputation for
being sort of cowboys and earnest.

218
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:01,180
And they are the, uh, the typical
American image is really a,

219
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:05,010
though it's been desmin devastated in
the last four or five years, but, uh, uh,

220
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,260
really is created by the
Americans arriving to fight.

221
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:13,120
And you're well trained pistol, uh, uh,
wielding a sharp shooters and all that.

222
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,550
And they first go to the
first fight at Chateau Gfe,

223
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,660
which is not very far from Paris.
It's northeast of Paris in 1917.

224
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,910
But that's not what makes the difference.
Uh,

225
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,350
American troops in the long run
will help tilt the scale to, uh,

226
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:29,980
to the allies, uh, and it
compensates for, um, for,

227
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,010
for what we've discussed in terms of
the French not having a, you know,

228
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,300
they're gonna run out of soldiers.

229
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,470
But the big difference is
that the curves cross, uh,

230
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,190
that the curves of the ability of the
Germans to supply, uh, their own forces,

231
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,770
uh, that the German war machine, uh,

232
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,750
is not going to be able to compete
with the combined power of American

233
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:52,730
industrial might.
And Detroit can be easily converted.

234
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:54,920
The factories in Detroit
and Ypsilanti and Flint,

235
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:59,921
Michigan in lots of other places can be
easily transformed into production of,

236
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:04,450
uh, uh, if slanty yeah. Into a
production of arms and, and places like,

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,560
like that. And so the curves cross, and
it's at that point when many people in,

238
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,970
uh, you know, the French and the British
high command along with the Americans,

239
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,070
they know they're going to win the war,
uh, in a, in a, in the long run. Uh,

240
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,220
but the question at what, at what
cost? And, and, and, you know,

241
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,510
the lively discussion as there had been
in Germany, over German war aims, uh,

242
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,640
you know, the Germans, if
they win the war and the West,

243
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,740
they're going to want
demand part of Belgium,

244
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:35,120
they're going to want to probably more
of Lohan, uh, et Cetera, et cetera.

245
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,560
Uh, uh, the French also, uh,

246
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,220
have their war aims that are going to
want to have a permanent French, you know,

247
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,190
presence. They're talking about
that and in the Rhineland and,

248
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:48,590
and as well as taking Alsace and
Lauryn bet. And so that helps set up,

249
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:52,940
which I'll come back to talk about
in a while, uh, 19, 18 march,

250
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,920
because that's when the German say,
baby, it's now or never. And so that's,

251
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:00,870
that's the, the big Luton Dorf
offensive, which I'll come back to in,

252
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,330
in March of 1918. That's
important, uh, uh, uh, to say,

253
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,390
to discuss at least, uh, a little bit.

254
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Now what about the mutinies and
what about other aspects of,

255
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:20,150
uh, you know, of, of the war? Um,
uh, they have to do with, with,

256
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:23,810
with, with the home front and in
the mutinies are not on the, on the,

257
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,650
on the home front, but they're,
they're quite a close to it.

258
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,990
As I said at the beginning,
um,

259
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,680
as I said at the beginning, your, um,

260
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,470
most people in France did not want
war in 1914 but because it was easy to

261
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:47,360
portray Germany as the aggressors,
which they were,

262
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,270
the vast majority of the population,
uh,

263
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,740
obviously was prepared to hold
on because of the proximity, uh,

264
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,880
certainly of, of Paris,
uh, to, uh, to the front.

265
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,920
And this is right through the war.

266
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,330
It's right through into the failure
of the Luton Dorf offensive.

267
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,350
Now to be sure there are tensions
within French society about the war.

268
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,540
There was tremendous, uh, resentment and
you can see photos of this resentment, uh,

269
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,280
as, as, uh, in, in Paris.

270
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,940
Opera was one place where
they distributed coal.

271
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,690
That was ray rationed in
order to have to have heat.

272
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,300
And as you know from the discussion
previously of the Golden Buddha, you know,

273
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,460
that's where many of the
famous restaurants and cafes,
the cafe now, he can't, uh,

274
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,590
uh, the, the, the cafe lawpay
and ironically, the cafe de
la pay, the cafe of peace,

275
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,650
uh, and all those things are, are,
are, um, uh, located. And so as, um,

276
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,400
as people waited in line to hope to get
a few chunks of coal in order to stay

277
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:50,000
warm and in these cold a
Parisian a winters, uh,

278
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,000
they saw the fancy people in their big
cars. I've driven by chauffeurs, uh,

279
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:58,350
going off to the great restaurants and
people who had profit tiered from the war

280
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,650
and named me a war in
which people, uh, uh,

281
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,600
do not profit enormously in,

282
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:07,750
in which some aspects of big business
are not just gleeful with every extended

283
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,590
tour of duty. And, and,
uh, you'll have that,

284
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,740
you'll have discovered something
that I didn't know existed.

285
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:17,670
And so there's a lot of tension toward,
toward up, uh, a to a profiteers,

286
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,880
to legal, the big guys, the fact guys,

287
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,500
they global ne the big hats. Um,
and you've got those tensions,

288
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:28,830
but you have more than that. You have
tensions between those people who, uh,

289
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,880
PA peasants, they Payza
who are, um, you know,

290
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,910
conscripted without any real possibility,

291
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:39,580
unless they've already had
two brothers killed. Uh,

292
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,250
and that saves them. And for example,
skilled workers in the armament industry,

293
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,820
uh, for example, around
Santa Tn, Santa Tn, uh,

294
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:51,840
is an armament manufacturing town or
was they used to make bikes there too?

295
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,230
Neither. They don't make it either
there anymore or in tune in, in,

296
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:58,260
in the Co has a places
that make arms people,

297
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,490
skilled workers got out of
the draft because of that.

298
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,210
And thus they worked very hard.
Uh, uh, but there was, you know,

299
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,690
there are some tension, uh, towards,
towards that from, uh, from, uh,

300
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,120
for example, people in, in the Macias
on tile, uh, where you have the, the,

301
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,900
the most endless lists of names killed
that one could ever see in Avania and

302
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:23,250
places like that. So you have
those sorts of tensions as well.

303
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,430
Now, the role of women in all
of this is of course crucial.

304
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,310
A because it's in the factories.
Uh,

305
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:33,150
particularly and not ski and not highly
skilled work because they didn't have

306
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:37,320
the from us. You are the training
in that, that women step up and uh,

307
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,610
and replace men. And also, again,
the role of nurses is so important.

308
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,370
And so that's what I was inconceivable
for many French women after all of this,

309
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:49,320
not to get the vote after World War One,
whereas in Britain, uh, women, uh, uh,

310
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,890
get the vote after World War Two and
the United States, Rosie the riveter,

311
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,090
you know, working in a factory
in Detroit or in, in, uh,
uh, Pittsburgh, uh, you know,

312
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,870
became sort of an icon for a, you
know, sort of in the Crypto, uh,

313
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,480
uh, feminist movement,
uh, in later decades. Uh,

314
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,550
so you have some tensions there.
I mean,

315
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:11,250
you also had workers who would come
back and of course, after the war,

316
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,770
if they were lucky enough to
survive Brunello top Bruno Gabon,

317
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,480
we'll probably talk about this next
week after midterm, you know, they,

318
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:20,310
they get thrown out there the last hired,
so they're the first fired.

319
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,550
And there's some tensions between males
and females over that too, because, well,

320
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:27,740
the males had been out in the trenches
and then they want those jobs back and,

321
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:28,574
and all of that.

322
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,000
But another thing is rather interesting
is of course the role of women in, in,

323
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:36,210
in them, the nurses and the
big, you know, the, the,

324
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:40,890
the northern French nuns and the Belgium
nuns with those huge hats. Uh, you know,

325
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:41,510
the, the, the, and,

326
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,240
and it was easy to become anticlerical
and we've talked about that before. But,

327
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
but one of the things that calm
that situation is the role of,

328
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:53,641
of the clergy in particular of the female
clergy in attending to these horrible,

329
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:57,430
horrible wounds and, and some cases
going, you know, going to the front is,

330
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,880
you know, working with
ambulance as in this sort of
thing. It's a other women did,

331
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:04,180
who didn't happen to be nuns. And
if, for example, the, the, the, the,

332
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:08,110
the case of Leon has been documented
and Leon was the capital of the Radical

333
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,210
Party with the big are
socially conservative and v
but very, and, but, but, uh,

334
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,110
moderate politically, but based
upon built upon anti clericalism,

335
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,010
uh,

336
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,360
and in Leon where there was a vibrant
kind of anti clericalism before World War

337
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:27,250
one that calms down because, you know,
these nuns who people, uh, you know,

338
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,410
attacked, representing in
some ways institutionalized
role of the, of, of, of, uh,

339
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,160
the Catholic Church and French society.

340
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,600
We're extraordinarily heroic and so
are these priests and, uh, you know,

341
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:39,430
in ministers and, and, and, and
indeed, rabbis who of course,

342
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:43,120
who get killed by shells, uh, as they're
giving the last rights to all of these,

343
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:45,310
uh, people who, who have been killed.

344
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,500
And there's another attention
to that's not talked about
so much. Uh, but I, I can,

345
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,490
I've heard it in the end. There's a
collective memory of a, you know what,

346
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,070
where we live too. Is that one of the
things that happens with the warrant,

347
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,600
obviously when you look
at a map of France, uh,

348
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,280
that they popped him all like the aisle
then and the n and the mountain and,

349
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,070
and the product Kallai and the na are
basically German or the front line is

350
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,500
running right through that.
Did they pop them all?

351
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,710
So you've got these millions of people
who become refugees and they are going,

352
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,381
Eh,
you know,

353
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:20,560
they're in a more organized fashion
than in 1940 when everybody's seen the

354
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:23,530
pictures of them walking along the roads,
caring what they can,

355
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:27,780
and then diving into the ditches
as the, as the, uh, loose, uh,

356
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,180
as the Luftwaffe, the
German, a fighter plane,

357
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:34,570
the German air force is strafing
them in a more organized fashion,

358
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,190
but you still have to somewhere to go.

359
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,430
You have to have someplace to end
up where you're going to be fed.

360
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,500
And so where they end up,
well,

361
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,170
they ended up in the places
in France where there are not,

362
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,680
where there's not fighting.
And uh, and it became,

363
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:51,700
is that people get tired of the war
by 1917. Well, at the time, I mean,

364
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:56,260
everybody's tired of the war, but, but as,
as as one gets even tired or of the war,

365
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,770
you hear the sort of grumbling about
these people from the north and they speak

366
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:04,000
at different accent. Uh, in some
cases if they, if they speak German,

367
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:06,250
they speak a different language.
If they speak slimish.

368
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,340
And there are lots of Flemish
speakers who come down from, from, uh,

369
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,810
the Knauf and places like
cause Buka and all of that. Um,

370
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,410
and so they are strains
on local resources,

371
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:22,090
which are already extremely limited.
And so you even have this talk,

372
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,970
a grumbling,
it's not more than that,

373
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,660
but grumbling in cafes and bars about,
uh,

374
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,460
Paris is war,

375
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,510
but also about the Bush do know
that is the Germans of the north.

376
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,290
And in one of the things is that a lot
of people in the north of France or

377
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,500
blonde and a lot of people in the majority
of people in the south of France have

378
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:48,490
dark hair.
And so all of a sudden there's is a ride.

379
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,320
It was a silly way of viewing it,
but this is how people viewed it is that,

380
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,651
you know,

381
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:54,410
you had your bom blind people in the
south and you have dark people in north.

382
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:58,460
I mean that life is like that. But you
have the, the rival of these people,

383
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,020
many of whom will collect their Dutch,
you know,

384
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:05,000
who are arriving and who caused some
sort of strain, a strain on, uh,

385
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:10,130
the building of communities to, uh, to
take care of those who perceived as,

386
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,600
as of their own.

387
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,020
And so 1917 is a big year
for that as well. You have,

388
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,400
you have other kinds of, uh, uh, you have,

389
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,360
you have other kinds of problems you
have in 1917 is the year lots of men and

390
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:28,250
women go on strike. Now, they are not,
these are not defeatist in quotes strikes,

391
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,990
but the strikes and Santa tn and many
of them are, are involving women, uh,

392
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,800
are demands for better working
conditions for better wages.

393
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,720
They're part of the Sacred Union Union
Hay, but they want better conditions.

394
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,290
And so the strikes in 1917, again,
they're not the fetus strikes,

395
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,530
they want to win the war, but it's the
same thing as the, the movement, uh,

396
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,400
before the war for better conditions,
uh,

397
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,790
that why should you work for worse
conditions than men, for example?

398
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:59,030
Or why should it work for conditions when
the prophet hears are getting rich and

399
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,600
the global born the big bonus, the
big hats are getting wealthy. Why,

400
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,560
why should you have terrible conditions?
And so these strikes, you know,

401
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,890
are very widespread. Clem soul.
Uh, it'll come, it has more power.

402
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:14,090
In 1917, he becomes prime
minister. He says, I wage war.
I wage war. I wait. Wage war.

403
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:16,730
That's all. Uh, there were
attempts to break the strikes,

404
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:21,560
but it's a year where the, the, the
morale of the Home Front, uh, is,

405
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,430
is extremely, um, it's
fragile. It's more fragile,

406
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:27,170
1917 than any other time.

407
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,650
And there seems to be this enormous
disparity between this or a howling

408
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:33,590
propaganda of, of, of big,

409
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:37,850
big newspapers in which everything is a
great victory and defeats are just tiny

410
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:42,490
setbacks a step back. And if, if
things are so damn good, why, you know,

411
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,450
why are the Germans still close to Paris?

412
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,510
And so it becomes pretty
hard to explain now.

413
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,640
They don't have the problems that
the Germans will have because,

414
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,510
and that's a different situation. A very
good book edited by my friend, um, uh,

415
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,290
j winter, uh, and, uh, coming from
the zone, do we do a rollback,

416
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,160
uh,
called Capitol cities and at war,

417
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,450
because conditions are worse in
Berlin than they are in, in Paris. Uh,

418
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,150
but conditions are much better
in London than they are in Paris.

419
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,550
And that's the only for
fairly obvious reasons.

420
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,570
So the losses are still a equally bad,
uh,

421
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:19,490
so that that year in 1917
is, uh, uh, is a bad year.

422
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,200
Uh, but overall, uh, things
come are calmed down. And, um,

423
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,580
uh, for these reasons I've already
said it is a, a, a turning point.

424
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,530
Now, what about these, the, the strikes,
I mean, what about the mutinies?

425
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,500
Uh, how serious were the mutinies?
They were probably only two, uh,

426
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,320
divisions that were totally reliable
standing between the Germans and Paris at

427
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:46,790
that point. Not reliable. Uh,
again, to the extent that, that the,

428
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,950
that they want the Germans to win because
they don't, but they want, for example,

429
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:52,070
the rights of the French
were trying to keep, uh,

430
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,910
representatives from the Socialist Party,

431
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:57,630
from going to Switzerland or going to
to Sweden to meet an international peace

432
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:02,430
conferences, uh, and that sort
of thing. Um, but one of the,

433
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,190
I spoke earlier earlier,
whenever it was Monday,

434
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,820
about this sort of discontinuity
or the contrast between, uh,

435
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:13,230
the soldiers view of the war and that
other civilians and one of the, uh,

436
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:17,760
and how the soldiers back on leave didn't
want to talk about it. And, and, uh,

437
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,500
you know, couldn't really give that
precise kinds of information anyway, uh,

438
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,870
because off it's all swirling around
them and they don't really know what's

439
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:27,890
going on in other places
except where they are. Uh,

440
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,230
but one of the best evidences
of that is the fact that nobody,

441
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,470
as far as as we can
tell at the home front,

442
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,940
really knew at the time of the,
uh,

443
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,950
of the mutinies about how serious
and widespread the mutinies were,

444
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,280
uh, that they didn't really know.
Now remember also that, that in fact,

445
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:52,200
this is one of the key sources for Bruno
coupons. Magnificent book, uh, on, um,

446
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,350
uh, Vic called rated the French
translation to English would be,

447
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:59,490
we'd be sort of something like a
victory plunged into morning. Ah,

448
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,930
that is the return of the soldiers.

449
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,130
One of the principle sources are letters
written by soldiers from the front that

450
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:08,250
were collected and censored by,
uh,

451
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,490
by military sensors who don't want the,
uh,

452
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,010
these letters revealing to civilians
much of what's going on at all.

453
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,490
And so that also explains why people
at the home front really didn't know a

454
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,780
about how widespread these new knees were,

455
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,820
nor did the Germans,
nor did the British, uh,

456
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,271
uh,

457
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:32,271
outside of the high command have
any sense of what was going on.

458
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,320
Now, um, these mutinies,
it's not, uh, uh, to, uh,

459
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,190
hard to say, uh, why, you know,
these movies take place in, in,

460
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,650
in, in, uh, when they do, uh, or,
or why they take place at all.

461
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,510
Uh, it is not, again, to feed us and
they don't want the Germans to win. Uh,

462
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,670
they have some respect,

463
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:57,090
lots of respect for the German soldiers
that were fighting against the law at

464
00:28:57,091 --> 00:29:01,320
the end of the war. They still just with
seeps out of these letters is maybe on,

465
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,610
we'll talk about this next time, uh, is,
uh, uh, you know, hatred for, you know,

466
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,380
the horrible hunt, et Cetera, et
cetera. But is that, you know,

467
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,860
anybody could tell that these tactics
were just killing hundreds of thousands of

468
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:18,330
people for nothing,
for nothing.

469
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,490
That there wasn't going to be a French
British breakthrough that the battle of

470
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,930
the Somme grounds to, uh, a
halt all along the front, uh,

471
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:32,860
for obvious reasons after, uh, you know,
a, you know, after a matter of, of,

472
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:37,750
of, of really days but weeks,
uh, and that there isn't any, uh,

473
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,730
any, any hope, um, that it began
when one company, oh, by the way,

474
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:46,210
how do we know this? Uh, you know, we
don't know it from Kirk Douglas. Um,

475
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,460
most archives in France are,
um,

476
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,520
can be opened up 50 years
after the fact. So, uh,

477
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,121
what is your,

478
00:29:55,121 --> 00:30:00,121
is this 2000 something where the 2007 so
we could see the archives 50 years ago,

479
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:05,320
but not, uh, uh, 49 years ago,
but with the military archives,

480
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:08,080
because this was so sensitive,
the mutinies,

481
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:12,280
all of these documents were in
the war archives and vast sen,

482
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,060
and I saw them before they were
open because I bribed my way in. Uh,

483
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,250
I was not to see them,
I was working on something else,

484
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:22,330
but they're the person that ran this, that
we're arc. I was just totally clueless.

485
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,650
Totally clueless. And she
lived for about, you know,

486
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,350
three hour Tris or lunch breaks I guess
more appropriately. And then, uh, um,

487
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,320
and I knew these documents were there
and so I knew also somebody tipped me off

488
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:35,050
that the Gao,
the end likes a stamps.

489
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,130
And so I would put all these wild
sort of stamps on my, you know,

490
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,830
mail letters when people still
use stamps and, and, and, and,

491
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,670
and I had one from Latin America and one
from Africa. And, and this guy comes up,

492
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:49,750
he's okay. Very beautiful. The stamps.
I said, Oh, do you like stamps?

493
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,970
And you're, yeah. So, yeah. So,
well would you like these? Oh,

494
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:58,630
thank you so much. And they're pretty
soon I'm in the, in the archives, uh,

495
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,320
in the back, you know, and,
and he's, he's an officer too.

496
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:06,520
He's some sort of a lieutenant,
a guy, either ogre guy. Anyway,

497
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:10,000
so I bribed my way in and you could
see these, all of these, these cartons,

498
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,190
and they were changed.

499
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:15,340
They were literally all chained in this
big kind of capsule look like a space

500
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:15,851
capsule,

501
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:19,110
except it was just looks like the basement
of Branford college or something. But,

502
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,740
but you, you couldn't, you couldn't,

503
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,260
you couldn't get into those pigs that was
taught to be the national disgrace, uh,

504
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,010
that there had been these,
uh, uh, these mutinies, uh,

505
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:32,830
and the mutinies were, uh,
were indeed why widespread?

506
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,680
And so what happens is
that a refusals to go, uh,

507
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,640
to go over the top a simply spread.
They spread like wildfire.

508
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,970
Soldiers say they don't want to get
killed anymore for 5 cents a day.

509
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,290
In some places there are red flags go up.
In some places they're black flags,

510
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:55,090
which are the, the, the
flags of anarchism. But,
uh, remember that, that uh,

511
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:59,890
you know, the Socialists had also
joined the, the uh, uh, joined,

512
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:03,820
uh, the sacred union. And as you'll get
ends up being minister of Transport,

513
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,740
minister of a communication
or something like that in 19,

514
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,840
um, uh, uh, in, but in 1915,
if I remember correctly,

515
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,490
and two regiments that are posted and
Swat Soul Swipe Sloan is not very far away

516
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:23,380
from Paris. That's swa song was about a
45 minute drive away from Paris by car.

517
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:28,060
Now two regiments decide they're going
to march on Paris to try to set things

518
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:28,870
right.

519
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,460
They're going to force the Chamber of
deputies to find a way to end the war.

520
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,660
Not to, to say we want the Germans
to win, uh, but to find a way,

521
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,300
get some sort of negotiated so
that this carnage, uh, stopped. Um,

522
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,480
most of the generals who
were fairly clueless, uh,

523
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,270
see organized Bolshevik propaganda
behind this or pacifist,

524
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:55,271
those people coming out of Sweden
or Switzerland and trying to stop a,

525
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,410
a the, the useless way this
war is being fought. Um,

526
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,450
uh, it may and June about
about 40,000 soldiers were,

527
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:10,310
um, involved in collective,
um, uh, acts of, of uh,

528
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,420
of refusal. Uh, and, um, the,

529
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,500
although the generals insisted in their
correspondence that those 40,000 people

530
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,650
were cowards. I know this,
obviously it was not the case,

531
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:24,020
and many of them had already been
shot up and already been wounded.

532
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,820
And already we're, we're, we're,
we're, we're going back. Um, and, um,

533
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,260
the first signs of this, by
the way, are the soldiers were,

534
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:34,010
were supposed to move up in order
to prepare to go over the top,

535
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,160
began buying like sheep, going Baa, Baa,

536
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:41,870
the way that sheet by and the way to the
slaughter, the, the slaughter house. Uh,

537
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:45,530
because that's, that's where
they were going. Um, now there,

538
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:49,730
there was socialist and passive as
pacifists literature that had, uh, uh,

539
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:53,480
happily enough, uh, you know, in my view
had to, had gotten into the trenches. But,

540
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:57,860
but, but th th this is not the motivation,
uh, and pay town, uh, you know,

541
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:02,000
who ends up being one of the evil forces
in France, but this was the early town,

542
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,950
uh, when pay town, uh, he realizes
that, that this is not the case. Uh,

543
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,640
that, uh, um,

544
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,140
and in fact the repression is much less
severe than many of the generals wanted

545
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,450
a more about that, uh,
uh, in, in a minute. Um,

546
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,810
and so he ends the policy.

547
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:25,811
Petain does have these
mad attacks over the top,

548
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,220
the whistles blow,
and then they simply get slaughtered.

549
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,700
Uh, they, uh, in some areas,

550
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:37,520
and we don't have exact statistics because
there were certainly some people are

551
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:40,190
just put up against the wall
and shot in and we don't know.

552
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:43,040
It's just like after
1945, uh, we don't know.

553
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,990
We have a guest of 10,000 people
were killed in the reprisals in 1845.

554
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:51,640
But that's, that's a pretty
rough account. Uh, but, um,

555
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,390
there were 3,400, 27 condemnations, um,

556
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,560
about 10% of the people who
were, who faced some kind of, of,

557
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,300
of court martial for something they
did or something they didn't do. Um,

558
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,400
and 49 were condemned to death,
which is not, I'm not from,

559
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,430
for condemning anybody, uh,
uh, to death. Um, but, um,

560
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,030
it, it, um, and, and these were
carried out as in the movie, uh,

561
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:24,650
as in the film, uh, immediately, you
know, it's just up against the wall, Bang,

562
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:29,360
Bang. And Peta, uh, tries
to, he tries to bring in,

563
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,260
um, uh, he tries to bring
in better conditions,

564
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,750
I mean ups the booze ration as well.

565
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:39,150
And of course that was a pretty happy,
uh,

566
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:44,110
so I'm in all, in fact, I said 40,000,
but there's another statistic, uh,

567
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,200
that, that, that, that goes as
high as 70,000 people. Uh, and uh,

568
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,190
let me throw in a statistic. As long as
we're doing that, uh, for strikes and set,

569
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,760
1917,
there were 689 strikes,

570
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,050
a affecting 300,000 workers.
That's a lot,

571
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,050
twice all meal,
300,000 workers.

572
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,260
And that's compared to
98 strikes in 19 a 16.

573
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,910
But again, uh, we know
fascinating, um, uh, aspect.

574
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,960
I'm repeating,
uh,

575
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,820
I is that this was not known and
this was not known. Uh, you know,

576
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:24,720
then you couldn't drive it in 45
minutes, but this was not known, uh, in,

577
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,230
in Paris by the general
population. Uh, what had,

578
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:33,490
what had happened. And then
the end, uh, France, uh,

579
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,820
France, France holds on now
in the spring of 19. Um,

580
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,170
and the spring of 1918,
the Germans launched their victory drive,

581
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,820
uh, in quotes, uh,

582
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:49,821
the first major German offensive
since 1914 before spend.

583
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:54,690
The British and the French attempting
to break through. Now, if the same time,

584
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,650
the Austrian Hungarian Empire,
uh,

585
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,320
the army is all the cracks that were
quite predicted and predictable. Uh,

586
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,330
there are all sorts of
problems there and funds.

587
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:08,331
Yosef has died in 1916 and so the Germans
are quite unsure whether the fostering

588
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:13,530
going to empire is going to be
able to hold on, uh, uh, in, uh,

589
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,280
uh, you know, fighting against
the Italians for example,
and member of the breast,

590
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:21,390
the Tosca is not, uh, is
not signed until March of,

591
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,160
of 1918.
And the Americans have by spring of 1918,

592
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:30,580
325,000 soldiers. That's not a
huge number of soldiers, but,

593
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,840
but there's still three times,
Michigan football stadium
full. So that's, you know,

594
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:35,130
that's,
that's a lot of people.

595
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,390
So Luda nerf decides on a massive
German assault along the poor,

596
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,950
old some river,

597
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,130
therefore avoiding the mud
of Flanders and avoiding, uh,

598
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,600
the forts of eastern
France around Vietnam.

599
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,350
He was encouraged by the fact that
there are younger soldiers that are just

600
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:57,240
barely 18 that had been put
into, uh, uh, into, uh, uh,

601
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,290
the ranks. Uh, and he also has
brought up old, much older men too.

602
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,480
So they have some serious troops in order
to try to pull off this breakthrough.

603
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:07,710
And so on 21st of March,

604
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,720
1918 after a relatively brief bombardment
of five hours as opposed to five days,

605
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:20,030
1.6 million men who could
have imagined these numbers,

606
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,610
who could have imagined these numbers.
In 1913,

607
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,410
a 1.6 million men attacked
the ally defenses, uh,

608
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:30,420
in five separate,
uh,

609
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,450
our defenses in five separate
offenses over a front of a 40 miles.

610
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,970
And they do break through in five days.

611
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Some German units have pushed
forward more than 40 miles.

612
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,380
Uh, the, uh, uh, uh,
complimentary attack in Flanders,

613
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,950
uh, does very well indeed. Uh, and the,

614
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,680
the British troops and the French has
as a, you know, a General Haig. Uh, uh,

615
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,760
in Britain famously once said,

616
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,970
we're fighting with
their backs to the wall.

617
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,270
And on Easter Sunday of that year,
again,

618
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:12,040
the shells from big Bertha loved all
those miles from the north fall on Paris

619
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,270
through to Rivoli.

620
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,610
You can still see a sign where it
took out an apartment building,

621
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:20,140
Church of Santa Fe, uh, uh,
you know, right near the sand,

622
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:24,100
the same thing. We'll have
our [inaudible], uh, up by
Moh Parnassus, same thing.

623
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,690
So these shells a fall, and
they begin, uh, taking, uh,

624
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:31,260
alive. But what happens, uh,

625
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,390
was predictable and predicted is that
as on the small scale in the big scale,

626
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,380
the Germans begin to outrun
their cover and supplies,

627
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:46,530
and they begin at each one of these five
points of German offensive to encounter

628
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,430
a stiff a resistance.
On July 15th,

629
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,820
Ludendorff tries a last desperate
attack, uh, and it's, um,

630
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,670
it's, it's repulsed. And for Luna Andorf.

631
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,370
He knew this was the last
chance to win the war.

632
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,560
And at that point he knows it's a lafond,
the article, the end of the green beans,

633
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,150
uh, that they're simply not going
to win. And that the French,

634
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,050
their resources swollen by the
mirror can entrance into the war, uh,

635
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,330
are not going to sue for an armistice,

636
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:23,770
armistice until they've pushed
the Germans back across, uh,

637
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:25,650
the Rhine.
And we're at that point,

638
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,350
morale plunges dangerously in Germany.

639
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,560
In January of 1918 250,000 German workers
defy the government by going on strike

640
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,220
and strikes were illegal during the war.

641
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,320
There's all sorts of hoarding and so
there's a big problem and the French, uh,

642
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,850
forces counter or the allies,
the British,

643
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:48,040
the French and the Americans
CounterTack in July.

644
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,540
And at this point when they're in the
open for the first time tanks that you've

645
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,540
all seen, pictures of them
stuck in the mud, uh, now,

646
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:58,600
but when they're in the open
tanks began to work rather well,

647
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:00,970
and they'd been getting to adopt
a strategy of having soldiers,

648
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:06,100
infantry following tanks, and therefore
not getting picked off, uh, a, you know,

649
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:07,480
in such huge numbers,

650
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,100
and they begin to make a big a difference.
Uh,

651
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,990
on the 8th of August,

652
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,370
1918 of the German army's
darkest day, the, uh,

653
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,780
there are all sorts of attacks against
the German lines and a British force

654
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,950
moves force moves eight miles.
Uh,

655
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,070
and that though that's a territory
that was unimaginable, uh,

656
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,460
in the beginning, at this point,
Luton to RF us the hapless of Wilhelm,

657
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:35,630
the second that is all over,

658
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,860
but the shouting and you better
figure out some way of bringing, uh,

659
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,860
this whole thing to, uh,
to an end. And as, as,

660
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:47,720
as you know, in the end, uh, uh, go home,

661
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:50,530
the second will slither
across the Dutch border. Uh,

662
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,530
and the armistice will be signed
in a railroad car and comb PN, uh,

663
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,940
uh, north of Paris. Um,

664
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,990
there's still a railroad car
there or it's not the same one.

665
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:03,530
And that's where Hitler insisted on the
declaration of the armistice in 1940

666
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:07,430
being signed. So the war ends
on the 11th of, of, of November,

667
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:10,280
1918. And as you know, there
were many people, not many,

668
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:13,400
but there are lots of people killed after
were because they didn't know that the

669
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,200
pharmacist had come along and that the,

670
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,370
that the biggest pan-am
DEMEC ever in human history,

671
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:23,310
at least since the black death,
uh, in the 14th century, uh,

672
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,180
the Spanish flu, uh, is, it was called
a, it probably started in India, uh,

673
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,990
but had already began to
slip a sweep through, uh, a
sweep through the world. So,

674
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:35,150
uh,
things were not getting better and better,

675
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,280
but they were getting worse and worse.
Uh, just a few, I mean, obvious,

676
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,020
uh, statistics. I mean, you can see
these all over, but, um, uh, it,

677
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,700
it is, uh, it, it, it, it is staggering.
Beforehand was something that Jay Winter,

678
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,020
uh, has, um, has, uh,
begun one of his books, uh,

679
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,640
with, um, and just in terms
of dead and wounded, uh,

680
00:42:58,641 --> 00:42:59,810
just a couple,
don't reckon,

681
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,740
write these down and you write it down
or don't write them down. But anyway, uh,

682
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,570
Russia dead,
1 million,

683
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,590
800,000 wounded 5 million.

684
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,980
Now that ain't nothing like World War II,

685
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,360
25 million dead in the Soviet
Union in World War Two.

686
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,890
But 1.8 million is a
rather lot, uh, to, uh,

687
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,270
to be killed in France. Uh,
the French, um, at least two,

688
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,720
probably more than this, but, uh, you,
you hear figures from one point, uh,

689
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,480
1.4 million to 1.5 million.
Dead and wounded,

690
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:39,470
4 million, 266,000, Great Britain,

691
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:42,880
including the empire, the
dominion, the Australians, uh,

692
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,920
the Kenyans a dead 908,000
and wounded 2 million.

693
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,480
The Italians, 58,000, 578,000, excuse me,

694
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,400
with about a million wounded, uh, in
Serbia, which is a very small country.

695
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:03,320
Dead, 278,000 wounded, 133,000,

696
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,300
tiny Belgium killed 38,000 wounded 44,
uh,

697
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,370
uh, and among the central
powers, Germany, 2 million dead,

698
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:18,260
2 million dead. After all that,
you know, with your armies,

699
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:20,990
how do you explain to the folks back home,
all those people dead,

700
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,890
why you've surrendered will,
must be someone's fault.

701
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,360
And that's what the right would argue.
It's the Jews. It was a socialist.

702
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:32,040
So it was the communist there
hadn't a stab in the back.

703
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,720
How do we explain this
to the folks back home?

704
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,800
A wounded 4 million more
than that. Austria, Hungary.

705
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,250
The amazing thing is they held on
so long giving you all the national,

706
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,710
given all the national differences,
1.1 million with wounded, uh,

707
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,880
3.6 million.
I mean,

708
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:52,800
these are just statistics that
are so incredible. In France,

709
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,980
there are 36,000 communes and there
were only 12 that didn't have somebody

710
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:03,030
killed. And that's where when you go
to any French commun except those 12,

711
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,190
you will see, uh, uh, you know,

712
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:07,590
a list of those people killed
or even inside churches.

713
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:10,710
Sometimes they'll have the parish ones
and if the war monuments or near the

714
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:15,330
churches, that tends to happen more in
areas that were still Christianized,

715
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:18,060
where people still went to church.
And I mentioned this once before,

716
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,640
but if you go to the booboo
nay or the Rda, you still,

717
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:24,690
you find these war memorials that are
sort of like Voltaire of God exists.

718
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,530
How could he or she let this
happen with broken crosses,

719
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:32,280
shattered crosses that were lamenting
that this could happen in a,

720
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,830
in a so called civilized world.
And of course,

721
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:38,520
one thing that happens after the
war, it as, as Charles pointed out,

722
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:42,630
you know the other day is that if
you've been told, if you ate, if you,

723
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,810
you're an African in their urination and
you've been told that this is the great

724
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,690
civilization, that the Europeans,
they've got it all, you know,

725
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:51,660
you've been told by them that
they're better than you. How do you,

726
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,830
how do you reconcile that to what they're
screaming at you and they're little

727
00:45:55,831 --> 00:46:00,780
schools trying to teach you
their language? If they're,
if they're so damn better,

728
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,850
how could they bring, uh, all
of this upon, uh, upon Europe?

729
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,230
There is by the way,

730
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,560
but one soldier left in Great
Britain who still alive for more.

731
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:17,010
We're one,
he's a fellow called Harry Payne.

732
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,300
He was born in 1898 and somebody
just published a book about him.

733
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:26,490
And periodically on Armistice Day, he
is interviewed. You can hear him on BBC,

734
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,170
but with the passing of time, of
course, uh, you don't have that anymore.

735
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,980
And I can remember even my
Magennis, I can remember, you know,

736
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:39,700
seeing these very aged people
coming out in November 11th, uh,

737
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,700
so proud of, you know, of what they
did, uh, fighting and you know,

738
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,920
in the Americans too that did.
But in those days,

739
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:49,680
those were different wars and
those were different countries.

740
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,580
And I would argue also that was
a very different America. Anyway,

741
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,050
just to simply end with something
that Jay winter leaves us, uh, with.

742
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:00,360
He has a wonderful book, uh, uh,

743
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,370
about morning in memory
and he begins with a film.

744
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:09,590
He begins with a film by about Goss.
I bet a Goss ga.

745
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:14,591
And Ce did a very long overrated film
on Napoleon Napoleon with a famous

746
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:19,910
snowball fight. But he did a book.
He did, uh, uh, he takes a Zoloft,

747
00:47:19,911 --> 00:47:24,780
his title, but he did a movie called Jack
Hughes. He makes it a 19, 18 and 19, 19.

748
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:29,000
He made it before, uh, the
war. Uh, his is over. Uh,

749
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,580
the hero is a guy called John
Diaz. He's a wounded soldier, poet.

750
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,820
And he goes crazy.
He begins to lose his mind.

751
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,450
So many people that did after
all that in World War One,

752
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:45,451
he escapes from a mental hospital and he
goes back to his village and he brings

753
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:51,451
all the villagers together and he tells
him about a dream that he's had a in the

754
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,960
asylum. And um, in the dream in the movie,

755
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:59,950
you see a battlefield
graveyard with all the crosses.

756
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,020
They're all there and
they're all a skewed.

757
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,910
And a big black cloud comes up behind
the village graveyard in the ground,

758
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,030
in the, in the, in the
movie. And magically,

759
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:14,950
these ghostlike figures emerged from
the grays with tattered bandages,

760
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,280
missing arms,
their bandages to began.

761
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,440
I began to unravel around their head.

762
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:25,120
And some are blind who they've lost their
sight and some are coughing out their

763
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:30,070
lungs from the poison gas and they leave
the battlefield and they go back to

764
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:34,660
their own villages to see if the
sacrifices have been worth it.

765
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,730
And what they find is what Jay calls
the pettiness, a civilian life.

766
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,020
That the black marketing,
uh, the profiteering,

767
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,850
their wives had been sleeping around.
Uh, things aren't the way they should be.

768
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,200
Whereas they have suffered, but
they come back, they're alive again,

769
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:54,640
but they're really dead.

770
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,270
And their appearance so terrifies the
villagers that they decide the men their

771
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,570
ways and to, and to, to be
big, become better people,

772
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,020
better people. And so the, these,

773
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,330
these ghostlike figures
in their advantages,

774
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,480
they marched back to the cemetery and
they go back into their graves and it's

775
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:18,580
all over. But what's it's, it's,

776
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,960
but what's really interesting about it
is it some of the soldiers who were on

777
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,060
leave at that time on premise,

778
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:30,061
y'all were used as extras in the
movie and you can identify them.

779
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:34,540
Someone who has lost his arm. Really, it's
not a fake missing arm. It's a real one.

780
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,960
And some of them who were there in the
movie go back to the war and are killed.

781
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:48,180
They die real deaths in their
graves with their tattered vantages.

782
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,060
And as if art and reality has emerged.

783
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,150
And that's an important theme in
all of this because there's no war,

784
00:49:55,151 --> 00:50:00,151
no more powerful moment in history that
has brought us such great literature and

785
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,880
all of this,
and there's no war like this ever.

786
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,090
That end leaves so many
demons into the world,

787
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,980
and as is some of those demons that
we will now next turn, but not today.

788
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,580
Good luck than the midterm. Have
a great weekend. Rock and roll.
