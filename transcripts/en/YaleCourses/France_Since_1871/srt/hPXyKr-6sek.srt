1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,150
It,

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,311
this,

3
00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:01,920
it all,

4
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,580
uh,

5
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,210
relevant what happened in VA,

6
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:05,040
the bed.

7
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,880
I was that,

8
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,720
uh,

9
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,550
you got your basic cop car coming along
and it wasn't rolling aggressively.

10
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,001
I,

11
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,310
it was about a saying about
50 kilometers an hour.

12
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,170
And these two young,

13
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,040
uh,

14
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,420
north African extraction,

15
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,111
uh,

16
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:19,890
use,

17
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,191
uh,

18
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,420
without helmets,

19
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,170
uh,

20
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,003
were,

21
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,400
uh,

22
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,930
didn't yield to the car.

23
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,910
They were on a scooter,

24
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:26,911
you know,

25
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,320
sort of essentially a motorcycle,

26
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,041
not a big one,

27
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:29,341
but you know,

28
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:30,174
it's good hair.

29
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,850
And so that they hit the
car on the left side.

30
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,940
Unfortunately they were both
killed and then the police,

31
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,833
um,

32
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,230
state a bit and made calls.

33
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,910
But the calls that they made were more,

34
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,331
you know,

35
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,590
we have something spinning out of control.

36
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,330
It's not about how are
these two kids who are,

37
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,164
and you see,

38
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,341
they,

39
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,730
they left it there for two days.

40
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,670
They circled it always.

41
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,610
So you still see these
little guys tennis shoes,

42
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,511
you know,

43
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,340
and you see,

44
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,671
you know,

45
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:54,600
you can see the traces of them.

46
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,310
They're having expired.

47
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,330
And so VDA a Labella,

48
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,590
which is about 18
kilometers north of Paris.

49
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,460
It's near Yc,

50
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,110
it's near [inaudible] where
there's a lot of trouble.

51
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:04,944
Before it was near.

52
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,280
They're going ass.

53
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,811
It's in the,

54
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,410
in the [inaudible] um,

55
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,180
went up in flames basically in a lot.

56
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,641
Unfortunately,

57
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,220
a lot of people were
hurt in the fighting and,

58
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:17,340
and yesterday they burn
somebody who stupidly burned
the library and the library

59
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,750
is not associated with the fleet,

60
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:21,090
with the cops is not
associated with the state.

61
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,930
Even it is the municipal library
where lots of kids go and study in the

62
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:25,800
municipal library.

63
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,521
And so this was just,

64
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:26,710
you know,

65
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,300
Nocona Hey,

66
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,820
I mean this is not possible
to do stuff like that.

67
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,600
But anyway,

68
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,500
the part of the problem is,

69
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,490
and cause Sarcosy,

70
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,120
you know,

71
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,480
denigrated the people in the suburbs.

72
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,313
There's an archive,

73
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:35,911
you know,

74
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:37,770
as scum by implication,

75
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,640
uh,

76
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,473
that,

77
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,320
and uh,

78
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:42,900
was minister of the interior
during the big troubles.

79
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
And a couple of years ago,

80
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,270
which I'm going to talk
about on Wednesday,

81
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,400
the troubles we're starting clichy Suva,

82
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,080
but there's a lot of,

83
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,560
in Toulouse where they had been trouble,

84
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,191
uh,

85
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:50,851
two years ago.

86
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,320
Now it's happening in two news too,

87
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,010
but I didn't,

88
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,240
I'll watch it this afternoon,

89
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,190
but it's,

90
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,940
this is a problem.

91
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,863
It's going to be a,

92
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,260
it's gonna be a problem for a while.

93
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,050
And what's makes it a little more scary
is that this was an incident where they

94
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:05,300
have an instance where the police are,

95
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:05,880
you know,

96
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,490
the police systematically control
people of color systematically in,

97
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,280
in France,

98
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
systematically.

99
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,560
I go through Barbara Joie Schwab,

100
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,060
which is a,

101
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,650
uh,

102
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,810
is a metro stop,

103
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,670
a famous for this first place that
somebody shot and killed a German officer.

104
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,880
And during Vishi and uh,

105
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,870
or the Guard Leo,

106
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,704
I was there then Garland,

107
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,850
garland will not the other day,

108
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,720
but at the end of uh,

109
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,960
November or for that matter,

110
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,370
after Sarcozi was elected,

111
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,291
you go to the garden,

112
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,380
the own metro stop.

113
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,970
And also when you turn the corner
and then you got 10 policemen,

114
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:41,850
they're controlling people.

115
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,231
I've lived in,

116
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,480
I spent half my life in
France for the last 30 years.

117
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,590
I've never been controlled.

118
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,723
Not once,

119
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,811
not once.

120
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,300
And I've been with people going through
and that you turn the corner and all of

121
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,134
a sudden you've got all the,

122
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
the police there.

123
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,690
And who do they pick out?

124
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,153
They don't pick out,

125
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,641
you know,

126
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:59,310
whites carrying a little
academic briefcases.

127
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,251
Uh,

128
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:05,120
they pick out everybody
practically who is young and,

129
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,340
and who is not white.

130
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,780
And so th this rubs people the
wrong way to say the least.

131
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,900
And it's part of the way
this works in the suburbs.

132
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,711
And so this incident,

133
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,730
which involved a police car was not
coming in sort of saying up against the

134
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,360
wall,

135
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,631
you know,

136
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,500
MF and all this,

137
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,970
but let's see your papers.

138
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,560
Uh,

139
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,620
cause that's what happens.

140
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,640
And I've seen that happen.

141
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,240
Uh,

142
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,360
it was just unfortunately these two
policemen who were doing anything wrong.

143
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,601
I mean,

144
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,230
they were just,

145
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,340
it was a banal trip
through a banal suburb.

146
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,810
I happened to hit these two,

147
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,910
two kids who were not wearing helmets.

148
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,744
And so they were killed.

149
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,591
But this is,

150
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:38,891
you know,

151
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,110
the,

152
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,311
I mean,

153
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,540
who knows what it's
going to happen in this,

154
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,260
but this is part of when
you see La [inaudible] hate,

155
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,161
you.

156
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:45,730
See,

157
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,750
that's the best translation.

158
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,700
Simply evidence is hatred or hate.

159
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,480
And to understand how
people in the suburbs feel,

160
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
you have to understand the
relationship between both,

161
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,430
and I'm going to do this
again in more detail.

162
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,690
I'd better get to what I'm doing today,

163
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,410
uh,

164
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,800
but,

165
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,633
um,

166
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,180
that it's not just young
people with not many,

167
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,650
not much of a future.

168
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,251
Uh,

169
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:07,690
it also is a,

170
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:12,691
mostly has to do with underprivileged
and underappreciated minorities,

171
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,170
uh,

172
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,340
pitted against,

173
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,440
uh,

174
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:16,770
the,

175
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,620
the crs,

176
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,370
the national kind of military police
as well as the municipal police.

177
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,001
And of course,

178
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:22,360
what the,

179
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,730
what the government of
of act did was of course,

180
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,870
take away all the money virtually
for voluntary associations that,

181
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,960
that our bridges to helping
integrate people in,

182
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,100
into,

183
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,550
uh,

184
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,670
into the communities in which they live
and into the state in which they live.

185
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,050
But,

186
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,540
uh,

187
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:37,721
you know,

188
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,081
say five,

189
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,100
you don't come with the office phone say,

190
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,371
I mean,

191
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:40,204
it's just a,

192
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh,

193
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,800
well,

194
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,633
there we go.

195
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,550
Um,

196
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,201
how did we get out of that?

197
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,880
We got on that because it's
important to talk about,

198
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,050
uh,

199
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,883
Ali.

200
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,740
So today I'm going to talk
about Charles de Gaulle,

201
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,731
uh,

202
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,710
in November,

203
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,400
in November,

204
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,500
1970,

205
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,720
it's a passive eaten of the tall.

206
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,890
Uh,

207
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,210
I was a student in Paris,

208
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,310
just a little older than you and
living in a 11 frank and night hotel.

209
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,191
And the room is still,

210
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:10,930
the price that was about $2
a night in my hotel room.

211
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,790
Wasn't worth that actually,

212
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,040
but it was kind of an
interesting place to live.

213
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,173
Uh,

214
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,070
a four then I was living in Limos,

215
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,670
uh,

216
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,410
for a lot of the year to,

217
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,700
um,

218
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,170
I went to the archives one day about,

219
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,130
you know,

220
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,850
get there early,

221
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,683
which I always do.

222
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,640
And this little man who had been
with World War Two veteran who would,

223
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,160
uh,

224
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
lost most of his arm in the war,

225
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,190
uh,

226
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,330
who would check my id,

227
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:34,841
but he knew me.

228
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:35,710
So there's no problem.

229
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,550
Uh,

230
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,400
my wife used to come in and looking for
me when she was my wife Carrie carrying

231
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,650
a baby and the groceries,

232
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,484
and it's all very,

233
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,050
very,

234
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,560
they call track TAVR and foremost,

235
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:45,394
not that way anymore.

236
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,001
And he said,

237
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,380
we're going to close because,

238
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,190
uh,

239
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,671
this agenda,

240
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,510
Hala Lily Mar,

241
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,350
the generalist dead and
Charles de Gaulle died.

242
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,520
I had died.

243
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:54,940
Uh,

244
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,773
and I,

245
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,300
I think infuriated my gaullist friend by
saying that he died board and watching

246
00:05:59,301 --> 00:05:59,931
French TV,

247
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,720
but he was often called on Bailey.

248
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,350
They do the uglies and he had a,

249
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,850
he had died at age.

250
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,490
He must've just been 80,

251
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,770
wasn't he 80 when he died?

252
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,623
Do you remember?

253
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,221
You don't remember.

254
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:10,761
But anyway,

255
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,600
I think he was 80 when he,

256
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,793
when he died.

257
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,280
Um,

258
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,941
and so,

259
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,774
uh,

260
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
later my gaullist friend,

261
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,323
uh,

262
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,483
uh,

263
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,581
who's a lawyer,

264
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,680
a lawyer called me up and said,

265
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:21,891
look,

266
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:22,730
why don't we go down in notes,

267
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,100
go dom and the go to the mass.

268
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,620
So the gold didn't want to have a mass.

269
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,011
And,

270
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,570
uh,

271
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:28,960
uh,

272
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,290
I didn't really want to go down to note,

273
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,330
and I'm going to go to the
mass for Charles to Gaulle,

274
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:32,651
but he said,

275
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:33,484
he said that,

276
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,363
uh,

277
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,560
it'll be,

278
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:35,980
uh,

279
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,180
you know,

280
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,550
as a historical event,

281
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:38,384
we should be there.

282
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,231
You should see it.

283
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:39,960
And so I went down,

284
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,490
we didn't went down to three in the
morning and waited in line and then they'd

285
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,380
flown into all these people.

286
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,640
Haile Selassie was there.

287
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:50,270
Those kind of amazing to see high Haile
Selassie and the odious Richard Nixon

288
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:50,911
was there and,

289
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,810
and all these leaders with
rather minimum security.

290
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,520
This was not in high security time.

291
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,250
You could see people were carrying
machine guns up on the towers.

292
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,830
You could see people in the cathedral up.

293
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,860
I was about the only person that
anyone saw get frisk and going in.

294
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,360
They looked at me and said,

295
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,500
we want to check you out.

296
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,690
So they checked me out with
the long hair and all that.

297
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,720
But we got in there and it was a,

298
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:10,911
you know,

299
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:14,030
it was a moment of
[inaudible] history and uh,

300
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,811
uh,

301
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:15,680
it was something,

302
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:15,831
uh,

303
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:20,831
to see his influence on French life and
the memory of French life can hardly,

304
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,731
I mean,

305
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:27,731
the collective memory of collective
memory in French life can hardly be

306
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,660
underestimated.

307
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,050
Yet.

308
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,180
It was so long ago that he died,

309
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,201
uh,

310
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,130
and the party that,

311
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,461
you know,

312
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:34,881
the beard,

313
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,160
his name disappeared,

314
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,840
that even if someone likes soft,

315
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,220
cozy or before him,

316
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:40,820
uh,

317
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:40,910
uh,

318
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,481
Jukka show,

319
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,030
Haka would go to Columbia.

320
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:46,340
They dues uglies it's village and the
[inaudible] and in the east of France,

321
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,330
um,

322
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,090
to have their picture taken in
front of his tomb with the qual.

323
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,320
The Lohan a de Gaulle
seems like a long time ago,

324
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,460
uh,

325
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,320
but what he did in 1958 is of
course to rescue the French state,

326
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,430
uh,

327
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,100
and to define a,

328
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:04,940
in his own,

329
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,660
his own person edge,

330
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,290
a certain idea of France that he,

331
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,980
uh,

332
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,060
did he represented.

333
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,000
And to borrow a Catholic image,

334
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,430
the gall who was born in Lille right near,

335
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,241
as I said the other day,

336
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,150
right near the fortress lead
as a pretty Catholic town.

337
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,090
He was not himself a
practicing religious man,

338
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:30,860
but I suppose it's a religious image that
I somehow have retained in the back of

339
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:35,120
my mind from the days at the good
old Jesuit high school in Portland,

340
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:35,954
Oregon.

341
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,003
Uh,

342
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,760
that,

343
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:37,841
uh,

344
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:42,080
he saw himself as the
mystical body of France,

345
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,850
that somehow the whole,

346
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,900
that is his body,

347
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:45,711
his percentage,

348
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:50,711
his very being was bigger than all of
the parts that constituted the body of

349
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,041
France.

350
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,150
And he represent,

351
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,810
he represents in France
with his fairy existence.

352
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,330
And that this was,

353
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,960
this was how he wanted to be remembered.

354
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,570
And when he leaves power in 1969 in a,

355
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,000
after a rather obscure,

356
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,290
um,

357
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,360
election plebiscite really,

358
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,740
um,

359
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,590
that that image still was retained.

360
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,090
There are really three elements
that represented his image.

361
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,283
Um,

362
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,980
and the myth of Charles de
Gaulle after world war two,

363
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,610
um,

364
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,610
that he was the providential figure who
through his own determination had saved

365
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:40,740
France and it's honor
after the blowout of May,

366
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,170
June,

367
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,550
1940,

368
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:43,730
uh,

369
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,070
that,

370
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,070
that as his voice crackled over the BBC
and the 18th of June 18 and 1940 a date

371
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,550
is still commemorized a commemorated a
every year when there's a ghost in power

372
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,550
and mirror mirror of France such as,

373
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,080
uh,

374
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,250
uh,

375
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,960
a Shafak.

376
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,390
There'd always been a little
event to commemorate that,

377
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,320
that he had restored
the integrity of France.

378
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,030
If my friend Bob Paxton,

379
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,610
as I remind you the other day,

380
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,780
a argued that that pay tie,

381
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,280
he might've saved the French state,

382
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,050
but he did not save the French nation.

383
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:19,140
He destroyed it by destroying
liberty fraternity equality.

384
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,550
And what that means,

385
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:20,890
uh,

386
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,330
that Charles de Gaulle had
restored the integrity of,

387
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,710
of France had restored the Po,

388
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,830
the sovereignty of French over their own,

389
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,233
uh,

390
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,770
over their own political existence,

391
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:38,580
which is obvious and the republic itself,

392
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,250
uh,

393
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,120
by being involved in the
curation of the fourth republic.

394
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,640
But then repudiating the
way it was established,

395
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:48,810
wanting a centralized executive
authority and all of that.

396
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,470
And then a golf pouting Toussaint,

397
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,820
uh,

398
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,091
to,

399
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:51,610
uh,

400
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:51,730
uh,

401
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,610
Columbian they do as the uglies,

402
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,883
um,

403
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,440
that he'd then he'd reunified
the nation after the civil war.

404
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,120
Uh,

405
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,350
that was Vichy.

406
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:04,891
But again,

407
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:09,180
with the goal is twist is that everybody
had basically resisted or wanted to

408
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:13,560
resist that they were always ready with
the gun nearby to go and kill the German

409
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,420
when they could and restore France.

410
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,653
Um,

411
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,400
uh,

412
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,570
and that every,

413
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,250
that hardly anyone had collaborated.

414
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:20,851
So this was the,

415
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:25,380
so the goal is take on this and that
he'd restored the centralized state,

416
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,760
not after World War Two,

417
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,760
because,

418
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,130
uh,

419
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,470
we're,

420
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,780
uh,

421
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,590
cause the force republic was as her swing
door ministry is rather like the third

422
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,310
republic,

423
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,210
which as in the case of the third
republic gave the illusion that French

424
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:42,780
political life was more unstable
than it was because the,

425
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:44,280
the deputies of the Fourth Republic,

426
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,170
like the deputies of the third republic,

427
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,330
it was a club where the same people were,

428
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:48,990
were,

429
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,380
you know,

430
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,740
reelected time and time again
from the same constituencies.

431
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,850
But the golf thing with it,

432
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,684
the only,

433
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,680
uh,

434
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,680
the only form of government that could
restore the integrity of France and,

435
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,950
uh,

436
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,950
in the factions of parliamentary
corals and poor lane.

437
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,671
And he hates you.

438
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,630
Hated the communists,

439
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:11,410
of course,

440
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,930
was a strongly centralized government.

441
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,370
And for that he had to wait
as new now know until sank.

442
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:22,371
Won't tweet until 1958 with a
constitution written for him by Michelle

443
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,093
[inaudible],

444
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,623
uh,

445
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,350
who personified gall ism itself and
whose son is an important figure in

446
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,610
contemporary France.

447
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,390
Um,

448
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,841
and that,

449
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,520
and this is very important for,

450
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,510
uh,

451
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,510
the goal of view of France is that he
had freed France in his mind from the

452
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,820
anarchy of political parties and,

453
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,360
uh,

454
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,810
that we're quarrelling a parliamentary
government that he didn't think he had

455
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:57,670
worked that was incapable of
restoring the grand juror of France.

456
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,600
A word he too,

457
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,580
which he returned
constantly more about that,

458
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,010
uh,

459
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,870
in a while.

460
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,680
Um,

461
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,680
strengthening the French state under a
new constitution that written by the way,

462
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,210
uh,

463
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:10,690
that,

464
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,350
um,

465
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,700
that gave France a strong executive with
a president who would be in power for

466
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,350
seven years and who had executive
strong executive authority.

467
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,870
Now those of you who know
anything about France before 1871,

468
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,080
if this doesn't sound like
Napoleon both and one Napoleon,

469
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:34,480
the first and in three Napoleon,

470
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,314
the third,

471
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,040
uh,

472
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,251
you know,

473
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,084
it's an obvious,

474
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,540
uh,

475
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,111
thing to say,

476
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,260
but it's still true that in 70,

477
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:41,681
there's no need.

478
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:42,880
You should know this was something you do.

479
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,970
1799 and the 18th of bloom Air Napoleon
Hill with the help of the Wiley I bay

480
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,890
cas.

481
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:51,571
Uh,

482
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:51,741
the,

483
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:51,941
the,

484
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,410
the pre cas who wrote,

485
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:55,930
what is the third estate overthrow?

486
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,070
The assembly.

487
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,050
Napoleon had a bit of a
faltering and his brother,

488
00:13:59,051 --> 00:13:59,500
Lucien,

489
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,260
I helped him out there because he
lost the only time in his life.

490
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,820
He really lost his courage.

491
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:04,600
Um,

492
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,600
they overthrow the government and imposed
a council it in which Napoleon becomes

493
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,700
the first council and
finally snatches the crown.

494
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,670
It is thought from the
pope and crowns himself.

495
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,773
Emperor.

496
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,800
Um,

497
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,170
and Napoleon adopts that,

498
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,180
what will become the most gaullist
political strategy and shared by that of

499
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,390
governments of North Korea,

500
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,670
among other dictatorships,

501
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,330
uh,

502
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,330
that is the plebiscite where you
ask people with a k a kg question,

503
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,690
do you agree?

504
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:38,200
For example,

505
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,220
the pulley and the third,

506
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:39,640
uh,

507
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,470
just before the fall of the whole mass,

508
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:42,550
at the end of the 18,

509
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,180
uh,

510
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,600
sixties in 18,

511
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,430
1970s,

512
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,950
a plebiscite.

513
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,630
You agree with the reforms that have
been undertaken by our glorious empire,

514
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,241
Emperor Cetera,

515
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:50,990
et Cetera.

516
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,190
If you write no,

517
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:52,641
you're saying,

518
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,170
well I don't really like reforms.

519
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,500
And so therefore you say yes
cause you liked reforms are yes,

520
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:58,850
cause you liked to pull in the third.

521
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,790
And so naturally the plebiscite
is like a South Korean,

522
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,780
I mean North Korean plebiscite where 99%
of the people say we sweating Napoleon.

523
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,614
The third did,

524
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,100
uh,

525
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,930
after he overthrew the second republic.

526
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,480
Um,

527
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,470
so there are strong
continuity's between Napoleon,

528
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,550
uh,

529
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,780
between Napoleon and the idea of
centralized state overcoming this of

530
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:19,760
quarrelling frack factions,

531
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,480
uh,

532
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,871
uh,

533
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:21,291
of,

534
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:21,750
uh,

535
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,960
of,

536
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,241
of,

537
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:22,911
of France.

538
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,670
And in the first put
an end to what it was,

539
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,250
was called the rather colorfully
and unfortunate phrase,

540
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:29,870
but the war of the chamber pots,

541
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,261
uh,

542
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:31,094
that was,

543
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,221
uh,

544
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,500
the French directory
before this whole thing,

545
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:33,900
this is,

546
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,371
is over,

547
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:34,870
gone,

548
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,703
overthrown.

549
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,940
And so there's appeal
appeal to the nation.

550
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,830
And Napoleon was,

551
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,460
uh,

552
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,611
you know,

553
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:43,940
one of the originators of an
aggressive kind of nationalism,

554
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,310
but Napoleon was perceived
as somebody over the,

555
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,144
on the left,

556
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:47,811
uh,

557
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,650
Napoleon the third,

558
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,770
and when importer's appointing the third
and 1841 wrote a book called a little

559
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:52,970
pamphlet called property,

560
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:53,440
uh,

561
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,350
about property,

562
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:56,640
about I'll call the
extinction of a popper ism.

563
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,000
Uh,

564
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and the idea that somehow the caring
state cares about all people in France and

565
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:08,240
that p all people in France find part
of their identity in the notion of being

566
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,074
French.

567
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,000
And as you already know from
things we've talked about,

568
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,360
that part of nationalism
was the sort of aggressive,

569
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:14,930
uh,

570
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:14,991
uh,

571
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:19,190
carrying of the French language into
corners in which it was not spoken or

572
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:23,300
spoken only as a second
way of speaking language,

573
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,880
dialect in Patois,

574
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,811
et Cetera,

575
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,644
et cetera.

576
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,693
Um,

577
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,073
so,

578
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,250
uh,

579
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,250
the idea of a national will represented
in the body of a strong executive

580
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,670
authority is a Napoleon idea that,

581
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,360
uh,

582
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,990
that,

583
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,650
uh,

584
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,240
they'll pull pollyannic idea,

585
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:44,700
uh,

586
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,430
that became part of,

587
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,473
of the,

588
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,540
the political existence of de Gaulle and
ultimately of the goal is of Gall Ism.

589
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,240
But you had to have the idea of
it being ratified by the people.

590
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,570
Thus plebiscites now pay town.

591
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,160
The differences is that pay town,

592
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,970
uh,

593
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,530
in World War Two,

594
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,010
uh,

595
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,770
the national revolution in quote with,

596
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,370
uh,

597
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,280
the Marshall,

598
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,141
again,

599
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,760
the military connection,

600
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,310
Napoleon pay Petain as he saw it.

601
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:16,890
And,

602
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,723
and uh,

603
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,000
it,

604
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,770
the goal,

605
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,910
it was never ratified by any kind of
popular vote because it wasn't a thought

606
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,150
even more authoritarian
government under Vichy,

607
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:27,770
the 1920s and the 30s where the,

608
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,460
uh,

609
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,660
and the first half of the 1940 [inaudible]
was the wave of authoritarianism.

610
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,381
The cost,

611
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,330
the lives of so many millions of people.

612
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,030
I need not remind you.

613
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,330
And that Bonaparte's Ism as in golf ism
involved the kind of stamp of popular

614
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:50,051
approval seeing in the plebiscites of
19 eight and in subsequent plebiscites.

615
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:55,110
And he goes out in 1969 after he loses,

616
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,960
uh,

617
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,290
he,

618
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,850
he,

619
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,590
they lose,

620
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,811
uh,

621
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,010
the plebiscite.

622
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,240
He says he on January 18th or no,

623
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:02,730
there must be,

624
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,750
I must have written this wrong.

625
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,421
It must be the,

626
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:04,651
these,

627
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,670
we just round the eye.

628
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,180
Uh,

629
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,830
it must be June 18th,

630
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,220
1940 he says,

631
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,671
I,

632
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,210
he,

633
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,820
he often said we the royal we,

634
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,320
but in this case he said,

635
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,183
I,

636
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,510
cause he wasn't yet running the show.

637
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,500
I General de Gaulle,

638
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,120
French soldier and leader and conscious
that I am speaking in the name of

639
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:21,954
France,

640
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,700
that I represent France,

641
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,540
again,

642
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,350
the mystical a body.

643
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,350
And he showed the bay again,

644
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:28,471
d,

645
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:28,591
e,

646
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:33,591
B r e a who wrote this constitution of
58 said that the only chance for French

647
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,280
democracy,

648
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:35,761
uh,

649
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:39,900
if that term it may be used is
to have a republican monarch.

650
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,273
And that was,

651
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:41,970
uh,

652
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,250
the Gaullist view of,

653
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,070
uh,

654
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,440
of the goal.

655
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,670
Um,

656
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,380
but,

657
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,213
um,

658
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,240
he resigned on the 20th
of June in 1946 and,

659
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:56,850
and the Fourth Republic
comes into existence,

660
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,600
uh,

661
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,210
with out him now.

662
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,044
Um,

663
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,230
when he returns to power in 58,

664
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,730
it was after,

665
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,151
uh,

666
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:09,060
because of the chaos of what
happened was happening in Algeria,

667
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,690
that republican institutions
seem to have been discredited.

668
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,190
And so he has the upper hand there to,

669
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,910
uh,

670
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,330
to identify himself with
the strongly centralized,

671
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,990
uh,

672
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,760
French,

673
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,030
uh,

674
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,970
a state.

675
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,040
It was clear in 1958 as it
had been clear with Napoleon,

676
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,553
uh,

677
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,950
though this as different case,

678
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:32,940
Napoleon one,

679
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,240
that it was only only de Gaulle at that
moment who could impose discipline on

680
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,840
the French army.

681
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Thus the howls of betrayal when the other
generals say he's gonna make Algeria

682
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,400
Algeria become free,

683
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,740
and thus the sense of betrayal.

684
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,320
And they try to,

685
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,100
uh,

686
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,521
uh,

687
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,120
to kill him.

688
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,481
And so,

689
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:58,770
but for all of his,

690
00:19:58,771 --> 00:19:59,604
you know,

691
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,290
verbal and his respect for an
endorsement of popular sovereignty,

692
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,500
but to his tool of state is
really often the plebiscite,

693
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:07,921
which is,

694
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,900
which is you can argue a serve a sham,

695
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,790
a tool of,

696
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,653
um,

697
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,450
of a democracy.

698
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,660
What and what he does,

699
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,733
uh,

700
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,960
in reflecting the fact that the early 18,

701
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,720
80,

702
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,780
the 1880s and the 1890s,

703
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,860
or the period of mass politics when the
first political parties are created,

704
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,221
I mean,

705
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:32,460
Napoleon first and deploying in third
did not create political parties.

706
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,690
Political parties did not exist in France
or they existed and the wigs and the

707
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:39,330
Tories a existed in England already.

708
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,021
But that is a long,

709
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:40,854
complicated,

710
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,180
a story that started,

711
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,680
it starts with the runup to the
English civil war at the end of the,

712
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,853
the middle end,

713
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,441
middle of the,

714
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,270
of the 17th century.

715
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,510
But he creates a political party,

716
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:51,860
uh,

717
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,021
that,

718
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:55,150
that will support him and
his support and the people.

719
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,020
A lot of the people who were gall us in,

720
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:58,590
in the late 1940s,

721
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,200
where people were part of the
[inaudible] of the MRP or whatever,

722
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:01,320
the,

723
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,441
the,

724
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:01,970
the,

725
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,170
the big Mass Catholic,

726
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,770
uh,

727
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:03,921
uh,

728
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:04,790
political party,

729
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,990
which was extremely,

730
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,510
uh,

731
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,970
a conservative.

732
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,133
Um,

733
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,550
but he,

734
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,443
uh,

735
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,190
the essence of this was,

736
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,580
uh,

737
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,050
was strongly centralized,

738
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:18,861
uh,

739
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:19,780
authority,

740
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:20,850
uh,

741
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,750
consciously

742
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,700
patterned himself after the
Napoleon's or after Boone.

743
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:27,901
Jay,

744
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:28,734
for that matter.

745
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,670
Uh,

746
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,070
he,

747
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,200
he been born in 1890 [inaudible] but,

748
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,951
but brought up in,

749
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:35,790
I think he was born in lead.

750
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,181
I'm sure he's,

751
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:39,240
I've seen his house in which I thought
he was born in legal that he's brought up

752
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,074
in Paris.

753
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,740
Uh,

754
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,520
he,

755
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,790
uh,

756
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,940
he loved the Arctic screen
off and he loved all the lead,

757
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:46,290
which is where Napoleon,

758
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,040
uh,

759
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,790
is,

760
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,623
um,

761
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,220
is buried.

762
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,610
I got it.

763
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,860
I just give you a small story.

764
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,401
I,

765
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:54,870
which I don't think I've ever related.

766
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:55,530
There was a famous,

767
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:55,931
is a fair,

768
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,270
most American tennis player,

769
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,050
uh,

770
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,890
who the first time this
tennis player was in the,

771
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,110
the French Open,

772
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,620
uh,

773
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,290
which is sponsored by the [inaudible].

774
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,710
Uh,

775
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,970
they took this tennis player on a tour
of Paris and the tour got kind of old for

776
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:09,960
this particular player.

777
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,320
After about an hour and a half,

778
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,720
uh,

779
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,210
uh,

780
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,850
person had seen enough
and then finally said,

781
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:15,481
some journalists said,

782
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:16,530
what do you like best about,

783
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,910
about what you saw in Paris?

784
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:18,960
And the tennis player said,

785
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,471
Oh,

786
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,380
I really liked the tumor,

787
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,630
the little dead dude.

788
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,080
And the little dead dude is of,

789
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:23,371
of course,

790
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:24,204
Napoleon.

791
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:24,900
And,

792
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,290
uh,

793
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,380
that image is still in
apoe two Napoleon's tomb,

794
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,610
which you see from above.

795
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,900
You can't see in the two of them.

796
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,970
It's not like when you're
looking at Lennon or something.

797
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,660
Uh,

798
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,050
but,

799
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,411
uh,

800
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:34,910
you know,

801
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,400
it is a massive tourist draw.

802
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:36,601
And,

803
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:37,181
and that,

804
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,320
that is something that's always happened.

805
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,700
It's always been the case since then.

806
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,180
Um,

807
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,580
he was a lecturer at a meal
at the Military College of,

808
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:42,781
of,

809
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:43,720
of here,

810
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,740
uh,

811
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:44,891
uh,

812
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:45,680
near Paris.

813
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,700
And he lectured on Napoleon's
military campaigns.

814
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,150
And particularly that of 1805,

815
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,691
uh,

816
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:53,770
when he organized the,

817
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:57,340
the French free forces
in North Africa in 41,

818
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,180
uh,

819
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,660
he referred to Napoleon's
campaigns that he had.

820
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,291
He had,

821
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:02,890
uh,

822
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,490
uh,

823
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,330
that he'd studied,

824
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:04,700
uh,

825
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,980
a very carefully,

826
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:06,581
uh,

827
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:10,170
but he knew also that because
the French constitution,

828
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,870
uh,

829
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,820
his head written written,

830
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:14,790
that is the third republic and of
the Fourth Republic had been written

831
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,520
reflecting the fear of
people like Napoleon,

832
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,070
the Napoleon's of Caesar,

833
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,360
Ism,

834
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,890
uh,

835
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,491
that he,

836
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:21,701
I,

837
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,690
he realized,

838
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:22,901
uh,

839
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,440
that,

840
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,771
uh,

841
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:24,760
that that was always,

842
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:25,490
um,

843
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,323
uh,

844
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,390
that was always a possibility and,

845
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:33,510
and always spoke highly
of things like popular,

846
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,950
a sovereignty.

847
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,400
He always used to kind of appeals to,

848
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,120
uh,

849
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,720
uh,

850
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,020
to the French masses that
Napoleon himself had done.

851
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,430
So effectively,

852
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm about that in a minute.

853
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:50,470
And his sort of plunging into
the crowds to the horror of,

854
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:50,871
of his,

855
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:51,260
uh,

856
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,400
of his guards.

857
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,090
Something happened when Gorbachev came
to the United States and Gorbachev was

858
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:56,870
so,

859
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,081
you know,

860
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:59,790
such an impressive person
and such an underappreciated,

861
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,643
great man.

862
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,460
Uh,

863
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,370
and Gorbachev,

864
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,840
Uhh,

865
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,400
just shocked his guards by,

866
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,920
by getting out of the big black limousine,

867
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:07,310
uh,

868
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,160
near the mall in Washington
and sort of plunging,

869
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:13,670
giving high fives and equivalent Russian
equivalents of high fives that people

870
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:14,690
in the crowd when we're,

871
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,200
you know,

872
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,420
the,

873
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,630
the guards were just
scared to death because of,

874
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,020
you know,

875
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,340
we'd lost a Kennedy and,

876
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,174
and the,

877
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,800
and all of this to Kennedy's indeed.

878
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:22,820
And because of,

879
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:23,390
uh,

880
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,580
uh,

881
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,780
security issues and the gall who had
survived these various assassinations of

882
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,940
Tamsen one in which,

883
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:29,121
you know,

884
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:29,541
as I said,

885
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,450
it's just this huge man's car,

886
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,190
which is riddled by machine guns,

887
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,270
have a couple of guys firing and came
out and he escaped absolutely unscathed.

888
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:38,960
Uh,

889
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,141
you know,

890
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:41,900
Napoleon was only wounded
three times very lightly.

891
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,670
And Napoleon seem to have this view.

892
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:44,810
There's a guy that comes out of,

893
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,700
you know,

894
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,690
saintly [inaudible] romantic battling
figures in the medieval times that,

895
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,950
that they were the god and made
them immune to physical danger.

896
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,450
And that if somebody
fired in the 17th century,

897
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,101
bulleted,

898
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:02,270
such person that they could cast the
bullet as of Superman or some ridiculous

899
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:02,930
video thing,

900
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,561
catch them in their,

901
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:04,310
in their,

902
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,820
uh,

903
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,960
kits from in their teeth.

904
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,940
But part of this is the popular appeal
of this man who was full of famous things

905
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:11,780
that he said.

906
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,470
Uh,

907
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,000
uh,

908
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,510
he never attended his witticisms.

909
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:14,661
I mean,

910
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:16,340
they may have virtually no sense of humor.

911
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:16,491
I mean,

912
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:16,761
he was a,

913
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:17,410
he's a,

914
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,160
a cynic but a very smart man.

915
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:19,650
But he,

916
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,260
and he's probably best
to remember for saying,

917
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,200
how can you possibly run a country?

918
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,430
I don't think he used the word rule run.

919
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,510
That would have been a mistake that would
have been left seem to the royal we,

920
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,800
which he used constantly.

921
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,430
How can you run a country that has 268,

922
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,911
uh,

923
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:36,470
different kinds of cheese?

924
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,510
It's also complex.

925
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,111
In fact,

926
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:42,560
there are many more than
268 times kinds of cheese.

927
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:45,560
There's probably 268 different
kinds of people don't,

928
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:47,090
which are small goats cheese,

929
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,640
uh,

930
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:47,780
uh,

931
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,710
produced in,

932
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,730
uh,

933
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,563
in the south,

934
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,820
uh,

935
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,710
east of France.

936
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:53,870
And in other places,

937
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,040
but what organized all this stuff
together and his thinking is that France

938
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,540
cannot be France without
gone Jew without grinder.

939
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,220
So one of the,

940
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:04,731
uh,

941
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:09,731
one of the compelling aspects of his
existence was that how you keep a power

942
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,830
that is no longer really a great power
in a world that had been divided among

943
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:20,090
two great powers,

944
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,900
how you keep a diminished great,

945
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:24,920
great power,

946
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,360
a great power.

947
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,680
How do you do that?

948
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,110
So there were two ways,

949
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,620
very vehemently anticommunist
through the whole thing,

950
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:37,040
but more realistic than the Americans
always more realistic than Americans.

951
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,110
And this will tie together in a minute.

952
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,400
Two ways.

953
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,690
One is that you maintain
forceful independence.

954
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,480
Visa vi the Americans and the Soviets,

955
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,760
the clash of these two,

956
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,650
these two civilizations,

957
00:26:55,651 --> 00:27:00,630
both with their monumental exaggerations
and both with her monumental problems,

958
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:03,430
the American's problems
less bloody than uh,

959
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,330
the tradition in the Soviet Union.

960
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,230
How do you do that?

961
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,060
So you become independent,

962
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,440
you leave NATO,

963
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:11,550
you throw the Americans out.

964
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,880
Thus he's huge air bases that
were once full of American planes,

965
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,280
full of American air force people
and soldiers and Chateau Hulu.

966
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:19,051
And all these places,

967
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:21,600
I mentioned this before now empty,

968
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,030
just big parking lots essentially.

969
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:27,030
You can still see him all over the place
or Leon or there's another good one.

970
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,201
You're,

971
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:33,201
you're independent and you insist
on having the Foss [inaudible],

972
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,020
foss f like forest and the De de and
then for proper f r a p p d and a FAP is

973
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:42,091
not,

974
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,640
sounds like something has served
that coffee to it or Starbucks,

975
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:45,210
but,

976
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:45,451
uh,

977
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:45,900
it is,

978
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,440
uh,

979
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,340
the nuclear capacity
and there are so France,

980
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:51,390
it's going to be independent.

981
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,980
It's going to have a nuclear capacity.

982
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:54,330
The Americans had at atomic bomb,

983
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,020
the Soviet Union had to tell him like
bomb the Americans had used an atomic

984
00:27:58,021 --> 00:27:58,854
bomb.

985
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,980
Israelis probably did not
yet have the atomic bomb,

986
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:06,150
but soon when I in India
would later and the Pakistan,

987
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,650
Pakistanis and uh,

988
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:08,270
as you know,

989
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:08,560
uh,

990
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,210
uh,

991
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,043
uh,

992
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,040
uh,

993
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,480
Chinese as well.

994
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,480
So that leads to point number two.

995
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,490
That is by being independent
and by being French,

996
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,910
that you maintain your influence in
places even as they are being decolonized

997
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,011
that place.

998
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:28,844
It's like muddy,

999
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,353
for example,

1000
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,230
or Senegal or x,

1001
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:33,811
Zaire,

1002
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:34,441
the Congo,

1003
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:35,160
which was,

1004
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,700
you know,

1005
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,390
the awful Leopold's private territory
before the Belgian parliament took it

1006
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:39,990
over,

1007
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,260
you know,

1008
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,310
at the end of the 19th century,

1009
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,750
beginning of the 20th
century because of the,

1010
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,460
just the massacres,

1011
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,323
the,

1012
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,480
the slaughter of local people by sort of
Belgian in a mercenary types and all of

1013
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:56,181
this that these places that even after
Algeria and before that Morocco and

1014
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,260
Tunisia become independent,

1015
00:28:59,261 --> 00:28:59,401
that,

1016
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:04,110
that the influence of La Belle false
in places like Vietnam after the French

1017
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:06,780
leave because of French civilization,

1018
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,740
the civilizing mission,

1019
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:11,580
the French language Lennet Lebanon
and another very good example,

1020
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,230
French influence in Lebanon,

1021
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,160
a terribly,

1022
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,993
terribly important.

1023
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,670
And that this kind of influence,

1024
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,840
a cultural influence and a
political influence of being
an honest broker between

1025
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:29,001
these two big colossal powers
will help accentuate Francis,

1026
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,681
uh,

1027
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,690
existence as a,

1028
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,290
as a great power continued
to exist as a great pocket.

1029
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:41,380
But there's a contradiction there because
France was no longer a great power but

1030
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,030
wanting to be a great power.

1031
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:49,020
And so that was essential in the way
that the gall viewed Francis' role.

1032
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,080
And personally his role that
France would maintain his,

1033
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,120
it's influenced in what
they called in those days,

1034
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,620
the third world,

1035
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,210
TF monk,

1036
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:02,900
uh,

1037
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,610
that,

1038
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,510
that were,

1039
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,490
had just been freed from some of
the colonial imperial experience.

1040
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,180
Uh,

1041
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,130
but we're economically,

1042
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,820
uh,

1043
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,110
uh,

1044
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,290
a disadvantage.

1045
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,450
And that Francis historical
mission of caring civilization,

1046
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,470
French civilization,

1047
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,460
the civilizing mission,

1048
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:21,911
et Cetera,

1049
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:22,660
et Cetera,

1050
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,300
would continue in those,

1051
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,560
in that context.

1052
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,491
Now,

1053
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,470
you even saw this very recently,

1054
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,010
uh,

1055
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,010
in the case of the Bulgarian nurses who
had been in Libya accused of as Terrell

1056
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,780
complicated case,

1057
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,450
uh,

1058
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,460
of infecting a Libyan children with HIV,

1059
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,903
uh,

1060
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,940
with HIV and who had been condemned
to death and had been in prison for,

1061
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,170
I don't remember how long.

1062
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,340
And one of the first things that Sarcozi
does is he sends his wife was no longer

1063
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:55,120
his wife,

1064
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,600
uh,

1065
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,080
to,

1066
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,190
to Libya to,

1067
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,431
uh,

1068
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:02,431
use the influence of that
old French influence in the
Middle East to obtain the,

1069
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:03,591
the,

1070
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:05,050
the release of these,

1071
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:05,680
uh,

1072
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,400
uh,

1073
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,941
uh,

1074
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,710
of these Bulgarian nurses.

1075
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,131
Uh,

1076
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:10,870
and indeed they were
able to pull that off,

1077
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,250
I think when the nurses was Palestinian.

1078
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:13,720
But I think the other ones were Bulgarian.

1079
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,040
I'm sure they were Bulgarian.

1080
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,881
And in the,

1081
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:16,840
I'm not sure about the Palestinian,

1082
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,674
but if I think so,

1083
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,760
and it works.

1084
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:20,860
But this is an idea that we can be there.

1085
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:21,370
We can,

1086
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,390
we can intervene,

1087
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:22,780
uh,

1088
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,070
in these cases and get,

1089
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:26,380
get things happen a lot because of that.

1090
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,921
And no one,

1091
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:27,591
if you travel in,

1092
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:27,791
in,

1093
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,151
in,

1094
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:29,260
in Africa and in,

1095
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,940
in Francophone countries,

1096
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,440
uh,

1097
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,570
nobody should have any illusion about
the continued to influence a France in

1098
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:35,170
these places.

1099
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:35,811
And it is very,

1100
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:36,251
very important.

1101
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:38,110
And this is something that the goal,

1102
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:38,460
um,

1103
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,670
I believe very much.

1104
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:44,671
He seared the domination of Europe and
France by Britain and the United States

1105
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,600
using NATO as a tool.

1106
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:50,950
And so,

1107
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,221
you know,

1108
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:53,080
you could argue now that that Europe,

1109
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,560
you know,

1110
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,000
quote unquote Europe,

1111
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:56,140
the European Union,

1112
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:58,600
the European community
in all of this stuff,

1113
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,090
that the basis of this lies certainly
in what would have seen the 1920s and

1114
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,940
thirties or format of
the 1880s and nineties,

1115
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:11,941
a horribly unusual alliance
between Germany and France.

1116
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,890
And the gall moves in that direction.

1117
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,191
And,

1118
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:17,721
and so,

1119
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:17,980
uh,

1120
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,210
and that is a way of,

1121
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:20,350
of of,

1122
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:20,741
I mean,

1123
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:21,750
this is a way of,

1124
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,710
of working against us.

1125
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:27,130
We're wrong terms of circumventing
the kind of domination of,

1126
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,940
uh,

1127
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,590
of the u s uh,

1128
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:31,440
and of Britain,

1129
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,940
uh,

1130
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,190
in all of this.

1131
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:33,541
And what,

1132
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,630
what he helps do,

1133
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:35,740
and this is very important,

1134
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,760
is it ends,

1135
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,120
uh,

1136
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
all that animosity between,

1137
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,221
uh,

1138
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:44,060
helps in between Germany and in France.

1139
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,640
I can remember going up
to the Normandy beaches,

1140
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:47,451
the Norman beaches,

1141
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:48,410
and try waiting in there.

1142
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:50,030
I imagine all these
people shooting at you,

1143
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,631
uh,

1144
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:50,871
you know,

1145
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:51,621
in 6th of June,

1146
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,431
1944,

1147
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,310
when you go to Omaha Beach or Utah beach
or one of these places and it's full of

1148
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:56,150
Americans going there.

1149
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:58,790
It's full of very old
Americans going there.

1150
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,540
Uh,

1151
00:32:59,540 --> 00:32:59,781
you know,

1152
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:01,490
to see where they had lost a lot of,

1153
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,271
of friends.

1154
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,820
But I remember going there
and then with German plates,

1155
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,200
uh,

1156
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,480
and this is in the early 1970s,

1157
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:09,650
and still getting scared,

1158
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,860
getting stares and,

1159
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:11,271
and,

1160
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:11,500
uh,

1161
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,740
and insults that,

1162
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:12,981
you know,

1163
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,360
I could understand perfectly well.

1164
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,190
They thought they thought we
were German and we weren't.

1165
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:16,790
We were,

1166
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,211
we were,

1167
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:17,450
uh,

1168
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:17,661
you know,

1169
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:18,540
your age and,

1170
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:23,510
and just kind of traveling around and
sleeping on beaches and eating a little

1171
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:25,970
and drinking some wine
long the way and uh,

1172
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,140
and all that stuff.

1173
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,590
Uh,

1174
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,660
but the gall help put an end to that.

1175
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:30,201
And now that,

1176
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:30,501
you know,

1177
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:31,700
if you ask almost anybody,

1178
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,390
uh,

1179
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,580
cause you asked all the Germans
going into straws book to,

1180
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,414
to uh,

1181
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,970
to buy a flogging La,

1182
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:37,750
uh,

1183
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,320
or all the French going into,

1184
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:39,810
uh,

1185
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,010
uh,

1186
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,920
going over to Germany to buy what
is slightly cheaper gasoline,

1187
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,880
uh,

1188
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,031
you know,

1189
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:46,680
this isn't alliance and
the a cornerstone of,

1190
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:47,370
of Europe,

1191
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,650
particularly given the attitude of the,

1192
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,670
of the British and all the anxieties
that they have about losing their,

1193
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
their integrity,

1194
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,410
national integrity of losing pound and,

1195
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,880
and all that stuff.

1196
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,660
Um,

1197
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,490
and so,

1198
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,323
uh,

1199
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,500
the gall help make that,

1200
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,383
make that possible.

1201
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,450
He never forgot the humiliation of France
having been excluded from the allied

1202
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,480
conferences at Yalta and Potsdam.

1203
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,910
You've all seen those pictures,

1204
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,050
uh,

1205
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,070
of Stalin with,

1206
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:18,341
with,

1207
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,440
with Churchill and uh,

1208
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:23,140
and sometimes Roosevelt as well.

1209
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,300
But France was not invited.

1210
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,780
Uh,

1211
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,300
both Roosevelt and Churchill
just hated to goals,

1212
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,163
guts.

1213
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,970
They hate it as arrogance.

1214
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:32,300
And he was not a person who,

1215
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:32,860
uh,

1216
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,310
uh,

1217
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:37,000
who lacked confidence
and he was not Rigado.

1218
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,640
He was not a,

1219
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,440
you know,

1220
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,420
he was not a good time guy.

1221
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:41,440
His own family,

1222
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:42,274
by the way,

1223
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,680
his own family [inaudible] him,

1224
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,210
his children did,

1225
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,350
they didn't use to,

1226
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,460
they used route.

1227
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:48,821
I mean,

1228
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:49,654
that's amazing.

1229
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,540
Uh,

1230
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,050
uh,

1231
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,450
the goal and they hated him.

1232
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,830
They,

1233
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,171
they,

1234
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:53,411
uh,

1235
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:57,400
they had contempt for him and the goal
never forgot those personal humiliations

1236
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:00,400
and the mutations that
law falls great power.

1237
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,490
I was not invited to participate
in essentially the fate of a,

1238
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,800
of Europe and the soul that leads to 1966,

1239
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,400
uh,

1240
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,570
France withdrawing from NATO by forcing
it to transfer its headquarters from

1241
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:17,110
Paris to Bruce Mau to Brussels.

1242
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:17,841
And these,

1243
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:21,910
the army and air force bases in France
were closed and armed forces radio was

1244
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,390
moved away.

1245
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,691
So it was,

1246
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,640
it became more difficult to
listen to football games,

1247
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,240
uh,

1248
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,810
uh,

1249
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,770
on armed forces radio.

1250
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:28,000
Cause you had to get them from,

1251
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:28,750
uh,

1252
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,351
from [inaudible],

1253
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:30,280
which is an extraordinary,

1254
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,140
a minor,

1255
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,973
a minor point.

1256
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,191
And again,

1257
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:36,310
he insisted on the
development of an arsenal.

1258
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,320
Uh,

1259
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,420
that was nuclear and the anger,

1260
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:42,620
the u s government by refusing
to support the US policies in,

1261
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,650
in Vietnam.

1262
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,671
And of course,

1263
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:45,960
the French had already seen,

1264
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:46,860
you know,

1265
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,380
how stupid policies lead to bad results,

1266
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:54,000
but the Americans did not see that for
a very long time until 70,000 American

1267
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,661
soldiers.

1268
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:55,471
And God knows how many,

1269
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:55,770
uh,

1270
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,090
people,

1271
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:56,923
Vietnam,

1272
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:57,511
uh,

1273
00:35:57,511 --> 00:35:58,240
died,

1274
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,640
uh,

1275
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,960
uh,

1276
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,790
all of this,

1277
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,481
he outraged.

1278
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:01,261
And I remember this,

1279
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,071
I wasn't in Quebec,

1280
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:02,491
but he went to,

1281
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:07,491
he went to Quebec and on a state visit
and he suddenly blurts out long live free

1282
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,943
Quebec.

1283
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,610
Uh,

1284
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,050
you know,

1285
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,750
and so this costs all sorts of problems.

1286
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,603
This was in late.

1287
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,140
Uh,

1288
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,430
there's about 1967,

1289
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:16,920
if I remember correctly.

1290
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,660
Why Free Cake Quebec?

1291
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,790
Because Quebec is Nouvelle Foss.

1292
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,510
And that's where you
had 60,000 French men,

1293
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:26,070
women and children living at the time.

1294
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:28,980
There were 2.5 million English people,

1295
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,280
uh,

1296
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,113
living in,

1297
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:30,780
uh,

1298
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,110
what was the colonies in the
u s in a very one sided war.

1299
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:34,591
But again,

1300
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:36,690
the idea that if Quebec is free,

1301
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,890
if it's independent,

1302
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,020
my own personal view is it
ought to be independent.

1303
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,160
So on by back.

1304
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,140
But I mean,

1305
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,590
you know,

1306
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,650
it was just my feeling,

1307
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,981
but,

1308
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:44,400
uh,

1309
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,770
I don't know enough about it
to say that's a good idea,

1310
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:50,100
but I have the same kind of cultural
of feelings that he does about it.

1311
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,641
But I mean,

1312
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,474
this is not what you do.

1313
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,480
You're not going to state visits suddenly
announced a long lived come back.

1314
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:54,751
I mean,

1315
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:55,920
American funds say the same thing.

1316
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,340
If,

1317
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,490
you know,

1318
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,323
somebody came from,

1319
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,580
I don't know if it was a,

1320
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,763
uh,

1321
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,000
some,

1322
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,540
a Serb ambassador and an
Italian prime minister.

1323
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,590
Somebody arrives and says,

1324
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:05,251
long live new,

1325
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:06,960
free New Mexico and Texas,

1326
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:07,800
or something like that.

1327
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,430
Uh,

1328
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,110
people didn't view it very well.

1329
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,273
Um,

1330
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,001
and,

1331
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:15,210
but although he was
vehemently anticommunist,

1332
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:15,661
uh,

1333
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:17,070
he did not want,

1334
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,090
um,

1335
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,311
he,

1336
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:18,640
he,

1337
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,240
he saw himself as again,

1338
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,380
this honest broker in,

1339
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:23,310
in negotiating,

1340
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,000
uh,

1341
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,833
between,

1342
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,420
uh,

1343
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:25,620
the,

1344
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,550
these powers.

1345
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,570
Um,

1346
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:27,811
you know,

1347
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:32,811
his legacy were of these imperatives that
he had that were backed by deeds or at

1348
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:37,340
least attempts to restore the grand juror,

1349
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,010
uh,

1350
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,030
of France.

1351
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,510
Uh,

1352
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:39,900
it's,

1353
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,740
it's efficient.

1354
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:45,741
Kind of active independence is a guest
that Stanley Hoffman called it that once,

1355
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,620
uh,

1356
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,740
and this diverse diverged from
other parts of the French,

1357
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:50,574
right?

1358
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,330
Look,

1359
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,920
she a home magazine for example,

1360
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:56,370
which is always just almost comically
pro-American on every issue.

1361
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,863
The French right couldn't,

1362
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,870
what to gall did is he took the
note nationalism of Napoleon's Le,

1363
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,170
the Napoleon's,

1364
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,800
which was nationalism associated
with the general liberal left.

1365
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,470
The state will do good things for people.

1366
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,210
He transforms that,

1367
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:12,870
uh,

1368
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,990
in the evolution that you see in
the third republic to nationalism,

1369
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:20,610
moving to the nationalism of the right
into the equivalent of the union.

1370
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,670
This sacred union of World War One,

1371
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,120
a into a nationalisms have fundamentally
a nationalism of the right in France.

1372
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,940
And part of that,

1373
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,200
to make a long story short,

1374
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:38,380
is you already have seen is
based upon his anti-communism.

1375
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,970
But at the same time,

1376
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:42,420
you have all this business
about grand juror and Gloria,

1377
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:42,791
et Cetera,

1378
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,624
et Cetera,

1379
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,340
a grand jury more than glory,

1380
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,100
but in attention to,

1381
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,880
uh,

1382
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,580
even at the end of what's
called the glorious 30 years,

1383
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:56,440
the French economy takes off that you've
read about in attention to how do you

1384
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,030
modernize France?

1385
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,470
How do you make it more economically
competitive and what you do about the

1386
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,000
education system,

1387
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,330
the university system in particular,

1388
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,980
and that would come crashing
down on his head in 1968.

1389
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,641
Uh,

1390
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,474
so,

1391
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,890
uh,

1392
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,251
his,

1393
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:16,390
his deeds,

1394
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:16,691
his,

1395
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:17,950
his legacy in,

1396
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:19,330
in I've already said,

1397
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,950
I think what there is to say,

1398
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:21,491
uh,

1399
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,300
about,

1400
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:22,760
uh,

1401
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,070
uh,

1402
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,120
the practical consequences of his,

1403
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:25,570
uh,

1404
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,291
his legacy.

1405
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:26,551
But he,

1406
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:27,041
he did,

1407
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:27,281
I mean,

1408
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,270
Francis influenced,

1409
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:29,500
did a remain as a,

1410
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,071
remained in the,

1411
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:30,701
in the world,

1412
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,534
which I think is a,

1413
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,650
is a very good thing.

1414
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:33,460
But the most,

1415
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,410
the greatest legacy that he left his,

1416
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:39,580
probably his style that of
the monarchical president,

1417
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,920
the monarchical president,

1418
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,670
the,

1419
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,270
the,

1420
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,540
uh,

1421
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,010
the king of,

1422
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,471
uh,

1423
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:46,540
of the republic.

1424
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:51,910
The idea that he represented France in
a way that the sun king had represented

1425
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:56,380
France towering over France and,

1426
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,280
uh,

1427
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,280
dead overriding the interest of those
he considered to be talkers mirror a

1428
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,330
mirror.

1429
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,950
Posers are talkers,

1430
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,300
including technocrats,

1431
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:09,610
the kinds of people who
had emerged in part out of,

1432
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:10,560
out of World War II.

1433
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:11,260
We're not out of,

1434
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,790
uh,

1435
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,290
uh,

1436
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,770
uh,

1437
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,440
under the fourth republic.

1438
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,130
Um,

1439
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,840
and so he left unsolved the question of
how you educate France for new society,

1440
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:20,920
uh,

1441
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,990
how you train and modernize people.

1442
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:23,890
How do you,

1443
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,060
what do you do with the
poisonous relations between
a very powerful Patois that

1444
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,110
is employers,

1445
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:29,950
uh,

1446
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,610
and,

1447
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:30,761
uh,

1448
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,130
working class that in the 1960s was,

1449
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,020
was still extremely influenced by,

1450
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:35,410
uh,

1451
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,370
the CGT.

1452
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:40,900
He does the confederacy in generality
to lie and by the Communist Party.

1453
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,390
So there were contradictions,

1454
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:43,881
uh,

1455
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,490
in all of this,

1456
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:45,760
uh,

1457
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,760
the idea that France is a great power
when France still in France wasn't yet a

1458
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:51,880
great power.

1459
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,950
The idea that France can be independent
and therefore maintain itself as a great

1460
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,780
power by intervening by,

1461
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,230
uh,

1462
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,780
in terms of its cultural influence,

1463
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,750
its political influence in the
third world and that sort of thing.

1464
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,550
And the reality when push came to shove,

1465
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,690
they were two great powers.

1466
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,290
Uh,

1467
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,400
so it kind of,

1468
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:09,850
um,

1469
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,630
uh,

1470
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:10,721
uh,

1471
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,760
the contradictions are there.

1472
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,160
He said over and over again,

1473
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,000
uh,

1474
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,680
that he was not of the left,

1475
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,330
nor have the right.

1476
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,510
He was above the left or the right.

1477
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,130
He used the above word,

1478
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,140
a word above all the time.

1479
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,370
Uh,

1480
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,203
he said,

1481
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,320
he says just Swedes,

1482
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,750
Alma de [inaudible] these weeks.

1483
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,950
I'm a man of the war of 1914.

1484
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,581
1918.

1485
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:35,400
He was wounded,

1486
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:35,601
you know,

1487
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:36,440
I'm Belgian bridge.

1488
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:36,621
And Do,

1489
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:37,190
you know,

1490
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,210
as I said the other day,

1491
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,460
and that was the sacred union.

1492
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,271
When the,

1493
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,710
in the interest of France,

1494
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,890
these quarrelling fragments would,

1495
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,790
would give up their quarrels with
each other and would rally around,

1496
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,510
uh,

1497
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:50,990
uh,

1498
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,790
big France.

1499
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,690
That Francis historical mission was so,

1500
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,130
uh,

1501
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:02,130
as a specialty set on a 10th
of a on the 11th of December,

1502
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,520
1969 I don't want to oppose,

1503
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,020
I don't want to even triumph.

1504
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,960
I want to bring people together.

1505
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,790
He saw his own party,

1506
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,810
the art,

1507
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,230
uh,

1508
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,740
as,

1509
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,900
as being above these,

1510
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,853
he said that the,

1511
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,430
the parties in 1965,

1512
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:22,431
we said parties or organizations
constituted to show off
particular tendencies

1513
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,111
and the support,

1514
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:27,650
the interest of such and
such categories of people or,

1515
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,640
or interests or desires and,

1516
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,391
and this all,

1517
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:31,040
all,

1518
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,570
all stuff time and time again.

1519
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,060
But he wasn't just someone who
is going to pronounce foolishly,

1520
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:36,800
AH,

1521
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,760
revert to the same,

1522
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,080
uh,

1523
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,670
the same,

1524
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:39,980
uh,

1525
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,810
eventually tired phrases.

1526
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:43,640
He was somebody who believed that he,

1527
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,020
uh,

1528
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,320
he could pay potential,

1529
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,100
uh,

1530
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,680
attention to serve a particular
attention to circumstances.

1531
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:48,951
And this,

1532
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:50,300
he was rather like Bismarck,

1533
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,350
uh,

1534
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:51,531
or,

1535
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:52,670
and saw himself in that way.

1536
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,200
I think it's possible to argue.

1537
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:56,900
And in this may be he stomps
off a little bit though.

1538
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:57,200
I would,

1539
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,970
I hate to make the comparison,

1540
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:00,710
but maybe with Henry
Kissinger a little bit,

1541
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,370
uh,

1542
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:01,551
uh,

1543
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:02,270
to,

1544
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:02,451
uh,

1545
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:03,710
in the old days,

1546
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,920
but one of the results of the way he
viewed France I is that he didn't really

1547
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:11,900
give a damn about the
existence of ordinary people.

1548
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,760
He once said that,

1549
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,020
uh,

1550
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,141
uh,

1551
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:15,560
state,

1552
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,400
he said this literally steak fleet
that has steak with French fries,

1553
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,120
uh,

1554
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,110
is okay,

1555
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,063
it's fine,

1556
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,070
but it does not add up
to national ambition.

1557
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,410
That's an exact quote.

1558
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,551
And the business is,

1559
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:29,240
or how do you,

1560
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,590
how do you bring together,

1561
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:31,200
how do you make,

1562
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,200
retain the importance of a
people with 268 kinds of cheese,

1563
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,040
uh,

1564
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,650
was,

1565
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,160
uh,

1566
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
a part part of,

1567
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:40,791
uh,

1568
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,110
of all of that.

1569
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,010
Um,

1570
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,850
and so his,

1571
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:47,180
his style was more original.

1572
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:47,691
Uh,

1573
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,650
then his,

1574
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,070
uh,

1575
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,270
then his doctrine,

1576
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,601
I mean,

1577
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:51,800
take the press conference.

1578
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:53,180
He used to have press conferences,

1579
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,541
you know,

1580
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,370
American presidents often
over press conferences.

1581
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,230
Those was the current one really
doesn't because the question is good,

1582
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,270
too difficult to handle.

1583
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,960
Uh,

1584
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,171
uh,

1585
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:00,861
but the golden,

1586
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,210
it wasn't one for press conferences.

1587
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:03,044
He hated them.

1588
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,580
He couldn't stand them.

1589
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,041
But the,

1590
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,100
the press conference in the
old day were orchestrated.

1591
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,210
They were appearances,

1592
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,110
uh,

1593
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,390
they were not like a
rock concert appearance,

1594
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,390
but they were appearances and on the
left in which the questions had been

1595
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:14,841
planted,

1596
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:16,310
it was rather like FEMA,

1597
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:17,000
whatever they called it,

1598
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,130
an amazing senior couple
weeks ago in California,

1599
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:19,964
they planted,

1600
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,380
their people weren't in the room,

1601
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:22,101
weren't reporters,

1602
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:23,330
there were female employees.

1603
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,560
And they presented it as a,

1604
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,570
as a press conference where
one guy raised his hand,

1605
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:26,781
he says,

1606
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:27,090
why are,

1607
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,570
why is FEMA doing such a
remarkable job this time around?

1608
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,531
And then the guy said,

1609
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:30,771
well,

1610
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:31,650
I think we're doing very well.

1611
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,371
Thank you for saying that.

1612
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:35,190
It turns out that he was an employee of
Fema and there weren't real journalists

1613
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:35,890
there.

1614
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,030
Uh,

1615
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,030
but the globe would do the same thing he
said he would do with real journalists.

1616
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:40,560
He wouldn't do it with like Helen Thomas.

1617
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:43,650
We once who was a wonderful person that
has had a guest at the t in Brantford

1618
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:45,990
where she was always able
to ask the first question,

1619
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:49,080
I don't think this is the case anymore
because she was the senior person,

1620
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,880
but you had real journalists.

1621
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,370
But they were told what questions to ask.

1622
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,870
And then he would say he would give the
same kinds of responses that I've just

1623
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:58,111
said,

1624
00:44:58,111 --> 00:44:58,650
steak freak,

1625
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:58,951
do not,

1626
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:02,820
and end up with national ambition
at the time of the Algerian war.

1627
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,270
Uh,

1628
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,820
somebody forgot to ask a
question about Ben Bella.

1629
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:06,871
So he said,

1630
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,360
did I hear it?

1631
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,460
Said he suddenly looks up and says,

1632
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:08,611
Dad,

1633
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:10,500
I hear somebody ask a
question about Ben Bella.

1634
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,150
And then he gives the response,

1635
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:15,960
but he turns and reads a response that
had already been written for him and

1636
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:17,100
sometimes by him.

1637
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,150
Uh,

1638
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,610
and so it was the kind of style.

1639
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,710
So appearances were important.

1640
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,980
The idea that somehow this mystical body
was connected in a real way to all of

1641
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,210
you by national glory.

1642
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,760
And when he would go to any town.

1643
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:33,960
And he liked doing that,

1644
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:34,890
uh,

1645
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,090
he would go and he,

1646
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,230
and he would say,

1647
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:42,210
as I stand in the shadow of your
magnificent cathedral or next year,

1648
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:43,260
smiling river,

1649
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,510
French rivers are always
described as smiling,

1650
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:46,060
bipap,

1651
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:46,500
uh,

1652
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,620
even if they're polluted by,

1653
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:47,970
by,

1654
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:48,420
uh,

1655
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,700
uh,

1656
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,950
by politicians.

1657
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,580
Uh,

1658
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,300
I,

1659
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,920
I am thinking of you,

1660
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:53,071
I,

1661
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:55,650
and I seen you here
are here to welcome me.

1662
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,720
Your Heart's beating just as mine for
France and it's grand jury and its

1663
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:00,660
civilization.

1664
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,010
I remind that,

1665
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:02,700
uh,

1666
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:02,971
you know,

1667
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:06,720
and then he launches into his two or
three minute bit and then he is in the big

1668
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:09,170
limousine and out of loose accolade,

1669
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,240
designees or wherever it is a,

1670
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:15,210
and it all was like that were style,

1671
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:20,211
increasingly overwhelmed substance and
in a man who was extremely elderly,

1672
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,900
but in no by no means by no means senile,

1673
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:26,250
not one bit.

1674
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:27,180
Uh,

1675
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,730
and who could still treat with contempt.

1676
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,780
Anybody who came and told him something
he didn't want to hear but could be

1677
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:35,400
charming as well.

1678
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:35,791
Uh,

1679
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,920
the stage was set for a,

1680
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:41,280
his departure as time moved on.

1681
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,520
And that would a swirl around the events
of 1968 a la revolutional malkay the

1682
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:53,310
revolution that didn't really happen
in France and an involved awful lot of

1683
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,430
people of your age and this to that.

1684
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:56,731
After,

1685
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,220
I hope a glorious weekend
that I will turn on Monday.
