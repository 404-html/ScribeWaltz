1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,540
I don't know if you've been
following the events in, uh,

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:06,210
in France the last couple of days.
Uh, you know, by the way, you can,

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:10,110
those of you who know French,
you can get a TFR at foster.

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:14,630
Do I prefer strongly the ladder, uh, on
your computers? If you want to follow it,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,700
just go to, uh, Google, uh,

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,050
ply affair or just go to Google and type
in [inaudible] or type in Kf and you

7
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:29,031
can get the news from a one o'clock
that is a treasure or from a,

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,760
you know, from eight o'clock at night.
And, uh, my other two universities,

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,850
a wall and Leon do completely shut
down I and Hannah and tour and,

10
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,830
um, uh, to loser, uh,

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,690
because this is a law that was going
to come into effect called the Loa pet

12
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:48,810
Cresa after the person who proposed it.
And what is this going to do?

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,420
Is it's going to, among other things, uh,

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,140
it's going to make the book the budgets
of each university kind of independent.

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,310
It's an attempt to, this is
a logical transition, uh,

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,910
into our topic today to Americanize
a French universities. Uh,

17
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:08,100
so that in a way, the result of which the
students don't like it, you'll have a,

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,910
you already have sort
of a gap between the,

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,030
the really good universities like
[inaudible], uh, or Leon do. Uh,

20
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,700
and the ones that are disservice, struggle
along, uh, many of the new ones, like a,

21
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:23,000
the product Calais a that a friend of
mine actually, you know, set up. And,

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,320
and when he was in the ministry, I, and
I'm in the little ones, like a Shamba,

23
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:31,010
he and Beth and I saw and
all the others. And, um,

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,190
because of the conditions that are so
difficult in, in, in French universities,

25
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:38,490
which are woefully
understaffed and, and uh, uh,

26
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:41,580
the ones that were built in the
early sixties and early seventies,

27
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:45,020
like the infamous Lieutenant
Vinita News and which is a,

28
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,140
we're going to talk once was puppy.
Uh, I think it's by, he got to have,

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,000
and they know the conditions
are just a very, very dreadful.

30
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,910
So there's been a lot of,
uh, of opposition there.

31
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,360
And then now the Sarcozi is
president, uh, that, uh, the,

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,760
the police, there was these
entrepreneurial moose clay
or kind of a really, uh,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,960
a brutal, um, um,

34
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,030
interventions by the crs a yesterday
and a couple people heard it don't care.

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,650
Uh, we're 1968 began, uh, and
in hand I think knowing tour,

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,960
uh, uh, rather, uh, so, uh,
this matter of fact when I was
teaching in a role, I do, uh,

37
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,600
I do a course, I've done the
last couple of maize of course,

38
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,890
of a couple of weeks there. And, uh,

39
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:27,510
the first day it was just only met my
students and we went to a demonstration

40
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:31,350
against Sarcozi, you know, in
front of the Palace of Justice.

41
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,160
And we were out numbered by the crs, but,
uh, and they took photos of all of us.

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,260
And I think that one of the things that's
going to happen in the future is that

43
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,080
a, you know, this is going to
be a very, um, very tense time.

44
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,850
I think now that the big strikes in
Paris now of course, which you know,

45
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,670
come Debbie too would like all the time
I've taken out the train's about uh,

46
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,410
oh one out of a about 15% of the
trains are running and the whole line,

47
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:56,910
if you know Paris, the whole metro,
the rer, the whole line bay, uh,

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,571
Bay,

49
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:01,540
which goes from a several the shoulders
all the way to two YC to the airport,

50
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,410
I just completely shut down. And, um,

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,410
the buses are about trying to get
about 10%. And so it's just chaos.

52
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:11,320
And I remember when everybody was on
strike when I was teaching Leon, you know,

53
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,950
I take the train, the trains
were on strike with the
buses forward and I took it,

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,410
I take the train up to Leo to, uh, from
where we live or from near where we live.

55
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,960
And, and I have to walk the
block, which is where Leon do is.

56
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,560
And that's about five miles or six miles.
And I mean,

57
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,510
it's not in the long run or one walk,
but people are very inconvenienced.

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,800
And the other thing that's going on
and the reason that the railroad, uh,

59
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,860
railroads are out had nothing
to do with the pet krass law.

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,020
It has to do with the fact that a
Socrates attempt to, um, to Americanize,

61
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,430
um, uh, France, uh, you know,

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,580
it involves sort of
withdrawing a rights that,

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,340
that certain categories of
workers, uh, received. And, uh,

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,620
there's a lot of anger now in Paris and
one other cities too against the strikes.

65
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:56,090
And most people in France do
not approve of the strikes. Uh,

66
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,690
and sometimes they do, sometimes
they don't. I'll give you an example.

67
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:02,830
People that work in the meats whole who
are underground, you know, the, the,

68
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,410
the drivers of the Metros, they're
underground all the time. I mean,

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,770
imagine working eight hours a day and
you're underground the whole time. Uh,

70
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,990
they have the right in principle is,
is it 50,

71
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,510
does everyone remember
if it's 50 or a dying?

72
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,840
Do you remember if it's 50 or 55
for the, they show photo, the, uh,

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,900
[inaudible] 55, but there's some
of that to the TJ drivers. Uh, uh,

74
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,720
and that's a big, high, high
stress occupation. I mean,

75
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,180
it's not like driving a plane, but
you don't drive a plane. I don't know,

76
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,930
you pilot a plane, but, uh, I, you know,
they can have the right to, to, to, uh,

77
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:34,600
retire at 50. Now, that
seems awfully young.

78
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,330
And in Sarcozi in his campaign,
uh,

79
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:41,230
against the ill fated campaign of Sega
Lend Royale Royale said that he wanted to

80
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,290
make the French work again. He also
said a lot of other provocative things,

81
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:49,090
and for son of immigrants,
a Fisa, these Amy, hey, who
seems to hate immigrants, uh,

82
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,570
a very provocative, um, provocative
things, but, but anyway,

83
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:56,770
he's going to carry these policies,
uh, uh, you know, until the,

84
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:00,760
until the very end. And so this, this is
going to happen, you know, quite a lot.

85
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:04,450
I've got a suit to nos to test
a thesis defensively on a jury.

86
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,480
I have to dissipate in
and, uh, in December.

87
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,660
And I'm kind of wondering whether you
know, whether this is going to take place,

88
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,880
but, but, uh, uh, you can follow
this through the newspapers
and, and, uh, through, um,

89
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,851
uh,
the other thing if you,

90
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,610
if you read French and one where you
can follow it through the New York Times

91
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:23,310
online or anything, uh, but you can
also get the [inaudible] affair. Uh,

92
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,280
so you can read Lee Bay every day or
you can read a pneumonia or whatever.

93
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:30,580
If you want to keep up on this. I'm going
to be this afternoon calling my, uh,

94
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,100
student, uh, uh, pals in, in,

95
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,520
in raw and finding out
what's going on with them.

96
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,220
One of them who's always in every
demonstration, he's always there.

97
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,010
And it's the last time he went out to
demonstration all these police and they

98
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,890
know him because he's in
all the demonstrations. And
this one policeman said to,

99
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:49,920
we've got this huge, you'll stick and
is this the students is a little teeny,

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,040
teeny guy and he has a stick. And he
says, uh, I, I'm reserving this for you,

101
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,770
spend and all of this. And uh,
they have a memory too. But anyway,

102
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,970
so a sub regional phones a month and on.
Why I want to talk though that that is,

103
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,130
I think, a logical thing to talk about
because I'm going to talk, uh, about, uh,

104
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,430
about anti Americanism, uh, in
France. It's hard to do that,

105
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,230
to talk about anti Americanism from
1945, uh, until now, uh, in a mirror,

106
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,140
um, uh, 50 minutes. And, um, uh,

107
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,050
let me see at the outset that,
uh,

108
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,170
having spent half of my life or half
of the last 30 years of my life and in

109
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,480
France, uh, uh, more than that actually,

110
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,320
I've never once encountered
anti-americanism, uh, which, you know,

111
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,240
something I went back, it doesn't
matter. But, but what it does,

112
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,650
what I am saying is that the,

113
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,940
that the Anti Americanism and France has
always been against the United States

114
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:41,420
policies. And, uh, particularly
the earlier days, uh,

115
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,010
United States that were
cultural imperialism, uh, but
his head, nothing to do with,

116
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,700
you know, anti-americanism
against, uh, against, uh,

117
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,490
American people.
I've been introduced in a book,

118
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,650
which I contribute some sort of random
musings about living in l dash uh, as a,

119
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:02,310
as a political refugee, uh, in
France, uh, at various times. Uh,

120
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,340
and, uh, people joke about that.
Uh, but, uh, so I'm differentiating,

121
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:11,510
you know, anti-americanism
like people that they don't
like Americans or, uh, with,

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,961
uh,

123
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:16,940
anti a US policies in an anti what
was considered by many people,

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,740
particularly intellectual server,
uh, cultural arrogance that, that,

125
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,813
that,

126
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,710
that risks making France less
than what it had always been.

127
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,100
Uh, and so let me talk a little bit about
that. And here I'm drawing a heavily,

128
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,760
at the first part of the lecture
on my friend Dick is, uh,

129
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,710
a book on anti-americanism
in the early stages.

130
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,470
But it's an interesting story
and it's one that's worth,

131
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,190
that's worth a telling now to,
uh,

132
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,360
you know, when, when, um, when our
teaching role, I go to often to this cafe,

133
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:55,270
this near the railroad station there,
and it's the cafe where we're Saska, uh,

134
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,270
and Simone de Beauvoir who are well known
to almost everybody used to go all the

135
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,490
time. And it's kind of fun
to be in a cafe where, uh,

136
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,660
where you imagine that they
were, um, and you know,

137
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,640
they were good example of kind of the
intellectual anti anti anti-americanism

138
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:15,330
that emerged after World War Two.
Um,

139
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,500
now why did this kind of a philosophical
and intellectual anti-americanism a

140
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,190
merge?
Uh,

141
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:27,191
you have to put it in the context of the
ideological controversies that emerged

142
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,010
out of world war one a. And
by that I mean from, you know,

143
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,800
1945, uh, well into the mid, uh, 1950s,

144
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,880
uh, they were doc strikes against
the arrival of, of us, uh,

145
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,200
military equipment. Remember
the Americans had, um, huge,

146
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,920
huge basis, uh, in France
until the time of the goal.

147
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,610
If you go to the town of Chateaux who, uh,
which isn't a very interesting town, uh,

148
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,910
and the only great restaurant
in it left to move to tour, uh,

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,080
I used go buy these just
abandoned airfield. It used
to just be full of American,

150
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,130
uh, um, uh,

151
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,280
military air force equipment
and uh, and uh, and officers.

152
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,760
And so you see a lot of these,
um, uh, a lot of these signs,

153
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,840
there were angry outbursts even
against the Marshall Plan, uh,

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,260
in the Marshall Plan is, as you
know, from other courses abroad, uh,

155
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,310
American aid in great quantities to,
uh, to western Europe. Uh, you know,

156
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,890
one of the reasons was to keep the
western Europe out of, out of Soviet,

157
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,240
uh, influence. Um,

158
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,730
and this drew a predictable attacks from
the pouty [inaudible] different from

159
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:40,420
the Communist Party, uh,
uh, because of the, of the,

160
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:44,460
the obvious ideological, uh, uh,

161
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,750
division that was, that
was the Cold War. Um, so,

162
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:53,520
and it also was a time when the
Rosenbergs in this country were executed,

163
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,650
uh, uh, for allegedly passing
nuclear secrets to, uh,

164
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,180
to Soviet agents and,

165
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,740
and these kinds of executions as has
been the execution of [inaudible], uh,

166
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,900
who were anarchists who were executed
in 18, 27. Uh, you know, the,

167
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:11,850
these have with the mass press, uh,
all the way before Internet, uh,

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,280
great ramifications. Um, but you know, Eh,

169
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,610
the French economy grows so
rapidly over the next 30 year,

170
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:25,410
the 30 glorious years.
Um, and part of, of,

171
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,360
of the, the rise of consumerism and
a consumer culture, uh, in France,

172
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,760
it was backed by the
arrival of such novelty.

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,760
There's refrigerators and things like
that was very much identified with u s

174
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:42,190
culture and was a debated,
uh,

175
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,310
a particularly by intellectuals,
uh, rather, um, uh,

176
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,880
rather heatedly. Uh, there were
pro American intellectuals, uh,

177
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:55,470
who made the case in the very beginning
that the, that the American path, uh, was,

178
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,380
uh, uh, the way to go. Uh, uh,
the most famous was probably
about, oh, hey, well, uh,

179
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,560
Oh, a, a r o. N. But there were
others like Francois Mohair Yak,

180
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:08,580
and I can't remember if chips in his book
I mentioned he has, I'm sure he does,

181
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,270
but the communist intellectuals were
adamantly against all things, uh,

182
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,100
that were American. And of course, they
were very much over the top. Um, uh,

183
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:21,360
Dick Kaiser will, uh, uh, quotes, uh,
uh, the famous communist poet there,

184
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,630
Louie [inaudible] gone, uh, uh,
describing the u s as quote,

185
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,620
a civilization of bathtubs
and Frigidaire's, uh,

186
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,730
in 1951,
as if this was a very bad saying.

187
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,390
And he did not meant it. As
Kyle says, as a compliment.

188
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,500
It was the party Communist, the
Communist Party, that coined phrase.

189
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:43,410
It's like the coca colonization of France.

190
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,310
And the arrival of Coca
Cola in France is of course,

191
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:52,110
was a terribly important moment. More
about that. Um, uh, in a minute, uh,

192
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,860
at the time of the natal pack, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949,

193
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,180
these kinds of debates, uh, hit, uh,

194
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,210
hit a boiling point
and an age of graffiti.

195
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,220
The graffiti and the Yankee
go home, uh, was, uh,

196
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,290
was a bit everywhere.
Now the US nuclear capacity,

197
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,150
which was of course very soon
matched by, uh, the Soviet,

198
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,630
uh, nuclear capacity,
uh, seemed to raise, uh,

199
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,020
the cry, uh, can see Americans. Uh,

200
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:31,580
there was a sock on conference in
1950 against nuclear power, uh,

201
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,000
and in France, you
know, as a country that,

202
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,670
that it almost leads the
world in the percentage of,

203
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,020
of it's energy that is drawn from these
nuclear plants in which several, several,

204
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,170
or not all that far from us.
And a lot of,

205
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,600
there's a big sort of nuke
anti-nuclear, a reaction. Now that's,

206
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:50,660
that's mostly through eco ecologist and,
and the Greens and,

207
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,860
and folks like that. But,
um, in the beginning,

208
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:57,100
because the Americans are the ones
who had used the nuclear bomb. I mean,

209
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,230
other people have never
used a nuclear bomb.

210
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,890
Never since then have
used a nuclear problem.

211
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,360
We live in a world in which
Israel has a nuclear bomb,

212
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:08,720
which Pakistan has a nuclear bomb,
which India has a nuclear bomb as well as,

213
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,010
as France and Britain,
uh,

214
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:16,890
and s and China as well. I do
believe, uh, so therefore all this,

215
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,450
uh, um, it's still very
scary. But in the origins,

216
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,950
this anti Americanism was increased by,
uh,

217
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,100
by the fear that the Americans and their
cold war against the Soviet Union would

218
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:35,140
turn, uh, the damage will be not, not
be done in Mississippi or in Minnesota,

219
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,460
but will it be done,
uh, in, in Europe. Um,

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,380
and so intellectuals also accused,
uh, the Americans of ignoring,

221
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,160
uh, a European culture. Remember, uh,

222
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,620
the infamous Donald Rumsfeld,
uh,

223
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,010
refers scathingly too old
Europe at a time when, uh,

224
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,890
the Americans were invading Iraq as if
old Europe with its quaint streets and

225
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:04,390
old churches and, and long cultures
where something not worth, not worth,

226
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,710
uh, remembering. Um, but I,
again, I mean the, the, the,

227
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:11,920
the critique critiques of America,
the critics of American culture,

228
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:16,660
we're over the top, um,
uh, new [inaudible], uh,

229
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,140
the Communist newspaper and still today,
uh,

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,200
said that one could starve even if one
owned a telephone and the telephone,

231
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,660
uh, where you can't even find
a, a fixed phone anymore.

232
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,360
I can't telephone and I can't even
call on the phone when I go back to

233
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,230
University of Michigan because there are
literally only one fixed phone left on

234
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:38,110
the campus. And I don't have a cell phone
because I don't like to cell phones.

235
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,100
I can't stand them. I agree with
those people who said that, uh, uh,

236
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,750
that they had great faith in
humanity until the cell phone.

237
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,180
And plus my daughter's lost three of
them already. But, but, uh, um, uh, that,

238
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,560
that the French Minister of
communications in 19 four,

239
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:56,210
this is the French Minister
of communications in 1964.

240
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,160
Yeah. Of all who before you
existed, but not before I existed.

241
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:05,270
He called the telephone a gimmick in 19,
uh,

242
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:10,130
64. Uh, but it wasn't the telephone
that drew heat. It was above all a,

243
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,900
well, the refrigerators, I
mean, you couldn't tell the
average housewife living, uh,

244
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,880
wherever, and they're more beyond
someplace and Brittany or wherever, uh,

245
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:20,570
that the refrigerator wasn't,
uh, uh, uh, a good deal.

246
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,400
But that for the Communist
Party of Frigidaire w fridge,

247
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,840
a Frigo a refrigerator or a Frigidaire,
which is a model,

248
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,440
I don't know if it still is, was,
was only good for making, uh,

249
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,310
ice cubes for fancy, uh, um, uh,

250
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,800
parents teeth where you would drink
American or Scottish American bourbon or

251
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:44,400
Scotch whiskey. Uh, so,
um, they, um, uh, are gone.

252
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,900
This again, as the communist
poet wrote a Ford Automobile,

253
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,080
the civilization of Detroit,
the assembly line,

254
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,260
the atomic danger in circled by napalm.

255
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,750
Now he said this early on, remembers the
Americans. You use napalm in Vietnam.

256
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,000
It was the Americans. He
use napalm in Vietnam. Um,

257
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,000
here is the symbol of the subjugation
to the dollar applauded even in the land

258
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:12,830
of Moliere, the Yankee more arrogant at
the nut. Then the Nazi Holocaust. I mean,

259
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:13,700
this is absurd.

260
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,410
A substitutes to machine for
the poet Coca Cola for poetry,

261
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,630
the Ford for Victor Hugo.
It degenerated to that extent.

262
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,640
Uh, a great sociologist called Edgar
Maha, who is a brilliant book on a,

263
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,580
on a called the red and the white
about it. Brett home village, uh,

264
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,900
he called Reader's digest,
uh,

265
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,090
a pocket size stupa fire
a drug for little minds.

266
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,100
Uh, and he attacked was one of the
earliest to attack from lay the,

267
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,080
and more about that in a while. That is
the absorption of American terms in to,

268
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,470
uh, the French language. Uh, uh,

269
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,210
toothpaste for example,
instead of [inaudible], uh,

270
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,000
flooding the French,
uh, language. But again,

271
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:02,330
you have to put this in
the context of the Times.

272
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:05,960
And that's why I guess what his
tour, he has tried to do. 60% of the,

273
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:09,350
of the people in the communist party
thought the US was readying and aggressive

274
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:14,220
war. Uh, and almost 95% of people
in the Communist Party, uh,

275
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,150
were against the presence
of us basis in France.

276
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,450
Now remember the guy who got rid of
the U s basis in France was Charles de

277
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,840
Gaulle, who was anything but a communist
who completely opposite of a Communist.

278
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,360
But his view is we'll see,
was that France had to be, uh,

279
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,980
to maintain its status as a great power,
had to be a,

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,510
I have a neutral path and influenced
in places where French was spoken

281
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:42,830
particularly, uh, in, uh, in
west and North Africa. Uh,

282
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,240
and, uh, you know,

283
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:49,040
in the Middle East and parts in
Lebanon and a of things, uh, like,

284
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,800
um, so, um, there were some, you know,

285
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:56,430
intellectuals who tried to find a third
way who weren't kind of parroting the

286
00:17:56,431 --> 00:18:00,600
communist party or we're really
going to cow down a Cao Tao.

287
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:05,070
The way it's our cozy is to,
uh, uh, to, uh, to America, uh,

288
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,220
and, uh, you know, Lamona for example,

289
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:12,810
which is without question the most
reputable newspaper in France, uh, uh,

290
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:17,760
though the bay is quite good
too, and a Pluto Mangu. Uh,
but, but it take, it takes,

291
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:22,730
took a more neutral position,
uh, in, uh, in all of this, uh,

292
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,160
because there were many people
in France who weren't communists.

293
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:29,650
I thought that the Marshall Plan was a
way of buying off Europe and, uh, and you,

294
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:33,740
you know, I wasn't, you know,
I was vaguely around in those
days, but, but, you know,

295
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,460
the fear was, you know,
after World War One,

296
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:38,910
there was a thought that nobody would
ever want another war after World War Two,

297
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,470
and after the, you know, the atomic
bomb. And after the horrors of, of, of,

298
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,910
of, uh, you know, all that had
happened, uh, and the Holocaust, uh,

299
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,930
people were quite certain that there
would be another war. So it was a time of,

300
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,190
of, of great fear. And so
these were big issues, um, in,

301
00:18:56,191 --> 00:19:01,191
in 1952 at the time of the visit of a US
General Matthew Ridgway to take control

302
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:07,760
of NATO forces, they were huge
demonstrations against United States. Uh,

303
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,060
he was called a butcher in the Korean
War would, would certainly wasn't true.

304
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,000
I was called a war criminal
and that wasn't true either.

305
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,120
But this came at a time when,
uh,

306
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,760
it was the government of a guy who
just died only a couple of years ago.

307
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,240
That'd be about 130 years
old called Antoine Pinay, uh,

308
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,600
who is from Sasha Momoa and you're
a 10, if I remember correctly. And,

309
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:32,601
and he had been accused of collaboration
during the war and he was in power and

310
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:38,631
he tried to ludicrous ludicrously enough
break the influence of the [inaudible]

311
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,770
and one of their leaders.

312
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,320
I didn't know about this incident
until I read Kaysville. Uh,

313
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,940
one of the incidents was he accused
Ashoka, do Clo a name you can forget, but,

314
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,050
but it was interesting guy who was
a leader of the Communist Party of,

315
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,800
of being a spy for the Soviets.

316
00:19:55,801 --> 00:20:00,801
And his proof was that they had found
two dead pigeons in the back seat of his

317
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:05,000
car and an autopsy on the birds,
uh,

318
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,620
that he thought they were a carrier,
pigeons that were smuggling,

319
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:09,900
going to send secrets off to,

320
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,160
to some Soviet spies
somewhere out of the country.

321
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,970
And of course they did an autopsy
on these birds and they discovered,

322
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,420
I don't know how you do this
to an autopsy. Uh, I didn't
want to be in the room,

323
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,820
but they were not carrier pigeons,
but there were pigeons,

324
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,970
people in France eat pigeons, peas,
you know, and that they simply,

325
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:29,940
he would have them in his backseat cause
he was going to take home and cook them,

326
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:33,760
hopefully with lots of garlic
and, and, and the eat them. Uh,

327
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,670
and John Paul Saska,

328
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,080
he said it the same time that if he
had to choose sides in the Cold War,

329
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,970
he would choose, uh, the USSR.
Now Saska like a lots of,

330
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:46,920
of, uh, of fellow travelers.

331
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,650
We're delusional about what
had happened in Stalin's

332
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,980
Soviet Union. Uh, and, um, his partner,

333
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,060
Simone de Beauvoir,

334
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,590
who's terribly important in the rise
of feminism is feminism as I sure, uh,

335
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,090
uh, you, you know,

336
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:09,010
she came to the u s in 1947 she had
been in 1947 and she liked the sort of

337
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:13,540
dynamism of the American economy
and she liked its, it's freedom. Uh,

338
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,640
but she was immediately suspicious of
racism, uh, in the United States. Uh,

339
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,740
and the 1940s in the 1950s as a
in need in our own time. Sadly,

340
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,370
I've though not as much, uh, was
a time of racism. And she said,

341
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:32,250
so she came right out and said, and that
became a part of the Anti American, uh,

342
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,580
a discourse because when the
Americans would get ahold of her,

343
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:38,230
and now about how people in
Europe, uh, uh, you know,

344
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,990
treated their minorities
all you had to look to, uh,

345
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,900
all he had to look to the United
States. Uh, where, uh, you know,

346
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:46,850
I think back my own
childhood when, when, uh, uh,

347
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,950
the freedom three freedom workers were
so brutally murdered in, in Mississippi,

348
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,510
um, and, uh, you know, uh, they would
point, they would point to that.

349
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,770
Um, now what about the role
of Coca Cola and all of this?

350
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:04,570
I imagine you may have seen Cocacola a
few times in your lives. Um, it became,

351
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,350
it's still is so identified with,
um,

352
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,230
with America and it probably is,

353
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,050
I think it's fair to say the,

354
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,250
the single item that is most identified,
uh,

355
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:23,380
in the rest of the world with,
uh, w w with the United States,

356
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,140
um,
that you couldn't,

357
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,290
you couldn't talk to people in the,
in the,

358
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,200
in France or anywhere else about baseball.

359
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,790
And you cannot talk to him about hot
dogs though there that this strange thing

360
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:41,650
emerged in the 1960s called
Lou dog, uh, which are two sir,

361
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:46,330
miserably, almost frozen, uh,
uh, uh, frankfurters with,

362
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,260
uh, some sort of godawful
cheese put on them and put in,

363
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:53,560
in what was then the equivalent of a
microwave. But, uh, it was coca cola.

364
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,600
Um, and as you know, the product was, was,
uh, uh, created, I think in the late 18,

365
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,870
1880s. It's very hard to get into.
The Chi's will manage to do it,

366
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:05,770
to get into the Coca Cola archives for
you might find that recipe. And of course,

367
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:09,990
I think somebody told me that cocaine was
put originally into the, uh, into coke,

368
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,920
into coke, uh, at, uh, at
the beginning, uh, of it all.

369
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,770
Um, let me give you some examples
how coke and American, uh,

370
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,860
view of itself and view
of the world, um, came to,

371
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,263
came to be.

372
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,120
We will see that every man in uniform
gets a bottle bottle of Coca Cola for 5

373
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,960
cents. Wherever he is. And
whatever it costs, uh, was, uh,

374
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:39,560
what cocacola had to say about the
relationship between, uh, soldiers, uh,

375
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,290
if they survived the Bataan death
march, uh, and whatever, uh,

376
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,460
and, um, uh, that was, it won.

377
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,290
The Coca Cola actually sent people
as technical as observers, a word,

378
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,821
a phrase.

379
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:57,680
They used to see where bottling plants
could after the fighting ended, uh,

380
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,500
be set up. Uh, in Europe,

381
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,980
one US soldier wrote a letter
in which he said to my mind,

382
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:08,981
I'm in this damn mess as much to help
to keep the customer drinking cokes as I

383
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,000
am,
to preserve the million other benefits.

384
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:16,001
Our country blesses that citizens with
64 bottling plants were set up in Europe,

385
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,670
uh, after, uh, uh, the war, uh, uh,

386
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,460
immediately after the world
was in a couple of years,
they expand to Belgium and,

387
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:30,290
and, uh, uh, and at
Luke's Ambu and, uh, uh,

388
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,420
the Netherlands in 1947,

389
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:37,220
I also to Switzerland and Italy
and then to France in 19, uh, 49,

390
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:42,350
the Olympics of 1950 were held in Finland,
in Helsinki. Uh, and there was not yet,

391
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,170
had not yet been time to
build a Coca Cola plant.

392
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,190
So what they did is they got ahold
of some d day landing vessels,

393
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,450
fill them with Coca Cola.
Uh,

394
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,730
and the Coca Cola company
landed on the shores of Finland,

395
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,200
literally,
uh,

396
00:24:57,201 --> 00:25:02,201
with all of these publicity material
and with 720,000 bottles of Coca Cola.

397
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,280
Now the chairman of, um, um, I didn't know
this either, took highs I castle. Uh, the,

398
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,030
the chairman of Coca Cola was,
was James Farley,

399
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,440
who was a former aid to Franklin
Roosevelt, and that's, he was what?

400
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,430
Very Wa had good contacts.
Um,

401
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,630
and he was a militant anticommunist who
identified the drinking of Coca Cola

402
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,370
with, uh, with democracy. Uh, the,

403
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,190
the Soviets and in their satellite
states did not drink coca cola,

404
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,300
but good old Americans drank a coca cola.

405
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,020
Now you're going to run into huge
lobbies in these countries. In Belgium,

406
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:42,610
you're gonna run into the beer lobby.
Terribly important in the pay.

407
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:43,520
You by and Netherlands,

408
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,570
you can run into the beer lobby and in
France you will run a head on to that

409
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:51,470
lobby. You already know something
about the wine lobby, uh,

410
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,770
which in a way is neither left nor right.
Uh,

411
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:58,930
but it's neither left nor right. It's
a little more complicated, uh, uh,

412
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,190
there than that. And
they tried to, um, uh,

413
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,990
stir up popular a action
against a Coca Cola.

414
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,980
A communist paper in new in Italy
said that the drinking coke would make

415
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:13,440
children's hair turn white and therefore,
uh,

416
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:16,040
you shouldn't do that in Austria,

417
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,130
the communist new biggest
communist newspaper in Vienna,

418
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,610
I wrote that Co cocacola plants
by, uh, by virtue of, of, uh,

419
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,650
the machines they use could be easily
transformed into plant's capable of

420
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:32,120
turning out nuclear
bombs. Uh, and so, uh, uh,

421
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:36,830
that good Viennese and good to
Austrians should avoid the insidious,

422
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,910
uh, a numbing a drink. Um,

423
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,840
coke's had begun to arrive in,
in, in France, uh, after war one,

424
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:50,841
but only in very small numbers
and extremely fancy cafes.

425
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,400
Um, and so, uh,

426
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:56,850
the Coco Cola having Kaiser would go
into the archives to find all this.

427
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:02,090
A Coco Cola marketers divided France
into six regions and figured that six,

428
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,710
they should anticipate each person
a drinking six. Coca-Cola's, uh, uh,

429
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,120
per year. Uh, the problem is
that foreign investments, uh,

430
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,750
such as, uh, building plants required, uh,

431
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,360
the permission of the Ministry
of, uh, of, of finance, uh,

432
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:25,980
and, um, that, uh, all
of this anxiety, uh,

433
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,090
comes along the Minister of finance,
Ministry of Finance gets involved, uh,

434
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,000
and all of this business, uh, the debate,
uh, reaches the Chamber of Deputies, uh,

435
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,040
in 1950s.
Uh,

436
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:41,640
and also this merges with other fears of
other American products. A John Deere.

437
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,560
Uh, some of you may be from
Illinois and that we're,

438
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,660
John Deere is made the
tractors and all that.

439
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,460
And that is by far the biggest company,
a successful company in, in, uh,

440
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,660
marketing machinery that's been part
of the French agricultural revolution,

441
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,570
a sense a World War II.
But of course,

442
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:01,230
the little producers and France
were against John Deere as well.

443
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,110
It also comes at a time, as you know, of,
of, uh, of a widespread outrage or of,

444
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:11,100
of intellectuals and filmmakers against
the Hollywood is nation of French, uh,

445
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:16,290
uh, of a, a French movie theaters.
And because France is idea,

446
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,500
attitudes towards own movies has always
been that as its attitudes towards

447
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:24,501
almost all industrial production that
France makes these fine little products of

448
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:28,710
quality. Uh, and the
arrival of, of, of the, uh,

449
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,970
God forbid the Charlton
Heston's of the world and, and,

450
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:35,850
and John Wayne and all of this stuff.
Uh, so these debates are going on, uh,

451
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,470
uh, among intellectuals and, and, and it,
film watchers, et Cetera. Uh, you know,

452
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:42,480
I mean, these debates just go on
and on. I mean, there are radio,

453
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:46,450
radio stations in France
now, um, have to, uh, uh,

454
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,590
play a certain percentage of French
music as opposed to Bruce Springsteen and

455
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:55,170
the stones and, and, and whatever.
They have to have a certain percentage.

456
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:58,560
And so there is this still this,
this paranoia that, that, uh, uh,

457
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:02,160
that English or French music
or other kinds of music coming,

458
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:06,600
we'll wipe out a wipe out
what's left of, of, of, uh,

459
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,730
of the French music industry and,
and that, uh, people won't put,

460
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,140
won't play as Jacques Brel
anymore or a Georgia, uh, or they,

461
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,160
they owe a few hey, or a Johnny, uh,
Johnny Holy Day, who was, anyway,

462
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:24,390
he was born, born Belgian, Belgian,
and he has his own problems,

463
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:28,530
whether it's nothing to do
with it. Um, but yet when a,

464
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:32,910
there are these, um, you know,
there are these debates, uh,

465
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,420
it seemed like the ties between coke and
the US government were even stronger.

466
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:41,010
Cocacola demanded that the US State
Department intervene in some way to stop

467
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,520
kind of uprising against
the rival of Coca Cola. Um,

468
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,790
US papers, uh, went, uh, went wild.

469
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,900
Cocacola was not injurious to the health
of American soldiers who liberated

470
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:57,901
France from the Nazis so that communist
deputies could sit in session today was

471
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,420
one,
a editorial in a US paper.

472
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,170
You can't spread the doctrines of
Mark's among people who drink coca cola.

473
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,030
The dark principles of revolution in a
rising proletariat may be expounded over

474
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,630
a bottle of vodka on a scarred table,
you know,

475
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:17,860
such as mores or some place like that,
or even a bottle of brandy.

476
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:18,970
But as utter Lee,

477
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:23,380
fantastic to imagine two men stepping
to a Soda Fountain and ordering a couple

478
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:28,050
of cokes in which to toast the
downfall of their capitalist Oh,

479
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,470
uh, oppressors. Uh, and
so, um, uh, so it went,

480
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,740
but coca cola arrived in France,

481
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:39,100
had got a permission to
be produced in France, uh,

482
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:42,550
and to be drunk in France and still is,
uh,

483
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,580
though often by American
tourists and France,

484
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,380
I have been on several occasions in a
really good, in one case even great.

485
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,310
Uh, and this is not dissing
Americans. They forgive me, uh, eh,

486
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,750
great restaurants and seeing
Americans ordering Cocacola, uh,

487
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,600
with their four or five course meal.

488
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,840
And that does make me sad. Does
it make me sound like a snob? Uh,

489
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,350
Eh, I've seen people drink milk
to and things like that. Uh, uh,

490
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,580
anyway, what can, what can
we say? I shouldn't get so
involved in all this stuff.

491
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,240
How did people like Coca Cola,
a pole, a sewn dodge, you know,

492
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:22,600
the French take take two American polls.
I mean, do these polls all the time.

493
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:27,370
I saw dodge is the word for Paul.
Uh, in 1953 said it only 70%.

494
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:30,880
People who drank it liked it and 60%,
not at all.

495
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:34,040
And the other ones couldn't
remember because they'd gone
into something else. Uh,

496
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,600
drinking something else I guess.
Um, but the dikes began to,

497
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,700
began to break and millions of, of,
of cokes, uh, are, um, you know,

498
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:47,650
are sold every year in France as, as
everywhere. Now this is just an aside,

499
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,700
but this is the same case.
Um, you know, as an Africa,

500
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,160
the debates and not been the same.
But one of the interesting things,

501
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:58,600
and I think sad things about,
uh, the places I know in
Africa, which has very few,

502
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:03,070
uh, but our family members are new Africa
about pretty well, uh, is that, you know,

503
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,600
the, the, the, the domination of, of, of
coke, uh, particularly in places you know,

504
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,440
that are Muslim and which people
don't drink alcoholic beverages,

505
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:15,520
the domination of coke and
Fanta, uh, uh, which are very,

506
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:18,670
very expensive for, for people
who have almost no money, uh,

507
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,050
and that the front tire or is sort of
becomes the equivalent of a celebration of

508
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:26,280
with champagne in France or the United
States or someplace where people,

509
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,690
where people drank.
And so some of the same issues,

510
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:33,490
some of the same debates are there. Uh,
and these companies just make Zillions,

511
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,850
uh, uh, off the strengths. And I'm
not criticizing these companies, am I,

512
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:38,890
I guess I don't know.
But anyway.

513
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,870
Now let's talk about some of the other
aspects of Anti Americanism before, uh,

514
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,360
you know, I end in the, in in 15 minutes
or so with, um, uh, the obvious ones,

515
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,940
uh, uh, today. Um,

516
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,130
well architecture, uh, for example, um,

517
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,650
many of the debates about preservation,

518
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,370
about keeping Paris what Ga,

519
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,210
anywhere you want to name the
beautiful centers, straws,

520
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:10,160
Bu the way they've always
been, uh, have involved, uh,

521
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,810
fighting against, uh, the
skyscraper ization if you will.

522
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:17,030
The got Seattle,
they got Seattle,

523
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:20,720
the skyscrapers in
France in the late 1960s.

524
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:25,721
There was a huge debate over the tour
Montparnasse and the tour Montparnasse uh,

525
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,310
uh, it right on. It's right on the,

526
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,600
it's where the station and wall
Pranassa is in Paris. It's right on the,

527
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:36,360
on the right beyond the
boulevard. Montparnasse there, uh,

528
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:41,380
was built with the enthusiastic
a cooperation if not no
money in the pockets of,

529
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,370
as yours a pump you do. Uh, the
president of France who said,

530
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:51,200
we must renounce this outmoded aesthetic.
That's an exact quote.

531
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,160
And so the big battle over
the Tour de France, which is
a year, I get my own view,

532
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:59,600
but it gives a, it was a
hideous building that, that,

533
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,100
that debt debt, uh, you know,

534
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,460
is a blight on the skyline of Paris.
Uh,

535
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,730
and if it said,

536
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:10,760
the only thing good about it is you can't
see it when you're viewing Paris from

537
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:14,720
the top and they have an elevator that
shoots up at the top and it destroyed, uh,

538
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,570
you know, while, anyway, you
know, what, what can we say?
It's an obvious thing now,

539
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:22,340
people that defended the tour more, which
is identified with Chicago, Eh, you know,

540
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,170
and the skyscrapers, I would say, well,
look, when people criticize the, the,

541
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:28,090
the Arctic,
the two,

542
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,180
and he failed the Eiffel Tower
when it was built in 1888 and 1889.

543
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,110
And Zola was among those who sign
saying, this is awful. It must go.

544
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,730
And it is part of what people go to
see. Now. People do not go see the tour.

545
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:45,140
Montparnasse because of the Eiffel
Tower, you know, uh, represented, uh,

546
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,150
uh, changes in, in, you know,

547
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:51,550
in industry and steel and iron and
all this stuff. And the tour mark,

548
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,330
we'll Parnoss I just represents a kind
of an American approach to architecture

549
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:59,510
that,
that the traditionalist a found wanting.

550
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,360
And so what they did subsequently
is they don't lie, they false,

551
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:05,380
which is outside of Paris. But what you
can see it if you stand, for example,

552
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:08,610
in the tweets are three,
uh, or you know, um,

553
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,470
around there you can see it
beyond the Arc de Triomphe.

554
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,340
And that's where lots of businesses,
that's the kind of Americanization of, of,

555
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,420
of French architecture and business.
Uh, but generally the, the, the, the,

556
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,120
the friendship and very good of,
of,

557
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,630
of trying to protect Paris from the
planners who would destroy other way the

558
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:29,240
place looks with an Americanized
kind of architecture. There.

559
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:31,990
There've been other problems
too. I mean, the, the, the,

560
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:35,850
the construction said at plus
digitally me and you know, the,

561
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,050
the tour Montparnasse became the
most famous and appropriately enough,

562
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,470
these kinds of battles,
uh,

563
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,190
to protect Paris against this kind of
architecture. Have involved the far right,

564
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,260
uh, conservative, right? Not
the first show of the fascist,
right. But the far right,

565
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:54,690
like my late friend Louis Shovel,
a very conservative man,

566
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:59,370
was the greatest historian of Paris. Uh,
and, and, uh, or my Fred Francois Louie,

567
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:03,690
who is now head of the committee to
preserve old Paris with people on,

568
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,740
I'm the last, you know, that the sort
of the French equivalent of me, uh, uh,

569
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:12,280
against the center against the kind of
plant plan air who just want to make, uh,

570
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,920
uh, make money. Um, but you know, other
aspects of Americanization, you know, the,

571
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:19,530
the word Pavio in France, uh, you know,

572
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:22,980
people wanted to have
their houses, uh, uh,

573
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,540
in the prosperous suburbs if
best at [inaudible], for example,

574
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,610
uh, most of the suburbs, you know, at the
time we're talking about until 1945 are,

575
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:36,080
are, are, are miserable places,
but the people in Sacramento,

576
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,940
La and the west of Paris or
Versailles, uh, you know what?

577
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,020
They want to have their [inaudible],

578
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:43,650
which was a big kind of modern
Americanized House with all these things,

579
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,630
you know, cell phones, refrigerators, all
this business, swimming pools and lawns.

580
00:36:48,631 --> 00:36:51,000
What could be more American
American than lawns. Now,

581
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,690
the vast majority of the people who
live in the Asian region do not live in

582
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,100
houses.
They live in apartments.

583
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,790
And the vast majority live in buildings
that they do not own or not the vast

584
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:04,440
majority, but the majority do. But
that became a big, uh, a big issue.

585
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,740
The television, the television,
uh, you know, people, uh,

586
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,500
thought to television
would destroy France.

587
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,740
I used to say that when Charles
the gold died, finally Columbian,

588
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,640
they do the leaves. Uh, he died of
board and watching French TV, uh,

589
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,220
because French TV,
which has some of the best stuff around,

590
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:24,240
but also has some of the worst, uh,
this talk shows and go on and on and on.

591
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,910
It's just, this is
numbing. Uh, but also, uh,

592
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,510
they took all these things that I've
never watched in my life. Like Dallas,

593
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,330
I used to be a big show and all these
things, I have no idea what they are,

594
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:35,880
but they, but people will, even
our, you know, a very dear friends,

595
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,740
you go there and they're
watching this stuff and well,

596
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:40,620
I'm the TV's not just American,
but, but the, that whole, you know,

597
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,810
that kind of culture was identified with
America and intellectuals didn't like

598
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:46,411
that very much.

599
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,660
People should be reading books and
they should be reading books too.

600
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:50,460
But who am I to say? I mean,
I watch ESPN, you know,

601
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,400
hours every day and every game of it's on.
So I can't really say,

602
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:56,820
I don't watch TV. I'm closing.
It used to be, you know,

603
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,440
when the first years and years,

604
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:00,300
and then I was living in
France and went to France,

605
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,220
you could tell who was an American in
about one second by looking at their feet.

606
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,630
Now I don't spend a lot of time
looking at people's feet. Uh,

607
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,920
but you could tell the way they look
because they were tennis shoes and tennis

608
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,030
shoes now are called a
bus get, you know, uh, uh,

609
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,140
but now everybody wears
the same way in jeans,

610
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:18,570
the same thing because there weren't
jeans in France and now everybody wears

611
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:22,230
jeans. Uh, I can still tell who's
American who isn't usually, but uh,

612
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,890
but the clothing was identified with,
with,

613
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,560
with America was seen as
being somehow an on French.

614
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:32,940
And of course there's the big war between,
uh, France, you know, hi, accrue to him,

615
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:37,840
you know, of, of French fashion and
trying to preserve as Milan tries to also,

616
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,160
and they've been very successful at that.
But clothing was one thing, uh, as well.

617
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,720
Uh, you hold these knee, what can
one say, but you hold these knee,

618
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,310
somebody called it a
cultural share. Nuba. Uh,

619
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,100
I share new blue was the big nuclear
plant, uh, that blew up in, in Kiev.

620
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,890
Uh, and, uh, and certainly the idea of a,

621
00:38:56,891 --> 00:39:00,850
of a Mickey mouse and goofy and
all of these people, uh, you know,

622
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,590
and you go and you've spent, I
haven't, I've never been there.

623
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,870
I would never walk into place.
She's been Saint Columbo. You spent,

624
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:07,900
what's a 50 euro to
get in and, and uh, uh,

625
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:12,370
so your kids can get sick eating
American coffee, a cotton candy. Uh,

626
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:17,170
but again, people go over the top
or Mcdonald's. Ha Ha. Ah, uh, I,

627
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:20,440
Mcdonald's would start it in France.
I really, in the, in the 80s,

628
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,970
Burger kicking tried and failed.

629
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,230
Now Mcdonald's is a big issue
and she was able value came, uh,

630
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,740
to Yale a couple of years ago.

631
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:30,190
She was able bay as a guy who now you
became identified with the struggle

632
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,600
against Mcdonald's.
Uh,

633
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,690
he was actually lived two years
in la though he speaks to me.

634
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:36,220
I wasn't here when he came.
My daughter,

635
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,510
I was a translator forum and introduced
him and all that. But, uh, he,

636
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:44,650
but he's one who led the struggle,
uh, uh, to try to, first of all,

637
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:49,600
to preserve his part of the Avp
of law. Uh, Laura, Zack against,

638
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,510
uh, uh, making a strafing
practice range for the,

639
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:57,511
for the French air force and has gone
after a Mcdonald's is representing the

640
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:02,260
globalization that's going to
hurt, um, a local commerce.

641
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,270
Then Mcdonald's has tried
to compromise in some ways.

642
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,640
If you go and get a Mcdonald's,
and I won't go into places,

643
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,470
I shouldn't say that because the
recording this, but, but, uh,

644
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,740
I haven't been in years in
France, but the, uh, you know,

645
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,000
they had these little
salads with a little,

646
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,050
a few pieces of goat's cheese in it to
go along with it. The 2 million calorie,

647
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:21,520
uh, uh, a burger, uh, and all
that. But what a joy they will,

648
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:24,560
they did is that he and his
friends went up and broke up. Uh,

649
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,900
it didn't hurt anybody, but they'd sort
of trashed a I Mcdonald's in, um, uh,

650
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:33,430
in meal, which is an Av, you hone the
south right near this huge, huge bridge,

651
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,550
the biggest span bridge.
And, uh, in Europe.

652
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:40,420
And of course he went on trial and
he became a presidential candidate.

653
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:45,310
And I guess I get my daughter stays
there. Really great guy. Uh, but, uh, uh,

654
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,080
you know, Mcdonald's became, he became an
issue, but, and this, and I said, well,

655
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,770
maybe it won't work,
but Mcdonald's,

656
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:54,070
because you can eat cheaply there because
everything's so expensive. And France,

657
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,660
so expensive.
Uh,

658
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,420
they're always just where you could
drive by is when an overnight, you know,

659
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,940
there's one everywhere. Uh,
they are always full of,

660
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,120
of people eating whatever
it is they eat there.

661
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,810
So it became a symbol more important than
the reality. Makoto Makoto [inaudible],

662
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,620
uh, became, uh, became a symbol
of, of, uh, of globalization,

663
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,080
first of Americanization and then a
globalization. Uh, and then, you know,

664
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:19,300
what comes along now, but Starbucks,
there's, there's three or four,

665
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:23,860
there's one in Monterrey, in, in, in
Paris. Uh, there's one I saw in, um,

666
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,390
a summer up open.
Huh.

667
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,930
And there are a couple other ones there
and they soon will be everywhere and

668
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,510
even eat better Mount Shay supermarkets.
Now,

669
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:34,790
people don't dispute supermarkets anymore,
but they used to.

670
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:38,690
The big ones are the [inaudible] and
all these look there, it's probably the,

671
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,360
the biggest, uh, and I mean the
upscale version of [inaudible].

672
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,280
Now I remember in the 1970s of people
thought the supermarkets were just

673
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:48,950
terrible things. Why? Because
they were going to end,

674
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,960
did destroy local commerce that most
villages now do not have the little

675
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,470
[inaudible] that grocery store that,
uh,

676
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,790
made it possible for old ladies
to just to walk a few, uh,

677
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:04,790
equivalent of a few hundred
meters to buy their milk. Uh,

678
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,170
and now they can't do that anymore.

679
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,870
Now there's more than just a
disappearance of a way of buying food.

680
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,920
It's the way it's a disappearance of a
place where you get together and exchange

681
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:13,940
news in the morning.

682
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,710
Our grocery store disappeared about
10 years ago or about eight years ago

683
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:23,240
because everybody goes to the
Supermart Shea, uh, EPR, Ma
supermom chasing them, um,

684
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,220
shows, uh, though, um,

685
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,990
the other thing that it could attack but
ha ha could interfere with and has not

686
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:34,130
as much as we feared were markets. The
Saturday market, the Wednesday market,

687
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:38,170
that Saturday and Wednesday
market, depending on the
size of the town, uh, that,

688
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,270
that are all over France.
And in fact, people still,

689
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:45,590
even to even young people your age still
have a sense that you got to protect.

690
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,250
You've got to save the markets, and you've
got other people that produce there,

691
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,360
I mean, that bring what they
produce in their fields.
They're, uh, by goat's cheese,

692
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:57,740
Pico doll, uh, you know, whatever
wine, uh, from producers directly.

693
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,000
And that's part of the ambulance.

694
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:01,670
That's what's great about living in France
or living in Germany or living in pay

695
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:04,120
by or living anywhere in
Belgium, in Belgium. And,

696
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:09,050
and so many people will go and guided
by the big things of milk and, and,

697
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:10,850
uh, uh, you know, uh,

698
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,150
the big items of paper
towels and all that,

699
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,940
but then they will still go to the market,

700
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,650
not just for a trip of nostalgia,
uh,

701
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,640
but because the products they know they're
buying from people they know and all

702
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,000
that.

703
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,800
So that fear was probably turned out to
be less than a one had a worried about.

704
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,450
Um,
and then of course,

705
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:33,980
there's the question of
from lay every about,

706
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,740
oh, maybe five or six, seven years,

707
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:40,910
somebody in and in one of the
ministries gets it into his or her head.

708
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,120
That framed lais has to, uh, you know,

709
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,110
has to disappear from the vocabulary,
the official vocabulary,

710
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:51,610
the administrative vocabulary
of France from, uh,

711
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,890
is the absorption into a daily
parlance of words that are,

712
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,260
uh,

713
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,260
non-French of which it was the
first one that really took over,

714
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,300
uh, at least in my memory was Lou
weekend. And there were attempts,

715
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:15,290
I think, energy scale this time. And
there's one even more recently, um,

716
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,590
under early stages of [inaudible], uh, uh,

717
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,960
presidency to a stem stern
circulars around saying,

718
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,110
in a correspondence,
you shall not use Lou weekend,

719
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,100
but you'd rather use the fat, the Lhasa
men, the end of the, well, I mean,

720
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:34,300
that lasted about a matter of days,
uh,

721
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,640
because that's simply not
terribly a practical, uh,

722
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,770
English words began to permeate,
uh, with a sort of chic,

723
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,510
uh, uh, chic, a sense of being cool. Uh,

724
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,210
the French language drug store,
I can remember,

725
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,460
remember around penalty
San Angelo [inaudible],

726
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:58,700
Sasha map the metro there on thoughts
right across there was Lou drug store and

727
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,160
it was, it was a pharmacy. It had had
your basic green flashing light thing.

728
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:04,990
It's a pharmacy,
but they also sold all sorts of things.

729
00:45:04,991 --> 00:45:08,970
So it was almost like a anticipating a,
a a supermarket.

730
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,770
And the term was low drug stock.
Uh, it wasn't a union pharmacy,

731
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:17,130
it was La Pharmacy,
it was Lou drug store.

732
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,050
And people debated that you could
go on and on about this. Um,

733
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,940
I'll just give you a couple of examples.
I mean, these are obvious ones.

734
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:26,130
I just wrote them down because they're,
because they're obvious,

735
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:30,510
but I pray ugly sweaters,
sweater with the, there was, he,

736
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:34,960
they fully fashioned, uh,
uh, [inaudible] uh, uh,

737
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,880
new. Say Smith. S. M. A. R. T a what?

738
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:43,770
A virtual shopping club. Uh,
Lavati tabla wash and wear.

739
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,870
Uh, they, they drink, they Zhong, Rafi Ne,
the drink of people who are refined. Now,

740
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:53,700
this had already started to happen in
the night and the 1890s with certain

741
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:56,520
terms. As I suggested round,
you're talking about I meet re, uh,

742
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:01,050
they began to into the long drink. For
example, they began infiltrate the, uh,

743
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,390
the French, uh, language. Uh,

744
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,170
the hot dog became the chef show,
uh,

745
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,070
in these times of these
various commands. But, but, uh,

746
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,990
basically with the global,
with globalization and
with the American cultural,

747
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:19,940
uh, uh, a dominance, uh,
these attempts are, uh,

748
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,560
are basically just putting a,
uh,

749
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,700
small fingers in very large dykes.
Why did it matter so much?

750
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:31,590
All of this is because Francis no
longer a great power. Uh, and it's,

751
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,850
uh, and, uh, intellectuals and lots
of other people, uh, in France,

752
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:40,740
including me, are determined, uh,
that French culture, uh, retain. Uh,

753
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:45,660
it's, it's place in the world.
And, uh, I am chronically,

754
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,310
uh, sad to see another supermarket go up
where they're already been. Two of them.

755
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,440
Uh, it saddens me terribly,
uh, to, uh, you know,

756
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,710
see the Golden Arches,
uh, almost everywhere now.

757
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,870
Uh, a subway, which is a chain that
have actually happened at like a lot.

758
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,870
Uh, and those, those are, uh,
becoming, uh, all over the place. Uh,

759
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,150
so you're fighting against the waves
that cannot be, um, uh, they cannot,

760
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,860
cannot be halted.
Uh,

761
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,280
but in a way may not be
all a very bad thing.

762
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,610
So long as a sense of
perspective is maintained,

763
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:24,390
and that often was not maintained
in the early days of the,

764
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:27,820
almost hysterical a battle against,
uh,

765
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,870
the mounting empire of Coca Cola.

766
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,800
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving
vacation. See You, uh,

767
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,960
see you next time and go blue.
