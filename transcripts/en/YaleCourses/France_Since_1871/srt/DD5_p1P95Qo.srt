1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,191
So,

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,024
um,

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,350
the subject is,

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,130
is drank in in particular
drinking too much and,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,700
uh,

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,650
want to make it very obvious point that,

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,543
uh,

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,540
that drink and drinking a for better
or for worse often for the ladder as

9
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,830
closely tied to,

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,820
uh,

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,690
the economy,

12
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:22,200
a political life culture,

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,270
a social life sociability of,

14
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:26,104
of France.

15
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,640
Um,

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,473
and that,

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,050
uh,

18
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,501
this is,

19
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:33,501
has always been the case
as a wine producing country
and a country that a in the

20
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,553
course of the,

21
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,530
over the centuries produced
lots of other alcohol as well.

22
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,731
So,

23
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,420
uh,

24
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,871
let's,

25
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,440
um,

26
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,820
let's get going on that here.

27
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,970
I've drawn on the work
of an old friend of mine,

28
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,790
Susanna Barrows,

29
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,361
who studied,

30
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,110
uh,

31
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,530
uh,

32
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,840
studied aspects of this and,

33
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,261
and,

34
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:49,800
uh,

35
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,420
lots of other people as well.

36
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,940
And in addition to some,

37
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:55,980
probably a firsthand experience,

38
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,030
uh,

39
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,470
not about drinking too much of course,

40
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,180
but about,

41
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,960
uh,

42
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,930
about living in,

43
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:01,830
in France.

44
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,401
Uh,

45
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,560
in 1934,

46
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,100
the president of the France quite
forgettable character called the Alabama,

47
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,530
uh,

48
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,191
said that,

49
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:11,281
uh,

50
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:11,930
wine,

51
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,570
um,

52
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,340
does not only confer health and vigor
vigor to those people who are drinking it,

53
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,390
it has soothing properties that both
ensure the rational equilibrium of the

54
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,370
organism and create a
predisposition to harmony among men.

55
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,511
In addition,

56
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,010
it can be in difficult times.

57
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:33,390
It can poor confidence and hope
into our hesitating hearts.

58
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:33,751
Uh,

59
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,010
one of course thinks of,

60
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,520
uh,

61
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,310
of Peyto increasing the rum ration.

62
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,140
Uh,

63
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,450
uh,

64
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,283
it felt done,

65
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,830
uh,

66
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,920
in 1916 and the regular rounds of,

67
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,400
uh,

68
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,050
of doing shots before you,

69
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:46,290
uh,

70
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,710
went over the trenches,

71
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:48,810
the hesitating hearts,

72
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:49,290
uh,

73
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,080
soon a,

74
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,050
a dead hearts.

75
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,660
Uh,

76
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,180
there has been in France
a very long time from,

77
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,840
uh,

78
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,673
from the,

79
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,540
from about the 1880s,

80
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,720
a raw really into the early nineties,

81
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,190
1990s,

82
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,820
uh,

83
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,160
a denial of the problem of drinking.

84
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,750
This is not only France,

85
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,381
Poland,

86
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:07,711
of course,

87
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,680
which has even a higher
a rate of alcoholism.

88
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,390
I spent a lot of time
in Poland these days.

89
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:12,811
And you know,

90
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,250
it's really kind of amazing.

91
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,031
Uh,

92
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:15,631
and in,

93
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:16,464
in Russia,

94
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,150
uh,

95
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,310
uh,

96
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,210
as well.

97
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:18,841
Uh,

98
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,661
but because of the,

99
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:19,901
the,

100
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,700
the identity,

101
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,200
the identity of France and its national
identity with products of quality,

102
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,310
with fine wines,

103
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,630
with fine Boldo,

104
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,220
with fine Burgundy,

105
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,031
uh,

106
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,290
this denial became,

107
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,250
became rather,

108
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:32,630
um,

109
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,180
uh,

110
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,931
easier.

111
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,341
And the,

112
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:36,450
and the people who drank too much,

113
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,171
uh,

114
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,610
we're not drinking Feinberg and he's,

115
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:38,761
and,

116
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:39,091
and,

117
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:39,500
uh,

118
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,720
uh,

119
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,950
find Boldo no,

120
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:41,784
are they,

121
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,781
uh,

122
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:43,614
today,

123
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,041
uh,

124
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,810
in 1875,

125
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:50,670
I barrows discovered that's a [inaudible]
of EMC actor informed it's readers

126
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,410
that in our country,

127
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,570
other drunkenness is not unknown.

128
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,620
It is far from having a character as
repellent and isn't the forests as an

129
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,230
England and as in America.

130
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:02,921
Now,

131
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,180
one of the reasons why,

132
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,541
you know,

133
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,790
a dictionary consulted by,

134
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,850
so what he's doing of people over
the ages could throw out such a line.

135
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,660
It's because there's been a
close identification with,

136
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,880
with people who are drinking too much
in particularly the lower classes in,

137
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,780
um,

138
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,580
in Britain with drinking hard liquor,

139
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,600
a gin.

140
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,370
I mean that isn't,

141
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:20,580
you know,

142
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,413
Hogarth and,

143
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,621
and,

144
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:22,690
and the prince,

145
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,970
and not just not just
getting wasted on beer.

146
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,901
Um,

147
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,040
and the United States,

148
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,900
a as Louis flee from cell found out,

149
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,680
uh,

150
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,660
the drink of choice was bourbon,

151
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,200
uh,

152
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,040
and uh,

153
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,260
and various whiskeys as in,

154
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,950
uh,

155
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,311
uh,

156
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,031
as in Scotland.

157
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:37,291
So,

158
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,290
so wine seem to be,

159
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,010
you know,

160
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,631
seem to be,

161
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:39,851
be,

162
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:40,900
be okay.

163
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,243
Um,

164
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,380
and um,

165
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,320
in England where the temperance
movement closely tied to,

166
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,651
you know,

167
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:47,861
to,

168
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,350
to organized religion
was terribly important.

169
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,441
And in,

170
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,220
in the Scandinavian states and in Germany,

171
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:54,700
uh,

172
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,080
the temperance movement was a,

173
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,120
but a small,

174
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,640
a dyke had put up against the,

175
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,110
against the waves,

176
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,801
the hurricane,

177
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,910
like waves of,

178
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,241
of,

179
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:04,471
of,

180
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:04,761
of,

181
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:05,111
of,

182
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:05,944
of drink.

183
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,353
Now

184
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,263
wine,

185
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,590
his always been,

186
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,010
you know,

187
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,930
produced in France,

188
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,141
uh,

189
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,070
for uh,

190
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,360
for centuries and centuries.

191
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,310
There is a wine called call nos.

192
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,030
Uh,

193
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,680
Cor,

194
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,441
Nas.

195
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,820
It's produced down here,

196
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,570
uh,

197
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,403
in all that,

198
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,130
um,

199
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,520
uh,

200
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
quite near their own.

201
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,860
It's a very dark,

202
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,180
uh,

203
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,450
coastal and uniform to say very,

204
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,950
very hardy red wine that has
to be sat down for a long time.

205
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,570
That one of the Roman poets,

206
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,440
uh,

207
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,780
discussed in some Romans Century,

208
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,640
uh,

209
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,340
uh,

210
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,260
BC century.

211
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,950
Um,

212
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,390
in that particular region,

213
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,950
people had to produce wine.

214
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,600
Most of it was bad wine in order to trade
the wine for something to eat because

215
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,260
the reach of that particular
region that called the Viva,

216
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:51,461
hey,

217
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:52,160
it doesn't matter.

218
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,130
Couldn't produce very much
at all because of the,

219
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,190
of the rocky soil.

220
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,430
And so they would trade
their rather bad wine,

221
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:57,881
uh,

222
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,530
for,

223
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:58,900
uh,

224
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,980
for lentils,

225
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,581
for example,

226
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,530
produced around loopy higher up.

227
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,130
It doesn't matter.

228
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,290
Well,

229
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,400
wine had always been I,

230
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,380
the details don't matter.

231
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,040
So wine,

232
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,930
it always been a produced,

233
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,690
but a wine was fairly expensive.

234
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,550
And so people as we'll see in a while,

235
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,061
uh,

236
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,080
began to,

237
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:14,291
uh,

238
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,720
drink to drink other things.

239
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:17,860
Um,

240
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,200
Boldo wines where we're well known in,

241
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,840
in England and,

242
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,601
and thus a,

243
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:22,850
you know,

244
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,121
in,

245
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:26,170
in Britain they refer to
red wine is a clarity.

246
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,680
Uh,

247
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,630
and the reason that burgundy wines,

248
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,900
we're not well known in
Britain is fairly easy.

249
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,753
Just look at a map.

250
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,940
Boldo a dangerous trips,

251
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,451
uh,

252
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:34,721
you know,

253
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:34,960
uh,

254
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,980
across the,

255
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,761
around the,

256
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:37,481
around France,

257
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,111
around Brittany.

258
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,760
Would end up a wines arriving in,

259
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:40,060
in,

260
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,350
in,

261
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,950
in British ports where,

262
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,461
for example,

263
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,294
in Belgium,

264
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,950
uh,

265
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,200
uh,

266
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,641
when people,

267
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:44,771
you know,

268
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,630
people drink great wines
are very good wines,

269
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,050
they tend to drink a
burgundy's because of,

270
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
because of the way,

271
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,940
uh,

272
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,121
the,

273
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:52,030
the lay of the land,

274
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,421
uh,

275
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,740
the land works.

276
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,550
Um,

277
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,061
but what's,

278
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:56,470
what's interesting about and what we're,

279
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:56,671
what,

280
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:58,670
what fits right into what
we're talking about is,

281
00:05:58,671 --> 00:05:58,821
you know,

282
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:03,821
where people drank because obviously
the role of the cafe is so fundamental,

283
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,361
uh,

284
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,080
in France,

285
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,760
economic,

286
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,401
a political,

287
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,650
social and cultural life.

288
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,484
There's just a,

289
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:10,910
I mean,

290
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,320
any aspect you think of,

291
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,280
of modern France,

292
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:16,880
particularly in the third republic
is closely tied to that institution.

293
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,740
Uh,

294
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:17,930
you know,

295
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,790
impressionist painting for example,

296
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,200
uh,

297
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,480
uh,

298
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,140
the role of cafe [inaudible] where you
could go and be entertained as you,

299
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,920
uh,

300
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,330
as you drank,

301
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,020
uh,

302
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,620
uh,

303
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,070
is,

304
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,341
uh,

305
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,410
is important in,

306
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,660
in impressionism or paintings of,

307
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,040
uh,

308
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,331
of,

309
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:37,160
of the coast of the Norman coast by
Moh Hizo and lots of other people,

310
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,521
you know,

311
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:38,070
drink is,

312
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,170
is it's totally,

313
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,501
you know,

314
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,201
prevalent and,

315
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:40,431
and,

316
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:40,791
and,

317
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,150
uh,

318
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,361
you know,

319
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,680
the guy and all the other ones.

320
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:42,891
I mean,

321
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:43,670
there's just the,

322
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,150
uh,

323
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,751
uh,

324
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,400
the practice pupation
with absent for example,

325
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:48,880
which more about that in a while,

326
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,110
which is just guys,

327
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,530
Darren,

328
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,910
it's just been a made legal again
within the last couple of years.

329
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:56,960
Um,

330
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,261
Eh,

331
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:57,651
you know,

332
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:01,850
cafes or where deals did use to get
done and we're deals to get done.

333
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,520
Or if you're living in a large city,

334
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,480
uh,

335
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,313
in a city,

336
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,700
in a world of apartments,

337
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,481
people will tend to,

338
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,500
first time they will invite you,

339
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,650
will be to a cafe often not to their own,

340
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,600
uh,

341
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,540
their own home.

342
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,410
Um,

343
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,480
but just as at restaurants,

344
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,530
which I'll talk about it at the end,

345
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,390
if their time,

346
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,830
uh,

347
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,301
I mean,

348
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:23,360
cafes themselves are of
relatively in French history,

349
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,350
recent phenomenon,

350
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,910
even the word Cafe,

351
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,481
a cafe.

352
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:26,870
What does it,

353
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,910
what does cafe a cafe is coffee.

354
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,810
Uh,

355
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,830
and it is with the rival of,

356
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:32,010
of,

357
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,301
of,

358
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:32,960
of,

359
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,830
of a,

360
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,720
of coffees from,

361
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,070
uh,

362
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,201
uh,

363
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:37,430
the new world.

364
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:37,951
Uh,

365
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:39,860
that becomes the real rave,

366
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,780
the real hit of the 18th century.

367
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:43,970
And that the emergence in
Britain of the Coffee House,

368
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,690
uh,

369
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,580
where politics is done,

370
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,090
uh,

371
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,631
we use,

372
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:52,631
and I use today cafe to be a
generic place where one drinks,

373
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,410
but in fact in the period
that we're considering at
the end of the 19th century,

374
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,280
uh,

375
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,940
uh,

376
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,601
people were,

377
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:03,470
were clever enough to realize that and
aware of their surroundings enough to

378
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,530
know that under the cafes are where
they're wealthy people went on the big

379
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:09,900
boulevards of Paris or on the root
level of Public Kid Republique in,

380
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:10,071
in,

381
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:10,904
in Leone,

382
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,420
uh,

383
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,020
or,

384
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,141
uh,

385
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:16,790
in the fancy neighborhoods of almost
every large city and ordinary people went

386
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,140
to drink in places,

387
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,860
uh,

388
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,461
where,

389
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:19,910
uh,

390
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,050
they did not often serve cafe
because it was so expensive.

391
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,591
And if they did,

392
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:27,020
it was a fairly rare thing
cause cafe was expensive.

393
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,230
Drink as we'll see in a while,

394
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,830
cost absolutely nothing.

395
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,390
And,

396
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,900
and even the names.

397
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:33,890
And I just picked a few,

398
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:34,160
you know,

399
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,270
six or seven.

400
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,710
I,

401
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,270
nobody's responsible for this and maybe
the French people would like to think

402
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:38,631
about this,

403
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,050
but,

404
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,770
but uh,

405
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,070
uh,

406
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,371
just,

407
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:40,611
you know,

408
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:40,950
the,

409
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,730
the kind of described
where people go to drink,

410
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,241
uh,

411
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,130
it varies from region to region often.

412
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:47,420
But let me just go through this briefly.

413
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,441
A cafe.

414
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:48,770
Well,

415
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,603
I've already said that.

416
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,090
Um,

417
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,511
and wait,

418
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,230
how they change because the days
of the CPM machine are all gone.

419
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,260
The pinball machine and all that.

420
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:54,411
I mean,

421
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,560
it just changes my God.

422
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,160
Now there's,

423
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,461
you know,

424
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:57,550
Starbucks had ha,

425
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,710
I mean I have nothing against Starbucks.

426
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,010
Do I?

427
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,520
I don't know.

428
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,310
But I have arrived in
Paris now and you know,

429
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:02,640
that's it.

430
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,380
That's as much of a shock.

431
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,320
And Dare I say blow is the arrival of,

432
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:06,530
of,

433
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:06,810
of,

434
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,860
of Mcdonald's,

435
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,580
you know,

436
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,091
uh,

437
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:09,811
in all those years ago.

438
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:10,121
But anyway,

439
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:10,954
a cabinet and a,

440
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,910
when you think of cabaret,

441
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:12,331
you think of,

442
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,250
you don't with the Cabernet and people
think of people dancing and who think of,

443
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:15,781
you know,

444
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:18,000
Berlin and an it twenties
or something like that.

445
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,390
But a cabaret was a place for
ordinary people went to drink.

446
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,580
That's what a category is,

447
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,250
is,

448
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:23,550
uh,

449
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,210
an sw ne is simply a
word for the same thing.

450
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,540
Uh,

451
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,710
but in the north of
France and the stomach,

452
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:29,900
Nate,

453
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,733
you wouldn't go to,

454
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,261
to,

455
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:31,700
uh,

456
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:31,990
you know,

457
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,550
Isiah,

458
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,720
you wouldn't go to my say and I,

459
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,350
you know,

460
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,960
asked for the local stymie Ne,

461
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,840
uh,

462
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,231
again,

463
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,690
get it sort of a rural
place that you would drink.

464
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,740
Uh,

465
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,491
and again,

466
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm thinking of impressionist
paintings that you might've seen with,

467
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,660
with a role of people going up there.

468
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,100
And I'm Sunday,

469
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,850
uh,

470
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,150
uh,

471
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,650
both,

472
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:48,960
you know,

473
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,660
males,

474
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:49,900
uh,

475
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,220
unattached males looking
for unattached females and,

476
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:55,080
and families going out
and along the Marne,

477
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,580
which in the 1920s and thirties,

478
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:57,930
outside of Paris was a real,

479
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,420
real hot place to go.

480
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,710
Uh,

481
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:01,951
you know,

482
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,240
again,

483
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,510
get with very rural,

484
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,950
Rural Abou Shawl.

485
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,170
The word in French
Bouchard show means a cork.

486
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,621
Uh,

487
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,320
it also means a traffic
jam as a cork in a bottle,

488
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,071
as a traffic jam.

489
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,180
Nobody can get through cause it's
bushland or wine can be Boucher in a too,

490
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,371
but,

491
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:15,990
but anyway,

492
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,380
uh,

493
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,561
uh,

494
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:16,741
but,

495
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:16,771
uh,

496
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,140
Bouchama is a rural drinking place.

497
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,700
And when I think of Boucher,

498
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,050
I think of a place where,

499
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,710
uh,

500
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,011
you know,

501
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:24,270
you go with your friends and,

502
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:24,601
and,

503
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:25,020
uh,

504
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,500
uh,

505
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,820
maybe play a little boost,

506
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,241
you know,

507
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,680
a alongside of that and,

508
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,120
and it's,

509
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,090
it's identity,

510
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:30,781
you've leisure,

511
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:31,790
but seeking the,

512
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,281
you know,

513
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,140
seeking the outside of,

514
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:34,531
of,

515
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,060
uh,

516
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,770
um,

517
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:35,940
you know,

518
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,210
you know,

519
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,170
of the city,

520
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,770
uh,

521
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,190
uh,

522
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,690
to find some greenery,

523
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,180
uh,

524
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,013
on a,

525
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,020
uh,

526
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,380
on a Sunday.

527
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,741
And you know,

528
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,551
I think of lean all,

529
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:45,301
for example,

530
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,270
of all the uni at the
end of the 19th century,

531
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,010
going across the Rhone River,

532
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,610
uh,

533
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,390
to,

534
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,223
uh,

535
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,540
working class full book called Lucky ots.

536
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,280
And then going further out in
these places like Brooke Toe,

537
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:57,661
it doesn't matter,

538
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,320
but where,

539
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,741
where,

540
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:58,891
uh,

541
00:10:58,891 --> 00:10:59,101
you know,

542
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,740
it was just full of places to drink,

543
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,280
uh,

544
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,731
or,

545
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:03,300
um,

546
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,470
uh,

547
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,200
Sean Sean put a w is,

548
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:08,760
is a form of a place of
male sociability women.

549
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,690
Uh,

550
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,740
I did not go there.

551
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:13,030
Usually it was sort of a
club where you're drinking a,

552
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,460
essentially tax free,

553
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,280
uh,

554
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,820
uh,

555
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,030
uh,

556
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,610
booze on the sly.

557
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:17,871
And it,

558
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:18,451
it's more,

559
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,520
it's identified particularly
with the department called the,

560
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,810
via a Var,

561
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,890
which is a,

562
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,360
you don't have to remember obviously that,

563
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:24,660
but it,

564
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:24,850
it,

565
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,230
uh,

566
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,090
which is so we don't,

567
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:27,780
we're too long isn't central pay.

568
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,470
Uh,

569
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,670
and they were important because in the
second republic that is 1848 to 1851,

570
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,780
this is one of the places where politics
sort of came to very ordinary people.

571
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,800
Um,

572
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,371
so,

573
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:39,040
uh,

574
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,000
but what'd you have as an
expansion of these places that,

575
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,834
that simply,

576
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:43,600
uh,

577
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,330
simply,

578
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:44,630
uh,

579
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,810
a phenomenal,

580
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,800
um,

581
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
and it,

582
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,493
um,

583
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,543
uh,

584
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,380
it's hard to say.

585
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,600
I guess you'd probably is more accurate
to say that the expansion and the

586
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,920
production of wine,

587
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,910
uh,

588
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,910
helps generate the expansion of places
to drink along with the expansion of,

589
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,030
uh,

590
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,601
of,

591
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,434
um,

592
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,970
uh,

593
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,150
of,

594
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,330
of the population,

595
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:07,750
uh,

596
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,860
itself.

597
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,281
Uh,

598
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:12,670
between 1840 and 1875,

599
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,091
uh,

600
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,970
the monitor wine produced
in France doubled.

601
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,310
Now this is the same time
as the population has,

602
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:19,420
is stagnating.

603
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
Um,

604
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,350
and in part this is because they're,

605
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,390
they're better roads and
there's railways to carry,

606
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:25,910
uh,

607
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,140
uh,

608
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,260
carry wine that's produced to,

609
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:29,050
um,

610
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,120
to a far off places,

611
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,540
but regions that hadn't traditionally
who'd produced much wine,

612
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,523
for example,

613
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,493
Columbia,

614
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,453
uh,

615
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,180
which Ann Rousse young way down here,

616
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:40,750
uh,

617
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,370
that is north of packing y'all around
parish renewal and the north of Pepin

618
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,920
y'all,

619
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,380
I begin producing lots
of wine and long doc,

620
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,160
uh,

621
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,521
that is,

622
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,720
this region down here becomes a massive
producer of wine that is around mobile

623
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,471
lea and,

624
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:54,050
and,

625
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,700
and all that.

626
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,200
So more and more wine,

627
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,170
more and more people are
dependent upon upon wine,

628
00:12:59,530 --> 00:12:59,860
uh,

629
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,693
for,

630
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,240
uh,

631
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,410
for getting by.

632
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:02,891
Uh,

633
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:04,490
and as a matter of fact
that lots of people who,

634
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,261
who worked,

635
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:08,950
who work the fields during the
various harvest are paid in wine,

636
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,000
uh,

637
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,230
as part of their salary,

638
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,070
uh,

639
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,560
as opposed and have to take
those kinds of conditions.

640
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:14,651
And,

641
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:15,341
and then of course,

642
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,660
you can't carry a lot of wine with you.

643
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,494
So you ended up getting,

644
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,070
you know,

645
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,200
drinking a lot of it wherever you can.

646
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,920
Um,

647
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,671
and then of course,

648
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:22,630
what comes along,

649
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,130
and this is part of the,

650
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,880
these blows against the rural
economy in the third republic.

651
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:32,881
That helps also explain why the rural
population begins to deep populate.

652
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,360
Why rural France begins to depopulate.

653
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,520
Remember two thirds of the,

654
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,700
they fucked them all have
smaller populations in 1939
than they did an 1871 is

655
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,770
along comes the phylloxera disease here,

656
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,390
the philosopher disease,

657
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:49,240
which starts in the late 1870s.

658
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,373
And uh,

659
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,680
it comes after a another disease called,

660
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:57,610
it doesn't matter the name of the pay
buddying which attacks a silk worm

661
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,341
production.

662
00:13:58,341 --> 00:13:59,800
So it just devastates,

663
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,800
it devastates particularly
this part of France.

664
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,490
But there isn't any place that produced
wine that isn't effected by the flux or,

665
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:07,930
uh,

666
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,110
uh,

667
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,100
and Louis Pasteur,

668
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,060
a name of what you've,

669
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:10,480
uh,

670
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,580
of whom you certainly you've
heard of Louis Pasteur.

671
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,001
I mean,

672
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:14,350
he does a lot of his work,

673
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,591
uh,

674
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:19,330
trying to study the origins of this wine
blight as well as the origins of this

675
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:20,650
silk worm blight,

676
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,460
uh,

677
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,293
that are these,

678
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:22,600
you know,

679
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,950
little began his little tosh,

680
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,610
their little spots on the silkworm.

681
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:25,781
And,

682
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,021
and,

683
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:26,221
and,

684
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:26,520
uh,

685
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:26,870
uh,

686
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,250
flux.

687
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,380
There's basically a disease that,

688
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:28,570
you know,

689
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,250
that attacks the Seth at texts,

690
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,840
that kind of roots of,

691
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:32,674
of uh,

692
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,180
uh,

693
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,660
eh in the vineyards.

694
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,100
And ironically,

695
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,551
you know,

696
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:36,811
what,

697
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:37,081
what,

698
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,270
what resolves the problem is
they restart a planning American,

699
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,290
uh,

700
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,180
um,

701
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,940
roots,

702
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,600
uh,

703
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,880
that plants that are
resistant to the flocks.

704
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,650
A,

705
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,750
and somebody told me recently
that California wine,

706
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:50,970
it's now facing flux.

707
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,810
Ra are,

708
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm not,

709
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,351
I,

710
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,121
I had heard that,

711
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,250
I don't know much about the,

712
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,483
uh,

713
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:55,920
um,

714
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,090
uh,

715
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,290
a California wine.

716
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,071
But what this,

717
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,260
this is just absolutely devastates,

718
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,741
you know,

719
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:01,640
wine production,

720
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,031
uh,

721
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:02,870
in France.

722
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,860
And one of the results is that when
the wine crops begin to bounce back,

723
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,461
you know,

724
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:12,461
in the 1890s that many
places that produced wine
simply stopped producing wine

725
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,190
because it's not a long time.

726
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,230
You can't make any money on it.

727
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,610
Give you a couple of examples,

728
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,021
Brittany.

729
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,840
It's hard to imagine why and being
produced in Brittany outside of a very

730
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,330
ordinary wine called
Mooska day white wine,

731
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:24,021
right on the edge.

732
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,880
And so I've just got off of a reds,

733
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,740
uh,

734
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,110
uh,

735
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,530
also,

736
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:27,770
but,

737
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:27,950
but,

738
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,131
but,

739
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:31,880
but basically that all stops the
production of wine up in the north stops

740
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,140
wherever is possible with big
exception obviously of [inaudible],

741
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:35,870
uh,

742
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,680
here.

743
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,250
Uh,

744
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,761
and,

745
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:37,971
uh,

746
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:38,141
and,

747
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:38,931
and other places.

748
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:39,950
The production of wine,

749
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,440
uh,

750
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,730
Eh,

751
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,120
uh,

752
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,450
you know,

753
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,160
is really cut back.

754
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:43,701
But this is a,

755
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,950
this is a big blow to the rural economy.

756
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:50,810
And lots of people abandoned their fields
or their converted to other things,

757
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,970
but wine bounces back.

758
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,480
And,

759
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,990
uh,

760
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,310
it takes its place again,

761
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:59,270
is one of the real dynamic
forces in modern French life.

762
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,400
But what's incredible is that the,

763
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:01,720
um,

764
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:01,940
you know,

765
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,040
the number of cafes continues
to expand exponentially.

766
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,140
And this suggests an obvious point is
that people drank more than just wine.

767
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,490
More about that in a minute.

768
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,990
Let's give you some suggestions,

769
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,150
some ideas and some figures.

770
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,290
1790,

771
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,980
Paris only had 4,000 cabaret,

772
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,110
4,000 cabaret in a,

773
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:24,110
in a town then of about 600,000 people,

774
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,310
more or less.

775
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,503
Um,

776
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,920
in 1830 places that had licenses to,

777
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,700
uh,

778
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,800
to serve alcohol in France.

779
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,281
Uh,

780
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,110
it was about 280,

781
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,480
2000 in France.

782
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,070
Now let me add one thing now,

783
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:42,080
having a license to sell alcohol.

784
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,650
Uh,

785
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,240
one of the things that really basically
no longer exists anymore but existed

786
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:47,900
until,

787
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,141
uh,

788
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:48,350
you know,

789
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,000
the 1960s,

790
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:50,540
uh,

791
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,140
was,

792
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,530
uh,

793
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,090
places you did other things,

794
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,500
but you could also buy a drink.

795
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:54,681
Well,

796
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:54,851
I mean,

797
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:55,221
I still,

798
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,420
I've been in grocery stores,

799
00:16:56,421 --> 00:17:00,530
it's still our cafes or cafes that are
converted into grocery stores as well.

800
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,100
But,

801
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,510
um,

802
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,260
uh,

803
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,840
uh,

804
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,820
let me give you a ghoulish example.

805
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,361
Um,

806
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,560
I'll talk later about a,

807
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:09,740
or how they're sort of drawn about the
massacre there on the 10th of June,

808
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,900
1944 by the SS and where they simply
kill everybody in the village.

809
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:15,711
And when you go to this,

810
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,030
this sacred site,

811
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,430
a to see what's what they left standing,

812
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,630
which was everything you notice,

813
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:22,440
they're all these places
that were barbershops.

814
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,320
There were also part time drinking places.

815
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:24,980
You know,

816
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,813
I had a barber,

817
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,110
my Barbara in Paris.

818
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:27,261
I mean,

819
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:28,310
I don't go to the Barbara that much,

820
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,570
but he's got a buddy and
he was in the youth center,

821
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:30,871
the wheel.

822
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:33,740
And you had to get to him
early because if you a,

823
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,071
you know,

824
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:34,970
if you got there late,

825
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,571
he'd already got,

826
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:36,281
he already had pies,

827
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:38,870
six or seven or maybe
10 beers and you know,

828
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:42,260
you kind of look even
more damaged than I do.

829
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,040
I tried out Foxton once I said I made
a Honda [inaudible] eight 30 in the

830
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,030
morning because he starts at,

831
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:47,840
at uh,

832
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,673
at nine,

833
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,100
you and I got there and he,

834
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,120
and he was already a,

835
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:52,890
he'd been at that bar quite a long time.

836
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:56,580
A Bar that we call the annex because
that was for the annex of his shot.

837
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:56,911
But anyway,

838
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:57,780
when you see this horrible,

839
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:58,614
he ghoulish place,

840
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,130
uh,

841
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,560
peers of what happened there and they
left everything in the way it is.

842
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,880
You see these part time,

843
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,260
half grocery stores,

844
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,891
half,

845
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:05,370
uh,

846
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:05,730
uh,

847
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,630
drinking places,

848
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:07,500
half barbershops,

849
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,550
half drinking places.

850
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,091
A Boon.

851
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:09,570
Yeah,

852
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,141
I can remember,

853
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:10,470
you know,

854
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,303
in the Monterey,

855
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,130
the center part of the,

856
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,040
the right bank.

857
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,000
I can remember right down the street
from a place that we live for a long time

858
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,590
and not even that far from our apartment.

859
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,130
Uh,

860
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,820
the last,

861
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:20,941
uh,

862
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,720
boonies of the core quarter
and that you bought coal there,

863
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,120
coal and you bought drink there.

864
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,320
So these,

865
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,681
uh,

866
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:29,161
these,

867
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:29,994
uh,

868
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,220
these places that are licensed to sell,

869
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,000
drink,

870
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,480
uh,

871
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,691
you know,

872
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:34,860
cover all sorts of things.

873
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:38,460
They're not just your basic cafe with
the red sign there or whatever the big

874
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:40,570
flashing neon sign or the small ones,

875
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,640
you can barely read.

876
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,510
Uh,

877
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:42,960
uh,

878
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,281
but the,

879
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:44,010
the numbers in Cra,

880
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,670
incredible.

881
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:44,971
Okay.

882
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,020
1865,

883
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,940
this is not count places in Paris.

884
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:48,840
This is in France,

885
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,400
a country that's the size of Montana,

886
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,673
a little bigger,

887
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,350
um,

888
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,820
slightly more populated of course.

889
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,750
Um,

890
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,620
1830 there,

891
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,330
282,000 and France,

892
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,010
1865,

893
00:18:59,011 --> 00:18:59,940
350,

894
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:00,930
1000,

895
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,000
1900,

896
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,430
435,000.

897
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,470
And then they,

898
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:07,591
uh,

899
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:09,180
they count Paris the first time,

900
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,014
the next year,

901
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,360
464,000,

902
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,760
1937,

903
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,790
half a million places to drink.

904
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:18,601
Uh,

905
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:20,100
and in 1953,

906
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,350
a mere 439,000.

907
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,340
Now,

908
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,173
um,

909
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,670
this represents for every man,

910
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,930
woman and child,

911
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,230
one bar for every 97 inhabitance,

912
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,730
one place to barge generic bar
for every 97 and a half minutes,

913
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,800
counting babies coning,

914
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,550
old ladies who could put them down
to maybe more about that in a minute.

915
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Uh,

916
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,990
compared to one for 225 for Italy,

917
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,440
one for every 273 for Germany
and one forever 425 for England.

918
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,570
And also just his side.

919
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:54,751
You know,

920
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,000
I got to concentrate on
going ahead or I'll just,

921
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,110
every time I'd go off inside,

922
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,530
but,

923
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,760
but if you go to El Sauce,

924
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,330
uh,

925
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:00,511
you know,

926
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,520
you don't find cafes in the French sense,

927
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,730
they really serve more
like vine [inaudible] of
drinking places and they look

928
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,230
like German drinking places.

929
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,100
The more influenced by the,

930
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,420
by the culture there.

931
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,360
So this is a huge number of,

932
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,050
um,

933
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,230
uh,

934
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,250
of places to drink,

935
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,960
but it's also regionally specific.

936
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,081
Oh,

937
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,430
here's another good word for you.

938
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:17,880
Uh,

939
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,970
for those people that in France,

940
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:20,550
and I'm not trying to
exclude the others at all,

941
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,320
but it's just kinda fun to talk about.

942
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,453
Uh,

943
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,690
this is more of a,

944
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:24,781
Oh,

945
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:25,441
it's a Parisian,

946
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:26,274
but you know,

947
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,283
uh,

948
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,850
I'll go to my Zach to have a drink.

949
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,860
A Zach means zinc,

950
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,401
like,

951
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:33,210
like the,

952
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:33,931
the metal and,

953
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:34,091
and,

954
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:35,670
and because in a poor cabo,

955
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,250
hey,

956
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,410
rapport bar,

957
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,020
it's not copper or something like Lottie,

958
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,003
like that.

959
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,490
Uh,

960
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,520
those were things like the cafe amount
he can and this sort of sense of luxury

961
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:47,620
being associated in the 90s with the,

962
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,100
uh,

963
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,480
British and American world.

964
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:49,870
You know,

965
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,250
Mosiac is my,

966
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:51,431
you know,

967
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:55,030
sort of grungy bar where I
have my place at the bar,

968
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,360
uh,

969
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,841
which is,

970
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:56,350
uh,

971
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:56,561
you know,

972
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:57,460
depending on how long have you been,

973
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:59,560
there will be near where the Pattan,

974
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:02,050
where the woman who worked
in the cash register is.

975
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,780
We used to go to a place for ages.

976
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,061
In fact,

977
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,020
after I was married,

978
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,510
I was married here in a,

979
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,450
what's that place?

980
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,170
Uh,

981
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,100
Dwight Hall.

982
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:09,920
And then we went up,

983
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,980
we had the reception area
and then we went to France.

984
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,910
And the cafe that we'd
been going to fight,

985
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,400
I had been going to for a very long time,

986
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,000
close to cafes and a little reception
for us are right across from the national

987
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:19,810
archives.

988
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,160
And I'd been there so long that,

989
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:21,341
you know,

990
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:23,500
I moved up to moved up the ladder.

991
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:23,771
So,

992
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:24,910
so when I went in there,

993
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,181
you know,

994
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,740
my place was right next to the,

995
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,071
no,

996
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:29,740
I'm not saying I was
drinking a lot of stuff.

997
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:30,551
I mean I was just there,

998
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:30,701
you know,

999
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:31,660
for conversation,

1000
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,660
you know me well enough already
to know that was the case and,

1001
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,870
but,

1002
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,261
but you know,

1003
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:35,480
it,

1004
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,010
it's,

1005
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,070
there's this sort of hierarchy
there that it has to do with,

1006
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:39,340
you know,

1007
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,690
your association,

1008
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,140
you know,

1009
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,640
with that particular place.

1010
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,050
And that was a very typical place.

1011
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:44,990
And that the uh,

1012
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,360
the,

1013
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,791
the,

1014
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,320
the couple were from Oh,

1015
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:47,750
van.

1016
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,070
Yeah,

1017
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,681
that is in,

1018
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,870
in central France.

1019
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,471
Uh,

1020
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:51,610
born in misery.

1021
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,430
That means they have 13
children I've mentioned before,

1022
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,320
once and 12 and the other case.

1023
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:59,560
And they had got the money together
because they had a neighbor who had no

1024
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,010
children,

1025
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,330
that loaned them the money to get on the
kind of equivalent of the web in those

1026
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:04,331
days.

1027
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:08,860
And to buy a cafe from another person
from o Vannia and then they worked there,

1028
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,101
you know,

1029
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:09,821
everyday from,

1030
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:13,570
from five in the morning
until nine at night.

1031
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,760
And now they're gone.

1032
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,070
It's her,

1033
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,600
she can ridiculous place.

1034
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,080
But,

1035
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,500
uh,

1036
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,920
uh,

1037
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,230
you know,

1038
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,540
there were these places,

1039
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,660
these Zach were ones that you had and
you never went to the one across the

1040
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:23,320
street.

1041
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,010
Never,

1042
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,401
never.

1043
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:25,330
I would go to another place,

1044
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,010
uh,

1045
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,210
uh,

1046
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,370
in the Monterey and I used to start,

1047
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,300
I started going there cause
because [inaudible] went
there and cause Trotsky had

1048
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:34,180
been there and it's called
laptop teen and it's still there.

1049
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,530
And that's a very different
one because all the,

1050
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,910
uh,

1051
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,491
is it now,

1052
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,750
it's also become very chic,

1053
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,471
very Bougie,

1054
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:39,340
very ridiculous.

1055
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:39,451
And,

1056
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:43,300
and with the Bush dollar unaffordable
for almost anyone anyway.

1057
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,170
Um,

1058
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,471
so,

1059
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:46,420
but it's regionally specific in the na,

1060
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,560
which you already know about.

1061
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:50,520
There was one bar for
every 46 inhabitance.

1062
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,371
I mean,

1063
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,300
that's amazing.

1064
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,230
Um,

1065
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,560
and you compare that to a elbows,

1066
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,950
which is a town in Normandy,

1067
00:22:56,951 --> 00:23:01,390
one for every 60 Biz Yay way
down in the south of France,

1068
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,900
uh,

1069
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,210
which had a lower
alcoholism rate by the way.

1070
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,410
A Bez Yay.

1071
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,230
There was one for every 120 people.

1072
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,750
So it tends to be very specific.

1073
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,440
Uh,

1074
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,830
but again,

1075
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,910
this is babies too.

1076
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:16,780
And of course everybody's heard those
horror stories about young mothers in the

1077
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:17,990
1950s,

1078
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:20,050
in the 1930s and the 1890s.

1079
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,441
You know,

1080
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,440
their babies crying all the time
where you get a little bit gay,

1081
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:22,951
but yet,

1082
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:23,050
well,

1083
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,740
a piece of bread and dip
it in some brandy and,

1084
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,630
and the stuff that Brad
in the baby's mouth and,

1085
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:29,240
and uh,

1086
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,450
uh,

1087
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,040
there's a,

1088
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,470
a smiling happy baby
and they get some sleep.

1089
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,690
Is that disastrous or what
is absolutely terrible.

1090
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:37,390
And they have to have these huge
campaigns against all of this.

1091
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,020
But,

1092
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,380
uh,

1093
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,390
but basically babies didn't drink,

1094
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:40,960
uh,

1095
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,890
older people,

1096
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,400
uh,

1097
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,211
did for sure.

1098
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:43,421
You know,

1099
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,960
there's this woman that
used to come into the,

1100
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,800
uh,

1101
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,750
even the terms of what they would drink.

1102
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:48,590
You'd go down in the morning,

1103
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:52,760
I have my coffee before I go to the work
in the archives and really a coffee,

1104
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,241
nothing else.

1105
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:56,630
And there'd be this as this rather
elderly lady in there in May,

1106
00:23:56,631 --> 00:24:00,810
may come on the Alfonsi and she would
be tossing down [inaudible] stack,

1107
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,630
which is a little glass of white wine.

1108
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:05,030
And she would call the drink her Gloria.

1109
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,500
Now that's mocking the
church cause the glory.

1110
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,040
You know what you're seeing in the,

1111
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,540
of what other people
were singing in the mass,

1112
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:16,010
I guess at Gloria in Excelsis Day or
whatever they sang and she would have her,

1113
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,450
Gloria was right there at her,

1114
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:20,190
Zack and that she'd knock a
couple of those babies down and,

1115
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,171
and you know,

1116
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:22,520
go off a little shopping bag,

1117
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,790
maybe lurching and trying to
avoid the 68 buses at roars by,

1118
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,160
and she was out of there.

1119
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:28,611
But,

1120
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:29,061
but you know,

1121
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:29,820
and so you,

1122
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,500
but you,

1123
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,870
you know,

1124
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,551
it's just,

1125
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:31,851
I mean,

1126
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,241
it's also,

1127
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:32,530
I mean,

1128
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:32,650
I,

1129
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:32,961
again,

1130
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:33,321
I said,

1131
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:33,471
you know,

1132
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,700
I'm making fun of this a little bit,

1133
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:36,800
but it's sad because you'd see
all these people just blot,

1134
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,750
or there was a guy at a bar called John.

1135
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:40,730
He was a bit kind of
marginal guy and you know,

1136
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,630
he disappeared.

1137
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:42,680
And so people in the bar,

1138
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,660
I wasn't there that was down
and working in another place.

1139
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,400
But,

1140
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,591
you know,

1141
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,660
people went out and tried
to find him and end up,

1142
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:48,171
cause he was,

1143
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:48,440
uh,

1144
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,900
you know,

1145
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,080
he was on the spree,

1146
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,290
uh,

1147
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:50,750
you know,

1148
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,401
as you said,

1149
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:52,910
that's a term that comes from Berlin.

1150
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,370
Uh,

1151
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,480
I guess when soldiers would get all drunk
up during the occupation and they'd go

1152
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:57,171
on a spree,

1153
00:24:57,171 --> 00:25:00,080
which was the river and get
off and drink way too much,

1154
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,440
uh,

1155
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,273
of these,

1156
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,491
uh,

1157
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:02,690
of these spirits.

1158
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,680
So,

1159
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,513
um,

1160
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,181
how,

1161
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,260
how much did people drink?

1162
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:06,520
I mean,

1163
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,700
it's scary.

1164
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,121
I mean,

1165
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:09,350
it's just scary.

1166
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,573
Um,

1167
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,650
if,

1168
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,340
um,

1169
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,830
the consumption of wine per person,

1170
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,790
per baby,

1171
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,870
per old lady,

1172
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,861
per you,

1173
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:19,371
per everybody,

1174
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:23,720
but I hope not per you was
in 1791 61 liters per year.

1175
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,000
By 1850.

1176
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,520
It was 75 liters per year.

1177
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,290
By 1895 it was 113 liters per year.

1178
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,600
But that's only wine.

1179
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,980
Now.

1180
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,690
Also when people drank at work,

1181
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,530
we have a,

1182
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,620
we have a native former neighbor who
was an alcoholic who stopped drinking.

1183
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,060
He's also moved away.

1184
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:44,421
He's a great,

1185
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,260
he's a wonderful guy.

1186
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,550
He worked at ODF,

1187
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:49,770
which is a big gas factory and
electrical factory and Leon,

1188
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,280
and he would drink six
or seven liters a day,

1189
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,860
a day cause it was so hot where he worked.

1190
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,820
Uh,

1191
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,800
and you see the difference between
American and construction industry and,

1192
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:00,061
and,

1193
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:00,310
and,

1194
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,750
and fragile construction industry as,

1195
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:03,360
as you know,

1196
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,550
I mean,

1197
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,381
sometimes you go there,

1198
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:04,730
they're saying,

1199
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,050
you know,

1200
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,260
they're,

1201
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,650
they're out directing traffic,

1202
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:06,831
you know,

1203
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,210
and they got a bottle in their hand.

1204
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:08,670
Is there,

1205
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,130
there's the directing you along there.

1206
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:10,580
I mean,

1207
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,331
it was part,

1208
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:11,871
unfortunately,

1209
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,280
of the culture of,

1210
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,300
of daily,

1211
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,760
um,

1212
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:14,980
uh,

1213
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,950
a daily existence.

1214
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,570
Now that's just wine.

1215
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,120
Then you have to add these other things.

1216
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,080
And the other things,

1217
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,280
the numbers are just phenomenal.

1218
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,180
Um,

1219
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,680
if you add distilled,

1220
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,400
um,

1221
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,233
uh,

1222
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,110
it's still liquor per capita
consumption of pure alcohol,

1223
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,741
in other words,

1224
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:32,780
all distilled and fortified liquors,

1225
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,580
50 proof and above.

1226
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,031
Uh,

1227
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,510
it was the average was 1.2,

1228
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:37,811
uh,

1229
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:38,644
leaders,

1230
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,970
uh,

1231
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,920
a year.

1232
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,010
That's again counting every
old person and every baby.

1233
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,010
Um,

1234
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,210
and an 1880,

1235
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:48,660
that doubled to 2.24 and by 1,890,

1236
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,160
it was 4.35 liters.

1237
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,800
So that's plus all the
wine on the average.

1238
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,150
And what about beer?

1239
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,770
Now Beer,

1240
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,430
uh,

1241
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,080
was not drunk in France until quite late.

1242
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,900
I again,

1243
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,331
you then,

1244
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:03,751
here we go,

1245
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:04,411
back to myth,

1246
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:08,430
but the myth is that it came back
with was soldiers of Napoleon's armies

1247
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:13,140
returning from the German states just as
the myth that the consumption of vodka,

1248
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:13,974
which is very,

1249
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,470
now there's a big problem because
they tell these companies,

1250
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:19,710
sell this pernicious with vodka
stuff mixed with fruit juice.

1251
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,311
You know,

1252
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:21,051
and then in a,

1253
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:21,330
in,

1254
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,470
in the these days,

1255
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:24,000
students get to get wasted with it.

1256
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:24,240
But the,

1257
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,073
but the taste for,

1258
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,740
uh,

1259
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,320
uh,

1260
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,520
[inaudible] but the,

1261
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:27,681
the,

1262
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:28,110
the,

1263
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,260
uh,

1264
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,400
the,

1265
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
the tea tastes for a,

1266
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:33,900
for vodka was supposedly came to Monaca
with the first Russian restaurant opened

1267
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:36,510
up by occupying soldiers in 18,

1268
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,530
15.

1269
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,960
But the big problem among,

1270
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,290
among,

1271
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,190
well among other problems,

1272
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:43,110
but one of the big promise is absence,

1273
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,280
absence.

1274
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,060
And that's,

1275
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,580
that's worth retaining ab Santas made for,

1276
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,960
from wormwood.

1277
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,441
It used to,

1278
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,580
it was a Beta legal,

1279
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,380
it's physiologically addictive.

1280
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,520
It is addictive.

1281
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,750
Drinking's addictive too.

1282
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,610
But this is physiologically addictive.

1283
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,444
It's bad stuff.

1284
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,200
And they banned it in
1915 because of the war.

1285
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,040
Um,

1286
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,200
and I had some absence.

1287
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,300
We have friends and Bezanson
who don't drink very much,

1288
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:07,520
but they had some absinthe.

1289
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,390
And of course I was willing
to take a shot at that and,

1290
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,380
and uh,

1291
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,071
and drink that,

1292
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,420
and then it became legal again.

1293
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,601
And,

1294
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:13,051
and,

1295
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:13,500
uh,

1296
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,070
um,

1297
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,270
now you can produce it,

1298
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,720
uh,

1299
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,680
and you can drink it.

1300
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:17,461
And it's a,

1301
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,660
it's more of a southern drink.

1302
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:19,494
It's rather like,

1303
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:19,680
no,

1304
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,800
that's what [inaudible] said.

1305
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,230
Tastes are like pasties,

1306
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,540
pasties,

1307
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,170
uh,

1308
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,020
as trustees,

1309
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,920
uh,

1310
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,131
you know,

1311
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:29,400
a sort of licorice tasting
and you mix of water with it.

1312
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,640
Uh,

1313
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,100
hopefully lots of water and
little pasties and you know,

1314
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,260
people in the south and in,

1315
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,050
in Corsica and Maasais and Volo,

1316
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:35,910
Zuken all dash,

1317
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,013
uh,

1318
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,883
you know,

1319
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,730
they're playing boule on
Sunday or something like that.

1320
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,970
It's up until when they locked at the,

1321
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:42,630
you know,

1322
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,800
a couple of pasties and,

1323
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:44,634
and uh,

1324
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,480
um,

1325
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:45,780
you know,

1326
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,800
it's not very good for you.

1327
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:49,740
It actually damages your brain
cells and rather major way.

1328
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,611
You might have noticed.

1329
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:51,031
I don't know.

1330
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:51,980
But anyway,

1331
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,230
I,

1332
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,950
I,

1333
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,430
I,

1334
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,270
I,

1335
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,451
no,

1336
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:54,770
I don't,

1337
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,140
I don't,

1338
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,650
I don't drink,

1339
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,330
I don't drink very much pesticides at all.

1340
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:57,900
Uh,

1341
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,350
but,

1342
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,950
um,

1343
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,510
but absence became one of the,

1344
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:01,671
you know,

1345
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:03,000
the focuses of,

1346
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,850
of even some of the
impressionist paintings of cafe,

1347
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,620
uh,

1348
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:06,790
uh,

1349
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,130
of cafe life.

1350
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,340
I think it's Degas who has the absence
drinker a where you see a woman sitting

1351
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:16,230
next to a man and you don't
know their relationship.

1352
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:17,730
They're anonymous in the cafe.

1353
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:18,750
You've kind of figured it out.

1354
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,950
And in this painting,

1355
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:20,784
which I should have brought in,

1356
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,500
but I forgot,

1357
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:21,870
uh,

1358
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,410
to God,

1359
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,560
brings you into it by not having
any price at any table leg.

1360
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:27,360
And so you wonder
where's the table league?

1361
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:30,570
And then you reach the glass and you
see the glass and it's simply called

1362
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:33,990
absinthe and is always on
the cover of Emile Zola us,

1363
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,010
which we'll come to now.

1364
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,390
Uh,

1365
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,040
immune so allows less,

1366
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,090
some wow.

1367
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,110
Inevitably in,

1368
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:40,640
in,

1369
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,100
uh,

1370
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,390
uh,

1371
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:41,771
in the,

1372
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:42,940
in the translation,

1373
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,253
um,

1374
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,410
Zola realized among
others that France was,

1375
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,530
seemed to be drinking himself to death.

1376
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,740
And this came at a time
when there was fear.

1377
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,060
I bought the French population,

1378
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:56,080
which I've already said,

1379
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,310
uh,

1380
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,130
that the French population
is not reproducing itself.

1381
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,661
And so they're,

1382
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:03,220
they're afraid of that and less time.

1383
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:03,730
Why,

1384
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,563
uh,

1385
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,600
briefly is the story about the decline
of the fall less someone who really,

1386
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:10,720
you can't even translate it.

1387
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,140
It's not never translated,

1388
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,920
uh,

1389
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,330
left somewhere would
mean I had got to be us.

1390
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:16,691
So may,

1391
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,520
it would be just completely get wiped out.

1392
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,473
But also,

1393
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,020
uh,

1394
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,890
if you went to a place,

1395
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:23,290
a bar every day instead
of coming to class,

1396
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,100
uh,

1397
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,341
you know,

1398
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:25,690
that the place that you went,

1399
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:25,891
that,

1400
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,280
that caused your ruin,

1401
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:27,940
uh,

1402
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,570
would be the place of your fall sort of.

1403
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:32,021
So it's got,

1404
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:32,501
but anyway,

1405
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:36,910
it just translate as the dive that was
a bad translation once somebody did or

1406
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:37,330
just,

1407
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,020
uh,

1408
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,660
the bar or less time wise
or were things going wrong.

1409
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,040
And it's a story about a woman
calls you have this and um,

1410
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,910
and her,

1411
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,773
uh,

1412
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,230
her family and quotes
and as part of his long,

1413
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,890
a long series of novels and,

1414
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:53,724
and uh,

1415
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,400
uh,

1416
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,320
they all basically drinking
themselves to death.

1417
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,320
And when she dies in a bed
of Straw at the end of the,

1418
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
of the novel,

1419
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:02,740
when one of the amazing scenes and,

1420
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:03,130
and,

1421
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,390
and,

1422
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,840
and the doctors are looking at,

1423
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:05,111
at,

1424
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:08,890
at her partner who's just
completely a raving alcoholic,

1425
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,820
uh,

1426
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,031
you know,

1427
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:10,191
it,

1428
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:10,401
it,

1429
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:10,701
it,

1430
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:11,020
it,

1431
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,650
it touched,

1432
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,790
it touched many,

1433
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,690
many people.

1434
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:14,700
And the upper classes were,

1435
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,191
were say,

1436
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:15,521
well,

1437
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:16,630
there they go again.

1438
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:16,901
You know,

1439
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:20,110
they're drinking cause they're the
drunken commoner a while they were putting

1440
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,420
away their apoe and Fmol
by the ways that you know,

1441
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,790
a drink or two or three
that people would have,

1442
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,390
uh,

1443
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,950
before a dinner.

1444
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,190
And so a lot of published this in 1877
and what it was according to Barrows and

1445
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,320
other people,

1446
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,451
uh,

1447
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:34,450
it was a call,

1448
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,350
a cry of alarm for parliament
to do something about that.

1449
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,270
Uh,

1450
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:39,721
he,

1451
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:40,780
he was a man of the left.

1452
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:43,900
He defended Dreyfus against the
church and against the army.

1453
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,734
And uh,

1454
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,191
uh,

1455
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:46,930
and all of that as you know,

1456
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,440
but,

1457
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,191
but it was a,

1458
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:49,630
it was a non political,

1459
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,130
it was a political statement.

1460
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:54,670
He just wants somebody to do something
about the fact that the French seem to be

1461
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,110
drinking themselves to death.

1462
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,870
And if you didn't believe that all
you had to do was to go up to him,

1463
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,713
Omar,

1464
00:31:59,760 --> 00:31:59,981
oh,

1465
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:00,880
as today.

1466
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,050
And see all the people,

1467
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:03,090
all and a lot of them are,

1468
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,690
are sort of sad sacks who had
terrible things happen to them.

1469
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:05,860
But,

1470
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,201
but the,

1471
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:09,130
the problem is just
simply absolutely amazing.

1472
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,560
Now that this book lesson,

1473
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,493
wow,

1474
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,040
there were 38 printings
of the book in one year,

1475
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,000
uh,

1476
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,620
after that year with publication again,

1477
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:20,980
1877 and by 1882,

1478
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:21,880
uh,

1479
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,670
over 100,000 copies had been,

1480
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,121
uh,

1481
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,050
been sold.

1482
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,780
Gimme given the example
that Barrow is also,

1483
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,430
uh,

1484
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,890
um,

1485
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,790
found interesting,

1486
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,833
um,

1487
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,370
of the influence of the book even
in the way w the way that the first

1488
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,490
psychologists are the first sociologist,

1489
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,530
the first anthropologist
described crowd behavior.

1490
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,700
There was a guy called Gustaf
who wrote a book Lube Oil.

1491
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,360
He Bon,

1492
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,250
who wrote a book called the crowd.

1493
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,150
And because know France was the France
of revolution and strikes the cause veal

1494
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,110
and these other places,

1495
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,160
these other scenes that
you know about from,

1496
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,780
uh,

1497
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,320
uh,

1498
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,560
uh,

1499
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,580
your me now,

1500
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,870
he was interested in the
way that crowds behaved.

1501
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,650
And he described them in ways that
reflected three of the kind of cultural,

1502
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:16,790
intellectual preoccupations
of the period of the,

1503
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,920
of the third republic
before World War One.

1504
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,353
First,

1505
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,000
he describes crowds as flighty,

1506
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,850
that they'll go from one place to another.

1507
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,601
Think of the women,

1508
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,130
the castration scene,

1509
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,521
you know,

1510
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,790
in the indycars veal.

1511
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,580
Uh,

1512
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,413
and that was the,

1513
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,840
that was her fucking by the fact that
women were supposed to be flighty and not

1514
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:36,471
rational.

1515
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:41,060
And what does that fear reflect or
fears reflective feminism of people like

1516
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,960
Michelle hole and of women putting four
claims for the right to vote and for

1517
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:46,190
other things as well.

1518
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,211
Secondly,

1519
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:48,044
crowds were,

1520
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,430
we're supposed to be able
to be manipulated by people
on a big white horse like

1521
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:52,810
Foodland,

1522
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,270
shame that crowds didn't
have minds of their own,

1523
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,080
but the rationality would sort
of be sucked out of them by,

1524
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,490
by the moment.

1525
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,550
And what does this reflect
reflects the first,

1526
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,061
you know,

1527
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:09,330
interest in hypnosis if Sharko
when we've read about and,

1528
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:09,880
and,

1529
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,230
and chips our wines,

1530
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,190
a book,

1531
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,830
charcoal chr cot,

1532
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,080
whom Freud went to visit a,

1533
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,090
to pay homage to when he went to Paris
and serve crowds were supposed to lurch

1534
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,320
like drunks and the image of the drunk
and commoner this or upperclass view that

1535
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:34,970
the commune was the work of the people
who had nothing to eat but found plenty

1536
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:36,710
to drink in Paris.

1537
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,440
In the cove of other
peoples' fancy apartments,

1538
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:45,130
that the drunk and commoner was capable
of inflicting the same kind of harm and

1539
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:46,640
the upper classes,

1540
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,330
uh,

1541
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,610
as had been the case,

1542
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:50,570
or in many cases,

1543
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:51,590
the imagine cases,

1544
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,101
uh,

1545
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,390
in previous,

1546
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:53,960
uh,

1547
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,100
revolutions.

1548
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,270
And so,

1549
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:57,104
um,

1550
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,310
the impact of drink itself
can be seen in the origins of,

1551
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,110
of crowd psychology.

1552
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:03,321
I mean,

1553
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:05,540
I've a very primitive of nature,

1554
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,140
uh,

1555
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,790
at,

1556
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,050
you know,

1557
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,940
it Cetera,

1558
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:08,720
et cetera.

1559
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,710
And in the novel,

1560
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:10,431
which you've not read,

1561
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:11,390
they read it in the other,

1562
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,770
the first half of this course,

1563
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,070
but,

1564
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,460
uh,

1565
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,920
he puts the focus,

1566
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:17,210
focuses the novel on a street called,

1567
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:18,170
which I will write on the board.

1568
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,033
It's still there.

1569
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,033
Um,

1570
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,203
the Hulu,

1571
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,300
the La glute

1572
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,633
dog,

1573
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,820
and he picks this,

1574
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,310
the golden kind of taste.

1575
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,180
Uh,

1576
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,890
he picks us because it was a,

1577
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:34,431
it's on the,

1578
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:35,031
it's on the,

1579
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:36,260
it was on the edge of parrots.

1580
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,530
It's near the station of the north,

1581
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,364
the Gal dinner.

1582
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,180
And they had produced wine
there at one time of fine wine.

1583
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,170
That was awful fine,

1584
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,680
you know,

1585
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,990
in quotes that was offered to the king,

1586
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,710
uh,

1587
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,610
once a year.

1588
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,421
But it was a,

1589
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:53,010
it was a street that was very
identified with a very ordinary people,

1590
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,640
uh,

1591
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,250
with workers in the big new industries,

1592
00:35:56,251 --> 00:36:01,200
but also these old artisans and Javez
you start your own laundry and then

1593
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,440
everything just goes wrong.

1594
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,390
It could possibly go wrong in her life
and they all get wasted together and

1595
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:07,920
basically they all die.

1596
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,700
Uh,

1597
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,031
but,

1598
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:09,811
but this was that,

1599
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:14,811
this image of this street was something
that fascinated upper class readers.

1600
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,861
And in fact,

1601
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:20,930
it's only about 15 years ago that during
one of the elections that the Jacka

1602
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:21,764
show huck,

1603
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,830
uh,

1604
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,720
went to that same street,

1605
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:28,710
which is now identified with immigrant
populations and still has the same sort

1606
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,950
of lightening rod effect on the upper
classes and said something like,

1607
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,161
God,

1608
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:33,210
it really smells here.

1609
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:33,840
You know,

1610
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,380
and just,

1611
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,213
it was just,

1612
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,070
it was almost like I'm gonna
Sarcozi referred to the Rock Chi,

1613
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,350
the people in the suburbs as scum,

1614
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,280
uh,

1615
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,551
you know,

1616
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,570
two years ago.

1617
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,830
And so these are still sort of,

1618
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:45,360
these images are very powerful.

1619
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:50,361
And Zola and Zola knew what he was doing
and this was the effect that he wanted

1620
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:51,810
to,

1621
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,291
uh,

1622
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,070
wanted to,

1623
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,500
um,

1624
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,000
uh,

1625
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,720
make.

1626
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,010
And we know what these people drag and
you can follow it if you read the last

1627
00:36:58,011 --> 00:36:58,181
time.

1628
00:36:58,181 --> 00:36:58,381
Wow.

1629
00:36:58,381 --> 00:36:58,650
They said,

1630
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:58,801
you know,

1631
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,910
a great paper topic,

1632
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,380
I'm going to drink almost
everything they could.

1633
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:01,980
Uh,

1634
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,120
but in addition to UB,

1635
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:03,900
Sam,

1636
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,440
uh,

1637
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:04,651
you know,

1638
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:09,651
the regional production of fortified
Eau de vie of both of the [inaudible],

1639
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,770
which are,

1640
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:11,700
which are sweet and Oh,

1641
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:12,030
divvy,

1642
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,863
which is was it,

1643
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,560
which is,

1644
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:13,711
you know,

1645
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:14,341
fairly sweet,

1646
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:16,230
which is an extremely powerful,

1647
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,750
it's like a brandy a,

1648
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,940
if you look at a map of
alcoholism in France today,

1649
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,110
um,

1650
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,620
very the same thing really since
the middle of the 19th century.

1651
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,020
Since you first have statistics
really from the 1870 [inaudible],

1652
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,550
the big regions of alcoholism
are not in wine producing areas.

1653
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,321
Now here again,

1654
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:34,621
you can say,

1655
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,460
the wine producers say,

1656
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:35,731
yeah,

1657
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,560
we have that healthy drink baby.

1658
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,100
You know,

1659
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,460
don't get us confused with these
heavy drinkers in those other places,

1660
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,290
which is complete nonsense as you know.

1661
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,530
But basically the,

1662
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,830
the big alcohol rate is there.

1663
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,641
It's in Paris,

1664
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:47,921
and it's,

1665
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:49,350
it's immediate surrounding.

1666
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,460
It's in the north,

1667
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:51,450
which is a,

1668
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,650
and the Patek la,

1669
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:55,770
because of all the economic
disadvantage in those regions.

1670
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,810
These are not wine producing areas at all.

1671
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,760
And in Brittany,

1672
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,980
above all in Feeney stair,

1673
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,903
which is the,

1674
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:03,061
uh,

1675
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,530
the most western,

1676
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:04,801
uh,

1677
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:05,580
department,

1678
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,030
uh,

1679
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,350
in France,

1680
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,450
and they're not drinking wine there.

1681
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,290
What are they drinking?

1682
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,030
They're drinking a brandy,

1683
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,050
apple brandy,

1684
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:13,410
uh,

1685
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:13,590
in,

1686
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,490
in that case,

1687
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,710
kind of a dose is the name of a day.

1688
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,450
Pop them all in France,

1689
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,351
Calvin dose,

1690
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:23,760
the capitalists call ca n there
by you or by your tapestry.

1691
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,420
Uh,

1692
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,420
and of Dovii got off the
place and all this stuff,

1693
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,080
uh,

1694
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,560
there,

1695
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,490
but kind of a dose,

1696
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:29,880
uh,

1697
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,620
became named after that.

1698
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:32,610
They pop them all.

1699
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,151
Uh,

1700
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,010
and it is basically apple brandy.

1701
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
There's old Calvados,

1702
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,450
which is extremely good and extremely,

1703
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,420
uh,

1704
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,253
uh,

1705
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,790
extremely good and good and very,

1706
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:41,440
very expensive.

1707
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,921
But there's this,

1708
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,990
you're kind of Rotgut Calvados also.

1709
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,740
Uh,

1710
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,160
and,

1711
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,390
but it's not just that,

1712
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,380
it's that particular fruit.

1713
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:47,531
I mean,

1714
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:48,100
there's almost,

1715
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,450
if you think of our sauce,

1716
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,170
um,

1717
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:50,441
you know,

1718
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,190
there you have this pair
drink a called [inaudible],

1719
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,580
which just means pair and French.

1720
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,250
Um,

1721
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,100
and it's,

1722
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,411
it's,

1723
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:58,810
it's Oda v that's made out of pair.

1724
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,330
And you also have OTV that's
made out of raspberries,

1725
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,580
is OTV that's made out of strawberries.

1726
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,680
There's OTV that's made out of prunes.

1727
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,260
Uh,

1728
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,860
there's OTV that's made out
of almost any kind of fruit.

1729
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,540
You can imagine how to Kiwi on,

1730
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,500
on anything.

1731
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,380
And everybody in France still
has the right to produce,

1732
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,540
I guess it's about half a bathtub
full a year of that untaxed uh,

1733
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,250
at,

1734
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:20,970
um,

1735
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:21,311
you know,

1736
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:22,540
I know no expense.

1737
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,051
And,

1738
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:23,440
and,

1739
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,560
and of course now in more refined times,

1740
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:27,371
is that true or not?

1741
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:27,581
I mean,

1742
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:28,001
who knows?

1743
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:29,160
But the idea that the,

1744
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,460
and more about this in a minute,

1745
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:30,821
uh,

1746
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:31,270
that,

1747
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,780
that,

1748
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,141
that,

1749
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:37,040
those kinds of alcohols or what you
would drink after dinner as you know,

1750
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,800
digestives um,

1751
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,221
you know,

1752
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:41,410
but that's not what they were
doing at the time of Zoloft.

1753
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,900
And that's not what they were doing.

1754
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:45,820
And in the 1930s in the 1940s and leave,

1755
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,410
and that's not what they're doing.

1756
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:47,950
Uh,

1757
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:52,240
in the 1960s in 1970s
in all sorts of places.

1758
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,150
Uh,

1759
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,220
you go to,

1760
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:55,054
um,

1761
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:55,541
you know,

1762
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,070
go Sunday morning,

1763
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,930
Sunday morning,

1764
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,411
well,

1765
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:00,280
women were in church,

1766
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:01,210
the men were out getting,

1767
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,190
getting totaled,

1768
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:02,830
uh,

1769
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,611
knocking down the,

1770
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:03,821
the,

1771
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:04,001
the,

1772
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:04,780
this stuff.

1773
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,220
And not all the women went to church,

1774
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:06,530
but,

1775
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,750
but all of this,

1776
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,380
uh,

1777
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:08,980
Eh,

1778
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,221
you know,

1779
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:10,150
it tells you two things.

1780
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:10,331
I mean,

1781
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:11,164
if they're drinking,

1782
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,310
well obviously way,

1783
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:12,430
way,

1784
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,180
way too much,

1785
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,790
but an unbelievable amount of,

1786
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,751
of alcohol,

1787
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,120
which cuts back on life expense,

1788
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,620
CIF,

1789
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,020
uh,

1790
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,890
to be sure,

1791
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,411
uh,

1792
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:23,560
but also that these,

1793
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,431
all of this,

1794
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:28,540
these alcoholics become part of
regional identities in France.

1795
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,470
Uh,

1796
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:29,980
that,

1797
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,550
uh,

1798
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,821
the,

1799
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:31,031
I mean,

1800
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:33,220
champagne is the classic example.

1801
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:33,431
I mean,

1802
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,570
champagne is still,

1803
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,590
uh,

1804
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,190
obviously the fanciest drink that's
ordered for big for big occasions and

1805
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:39,970
Champagne,

1806
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,121
uh,

1807
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,170
is extremely,

1808
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:41,540
uh,

1809
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:41,640
uh,

1810
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,370
expensive.

1811
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,630
There are other equivalents that are less
expensive that are produced in places

1812
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:49,060
like Dee Dee Dee or there's a,

1813
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,511
you know,

1814
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:50,530
they're all over the places,

1815
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,000
uh,

1816
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,310
uh,

1817
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,430
produced in Alsace infor,

1818
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,433
but champagne,

1819
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:53,940
uh,

1820
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,530
hear it,

1821
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:54,790
you know,

1822
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,521
champagne is,

1823
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:57,250
is basically this region here.

1824
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,980
And that becomes not only a part
of the identity of Shump Pinea,

1825
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,120
which is a region,

1826
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,310
but with French national identity.

1827
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,090
Uh,

1828
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,650
and there's a book on that,

1829
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,150
on how that happened,

1830
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,013
how champagne,

1831
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:08,470
uh,

1832
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,303
becomes to be,

1833
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,641
you know,

1834
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:10,421
seen as,

1835
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:11,190
as a,

1836
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,023
um,

1837
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,470
as a drink that you really celebrate for,

1838
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:15,640
for big birthdays.

1839
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,230
We have a friend who just hit 80,

1840
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:17,891
and,

1841
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:18,041
you know,

1842
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,390
we left him before we went.

1843
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:21,880
We left them a bottle of really good
champagne because that's something they

1844
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:22,930
couldn't possibly afford.

1845
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,680
Uh,

1846
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:23,891
Eh,

1847
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:24,410
you know,

1848
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,110
and,

1849
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,010
and the symbolism is,

1850
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,480
is really there,

1851
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,441
but I mean,

1852
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:32,170
Boldo Boldo wines,

1853
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,150
uh,

1854
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,370
profit enormously from,

1855
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,770
I think it's 1855 or [inaudible] 57.

1856
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:37,880
I don't remember where they,

1857
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:38,240
they,

1858
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,110
they classify them according to
the great wines and the course.

1859
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:43,020
Now a bottle of,

1860
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,400
uh,

1861
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,233
a shuttle,

1862
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,950
a pet close or something like that,

1863
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,640
uh,

1864
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,031
which is,

1865
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:47,390
uh,

1866
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,760
the most famous Boldo along
with shut Toby cam would,

1867
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:51,020
would go for a,

1868
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:51,231
you know,

1869
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:51,640
up to a,

1870
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:51,781
you know,

1871
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:52,970
$1,000.

1872
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,450
I mean,

1873
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:53,720
uh,

1874
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:53,931
you know,

1875
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:54,711
it's just incredible.

1876
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:54,891
I mean,

1877
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:55,820
those big kind of,

1878
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,460
uh,

1879
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,350
of a,

1880
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,440
of a bull Dhalla,

1881
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
we took as a presence,

1882
00:41:59,481 --> 00:41:59,751
somebody,

1883
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,820
a Volvo that's now a $500 for,

1884
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:02,001
you know,

1885
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:04,580
the bottle because we bought
it about 15 years ago.

1886
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,533
And these prices,

1887
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:05,781
you know,

1888
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:06,770
they hold their own,

1889
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:08,000
but for all of the corruption,

1890
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,830
for all of the trafficking too,

1891
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:09,981
that,

1892
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:10,161
you know,

1893
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,510
it has gone on in Boldo,

1894
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,200
uh,

1895
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,280
Bergen eats the same thing.

1896
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:13,431
I mean,

1897
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:17,090
how closely the production of Burgundy
wines like vote Norma nae and,

1898
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:17,520
you know,

1899
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,790
Shiva Shamba and,

1900
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,131
and,

1901
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:19,430
uh,

1902
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,641
you know,

1903
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:19,820
the,

1904
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,141
the,

1905
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:20,601
the really,

1906
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:20,751
you know,

1907
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:25,040
the great ones that I've ever could never
possibly afford to taste even like a

1908
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:25,850
rich book.

1909
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,340
I mean how those are identified with,

1910
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:28,730
uh,

1911
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,690
with the region,

1912
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,061
uh,

1913
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:31,940
is still a very important,

1914
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,540
and another drink came along
to this identified with
the region that some of you

1915
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:36,260
may know about.

1916
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,370
And I hope if you're under 21,

1917
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:38,204
you'll never drunk.

1918
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,780
Uh,

1919
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,820
and that is called a care.

1920
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:41,600
Uh,

1921
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,750
K I r and you look at
the cane and you think,

1922
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:46,490
well that's an Alsatian or Breton name.

1923
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:49,700
Cause there aren't words in
French that begin with Kay.

1924
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,500
But actually here was,

1925
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:51,860
um,

1926
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,240
he was the mayor of,

1927
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,140
of digital,

1928
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,011
uh,

1929
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,810
I guess in about the forties or 50s,

1930
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,010
1940s and 50s.

1931
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,530
And he came up the idea of putting
somebody else who had the idea,

1932
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:03,050
but he drank a lot of these things
and putting the sort of black currant,

1933
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:03,860
uh,

1934
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,510
into white wine.

1935
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:10,511
And so then the key becomes part of
the regional identity of a burgundy.

1936
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,240
I remember,

1937
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,900
uh,

1938
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,141
you know,

1939
00:43:12,141 --> 00:43:12,741
I was about your age,

1940
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:14,270
see these great big posters saying,

1941
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:14,541
you know,

1942
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:17,330
have some sort of imagined
br Burgundian person,

1943
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,020
uh,

1944
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,560
proud of being a Burgundian
and he's tossing down a cure.

1945
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,330
But all this fits together to create
this almost the impossibility of doing

1946
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:28,340
anything about the big,

1947
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,293
um,

1948
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,620
a big problem of drinking.

1949
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,450
And when Pyramind is frost,

1950
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,140
who we'll meet later when he
tries to run for president,

1951
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:38,150
he was the greatest
politician who never ha heal.

1952
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,780
Uh,

1953
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,020
you know,

1954
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,381
we've never,

1955
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:40,910
president of France and a great,

1956
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:41,740
great man.

1957
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:41,971
He,

1958
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:42,740
he tried to,

1959
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,041
uh,

1960
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:45,050
start a drink milk campaign,

1961
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,740
uh,

1962
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,480
in 1954 and he was a
toast or French toast,

1963
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:51,260
if you will,

1964
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:51,950
because,

1965
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,060
because they absolutely,

1966
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,660
uh,

1967
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:53,901
you know,

1968
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:54,980
they just destroyed them.

1969
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:56,780
The wine lobby just destroyed them.

1970
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:57,321
They just went,

1971
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:58,970
I asked for him and you could still,

1972
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,320
I remember when he was drunk and,

1973
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:00,950
uh,

1974
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,910
guys would park their big trucks on hills
and not put the brake on and they'd go

1975
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,870
and they'd come back,

1976
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:06,180
uh,

1977
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,440
you know,

1978
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,891
after you know,

1979
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:10,580
about 10 drinks and these things would
crash out of control and kill a bunch of

1980
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,240
people.

1981
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,680
Uh,

1982
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:11,880
uh,

1983
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,321
again,

1984
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:13,550
even 10 years ago,

1985
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,950
they started this campaign
against drinking too much.

1986
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:16,610
Uh,

1987
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,540
I must say now,

1988
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:18,240
the last 10,

1989
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,760
last five or six years,

1990
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:22,910
they really have made it harder because
they have that going on the Swedish way.

1991
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,110
But to have you used to be,

1992
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:24,650
you could,

1993
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,011
you could,

1994
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:26,390
you could have an Aperitif,

1995
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:26,781
uh,

1996
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:29,290
you could have three
glasses of a big bite on,

1997
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,460
but almost a big glass of
wine and maybe a little,

1998
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:32,580
a cal vie afterward.

1999
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,600
And the guy says,

2000
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:33,781
you know,

2001
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:34,680
blow into this,

2002
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:35,160
uh,

2003
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,993
uh,

2004
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,691
this,

2005
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:37,200
uh,

2006
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,801
what do you call those,

2007
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:38,640
those balloons?

2008
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,171
Uh,

2009
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:39,621
and he says,

2010
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:39,841
well,

2011
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:40,260
see Ya,

2012
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:40,530
you know,

2013
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,000
how these,

2014
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,090
how does he put up over him?

2015
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,590
And that's not the case anymore.

2016
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,630
And that's really hurt rural restaurants.

2017
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:45,960
Uh,

2018
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,920
we had a guy in our village,

2019
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:49,670
we had a restaurant in the summer
and he had this little teeny waiter,

2020
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,880
this guy who was tiny,

2021
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:51,810
tiny little guy.

2022
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,430
And at the end of his job,

2023
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:56,880
he had one beer and he went
out on the road and Bam,

2024
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,091
you know,

2025
00:44:57,091 --> 00:44:57,481
he'd go there,

2026
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:59,010
he turned the corner and
there's all these guys,

2027
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:00,960
a big orange jackets and
all these lights and say,

2028
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:01,794
sue famous here.

2029
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,541
Blow on it,

2030
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:04,000
a little balloon and he,

2031
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:04,710
you know,

2032
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,670
he had to pay it,

2033
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:06,151
pay fine.

2034
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:07,740
He couldn't afford it and
he wasn't drunk at all,

2035
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:08,491
but he was very,

2036
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:11,400
very thin guy and it was that
kind of account and went to a,

2037
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,180
why am I telling you straight?

2038
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:12,870
But they're interesting.

2039
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,703
I went to a,

2040
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:14,070
you know,

2041
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:14,270
a,

2042
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,920
a place of people we know a race pretty,

2043
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,251
pretty good.

2044
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:18,810
Why it produced pretty good wine.

2045
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:19,800
So I went there with this guy,

2046
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,130
his friend of mine who
makes me look like a,

2047
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,420
it looks like a dwarf and I mean
you guys about probably about,

2048
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,171
uh,

2049
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:27,000
all 280 or 90 pounds,

2050
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:27,810
a very big guy.

2051
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,790
And he brought his friend from work,

2052
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,640
ironically in a halfway
house for alcoholics.

2053
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,270
Uh,

2054
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,770
and this guy made my friend,

2055
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:35,510
you know,

2056
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,720
looked like a scat back,

2057
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:37,590
looked like his title,

2058
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:37,781
a guy.

2059
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:38,930
And this guy is at least above.

2060
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,400
I'm serious about three
or 50 pounds and you know,

2061
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:42,400
he is as our village,

2062
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:43,470
so I'm not driving anywhere.

2063
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:43,920
Uh,

2064
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,750
we're just going to go home and,

2065
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:45,990
uh,

2066
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,201
you know,

2067
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,430
I can go back to reading my book,

2068
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:47,810
you know.

2069
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:48,180
Uh,

2070
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,013
and uh,

2071
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,270
uh,

2072
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,103
so he,

2073
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:50,910
uh,

2074
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:51,750
this guy he got,

2075
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,201
he,

2076
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:52,680
uh,

2077
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,461
he hits the road,

2078
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:53,820
he lives,

2079
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,910
he lives about an hour and a half
away and he got controlled twice,

2080
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,070
twice to blow the bloom.

2081
00:45:59,220 --> 00:45:59,911
No problem.

2082
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:00,450
See Ya.

2083
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,470
That's because the guy who weighs about
literally about 380 pounds and it's out

2084
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:04,680
of there,

2085
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,120
but they've done a very good thing,

2086
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:06,490
uh,

2087
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,380
in trying to,

2088
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:08,214
uh,

2089
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:08,671
you know,

2090
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:08,850
in,

2091
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,890
in trying to control a drink.

2092
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,940
And the problem is that you see,

2093
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,970
it used to be when you started out as
we leaving the stuff that we're not

2094
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:15,804
leaving this subject.

2095
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:16,450
Um,

2096
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:16,790
uh,

2097
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,580
used to be,

2098
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:17,960
you know,

2099
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,310
when our kids were going up
and Francis the same thing,

2100
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,380
even when they were
two or three years old,

2101
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,281
if you know them,

2102
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,010
you can ask them,

2103
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,080
but you'd put a,

2104
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,100
you go to someone's house and they put
a little symbolic drop and they would

2105
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:29,701
never drink it.

2106
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:31,260
But it's a sense of participation.

2107
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,570
And then when they got to be 12 or 13,

2108
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:35,910
they put a little bit in champagne there
if they wanted to drink and they can

2109
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:36,630
drink it.

2110
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,770
But they grew up with it.

2111
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:38,820
And then,

2112
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,580
and then it wasn't like in high school,

2113
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:41,851
you know,

2114
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:46,590
when we first discovered
that stuff and you know,

2115
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:47,071
then you just,

2116
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:47,520
you know,

2117
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,930
chugging it down and he sees
people staggering around
vomiting their lungs out.

2118
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,420
And part of I really truly think is,

2119
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:59,100
is that because it was so part of the
culture for both good and for bad,

2120
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:00,480
and I emphasize the bad,

2121
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:04,310
but it was a sense of participation
and that's what came to this sort of

2122
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,400
elaboration of meals and
occasions for social ability.

2123
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,860
That's where it becomes
part of the culture.

2124
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,311
I mean,

2125
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:12,600
the whole idea of,

2126
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,140
you know,

2127
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,090
a meal where you,

2128
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,391
uh,

2129
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:16,290
how are we doing here?

2130
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:16,980
We got a,

2131
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,990
we got a role,

2132
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,660
um,

2133
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:18,890
uh,

2134
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,120
a meal where we have to,

2135
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:21,390
uh,

2136
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:21,601
you know,

2137
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:24,330
where you start out with a little
something to drink and then you have white

2138
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:27,720
wine with fish course or with
oysters or something like that.

2139
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:31,360
And you have certain kinds of red wine
with the doc or whatever and then a

2140
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:32,500
little red wine with cheese.

2141
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:33,670
But you can also have white run with,

2142
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:35,680
with goat's cheese and maybe a little,

2143
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,040
you know,

2144
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,000
Devi at the end of it.

2145
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,500
This is something that's recent.

2146
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,960
Most people couldn't ever
afford it eat like that.

2147
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:41,930
They did cost cruet,

2148
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,660
they ate whatever they could.

2149
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:44,260
Uh,

2150
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,640
they couldn't afford to have wine.

2151
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:48,640
But this is something that comes out
of the evolution of restaurant culture.

2152
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:52,450
The first restaurants were created
a really good book by Rebecca Spawn,

2153
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,010
a about the origins of the restaurant.

2154
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:54,730
Um,

2155
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:54,971
we're,

2156
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:57,250
we're creating the 18th century basically.

2157
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:59,380
Cause remember the chef's
worked for the nobles,

2158
00:47:59,560 --> 00:47:59,890
uh,

2159
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,150
and you'd have bullion,

2160
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,350
which is supposed to make
you better if you were six,

2161
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,160
you go to a place to have bullion and
then the chefs are all out of work.

2162
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:08,110
This is a long version,

2163
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,170
short version of a long subject and
they start setting up restaurants.

2164
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,380
But it's really only in the late 19th
century that that the elaboration of meals

2165
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:17,681
and,

2166
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:20,440
and Michelin grading meals and grading,

2167
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:20,980
you know,

2168
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,040
what is a good restaurant
that's first 1900 diminish law.

2169
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,461
They don't,

2170
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:25,390
they're not grading yet.

2171
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:29,350
They're simply saying to people on
the road and Michella makes tire.

2172
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:31,690
So there they're the first
ones to say we have to have,

2173
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:36,220
you have to have signs on roads saying
how far it is to get the yellow zone or

2174
00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:37,000
whatever.

2175
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,420
Um,

2176
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,420
and so this is part of this elaboration
that identify that keeps food and drink

2177
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,560
in,

2178
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:43,960
you know,

2179
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,280
people's assessment of the French and
the French have their assessment of them

2180
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,040
selves and regional identity.

2181
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:55,030
Has Purdue extended disappearing
more about that in a tirade sometime.

2182
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:55,691
Uh,

2183
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:58,210
but not now because we're out of time.

2184
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:02,410
But one can even argue that if rather
mission law with its regional guides and

2185
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:06,580
with the guides to restaurant and grey
mule and the other guides have not kept

2186
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,380
alive in some useful way,

2187
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,180
a sense of what that one is
from one region as opposed
from to another and where

2188
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:17,050
you eat certain things in one region that
you don't find specialties in another.

2189
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,160
And where we all started that you drink
certain kinds of wine in some regions

2190
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,001
and not others.

2191
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:25,090
But above all that you not drink too much.

2192
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,180
I'll pick up that theme again when we
get to the bed they poke cause I might be

2193
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:28,900
able to resist it.
