1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,810
Well today I'm going to talk about
a little bit about Sydney Klezmer,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,240
mostly about socialism. And then Monday
I'm going to talk about anarchism.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,430
Uh,
so in 1864,

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,650
the first international was,
uh,

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,800
created the first international
working man's association,

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,260
a dissolved among a great dad,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,800
a tension in 1876 and also under the
influence of the commune because of the

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:31,410
repression of,
of a working class movements in,

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:35,380
in most places in Europe and also in,
uh,

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,750
the United States.
Um,

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,490
I'd off a ta who had crushed the commune.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,940
As you know,
a boasted in 1877,

13
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:48,480
nobody talks to of socialism
anymore and rightly so.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,870
We are rid of it.
And nonetheless,

15
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:55,890
it is in the late part of the
80s and above all the 1890s,

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,920
the crucial decade that socialist parties
become part of the political scene in,

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,940
in Europe above all in western Europe
because obviously the Mensheviks and

18
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:10,800
Bolsheviks when they are later, uh,
created, uh, are quite illegal in,

19
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,350
uh, uh, in Russia. Uh,

20
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:17,490
and the growth of socialist parties
above all in France, in Germany,

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,320
in Spain and Italy are part of the
development of mass politics, thus,

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,860
uh, closely tied to the emergence of, of,

23
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:29,790
of political associations in which the
socialist parties would be a very good

24
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:34,200
example. And the increased role
of newspapers, party, newspapers,

25
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:37,680
and also, uh, and just in
general, the penny press in,

26
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:42,330
in Paris in the 18 I nineties,
they're 20 daily newspapers,

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
maybe even a couple more than that, which
is phenomenal. I mean, now there's what,

28
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:50,520
there's an Ebay, there's a finger
hole. Uh, and, uh, there was pneumonia.

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,890
I mean, they're, they're
three. And then there's also,

30
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:57,750
I guess the remnants of
Francois, Francois, uh, but
there's just a couple of,

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,550
uh, compared to what they used
to be. Um, and so, you know,

32
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,050
socialists proclaim themselves.

33
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:09,051
Internationalists and one of the great
questions as you see in 1914 as the

34
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:13,470
clouds of war, uh, gather whether
a socialist workers in Germany,

35
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,410
we'll go fight against
socialists workers in France, uh,

36
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,160
and socialists workers in
Vienna. We'll go to fight, uh,

37
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:24,150
the Serbs and the Russians,
et Cetera, et cetera.

38
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,220
Now you can get most of this
out of a chips, our wines,
uh, uh, a book, but just to,

39
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,790
to make, uh, a few, uh, you know,

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,800
fairly important points about
the emergence of socialism
in France and France is

41
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,320
what we are talking about.

42
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,320
And then I'll break away a little
bit to talk about Cindy colorism, um,

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,280
which could be almost
better done on Monday,

44
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:51,470
but then will work because I got too
much to say on Monday. Uh, and then, uh,

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,350
come back to socialism and
talk a little bit about Jones'.

46
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:59,351
Ya has here who a unified
the Socialist Party I n 1905.

47
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,790
Um, so, uh,

48
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,600
basically socialists and France and
other countries are divided between

49
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,160
revolutionary socialists and reform.

50
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:14,380
Socialists and revolutionary
socialists were, uh,

51
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:19,150
were influenced specifically by Karl
Marx. Indeed, Karl Marx, his son,

52
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,560
a guy called Paul Lafargue,
of whom you can forget, uh,

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,310
he introduced marks his writings
in translation I in, uh,

54
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:33,070
in France. And as you know, uh, Mark's,
uh, believe in scientific socialism,

55
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,630
uh, it was scientifically clear to him
that inevitably following the bourgeois

56
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:40,570
revolution, uh, the
workers of the world would,

57
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,900
would a throw off their chains
after having United, uh,

58
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:48,640
and led by class conscious
leaders, uh, seize power. Um,

59
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,780
so in principle,

60
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:54,430
revolutionary socialists did not believe
in elections and nor do they believe

61
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:57,730
in, uh, in reforms. Uh, the,

62
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:01,000
the general attitude of
Revolutionary Socialists, uh,

63
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,130
was that if you encourage workers,
your minors in it, uh, uh,

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,270
in Jimmy now or whatever,
uh,

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,120
to push for reforms or can participate
in the politics, in politics,

66
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:18,040
political life, you're mat, you're just
propping up a, the bourgeois republic. Uh,

67
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,350
if you do that,
and the other hand,

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,530
they get themselves into a bit
of a bind because how do you,

69
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,110
if you want to have a mass
following among workers,

70
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,540
how can you not work for reforms such
as the eight hour day, uh, which was a,

71
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,800
you know, classic kind of, uh, a
demand of, of organized labor. Uh,

72
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:37,360
how can you not participate
in marches on May Day,

73
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:41,450
the first of which was in
1890, uh, in France, uh,

74
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:46,150
in order to put forth,
uh, demands for a reforms.

75
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,890
Uh,
they also were sort of caught in a,

76
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:52,780
in a conundrum because they're arguing
that that following Marxists in theology,

77
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:56,590
that the situation of
workers, uh, was a decreasing,

78
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,350
was getting worse in France. Uh,
but in fact, despite the, the,

79
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:04,120
the long depression, uh,
conditions are getting better, uh,

80
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,080
for most workers, even though the gap
between the wealthy and the poor, uh,

81
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,980
was as always a,
was increasing.

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,440
So they're kind of caught in a bind.
A,

83
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,170
their tactics are to
organize workers, uh, to,

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,740
uh,

85
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,510
make them aware of themselves as a class
a and make them aware of politics and

86
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,380
engage their,

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,560
their revolutionary activity for a
future date when everything would,

88
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,340
would, would, uh, when the revolution
that they, that they expected to come, uh,

89
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:39,910
would, um, we would follow
and remember, I mean,

90
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,250
we live in a time now where
you don't expect revolution
to come when people just,

91
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,270
you a racing down to the town hall. Uh,
or to the prefecture and overthrowing, uh,

92
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,380
uh, the government. Uh, but if you had,

93
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,740
if you grew up in a country in France
in which your grandparents could,

94
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,940
could talk, if you lived in the 1870s, you
could hear grant your grandparents, uh,

95
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,240
talk about stories they'd heard about the
French revolution. Uh, you had had, uh,

96
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,320
depending on how you count them,

97
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,280
a couple of revolutions
during the revolutionary
period, you had a revolution,

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,750
1830,
you had a revolution in 1848.

99
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,280
You had an attempted revolution in 1851
in response to the coup d'etat and above

100
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,740
all, you had the commune. Uh,

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,500
and the commune I weighed
so heavily, uh, uh,

102
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,930
as a way of encouraging a militancy
because for, as I said before,

103
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,270
for for one brief time,

104
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,650
people seem masters of their own fate.
Uh,

105
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,280
and the commune did initiate, uh, uh,
for all of the, the quarrelling, uh,

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,800
over, over, uh, uh, uh,

107
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,100
over politics and over policies
did initiate a meaningful reform.

108
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,980
So this was a while. It was scary
for a, a conservative elites. Uh,

109
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,070
it is energizing for both people who
want to capture control of the state that

110
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:55,060
is revolutionary socialists and
indeed reform socialists, uh,

111
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:56,210
as we'll see in a minute.

112
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:00,830
But there means we're
different and anarchists who
wanted to destroy the state.

113
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,270
So, um, the, you know, the, there's
an amnesty for the Comuna, uh,

114
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,030
in 1879,
uh,

115
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:13,031
and so people who were forced into exile
or forced into hiding a comeback now,

116
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,010
um, besides his Paul of farm, um,
that is the son in law of, um,

117
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,710
if Lafargue is a l a l a f a r g u e
M Marxism was introduced into France.

118
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,410
Bye [inaudible] again, if you're on the
youth side of the week, which is now,

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,420
you know, this is sort of, you know,
super chic and it was a tourist trap, uh,

120
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,500
uh, and has lost most of its charm. I,

121
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,080
there's a plaque right on the corner of
the intersection of the two main streets

122
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,230
of the USL Louie, that, that, that you
could hardly see it. It's up on the,

123
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:49,400
on the second floor, and it says
that you'll get, was born there.

124
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,470
So he was, uh, a Parisian. He
was a born in, in, in 1845.

125
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,950
When they use, Sally was very different.
There weren't all these belts, you know,

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,730
ice cream,
rip offs and things like that.

127
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:01,640
There he was the son of a schoolmaster a,

128
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:05,210
he gave up his intellectual
pursuits because of lack of money.

129
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,920
He worked as a translator in the
prefecture, a of the sand in Paris.

130
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,620
And he became a journalist and like lots
of young smart people in, in his, uh,

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,060
uh, of his day, he read Victor Hugo,

132
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,890
he read Victor Hugo on Paris and he
became interested in, in, uh, uh,

133
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,280
the plight of the poor. Um,
he, uh, became a Republican.

134
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:30,140
He was sentenced to five years
in jail after of the commune. Uh,

135
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,590
he went off to Italy to avoid
a serving time in the slammer.

136
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,960
And uh, there he a read Karl Marx, uh,

137
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,290
in 1877 and he created a paper
that got Iti or equality,

138
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,750
which had a circulation of 5,000.

139
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,230
And you can multiply by about 20 or 25.

140
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:53,180
The numbers of readers per each copy
cause people read newspapers in cafes.

141
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:57,270
So the diffusion of, of newspapers
greater than circulation, uh,

142
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,870
statistics would,
uh,

143
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,540
w w would would lead you to believe
he wanted to capture the trade union

144
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,960
movement, which had revived
after the commune. Again,

145
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:11,961
strikes had been legalized in 1864
and unions are a legal as of 18,

146
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,940
uh, 81. He was a very
successful, clever propagandists,

147
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:22,200
which terrified, uh,
the middle classes. Um,

148
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,150
and he was called the red pope,
uh, by his enemies, both outside,

149
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,060
uh, the, the revolutionary
socialist groups. Uh,

150
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:35,061
and inside he was also called the Red
Jesuit because of his authoritarian,

151
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,170
uh, personality. Uh, he,
uh, was tall, very thin.

152
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,620
He looked starved like middle many
militants at that time because they didn't

153
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:44,640
happen or they didn't have any money.

154
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,880
So they're living from hand
to mouth the whole time. Uh,

155
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,230
somebody described him as is always
looking ill. Uh, an extremely pale,

156
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,130
a fiery I shone from
behind metal frame glasses.

157
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,980
And when he spoke even
about ordinary things,

158
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:03,240
his lips seemed to quiver with rage.
He was a powerful,

159
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,680
ironic speaker. But not, you
know, not a spell. Spellbinder uh,

160
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:12,240
in the way Joe has, whom I'll
discuss in a while, uh, was, um,

161
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,200
and so that's his enemies called them the
red pope or the, or the or, or the red.

162
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,400
A Jesuit.
He helps file fine.

163
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,620
A crate found, uh, the,

164
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,390
the first mass political
party in modern France, uh,

165
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:31,080
which started out of after a different
name, but it becomes known as, as the,

166
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,120
as the path to Uva Francais or,
uh, the, the French Workers' Party,

167
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,720
uh,

168
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,340
which begins with some hesitation by
from get himself to run candidates,

169
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,410
uh, in the elections in
1881. Uh, and they get,

170
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,910
uh, some, uh, some votes, but
he, the goals of creating this,

171
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,130
this party were revolutionary.

172
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,760
They are not reformist or
they are not to capture, uh,

173
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,570
the Chamber of Deputies
through elections and to, uh,

174
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:04,440
to make possible reforms that
are promulgated from, uh,

175
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:09,330
the Pallium were ball or where the Chamber
of Deputies, uh, met, but rather to,

176
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,880
uh,
bring about a revolution.

177
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,300
And his preoccupation with
creating this mass party, uh, uh,

178
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,420
did alienate workers, uh, because, um, uh,

179
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,320
because they want reforms. And, and again,

180
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,810
we're talking about socialist
parties and, and, and you know,

181
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,780
what the socialist parties wanted at this
time or basically what any kind of, uh,

182
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,960
you know, conservative
Democrat would want. In the US,

183
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,460
they're talking about things like, like,
uh, uh, better conditions in the mines.

184
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,840
They're talking about, uh, uh,

185
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,850
the eight hour a day they're talking about
a decent wages and insurance programs

186
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,400
and, and that, uh, a kind of thing.

187
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,530
And one of the interesting things
about the path Uva, this calls the POF,

188
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,830
the property, uh, well, it just, that work
here, they're working the worker's Party,

189
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,230
French workers' Party a is a witch,

190
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,250
which also suggests that
the role of personality and
all of this is they do very

191
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,970
well in specific regions.
Uh, but overall in France,

192
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:08,890
they remain in extremely minority party,
even within the socialist movement,

193
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,100
particularly because of
their unwillingness to engage
in electoral politics and

194
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,460
to be committed to reform.
I,

195
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,740
they believe that elections and
the propaganda of these big,

196
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,970
big posters that are read posters and
purple posters that are still in the

197
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,040
archives,
which are wonderful things to look at.

198
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,010
That these are to be
sources of propaganda,

199
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,320
to make workers think
about their conditions,

200
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:36,070
to realize that their class enemy
can be defeated in, in revolution.

201
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,640
And so the places that the Geddes
do very well are in the north, uh,

202
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,580
where you've got, you know, large,
uh, textile and mining industries,

203
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:50,260
they do very well in a very different
kind of regions, some similar interests,

204
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:54,430
but, but, but our industries, but,
but without the kind of, uh, uh, uh,

205
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,760
Catholic fidelity that, that the remains
in parts of the north, they do well, uh,

206
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,100
down here in, uh, the [inaudible], uh,

207
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:04,360
and then the have and the lea,
uh,

208
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:08,830
in departments like that and their
places in, in, in the south, uh, in,

209
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:13,200
in the whole that is the department
of busy and won't Pta. And,

210
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,890
but in other places like for example,

211
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:17,880
the most where the Socialist
Party was and still is very,

212
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:22,420
very strong and remarkable continuity
or they don't do well at all. Um,

213
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,940
so, uh, again, uh,

214
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,480
is always sort of on the outside
looking in even within the context of,

215
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,690
of, uh, of the socialist movement.

216
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,040
But one of the incredible things about
these guys about get and Bruce and we'll

217
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,260
talk about in a minute in a bubble.

218
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,930
John Sherman as a is there
on the road all the time.

219
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,940
And here's where the
railroads come into play. Uh,

220
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,370
the number of speeches that they
give every year is in the hundreds.

221
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,510
They're constantly going, uh,
uh, showing up, uh, in a town.

222
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,600
I once wrote an article called
Dilla Guy Holla at a conference,

223
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,350
contradict her from the station
to railroad station to the,

224
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,040
to the great debate, uh,
where they'd be dating,

225
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,470
debating people of other
policies and, and, uh, the,
you know, they're there, the,

226
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,430
they do the tour to false, uh,
uh, giving these speeches. Um,

227
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,280
and it's really in the 1880s in the
1890 [inaudible] that you really do have

228
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,760
this sort of apprenticeship of
the republic and the republic,

229
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,360
the apprenticeship of mass politics and
of socialist movements through these,

230
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,410
these debates. And that's what a confit
homes contradict. Wire is in France,

231
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:29,200
or just call it a debate. Uh, um,

232
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,050
a lecture followed by debate and a,
for example,

233
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:36,580
when I was studying a porcelain
workers in Lemoshe a long time ago, uh,

234
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,190
you'd have these guys like
Bruce and, and, and, and, uh,

235
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,150
Joe has and the other show up and
there'd be taken on a tour of, uh, uh,

236
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,710
of Limos and they'd start out at the
worst of, provide more about that later,

237
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:52,130
or the amazing, I'll do poop.
And then he'd go run and
see the, and they'd see the,

238
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,990
the historical, uh, uh, historical
monuments in this that has hit me,

239
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:58,250
happened to me. I mean, I
was there for a long time,

240
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,400
slipping in the railroad
station. Uh, it doesn't have
any money. Yeah. You know, one,

241
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,810
one day out of, uh, uh, one
night out a seven could, I
was so broke then, but I was,

242
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:09,130
you know, invited back and all of this,
this, this, this, this thing to get, uh,

243
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,070
you know, uh, an award I showed
him. He didn't, uh, uh, uh, deserve.

244
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,740
And it was the same thing. It
was exactly the same thing. Uh,

245
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,350
the tour was the same even though
I knew the place for a well.

246
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,840
And we started out having a pair
of tiff, you know, drinks at the,

247
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,320
at the main zone to put that as the
host of the people at about, you know,

248
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:26,930
about 10 30 or 11 in the
morning and, and, and you know,

249
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,020
by the time you make all these
stops, it was a very, very long day.

250
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,910
And the thing went on until
one 30 in the morning,

251
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:34,010
literally to one 30 or two in the morning.

252
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,840
And this is what the way it is now in
this and in the circumstances. Uh, but,

253
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:42,860
but the way then was even as much more
interesting because what people would do

254
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:46,700
is they would go and you have some guy
like GED show up and he gives us talk,

255
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,041
you know,

256
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,760
he's up at the podium and gives us talk
and there are hundreds of people there

257
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,100
and then the other people take them on.
Then you've got,

258
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,380
you've got a reform socialists,
uh,

259
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,650
debating with him and telling him that
he's really flat wrong about this.

260
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,350
You've got an air kiss,
inevitably standing on the outside,

261
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:03,860
passing out leaflets as in 1968.
Uh,

262
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,930
and then you had a social Catholics,
uh,

263
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,160
who were priests that believed that the
only way you could win back workers is

264
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:13,160
to believe in reform. Uh, and,
and they would be putting,

265
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,530
there'd be wearing their
cassocks and things like that,

266
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:19,310
and they'd be making their cases. And
this was the apprenticeship of politics,

267
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,480
you know, for very ordinary people. And
it was really what's great actually.

268
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,330
And I mentioned the same thing happened
before the Co and before the commun

269
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:30,470
between 1868 and, and before
the Franco Prussian war in 1870,

270
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,530
after the law and on associations was a,

271
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:37,580
I'm the people going assembly could
assemble the law of June 18th,

272
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,450
the 1868. So anyway,
people knew who get was,

273
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:46,250
but most socialists didn't,
not a believe in, uh, in again,

274
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,220
um, uh, most of the people who wanted,

275
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,340
who supported yet we're
industrial workers. Uh,

276
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,660
though there are many artisans of course,
and even some small shopkeepers.

277
00:16:56,661 --> 00:17:01,310
And I said before, he does best in the
north and then with a textile workers, uh,

278
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,090
not with a, not with minors now. Um,

279
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,880
uh, he was, uh, you know, it was all
over the place basically. Now, um,

280
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,190
he found a political
rival in the early 1880s,

281
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,200
uh,
who was Paul Bruce.

282
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:23,201
I didn't write Paul on board to be r o
u s s e who started out as an anarchist

283
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:27,560
and who probably coined that chilling
phrase that I'll talk about on Monday,

284
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,510
propaganda by the deed, that
spark, that assassination,

285
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:37,280
that bomb, that would set off the social
revolution. More about that later. But he,

286
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,750
he leaves anarchism and he
becomes, um, he be, he be,

287
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,730
he becomes a reform socialist.
Very similar to an important, uh,

288
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,290
German socialists. Uh, Edward, uh,

289
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,660
a Bernstein who's name you don't have to
remember, but it was very important in,

290
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:55,950
in, in, uh, in, in, in
a reform socialism. Uh,

291
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,100
in Europe, he ends up, uh, in an
asylum at the end of his life. Uh,

292
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,940
he basically leaves politics and he
becomes quite, uh, uh, quite, quite crazy,

293
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,740
not a very clinical term, but
he ends up in a, in a, uh,

294
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,350
an asylum and it has a
very sad end. Uh, and, um,

295
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,500
he objected to GEDs,

296
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,560
authoritarianism in terms of
building a political party.

297
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,110
And he thought that the program of
a Socialist Party should append,

298
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,900
depend upon local circumstances and
should not be merely imported from say,

299
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:35,730
Karl Marx or should be important from
some, uh, uh, some one of the many,

300
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,950
many socialists con congresses,

301
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,870
wrangling debates between factions of
European socialists and all of that.

302
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,760
Now this was kind of an important comment
to make and it really influences the

303
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:52,650
evolution of socialism and communism, not
the, you know, this particular choice.

304
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,490
Uh, but, uh, when even after 1905,

305
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:00,810
when the revolutionary socialist and
the reforms socialist unite under the

306
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:03,960
leadership of John Show has in 1905,

307
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,440
you still have these tensions.
They go right through world war one,

308
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,890
between the Geddes who
believe in a hierarchically
organized political party top

309
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:18,951
down where the leaders make the decisions
and the decisions are passed down and

310
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:22,410
the reforms socialists who didn't
believe in the kind of authoritarian

311
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,670
hierarchical organization of a,
of a political party. I mean,

312
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:31,110
there's tension is still there is you
will get in world war one ends up being

313
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:35,520
minister of, of transportation or Ministry
of Commerce, I can't remember which.

314
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,080
So he joins the sacred union that
comes during the first world war.

315
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,880
But this tension between a way of
organization organizing, uh, uh,

316
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,180
socialist parties is still there
and it will burst forward again, uh,

317
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,170
in 1920 a and the Geddes end up being a,

318
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,870
the future communists, uh, with
again the same organization,

319
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,440
top down organization in
the 1920s and thirties.

320
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,910
So that with the Communist Party,

321
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,120
when the order comes from Moscow to
expel the intellectuals in 1922 and 1923,

322
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,260
they were out of there. Uh, and there's
this tension between, uh, the way that,

323
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:16,440
you know, the, the communist party,
again, democratic centralism, uh,

324
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,430
which is leaping way, way ahead, but, but,

325
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:21,840
but the kind of organization could
be anticipated in the way that,

326
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:24,420
that Gad wanted to. Uh, uh,

327
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,430
and the other revolutionary socialists
believe it was the way to power that

328
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:34,911
tension could not be swept under
the rug by this unification in 1905.

329
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,800
So what did, um, what did Bruce want? Um,

330
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,240
well,

331
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,240
he believed that the deads program wants
everything at once through revolution,

332
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,890
but the result of that strategy,

333
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:55,240
Bruce and his colleagues are
good with that. They got nothing,

334
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,660
zero Ho I, and therefore, uh,

335
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,980
the ideal he wrote should be divided
into overall practical stages.

336
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,820
Our aim should be, as it were, to, uh,

337
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,790
be immediate ties so us to rent,
render them possible.

338
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,200
So reformed socialism was
the politics of the possible,

339
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,460
and they damned,

340
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,490
they're revolutionary socialist rivals
as the impossible lists because nothing

341
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:28,600
would ever come to argue.
Argument went if you just followed them.

342
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,010
And so they differ in several important
ways. That is the possible lists.

343
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:37,510
And those denigrated as the
impossible is, uh, they, uh,

344
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,470
that the, the, the Bruce Bruce's,

345
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:43,270
the reformers said that local conditions
ought to be of paramount importance. Uh,

346
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,610
they wanted a union of all exploited
leader. I mean all exploited workers. Uh,

347
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,660
but that local conditions had to be,
had to be taken into consideration.

348
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,520
That is the goals of miners.

349
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,640
And because veal or in the north are
different than the goals of porcelain

350
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:01,840
workers. Uh, in some cases that you know,
or other workers in, in other sectors, in,

351
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:05,980
in, um, in the industrial
economy. Secondly,

352
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:09,520
they abandoned revolution as
a means of achieving the end.

353
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,200
Although many of their faithful believed
that there one day there would be a

354
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:18,460
revolution, but they are not
espousing revolution because they,

355
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:22,510
at the moment it seemed to be impossible.
The state was so powerful.

356
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,140
It's army so large and when
we're pressing strikes,

357
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,020
so absolutely ruthless.
As in the case of,

358
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:34,021
of the the big wine strike
in a wine workers and wine
owners strike you property

359
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:38,050
owners striking in 1907
or in the motion 1905,

360
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:42,490
where they'd gunned down a
workers throughout us without
the slightest a thought.

361
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,810
And third,

362
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,610
they concentrated on winning local
power because if you were going to do

363
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,820
something for ordinary people,
the way to do it is, you know,

364
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:56,800
you elect Socialists deputies
to the Chamber of Deputies or,

365
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,890
and you elect municipal councils that
you have a majority who are socialists.

366
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,460
Now the constraints on municipal
councils because of the French state,

367
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:11,050
which is still the case, we can go
on and on and on about that. Uh, uh,

368
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,110
it was, uh, quite, uh, quite a daunting,

369
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,060
but nonetheless in places where
they do win municipal power,

370
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:22,780
they are able to take what funds they
have and do things like create nurseries

371
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,070
for working women. Uh, and
you know, they, they can,

372
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,330
they can have give funds,
uh, to the Labor exchanges,

373
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:35,180
which I'll talk about in a
minute or these, you know,
may only to pull up. And the,

374
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,640
the, these sorts of things.
And so, um, in working class,

375
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,770
because it's universal male hoods and my
manhood, suffrage, uh, in working class,

376
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,850
uh, they come to power and there's nothing
that, that the conservative government,

377
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,610
uh, were surely it doesn't want
them in power can do about it.

378
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,460
And after the radicals, you can read about
that, Eh, uh, you know, in 1898 when,

379
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,640
when they, uh, there are
social conservatives or
social moderates, but they're,

380
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,490
and they're very anti clerical. But
when they, when they come to power,

381
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:08,600
they will also often have alliances on
the local level with the Socialists.

382
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,900
Now what this does is it serves to
leave the revolutionary socialist even

383
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:16,010
further behind because they're Fidel,
they're faithful are going to say,

384
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:19,580
of course I'm going to vote
for this socialist candidate
if we win the municipal

385
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:23,150
council. If the, the, the
working class suburbs of,

386
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,240
of x town are able to elect for the
whole town and working class majority is

387
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:30,860
socialists majority,
then we can have,

388
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,910
we can have concrete reforms and the get
really don't have an answer for that.

389
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,460
And they find themselves,
uh, you know, uh,

390
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,880
despite themselves participating
in these elections, which, uh,

391
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,210
and supporting some of the,
uh, of these candidates. Uh,

392
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,220
just two examples of towns, uh, well our
three or four, but the towns that they,

393
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,800
uh, sort of model, uh, uh, cities
that they, that they, that they,

394
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:56,620
that they take over the Moses one where
the socialist mayor as the reformers,

395
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,140
they do all sorts of interesting
things. Oh, bay is another one here.

396
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,880
Big Textile town were again,

397
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,820
part of it's a conurbation of
these two who bay right on the,

398
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:09,890
on the Belgian border. More song was
another one down in the share. I mean,

399
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:13,970
there are all sorts of them. Uh, a, you
know, the examples don't matter. Uh,

400
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,550
but this again is the
politics of the possible.

401
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:18,860
It's the politics of the practical.

402
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,210
And so municipal socialism is
one of those things that, uh, uh,

403
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,510
that it merges from these,
uh, these reform, uh,

404
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,220
a socialist a parties.
Um, and then I mean, uh,

405
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,610
it comes to, uh, this,

406
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:38,730
this is her key moment in 1890 is at 98,

407
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,860
98 or 99. I think it's 99 where, um, uh,

408
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:46,070
the first socialist minister,
uh,

409
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:50,240
is sitting at a cafe in a cabinet
meeting and it's a guy called the,

410
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,250
not Meta home, but me, the hall, uh,

411
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,950
the name you can read in and Sarah
[inaudible] book. Uh, and, and,

412
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,620
and of course the Geddes go wild because
here you have at an a cabinet meeting,

413
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:05,180
you have a socialist minister who is
sitting at the same table with one of the

414
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:10,100
butchers of the commune, uh, with a
former general who's the minister of war.

415
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,110
Uh, and so they said, well, there you
go. If you believe in reformist politics,

416
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:17,690
what you end up doing is you're talking
about propping up your bourgeois

417
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:21,020
republic. You're sitting next to one
of the butchers of the Paris commune.

418
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,830
There is your revolution. So this
increases the tension. But in the end,

419
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,180
the two parties unify a though they
can't cover over these big differences.

420
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,950
In 1905, well, Bruce, in any case,

421
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:38,150
was a most unlikely candidate to
run any kind of of a revolution.

422
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,330
He was a wealthy doctor, um, uh,

423
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,450
and his grandfather had been a wealthy
merchant. And this presumably, you know,

424
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:48,870
for many of many of his constituents
than an oppressor of the people.

425
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,080
And his father was a professor of medicine
who was a related to a bishop in the

426
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,500
Catholic church.

427
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,320
He somehow ended up marrying the daughter
of a Russian prefect of police, uh, and,

428
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:04,170
and, and Francis a relatively small,
you know, country in size. It's, it's,

429
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:05,700
it's about the size of Montana.

430
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:10,240
It's slightly bigger than Montana and much
smaller than Texas. He Knew Gad, uh, uh,

431
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,280
when he had been,

432
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,220
that is Bruce a medical student
at the University of Molten Yay.

433
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,570
Which is the second oldest medical
school after Bellona, uh, in,

434
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,760
in Europe. Um, and, uh, again, he
was a, when he was an anarchist,

435
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:27,150
he was convicted of a press
offense. And so he, he, uh,

436
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,340
he flees to Spain organizing a
small, uh, a socialist, a club.

437
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,250
Now he accepts class
struggle. I mean, again,

438
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:39,490
here is this or middle class guy who is
a leader of a party in which the most,

439
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,580
most of the, the, the,
the, the, the members,

440
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:45,780
both activists and simply people
who are a vote for them. Our, our,

441
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:50,220
our workers. And this tool brings out
another kind of tension. And inevitably,

442
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:53,400
I mean, without making this too
confusing, there's another, oh,

443
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,100
that there's another party,
uh,

444
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,570
that is created by this guy is y'all,

445
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,200
I have mine and I had in mind,

446
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:03,750
and we can just do the deal
with this very briefly.

447
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,950
Sroi why does he simply says,
look, how can you have a, you know,

448
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:10,440
you've got to revolutionary socialist
saying, how can you have a party that's,

449
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:13,680
that's that, that's reformist, this
properly with the bourgeois republic.

450
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,160
And then Joel [inaudible] that he says,
well, look at the Socialist Party.

451
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:19,170
Look at the leaders of
the Socialist Party.

452
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,470
Are they workers from the minds of Camo
or from the minds of Aza or anywhere

453
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:28,610
else? Or they textile workers or middle
electrical workers and uh, you know,

454
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,070
outside of Santa Tien, no, they're
bourgeois. They're comfortable.

455
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:35,970
Doctors like Bruce, uh, or Zanjan. And
as we will come back to in a minute,

456
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:38,580
it was a pull phone.
Filo was a philosophy professor.

457
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,800
And what we need is a working class party
in which, which workers will be, uh,

458
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,340
both the leaders. And the followers.
So they kind of split off.

459
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:49,470
And there are other groups
that split off too, but,

460
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,570
but basically those are the kind
of outlines of all of this now. Um,

461
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,590
just to, um, well by the way,
John and mom was, it was, uh, uh,

462
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,760
a t a type I type a type
pot and typographer and he
claimed that Bruce with an e

463
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,500
w was an opportunist. Uh, and so, uh,

464
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,130
he was more in tune with the
workers. Uh, but it, looking ahead,

465
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:12,570
you can see the same thing again,

466
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:16,200
the expulsion of the intellectuals from
the Communist Party in the early 1920s.

467
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,210
And this kind of suspicion of
fancy, uh, speakers and, and,

468
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,310
and uh,
and wealthy,

469
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,320
liberal or radical do gooders from the
middle classes at a time when people took

470
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:31,950
class differences extremely,
uh, extremely seriously.

471
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,440
And if you looked at the
communist party in the 1920s,

472
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,390
the communist parties leaders are
minors or metallurgical workers.

473
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,710
Uh,
and this was a story,

474
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:44,170
strong tradition to kind of kind of
remon reject these intellectuals.

475
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,180
Many of them became very famous.

476
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,230
Some of them very famous
poets and painters and things
like that is, you know,

477
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:54,160
your bourgeois, we don't watch you. You
have your only class interests in mind,

478
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,560
not the interest of,
of people who work.

479
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:01,090
And so this is a tension that comes out
again, in terms of the future history of,

480
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,330
uh, of the Communist
Party. And you can see,

481
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,360
you can see the sort of transition from
these debates before World War One two,

482
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:13,950
what will come next? Inspired by
the Russian revolution, uh, of the,

483
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:17,530
the second one of October of 1971.

484
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,920
So who are these,
uh,

485
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,610
send dickless and what do they want
it just to complicate things even more

486
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,890
sinned.
Klyce rather like John Out of mine said,

487
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,460
look, we don't want your
basic bourgeois leaders,

488
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,590
but more than this,
uh,

489
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,620
even though one of the main
syndicates was pretty bourgeois,

490
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:43,240
but even more than this, uh, we'd
also don't believe in politics.

491
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,640
The question of how to get from here,

492
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,210
that is the relatively miserable
condition of, of workers,

493
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:53,110
visa vi other people too.
There that is a revolution.

494
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,910
Like the Revolutionary Socialists.

495
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:59,860
They say this does not pass
through political engagement,
that, that, that is, uh,

496
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,930
the in merely a false,
uh,

497
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,830
a revolution and you'll end up propping
up the Bush over republic as with

498
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:09,580
Mueller Hall as, uh, the
minister, uh, in, uh,

499
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,900
in the cabinet of 1899.

500
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,260
So what, what, what do
they want to do? Well,

501
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,910
what they want to do is they
see the shop floor, and again,

502
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:26,100
if you want to think about this
as the mines, uh, they, they,

503
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:31,060
they see this as both the
way to get to revolution and,

504
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,620
uh, they see it as a, as
the future as well. And so,

505
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,390
uh,

506
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:41,390
the radical syndicate lists are very
involved in the strike wave from 1895 to a

507
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:49,240
1907, uh, and so cynical ism, uh,

508
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:54,230
sometimes in, in Spain and in Italy
is called anarcho cynical Chism,

509
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,270
uh, talk maybe a little bit about that
on, on, on a Monday or I probably,

510
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:03,040
I know I want to have time. So this
is here, uh, because of, again,

511
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,990
the decentralized,
uh,

512
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,260
at the decentralized aspect of,
uh,

513
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,450
that is from the shop floor.
Uh,

514
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,640
you build the bricks that are going
to overthrow on a local level.

515
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,380
Capitalism and the state and the kind of
relationships that people have in shop

516
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:24,700
floors, uh, on the shop floor are
going to make possible the revolution.

517
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,580
And they are simply going to, uh, um, uh,

518
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:33,640
the serve to, uh, to, uh,
to shatter a capitalism.

519
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,730
Now, uh, one.

520
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:41,600
And so one of the institutions that they
see as and which still exist in France

521
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,320
are called the [inaudible] to provide,

522
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,660
or the labor exchanges and
a border patrol. Vi was,

523
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,590
was a place where workers who came into
town could go in order to find out if

524
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:55,520
there was any work there to maybe get
a few cents to have something to eat.

525
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,660
They would sponsor dances, they
would sponsor, May Day celebrations.

526
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,700
They sponsored civil baptisms or mocking
the church as ceremonies by having

527
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:09,080
civil baptisms, uh, in, uh,
these, these labor exchanges.

528
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,820
And so they become part of the socialist
vision of how to get from here to there.

529
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:14,451
I mean the cynical,

530
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:19,040
his vision of how to get from here
to there in that they are local, uh,

531
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,880
a local institutions that
bring together unions,

532
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:27,770
which would become members of these
labor exchanges and serve as a offer,

533
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:31,880
militancy, uh, support
during strikes and, uh,

534
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,320
and as her family solidarity
as well. Uh, and um,

535
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:41,410
they are the idea basically of a guy
called Phil Know Pilou ta there and they

536
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,560
wore his, um, uh, his
mark [inaudible] ta, uh,

537
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,570
was himself bourgeois.
Ironically, he was born in 1868.

538
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:58,640
He died in 1901. So he
didn't live very long. Uh,

539
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:02,120
he was a son of a civil servant from
a clerical and legitimate that is

540
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,690
monarchists family educated
in a church school.

541
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,590
He was kicked out of his church school
for writing and anticlerical novel.

542
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,260
He failed his baccalaureate,
his box.

543
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,700
That is that the be exam that
you take after, after the, say,

544
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,480
after high school. And it used to be
only 35% of people pass, then 50%,

545
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:23,950
and now it's up to 85 or something like
that. Captivate, sank or something.

546
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,280
But it's still huge tension. Huge, huge,
huge tension when you take the buck.

547
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:31,600
Amazing. But he failed
the, uh, of the Bach. Uh,

548
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,640
but he'd already contracted that working
class disease that killed miners and

549
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:41,810
porcelain workers and all sorts of
other people. He had contracted TB,

550
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,320
tuberculosis. Uh, he was a journalist,

551
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,380
but he had to drop out of journalism
after 18 months for medical purposes.

552
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,900
Um, he, uh,

553
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:57,980
he emerged from all of this a changed man.
He knew he was dying.

554
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,530
And so when he wrote about the
dying society of capitalism,

555
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,910
he was also obviously
writing about his dying,

556
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,540
his death in this capitalist society.

557
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,510
And I don't know where he contracted
the disease. He did not control,

558
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:17,970
you could contract it and in various
ways, but he'd not contracted, uh, in,

559
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,970
in the mines. So, um,

560
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,480
he believed that only the working
class could regenerate the world.

561
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:27,260
That is not himself as a bourgeois,
but only worker. So here again,

562
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:31,870
he's very much like, like a jump out
of mine, uh, there, uh, and that the,

563
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,500
ultimately what you'd have is a
free association of producers.

564
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,300
They would rather be like an
extension of the shop floor. And, uh,

565
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,380
the divorced, uh, Troy vi, uh, the
Anna, it, the difference between the,

566
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:51,310
between him and the anarchists
with that, he still believed
in, you know, in, in, in,

567
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,160
in class struggle where for the
anarchists that was more, uh,

568
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,140
in which the working class was privileged
or for the anarchist as mostly the

569
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:02,580
poor against the rich. And,
uh, and also, uh, against, uh,

570
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,730
the state. Um, the board survive
created libraries for example,

571
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,680
workers would come in and read.
Uh,

572
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,640
and so one of them differences that it
made if you had a socialist municipality

573
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:16,780
is that the Socialists municipality
would give money to the boards, Troy vi,

574
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:22,140
whereas in, in a reactionary towns
or towns that have dominated by, by,

575
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:27,120
by a radicals or, or opportunists,
uh, in the political sense,

576
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,140
uh, then, uh, they, they wouldn't
give money to, uh, uh, to,

577
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:33,630
of the Boris to survive.
Um,

578
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:38,790
and so those are the cynic lists.
And as far as [inaudible], uh,

579
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,290
so, uh, you know, who was an engineer, uh,

580
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:48,030
his really contribution was to come up
with the idea of the general strike,

581
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,460
the general strike and the general
strike a, he calls it a myth,

582
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,120
a myth, not in the sense
that it doesn't exist, uh,

583
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,230
but a myth in the sense that that
is sort of overwhelming, uh, uh,

584
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:08,070
given of the possible, uh, that
can motivate people to, uh,

585
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,840
uh, to take, uh, a militant
working class action.

586
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,640
And that one day everybody was simply
put down their tools, put down there,

587
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,050
you know, put down, uh,

588
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:24,140
take off their work outfit and shut
capitalism down by simply saying,

589
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:28,930
we're not going to work anymore. And
the whole thing collapse. Is it? Uh,

590
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,680
uh, was it naive? Will obviously it
was naive, but this was so house, uh,

591
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,570
among others, a big
contribution to, um, uh, to,

592
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,050
to, to send a clear and
again, when these strikes, uh,

593
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:47,610
move from factory to factory
in towns likely Moje, uh,

594
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:52,080
in towns like who bay in another
places in Santa Tn, uh, you know,

595
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:54,930
there was a sense among conservatives
as among working people,

596
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:57,690
is this the general strike?
Will everybody, you know,

597
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,660
everybody shut the place down
and workers during strikes,

598
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:04,260
they would go from factory to factory
trying to get other people to go out.

599
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,420
And who knows that the
factory is up the road.

600
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,290
We'll go out and pretty soon Leone the
rumors of Leone going out and then it

601
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:14,090
shuts down and not, and pretty
soon you can bring capitalism, uh,

602
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,170
down with the general strike. It
doesn't really work out that way. Uh,

603
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,860
obviously. Uh, and the,

604
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,720
the what's called the heroic age of
cynicism that is of strikes of strike

605
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:28,620
movements. Uh, uh, it
goes from 1895 to 1907,

606
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,650
and then it sort of, uh, uh, shuts down.

607
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,830
Now how did you know, how did, um,

608
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,680
how did the Socialist Party
become unified in 1905.

609
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,850
And again, all of the tensions
within the Socialist Party do not,

610
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,690
are not eliminated, but the French
Socialist Party becomes a major,

611
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:53,920
major force in, um, in,
in, in French politics.

612
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,430
And that was largely through
the work of the Xiong. Shar has,

613
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,110
who I want to take a few minutes
to discuss now. Now in Germany,

614
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,040
uh,

615
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,040
the spa day or the German
Social Democratic Party is
the largest party in the

616
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,690
Reichstag by 1914,

617
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,500
but it doesn't make any
difference because in 1914,

618
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,480
Germany is still an autocracy
run by this or of mad cap, uh,

619
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,230
a ridiculous, uh,
extraordinarily stupid, uh, uh,

620
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,910
um, don't get me going, but
extraordinarily stupid. Uh, um, uh,

621
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,160
Kaiser.
And um,

622
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,180
but in France it didn't make a difference
because France was a parliamentary

623
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:34,871
regime. It, well,

624
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:37,450
you can't call France had
democracy because women
didn't have the right to vote,

625
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,070
but it's a parliamentary regime.

626
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,080
And Joshua is by his personal
charisma and intellectual energy.

627
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,700
I becomes a unifying force of the
French Socialist Party. And again,

628
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:52,030
in 1981, when Fox wanted me to home
was elected president of France,

629
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:56,920
the first thing he does is a
cameras. Follow them around
the Ponti on. He goes, ah,

630
00:39:56,921 --> 00:40:01,240
and to pay homage to a
Joan Jonas. So, um, uh,

631
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:05,800
what is important is he creates a unified
socialist party out of these various

632
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:09,790
factions and he gives it a, an
employee gives it to it, uh,

633
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:13,480
an impetus and a popularity,
um,

634
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,540
and a wide range, uh, that would carry it.

635
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:21,541
Basically after his death
on the 31st of July,

636
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,170
1914, a carrot into the
19 and twenties and 1930s,

637
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,000
uh, beyond, despite later claims,
he was a bourgeois by birth.

638
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,870
His family had included merchants
and lawyers to admirals and a bishop.

639
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,200
His father was the poorest of the family,

640
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,650
although he had married the
daughter of a, of a, um,

641
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,730
a successful cloth manufacturer.
Uh,

642
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,390
he ends up having failed a business
with a rather small farm of 15 acres,

643
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,540
uh,
in the south of France.

644
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:57,040
And Johannes was born in
1859 in, gosh, Costco is,

645
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,630
is northwest of Toulouse.

646
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,690
It's quite close to Camo that mine and
glass producing town there and the turn,

647
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:06,310
it's beautiful.
It's also got some very nice guy,

648
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:10,650
Yak wines and there would be great
improvement, uh, over over the years. Um,

649
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,470
but it's essentially outside of the glass
works in the mines. It's a very rural,

650
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,670
a department of 50,000
people on the farms.

651
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:21,100
There were 34,000 were
small property owners,

652
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:25,110
12,000 tenants and sharecroppers
and 16,000 day laborers.

653
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:27,700
So it's your basic rural France,
uh,

654
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,510
in the process of being
slowly a depopulated,

655
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,840
he got his education because of a wealthy
uncle who gave him the money and he

656
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,690
went all the first prizes in school
and things like that count in France.

657
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,540
He obtained a scholarship to
Paris. This is rather, again,

658
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:47,600
like a Maximilian Robespierre,
but they were very,

659
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:50,640
very different people who wouldn't
have liked each other at all. Um,

660
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,530
and he gets into the cold, no amount of
superior here, which is one of the goals.

661
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:58,970
They call her the big fancy schools,
uh, in Paris. And he did brilliantly,

662
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,180
he was third behind [inaudible] Saul
famous guy and a forgotten schoolteacher.

663
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,590
He got his degree in Philo in
philosophy to becomes a teacher.

664
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,320
And that would be, that's what you
do when you get your doctorate.

665
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:16,190
Then you go on to be a school teacher
and he's a teacher. And then then if,

666
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,710
you know, now it's harder and harder
and France because there's a few jobs,

667
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:21,050
but then you go on to become,
become a professor.

668
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,760
So he becomes a lecture
and then a professor in
philosophy at the University of

669
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,270
Toulouse, which then, and
now is a very good place. Um,

670
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,470
he developed a reputation for
being a, a great teacher. Uh,

671
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,660
and in the philosophical sense, always
was trying to reconcile idealism with,

672
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,440
with realism. Um, if you've
seen photos of him, uh,

673
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,930
he gave a rather uncertain,
uh, uh, impression.

674
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,770
Someone wants distance is saying that
he looks like a junior secondary school

675
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:53,090
master who'll never get as higher degree
and will never exercise enough or he

676
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,250
looks like a fat merchant
who eats too well.

677
00:42:55,251 --> 00:43:00,230
And too often he's a medium height and
rather square looking. Uh, neither.

678
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:04,550
He's neither ugly nor beautiful,
neither unusual nor common.

679
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,940
He had a nervous tick of the right eyelid.

680
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,050
He looked bright and indeed he was.
And when he started to laugh,

681
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:14,510
when he told jokes,
he was simply shake all the way from,

682
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,970
from the top all the way down.
Uh,

683
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,690
he was at first timid
in religious matters,

684
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,780
but ends up being a anticlerical
do not anti religion in any sense.

685
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,120
He was always embarrassed when the
subject of religion was raised.

686
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,440
He would get out of it by saying,

687
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,510
I assure you it is more
complicated than you think. Um,

688
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,000
he looked like a bourgeois,
uh, on holiday, uh,

689
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,120
in a,
you know,

690
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:44,121
a d app or some place like
daddy looked untidy in elegant.

691
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:47,060
His pockets were always
crammed with, with uh, uh,

692
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:51,230
with papers and indeed with books.
He'd rather big, big pockets.

693
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,700
But anyway, but he was a great orator.
Uh, people who follow those things.

694
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:59,690
We know we don't have films
of, I'm speaking, that would
come later. But really,

695
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:02,420
Leon Trotsky, who was also
just a great orator. I mean,

696
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:06,500
they were conservative to
the most magnificent no
speakers really of their time.

697
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,560
Uh, and there were a lot of good
ones, particularly in Germany, uh,

698
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:14,460
among all sorts of, of, of
political, um, political types. Um,

699
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,040
he, unlike a, uh, one of his friends
Viviani who took lessons at, at the,

700
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:23,150
at the comedy phone says and
practice them. Uh, there used to be,

701
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:25,790
one of my colleagues used to
practice his lectures, uh,

702
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:29,390
in one of the parking lots, and he
looked at himself in the, in the mirror,

703
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:33,240
you know, these rear view
mirrors. And, and I don't know
my father, but anyway, uh,

704
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,240
uh, Zaria is, was, was, um, uh, uh, it
was not like that. He was just a bar.

705
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,740
He was just a brilliant speaker. He
was born being able to speak, um,

706
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,760
and he could take his crowd on,
on,

707
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,790
on dizzying verbal flights.
Uh,

708
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:51,240
and the thing that you do was he could
unite people who Kay would come into a

709
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:55,380
room and have very different ideas.
Thus, the unification in 1905,

710
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,320
just in a personal side, the person
that I know that most reminds me,

711
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,370
those politics are very different with
my old late friend Bart Giamatti who was

712
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:05,370
president of this place long
before you guys were here,

713
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,220
I knew died in 1989 and it
was the same sort of thing.

714
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,800
You would come into a room with Bart
Giamatti and I often didn't agree with him

715
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:14,220
when, uh, about some things, uh, uh,

716
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,700
but almost always did and revered
him and still miss him terribly.

717
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,270
But he could at the end of the,
at the end of talking to them,

718
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,700
everybody would kind of agree,
at least the momentum to,

719
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:26,680
to find conciliation and,
and to,

720
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,810
to agree to this common goal that
they all shared was a fantastic,

721
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,070
fantastic experience. And when I
think of, Joe has, I think a bart and,

722
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:38,910
but your has could do that. And that's
what he did. That's what he did in 1905.

723
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,080
And so he ends up in the Chamber of
Deputies. He represents the tarn. Uh,

724
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,050
the mining bosses get
together to defeat him once,

725
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,210
but then he goes back and he's there.

726
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,770
He's there for always and
then until the 31st of July,

727
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,600
1914. Uh, and when he
spoke, people listened.

728
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,990
And when he spoke in 1905 in
all the years before that,

729
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,700
people listened and the Socialist Party
unified. And when he went on the road,

730
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:09,300
when he go, when he, whether he's in
business song or whether he's in camp air,

731
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,170
people listened and he was on the road
constantly. And he became a voice of,

732
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:19,110
of progress and reform and reason
in a world increasingly gone mad.

733
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,370
And, you know, on the night
of the 31st of July, uh,

734
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:27,510
when he went to write his famous
headline about whether France,

735
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,960
French workers should
follow into the war or not,

736
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,740
it was one of the crucial moments of,
of the 20th century.

737
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,220
And it was certainly his last,
uh, his, his last moments,

738
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:43,320
that's for sure. So he defended
them. Uh, he, he defended the, uh,

739
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:47,640
the workers in the strike.
He became a political dynamo,

740
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:50,520
really of the left respect
and even by his enemies,

741
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:52,790
because of his power and his ability to,

742
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,490
to take the bigger project
that was France, of course,

743
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,040
but was the happiness of humanity.
Uh,

744
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,720
and to see how we can best
arrive at that, uh, uh, that, uh,

745
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,960
that end, the most
admirable character. Anyway,

746
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,640
1905 for all the tensions, the
Socialist Party, uh, itself,

747
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,700
uh, uh, you know, relevant to
are revealed of a revealing the,

748
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:20,910
the mass politics of, of, of,
of the new era of the 1890s.

749
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:25,020
And the first decade of the 20th
century, right after 1914 was, uh,

750
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,100
essentially his work. And Monday,
people who didn't want to,

751
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:34,690
uh, change the state, uh, I want it,
didn't want to capture power in the state,

752
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,600
but wanted to destroy it.
And these include,

753
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:41,020
some of them were interesting people that
I've known, at least working on them.

754
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,550
Have a great weekend.
